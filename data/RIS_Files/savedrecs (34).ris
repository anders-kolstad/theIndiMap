AB  - Sessile aquatic invertebrates are at great risk for temperature stress. Changes in ambient temperature affect metabolic demands, thus altering energy budgets, and often reducing performance or survival of these species. Zebra mussels are highly invasive, yet little is known about their physiology under biologically relevant conditions, especially with regard to cellular parameters. This study examined the effect of temperature on zebra mussel physiology and investigated whether the levels of two cellular markers, HSP70 and AMPK activity, could serve as indicators of chronic thermal stress. Mussels were collected from a site in central Illinois, slowly acclimated to either 10, 20, or 30 degrees C, and held at these temperatures for four weeks. Size, mortality, and the cellular markers were measured. Size and mortality data indicate heat stress at 30 degrees C. Elevation in HSP70 levels confirmed this temperature elicits a stress response. Elevation in AMPK activity was not detected at 30 degrees C, most likely indicating this temperature is beyond the scope for this marker, and therefore at or near the lethal limit. These data suggest this zebra mussel population experiences reduced performance and potential mortality in the field during summer months. Interestingly, cold acclimation resulted in a temporary elevation in AMPK activity, a result that has not been reported previously in ectotherms and is likely attributable to the metabolic demands of thermal acclimation.

AB  - This study tests the hypothesis that the cellular N:P ratio of the cyanobacterium Microcystis remains at its optimum level if the N:P ratio in the external environmental remains at similar levels. To analyze the relationship between cellular and environmental N:P ratio, Microcystis was cultured in media with varying N:P mass ratios (5, 8.75, 13.3, 25 and 40) for 35 days. In all treatments, the cell density of Microcystis increased throughout the first 15 days and remained stable thereafter. The final N:P mass ratios in the culture medium were 1.0, 3.8, 36, 196 and 437, respectively. The ultimate cellular mass N:P ratios (5.1, 7.1, 11.4, 14.2 and 16.7) were reached and stabilized during the final 15 days. The stable cellular mass N:P ratio equaled the N:P ratio in both the initial and final culture medium if the N:P ratio in the initial culture medium was approximately 7 (mass ratio, known as the Redfield ratio). The Redfield ratio can be explained by the physiology of Microcystis under the culture conditions. The study suggests that cellular N:P ratio is a reliable indicator of nutrient limitation for Microcystis. In addition, the cellular N:P ratio of Microcystis occupying Lake Taihu (China) was investigated. The mass ratio always exceeded 7 during the period from July to November, indicating that Microcystis in Lake Taihu is P limited.

AB  - Aquatic insects of the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) are commonly used as indicators of freshwater quality. Recolonization of restored waterways by these pollution intolerant insects is frequently employed to measure the success of stream restoration efforts. Post restoration monitoring programs based on recolonization by EPT indicator species are typically generalized with little consideration for local conditions. Within Philadelphia urban development has resulted in a loss of unimpaired headwater streams that might serve as refugia of EPT colonists to replenish downstream populations through passive drift of larvae and ova. In this urban setting, recolonization may depend largely on overland flight by adults from other systems.
   In an attempt to predict the likelihood of overland dispersal by adult EPT within Philadelphia, PA, USA, a one year field study was conducted at the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education (SCEE) in Northwest Philadelphia to obtain data on local EPT taxa and dispersal behavior. Adult EPT specimens belonging to 15 species were collected using sticky traps extending laterally from Meig's Run, a 1st order tributary to the Schuylkill River. Leuctra ferruginea (Plecoptera: Leuctridae) was selected as the study species.
   A random walk model was developed and calibrated to field observations to predict long distance dispersal probability. An individual-based Levy flight random walk model provided the best fit for field observations from Meig's Run, as well as supporting observations and theory proposed in existing literature.

AB  - The study is engaged in the problems of competitiveness and the performance of the Czech food industry. Both these attributes are evaluated in the framework the domestic manufacturing sector and market, as well as from the point of view of the relations in foreign trade, that means in context with the European and world market. The study applies in the frame of methodology the economic model based on input-output analysis in CZ conditions. In majority of assessed indicators, there were used databases from 2000-2008, i.e. the period before and after the accession to the EU. The outcome of the study is the evaluation of the situation in the macroeconomic environment that influences food sector and the use of input and output in this sector. The SWOT analysis shows, among other, the occasions that could improve the current stagnant or rather decreasing situation of competitiveness of the assessed sector. The study also indicated new directions of the further development in this area. The analysis of the food sector development demonstrated that the sector competitiveness is not in a critical situation. However, the sector competitiveness assessed by the RCA index and foreign trade is not going to be improved. The stagnation has come. As it follows from the SWOT analysis, the reason is that the opportunities of the sector are not fully utilised. Food producers are facing the basic problems in the output sphere mainly in the domestic market. Above all, it is necessary to strengthen marketing with regard to improving the Czech products competitiveness.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has led to dramatic losses in biodiversity over the past several decades. Many studies have shown the effects of intensification on vegetation or soil communities at field or local scales. However, the functional significance of biodiversity may only appear at larger spatial and temporal scales, due to exchanges among local ecosystems throughout a landscape. To examine how patterns of biodiversity loss are reflected at larger spatial scales, plant and soil biodiversity and associated indicators of ecosystem functions were assessed in riparian areas over a 150 km(2) agricultural landscape in the Sacramento Valley of California. Publicly-available GIS data were first used to classify and select sites over the range of soils, topography and plant community types. Representative sites from the landscape were sampled for soil physiochemical properties, as well as microbial, nematode, and plant communities. Higher agricultural intensification, based on field and landscape indices, was negatively correlated with richness and diversity of plant and soil taxa, and was related to indicators of ecosystem functions, such as increased soil nitrate and phosphorus loading, decreased riparian health ratings, and lower soil carbon, soil microbial biomass and soil food web structure. Both field- and landscape-scale factors played important roles in the measured losses. The study area was composed of a wide array of soils, vegetation, and land management, indicating that the observed trends transcended site-specific conditions.

AB  - A macro-invertebrate-based field screening method for assessing the ecological status of rivers in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan Region is presented herein. The method was developed within an EU-funded project called "Development of an Assessment System to Evaluate the Ecological Status of Rivers in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan Region (ASSESS-HKH)". The data originate from five countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. The main instrumental method used was a screening protocol based on the Austrian method for screening the ecological quality of rivers and streams. The conception of the method, its adoption to the conditions in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan Region, and the application of the protocol are described comprehensively. The assessment procedure was based on sensory criteria and biota that can be identified in the field, with a special focus on benthic macro-invertebrates. The basic principles of benthic bio-indicators' assortment are described. The determination of individual bio-indicative values is demonstrated for selected examples. An NMS analysis was performed to describe the intra- and inter-similarities of benthic invertebrate assemblages in streams of different eco-regions. As a result, two different HKH screening protocols are provided: one for rivers in mountainous regions and one for lowland rivers. The performance of the screening method in the region and its validation as a rapid, cost-effective, and scientifically based tool for river quality assessment is discussed.

KW  - SYSTEM
AB  - This study focuses on development and application of a new modeling approach for a comprehensive flood hazard assessment along protected river reaches considering dike failures. The proposed Inundation Hazard Assessment Model (IHAM) represents a hybrid probabilistic-deterministic model. It comprises three models that are coupled in a dynamic way: (1) 1D unsteady hydrodynamic model for river channel and floodplain between dikes; (2) probabilistic dike breach model which determines possible dike breach locations, breach widths and breach outflow discharges; and (3) 2D raster-based inundation model for the dike-protected floodplain areas. Due to the unsteady nature of the 1D and 2D models and runtime coupling, the interdependence between the hydraulic loads on dikes at various locations along the reach is explicitly considered. This ensures a more realistic representation of the fluvial system dynamics under extreme conditions compared to the steady approaches. The probabilistic dike breach model describes dike failures due to three failure mechanisms: overtopping, piping and slope instability caused by seepage flow through the dike core (micro-instability). The 2D storage cell model computes various flood intensity indicators such as water depth, flow velocity, and inundation duration. IHAM is embedded in a Monte Carlo simulation in order to account for the natural variability of the input hydrograph form and the randomness of dike failures. Besides binary (wet/dry) inundation patterns, IHAM generates new probabilistic flood hazard maps for each intensity indicator and the associated uncertainty bounds. Furthermore, the novel probabilistic dike hazard maps indicate the failure probability of dikes for each considered breach mechanism.

AB  - Thirty one Holstein Friesian cows were allocated to two groups. For a period of 7 weeks, twice a week, the behavior of each cow was registered for 9 h (07:00, 09.00, 10.00, 11.00,13:00, 14.00, 15.00, 17.00 and 19:00 h) eating, drinking, ruminating, standing, resting, locomotor and other behaviors were recorded. The frequencies of eating, drinking, ruminating, standing, resting, locomotor and other behaviors for bedding and nonbedding usage groups were 32.9 and 34.6% (p>0.05); 1.7, 2.6% (p<0.01); 20.3 and 20.5% (p>0.05); 20.5 and 28.4% (p<0.01); 14.8 and 7.9% (p<0.01); 8.5 and 4.4% (p<0.01) and 1.7 and 1.5% (p>0.05), respectively. The percentage of the eating behavior of cows of the bedding group at 9:00, 11:00, 13:00 and 17:00 observations were higher than the nonbedding group, while the other results at different observation hours show reverse results. As a result, the amount of time cows spend resting is higher in the bedding group, which is considered to significantly influence their comfort level. Resting behavior is an indicator of animal welfare and as such, this result suggests that bedding usage in loose housing systems provides a more comfortable and socially interactive environment that satisfies conditions of a more positive animal experience.

AB  - Drought is the major factor limiting wheat productivity worldwide. The gene pool of wild emmer wheat, Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, harbours a rich allelic repertoire for morpho-physiological traits conferring drought resistance. The genetic and physiological bases of drought responses were studied here in a tetraploid wheat population of 152 recombinant inbreed lines (RILs), derived from a cross between durum wheat (cv. Langdon) and wild emmer (acc# G18-16), under contrasting water availabilities. Wide genetic variation was found among RILs for all studied traits. A total of 110 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were mapped for 11 traits, with LOD score range of 3.0-35.4. Several QTLs showed environmental specificity, accounting for productivity and related traits under water-limited (20 QTLs) or well-watered conditions (15 QTLs), and in terms of drought susceptibility index (22 QTLs). Major genomic regions controlling productivity and related traits were identified on chromosomes 2B, 4A, 5A and 7B. QTLs for productivity were associated with QTLs for drought-adaptive traits, suggesting the involvement of several strategies in wheat adaptation to drought stress. Fifteen pairs of QTLs for the same trait were mapped to seemingly homoeologous positions, reflecting synteny between the A and B genomes. The identified QTLs may facilitate the use of wild alleles for improvement of drought resistance in elite wheat cultivars.

AB  - Soil infiltration treatment (SIT) was proved to be an effective and low-cost treatment technique for decentralized effluents in the areas without perfect sewage systems. Field-scale experiments were conducted under several conditions to assess organics removals through a shallow soil infiltration treatment (SSIT, with effective depth 0.3 m) of combined wastewater (discharge from toilets, restaurants and a gas station), while bench-scale soil column experiments were performed in laboratory in parallel to investigate biological and abiological effects of this kind of system. From the start-up to the 10th month, the field SSIT trenches experienced the lowest and highest temperatures of the operation period in Shanghai and exhibited effective organics removals after maturation, with the highest removal rate 75.8% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), highest ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm (UV254) decrease by 67.2% and 35.2-100% removals of phenolic and phthalate pollutants. The laboratory results indicated that more organics could be removed in room-temperatured (25 +/- 2 degrees C) SSIT systems under different influent COD concentrations from 45 mg/l to 406 mg/l, and the highest total COD removal rate could reach 94.0%, in which biological effect accounted for 57.7-71.9%. The results showed that temperature and hydraulic loading rate were the most important factors influencing the removals of COD and organic pollutants in SSIT. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bacterial communities are important catalysts in the production of composts. Here, it was analysed whether the diversity of bacteria in finished composts is stable and specific for the production process. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) based on polymerase chain reaction amplified partial 16S rRNA genes was used to profile and analyse bacterial communities found in total DNA extracted from finished composts. Different batches of compost samples stored over a period of 12 years and a 1-year-old vermicompost were compared to each other. According to digital image analysis, clear differences could be detected between the profiles from compost and vermicompost. Differences between three different periods of compost storage and between replicate vermicompost windrows were only minor. A total of 41 different 16S rRNA genes were identified from the SSCP profiles by DNA sequencing, with the vast majority related to yet-uncultivated bacteria. Sequences retrieved from compost mainly belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. In contrast, vermicompost was dominated by bacteria related to uncultured Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Gemmatimonadetes. The differences were underscored with specific gene probes and Southern blot hybridizations. The results confirmed that different substrates and composting processes selected for specific bacterial communities in the finished products. The specificity and consistency of the bacterial communities inhabiting the compost materials suggest that cultivation-independent bacterial community analysis is a potentially useful indicator to characterize the quality of finished composts in regard to production processes and effects of storage conditions.

AB  - We compared seasonal changes in maximum diurnal trunk shrinkage (MDS) with seasonal changes in midday stem water potential (Psi(s)) over three years in plum trees grown in differing drip-irrigated regimes. In well-irrigated trees, day-to-day variations in Psi(s) and MDS were related to evaporative demand. Reference equations were obtained to predict MDS and Psi(s) values for well-irrigated trees as functions of environmental conditions. A decrease in plant water status toward the end of the growing season occurred even in the well-irrigated trees, probably reflecting a reduced volume of soil wetted by the drip irrigation system. Thus, for the prediction of Psi(s), different reference equations are required for the fruit-growth and after-harvest phenological periods. A seasonal change in the relationship between MDS and Psi(s) was observed, which compensated for the decrease in plant water status such that well-irrigated trees had similar MDS values during both the fruit-growth and after-harvest periods.
   The influence of tree size on the relationship between MDS and Psi(s) was also investigated. For tree trunk diameters ranging between 8 and 13 cm, MDS increased 13% for each cm of increase in trunk diameter, as a result of the thicker phloem tissues of the larger trees. This finding may allow extrapolation of Psi(s) predictions based on empirical relationships with MDS to plum trees of different sizes.

AB  - IGF-I is a mitogenic polypeptide that is an important regulator of growth in fish. The potential of IGF-I mRNA abundance as a rapid growth indicator in the Nile tilapia, Orcochromis niloticus, was evaluated. Hepatic IGF-I cDNA was isolated and partially cloned. The partial sequence having 539 bases encodes for the signal peptide, mature protein and a portion of the E domain. The deduced 68 amino acid sequence for mature IGF-I showed 84-90% and 77-79% sequence identity with fish and mammalian Counterparts, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence for domains B and A was most conserved (93-97%) relative to other fishes. A sensitive TaqMan real time qRT-PCR assay for O. niloticus was developed based oil the mature IGF-I peptide for measures of hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels. Hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels were found to be significantly correlated with growth rate of fish reared under different feeding regimes and temperature conditions. Higher feed consumption and water temperature produced faster-growing fish and increased hepatic IGF-I mRNA expression. These findings suggest that hepatic-derived IGF-I plays a key role in controlling growth in O. niloticus and indicates that IGF-I mRNA quantification could prove useful for the rapid assessment of growth rate in this species.

AB  - Weight of evidence (WOE) frameworks for integrating and interpreting multiple lines of evidence are discussed, focusing on sediment quality assessments, and introducing a series of ten papers on WOE. Approaches to WOE include individual lines of evidence (LOE) as well as combined LOE (indices, statistical summarization, logic systems, scoring systems, and best professional judgment [BPJ]). The application of WOE, based on multiple LOE, is discussed relative to the published literature. Fully implementing WOE requires consideration of six main LOE in sediment (or other assessments); these LOE generally correspond to other causality considerations including Koch's Postulates. However, the issue of sediment stability is an additional consideration, and the use of tabular decision matrices is recommended in a logic system to address LOE described by others as "analogy", "plausibility", or "logical and scientific sense." Three examples of logic system WOE determinations based on the Sediment Quality Triad and using tabular decision matrices are provided. Key lessons from these examples include the: generally limited utility of sediment quality value (SQV)-based LOE; need for BPJ; importance of ecological relevance; importance of assessing background conditions; and, need for appropriately customizing study designs to suit site-specific circumstances (rather than application of "boiler-plate" assessments). Overall, more quantitative approaches are needed that better define certainty elements of WOE in an open framework process, i.e., statistical summarization culminating in a logic system incorporating BPJ.

KW  - AGRICULTURE
AB  - The extended concept of soil quality which encompasses the attributes of environmental quality, food safety and quality, and human and animal health, in addition to soil productivity, has been widely accepted in the U.S.A. and abroad. In due course, the indicators of soil quality will need to be properly quantified and weighted according to site-specific conditions. Nevertheless, many scientists now tend to characterize the effects of soil degradative processes and soil conservation practices in terms of the time/rate of change in soil quality. It follows then that soil quality is the linkage or linchpin that bridges the strategies of alternative agriculture and the goals of sustainable agriculture. Thus, soil quality is the real "key" to a more sustainable agriculture. The concept of soil quality and these relationships should provide farmers, researchers, environmentalists, administrators and society as a whole with a better understanding of the challenges ahead, i.e., a) how to increase the productivity of arable/irrigated croplands while maintaining their sustainability and, b) how to increase the agricultural productivity of marginal/drylands without adversely affecting their potential sustainability. These are monumental tasks with problems that will not be resolved by the usual "standardized" research agenda. Rather, it will require new perspectives, innovative thinking, careful planning, and proper organization of both information and people. A vital requisite will be the involvement of scientists, extension agents and farmers working as a team to conduct the necessary research and development, technology transfer, on-farm testing, practical applications and adaptations that will meet these challenges.

AB  - Vegetation composition, soil morphology, and hydrology were characterized along wetland-to-upland gradients at six forested sites in north-central Florida to compare results of Federal wetland delineation methods with 3-5 yr of hydrologic data. Wetland and non-wetland identifications were supported by hydrology data in eight of nine plant communities. Lack of hydric soil indicators and hydrophytic vegetation in two upland communities (scrub and mixed mesic hardwoods) agreed with a deep water table. Six wetland communities (cypress dome, cypress strand, bayhead, cypress/bayhead, red maple/oak swamp. and cedar swamp) with field indicators of wetland hydrology, hydrophytic vegetation and hydric soils were inundated or had water tables at or near the ground surface at least 5% of the growing season in most years. Flatwoods communities, however, occurred at intermediate positions on the moisture gradient and could not be consistently identified as wetland or upland communities. Identification of flatwoods as wetlands depended on wetland delineation method and was not usually supported by hydrologic measurements. In the flatwoods community, soil properties and vegetation composition were correlated with the mean and standard deviation of water-table depths, as well as the depth continuously exceeded by the water table at least 5% of the growing season in most years. Various hydrologic parameters need to be considered in addition to the 5% exceedence level currently used in Federal wetland delineation guidance when characterizing wetland conditions in low-gradient areas such as flatwoods.

AB  - Underground coal gasification (UCG) has a great potential to be accompanied by the technology of (enhanced) coal bed methane ((E)CBM) and carbon capture and storage (CCS), enhancing coal energy efficiency and mitigating climate change. This study aims to assess the environmental impact of three field-scale UCG hypothetical sites targeting deep-buried seams during the UCG operational stage in the combined CBM-UCG application. For this purpose, a risk assessment methodology is developed with consideration of the geomechanical and hydrogeological impact of UCG operations on the overlying strata by analogy to longwall mining operations. A series of numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the effect of variations in the saturation conditions around the UCG reactor, the change of rock permeability, and the UCG reactor operation duration on the propagation of heat, moisture and gaseous chemicals. The results demonstrate that CBM-UCG activities in the three sites are not likely to cause negative impacts on the environment during the UCG process when the behaviour of the reactor and the change of the surrounding strata are in control as expected. This work can provide insights in terms of environmental decision making, regulation and management to prevent reduction in gasification efficiency, to conduct the post-UCG (E)CBM process and to mitigate the UCG gas leakage and contamination of surrounding aquifers, highlighting where additional information is required in CBM-UCG activities.

AB  - Major, trace and rare earth element (REE) geochemistry of the late Cretaceous lower Zhoutian Formation from the Jitai Basin of Southeast China were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis to infer the provenance of the sediments and to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment and palaeoclimate. The wide range of Sr/Cu ratios point to a fluctuating palaeoclimate, and the negative correlation between the FeO/MnO and Al2O3/MgO ratios and the Sr/Cu ratio indicates that the late Cretaceous climate during the lower Zhoutian Formation in the Jitai Basin can be divided into two parts. The lower part experienced two cooling periods, whilst the upper part was dominated by warm-humid climate. Mostly corresponding trends of the B/Ga, Sr/Ba and Sr/Cu ratios show that the salinity changed consistently with the late Cretaceous climate during the lower Zhoutian Formation in the Jitai Basin. During the lower part, the salinity changed from salt water to fresh/brackish water. In the upper part, water was mainly fresh/brackish, and there were many changes from fresh/brackish water to salt water. The relatively stable Ni/Co, V/Cr, V/(V+Ni) and Ce/Ce* data indicate a long period of oxic conditions. The La-Th-Sc, Th-Sc-Zr/10 and La/Th-Hf data of the silt- and sandstones of the lower Zhoutian Formation show that its provenance was mainly a mixture of felsic upper crust sediments and older sedimentary rocks.

AB  - The coral reef ecosystem plays an important role in scientific research and economy. An assessment research on status of the coral reefs was carried out at 6 sites of coastal water from Nghi Son (Thanh Hoa province) to Vung Ro (Khanh Hoa province), Viet Nam between October and December 2015. The research was done using the manta tow method for rapid reef assessment and reef area determination, using reef check for detailed assessment of reef substrate types, etc. 288 species of hard corals under 57 genera and 14 families were identified from the study sites. These species mainly belonged to 4 families, namely Acroporidae, Faviidae, Poritidae and Fungiidae. The research showed the bad condition of the reef at all study sites through such indicators as a low live hard coral cover (average cover of 19.8%), high dead coral cover, recently killed coral, fleshy seaweed, etc. Most of surveyed transects had poor level of hard coral cover, the number of transects having good coral cover was unsignificant. The total reef area of 6 surveyed sites was 809.5 hectares, mainly occupied in Son Tra and Vung Ro. This was the first time coral disease and bleaching widely ranged had been observed and described. However, the reason of this phenomenon has not been mentioned yet and there is a need for more detailed researches on these problems in the coming time to have a basis for protection and management of coral reef ecosystem in Vietnam's coastal water.

AB  - Natural, anthropic and post-depositional formation processes can affect the formation of sediments in rock shelters. Geoarchaeological analyses were carried out on a series of samples of compact and loose sediments provenient from the 1995 to 2005 excavation campaigns at the Atxoste shelter. This work focuses on climate reconstruction of the Upper Ebro Valley, comparing it with results of previous studies of the area and its surroundings, as well as the Cantabrian region. We also point out the problem of sediment conservation when analyzing sites containing Pleistocene/Holocene and/or Mesolithic/Neolithic transition stratigraphies. Thanks to the geoarchaeological study we have differentiated three climatic events: - The end of the Pleistocene as a period characterized by cold, humid conditions and with probable seasonal droughts. - The Pleistocene-Holocene transition that corresponds to a climatic moment in which the indicators of cold climate have practically disappeared. - The beginning of the Holocene, when a significant and rapid climatic improvement takes place, with an increase in temperatures, a decrease in rainfall but maintaining the humidity. The identification of the different post-depositional processes has been key to identifying the state of the recovered archaeological material. Therefore, this study is based on the geoarchaeological analysis, approaching the period central to this paper (Pleistocene-Holocene transition). This is crucial in order to obtain a better understanding of the paleoecology and archaeological aspects.

AB  - This study addresses the performance analysis of a subcritical and supercritical Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) with the addition of a preheater or superheater integrated with a turbofan engine. This analysis will try to explore the heat transfer throughout the evaporator for the purpose of determining the ORC output power and thermal efficiency. A simplified numerical model of the ORC for waste heat recovery is presented. The model depicts the evaporator by using a distributed model, and includes parameters such as the effectiveness, heat capacity and inlet temperature of the waste heat and the organic fluid. For a given set of initial parameter values, the output power and thermal efficiency, as well as the mass flow rate of the working fluid are acquired by solving the system's thermodynamic cycle with the aid of MATLAB software. The model is then verified by using data from an industrial waste heat recovery system. The connection between the turbofan engine and the ORC system was established and evaluated by means of Thrust-Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC) as well as fuel burn. It was found that the supercritical ORC with a preheater and superheater exhibits lower TSFC than the subcritical ORC, whereas the impact of the ORC in terms of waste heat recovery in relation to the environment and sustainability indices is quite small, but still considerable depending on the engine's weight.

AB  - The transport of colloid in saturated porous media is of great significance for the assessment of environmental risk and bioremediation. However, coupled effects of high pH and chemical heterogeneity on colloid retention and release in saturated porous media remain unclear. We studied colloid transports in acid treated/untreated glass beads under various high pH values and ionic strength (IS) conditions to elucidate the effect of high pH and chemical heterogeneity. Chemical impurities promote the colloid to attach to the primary minimum. Increasing environmental pH of solutions would weaken the colloidal retention capacity. Once pH increases to 11, almost no colloid retention occurs no matter chemical impurities exist or not. Adsorbed colloids in the primary minimum can be detached at high pH environments (from 10 to 12). Despite the final similar environmental pH (from 10 to 12), different amounts of colloids are reserved at the ends of the attaching processes and eluting processes. Effects of chemical impurities on colloid retention are negligible when pH = 10 or higher. At the same time, colloid release in high pH solution is also related to disabled chemical impurities. Although previous studies show no obvious rule about colloid release with changing pH (from 6.8-10), our results demonstrate significant coupled effects of high pH and chemical heterogeneity on colloid retention and release in saturated porous media. We also found that straining might be underestimated. Our results improve the understanding about the role of pH in colloid transport processes.

AB  - Purpose: There are several attempts to enhance the capacities of neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) as a probable source of stem cell therapy for neurodegerative diseases. The evidence shows that minocycline has several non-antibacterial effects in neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to investigate the effect of minocycline on proliferation, differentiation and migration of embryonic NS/PCs. Materials and methods: NS/PCs extracted from ganglionic eminence of 13.5-day embryonic mice were cultured according to neurosphere protocol. After second passage they were exposed to different doses of minocycline for 7 days. The number and diameter of neurospheres were assessed to evaluate their proliferation. Migration was estimated based on the distances traveled by the cells. Because of the importance of NS/PCs behaviors in 3-dimentional environment, all assessments were done in 3-dimentional and 2-dimentional cultures. Moreover, the fate of NS/PCs to neuron or glial cells was studied. Results: NS/PCs exposed to 1 mu g/ml and 10 mu g/ml of minocycline and those in untreated group traveled significantly longer distances compared to those treated with 50 mu g/ml and 100 mu g/ml of minocycline. In addition, higher doses of minocycline reduced the NS/PCs proliferation remarkably compared to control condition just in 2-D culture. However, the differentiation capacity of cells was not significantly affected by 1 and 10 mu g/ml of minocycline. Conclusion: The behavior of NS/PCs depends on minocycline dose as well as the characteristics of environment.

AB  - This paper describes an eco-efficiency decision support model for of end-of-life solid waste recycling. A holistic approach in balancing environmental pollution concern and waste recycling is required. A system dynamic model is based on mathematical model of the supply chain, and decision-making analysis is supported with the online spreadsheets. A criterion function-based modelling is used as a core model for simulation that uses net present value-based metrics of the supply chain activities. The economic and recovery effects of processing are determined. The system model combines technology process model, operational model, and macro and micro economic model, to locate all production-related technical requirements, effects, risks, and associated costs. The supply chain assessment based on criterion function assures a better technological foresight of environmental impact and preserved quality. The eco-efficiency indicators were developed. These indicators are used to evaluate the performance of the whole recycling system. The combination of technology and economic parameters dynamic modelling offers several advantages over existing modelling methodologies: they consider multiple products/process matrixes driven by the available inputs, and can respond to rapidly changing conditions in technology and economics. Theoretical framework on these aspects is provided in this paper, followed by a description of the dynamic modelling framework. An example case involving online simulation tool is presented to demonstrate the type of analyses possible using of the model developed in this study.

AB  - Remote sensing is a suitable candidate for monitoring rapid changes in Polar regions, offering high-resolution spectral, spatial and radiometric data. This paper focuses on the spectral properties of dominant plant species acquired during the first week of August 2015. Twenty-eight plots were selected, which could easily be identified in the field as well as on RapidEye satellite imagery. Spectral measurements of individual species were acquired, and heavy metal contamination stress factors were measured contemporaneously. As a result, a unique spectral library of dominant plant species, heavy metal concentrations and damage ratios were achieved with an indication that species-specific changes due to environmental conditions can best be differentiated in the 1401-2400 nm spectral region. Two key arctic tundra species, Cassiope tetragona and Dryas octopetala, exhibited significant differences in this spectral region that were linked to a changing health status. Relationships between field and satellite measurements were comparable, e.g., the Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RENDVI) showed a strong and significant relationship (R-2 = 0.82; p = 0.036) for the species Dryas octopetala. Cadmium and Lead were below detection levels while manganese, copper and zinc acquired near Longyearbyen were at concentrations comparable to other places in Svalbard. There were high levels of nickel near Longyearbyen (0.014 mg/g), while it was low (0.004 mg/g) elsewhere.

AB  - The aim of this study was to elucidate the inactivation effects on the antibiotic-resistance gene (vanA) of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) using chlorination, a disinfection method widely used in various water treatment facilities. Suspensions of VRE were prepared by adding VRE to phosphate-buffered saline, or the sterilized secondary effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. The inactivation experiments were carried out at several chlorine concentrations and stirring time. Enterococci concentration and presence of vanA were determined. The enterococci concentration decreased as chlorine concentrations and stirring times increased, with more than 7.0 log reduction occurring under the following conditions: 40 min stirring at 0.5 mg Cl-2/L, 20 min stirring at 1.0 mg Cl-2/L, and 3 min stirring at 3.0 mg Cl-2/L. In the inactivation experiment using VRE suspended in secondary effluent, the culturable enterococci required much higher chlorine concentration and longer treatment time for complete disinfection than the cases of suspension of VRE. However, vanA was detected in all chlorinated suspensions of VRE, even in samples where no enterococcal colonies were present on the medium agar plate. The chlorine disinfection was not able to destroy antibiotic-resistance genes, though it can inactivate and decrease bacterial counts of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB). Therefore, it was suggested that remaining ARB and/or antibiotic-resistance gene in inactivated bacterial cells after chlorine disinfection tank could be discharged into water environments.

AB  - The article considers the problem of increasing the satisfaction of employees of organizations of the Moscow region by the implementation of the youth cadre policy. An analysis of the nature of the impact of external and internal factors on the formation and development of youth personnel policy was considered through the satisfaction of employees of organizations in the Moscow region. As the indicators of satisfaction, the activities of the organization's leadership on the improvement of the youth cadre policy in the management system were chosen; Improvement of methods for implementing the youth cadre policy; Staff development, professional development of specialists; Improvement of corporate youth programs, etc. The methodological base of the research was made by such empirical methods as observation, questioning using questionnaires placed on the Google Forms online service, comparison. The analysis, the method of mathematical statistics and the SPSS Statistics software package were also used in a complex manner. 23. The study found that only 1% of respondents fully satisfied with the youth personnel policy. Dissatisfaction among respondents is mostly caused by the methods of implementing the youth personnel policy (29.3%), staff development, professional development of specialists (29 %%), improvement of corporate youth programs (24.1%) and material and technical base of the organization (29%). Prevents significant changes in the position of the employees themselves organizations. Only 2.5% actively oppose the leadership, participating in activities to uphold their rights to implement the youth policy. In these conditions, it is necessary to strengthen social control over the activities of management.

AB  - Two experimental trials were carried out in order to test the effectiveness of different environmental enrichments in improving the welfare of weaned pigs. A total of 120 undocked piglets was used. In trial one, group Cl received a metal chain and group WL a wooden log mounted on a frame. In trial two, the enrichments proposed were a hanging chain (group C2), an edible block (group ED) and a wooden briquette (group WB) mounted on a frame. The effectiveness of the enrichments was assessed in terms of animal behaviour, cortisol from bristles, hematologic and hematic profiles, cutaneous (skin and tail) lesions. Growth parameters were also recorded. Although some differences were detected in growth parameters in trial 1 (with Cl group having better productive outcomes than WL group) and some minor differences were observed in animal behaviour in both trials, the overall welfare status did not differ among the experimental groups. On the other hand, no welfare issues emerged in groups Cl and C2, receiving the enrichment device which is generally believed to be scarcely attractive, i.e. the hanging chain. We can therefore conclude that, if no managerial errors are made (floor space availability, feed inadequacy, group stability, microclimate, illumination), under the tested experimental conditions, hanging chains can provide a sufficient environmental enrichment for undocked piglets, even when compared to more attractive enrichments (e.g. an edible block).

AB  - Rapid urban growth and urbanization in recent decades have caused changes in the structure of human habitations such as social and economic changes that would further clarify the importance of sustainable development and urban sustainability. Urban sustainability should create a balance between different aspects of economic, environmental, and social development. Therefore, this study aimed to determine various aspects of unsustainability in Iranian middle-large cities in order to provide strategies to improve the indicators and to achieve sustainability by finding the causes of failure to develop these indicators. Accordingly, first, urban sustainability indicators in four social, economic, physical and environmental aspects were presented. Then, the process of changing was determined through the study of these indicators in Sanandaj during two different periods; and indicators such as jobs, green urban economics, housing, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), social participation, culture, public services and facilities, transportation, leisure, and medical care and health services were specified as unsustainability indicators in Sanandaj and other similar cities. Then, the following strategies are provided to improve urban sustainability in order to analyze the reasons for the decline or stagnation of these indicators: (1) strategies to revise the urban planning system in Iran; (2) strategies to improve the city's economy; and (3) strategies to improve the condition and status of poor people. The declining trend of unsustainability indicators could be reversed by applying these strategies. Furthermore, with the promotion of indicators, sustainable cities could be achievable.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the health care services provided for older adults by primary health care centers (PHCCs) in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), and the ease of use of these centers by older adults.
   Methods: Between October 2013 and January 2014, we conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study of 15 randomly selected PHCCs in Riyadh City, KSA. The evaluation focused on basic indicators of clinical services offered and factors indicative of the ease of use of the centers by older adults. Evaluations were based upon the age-friendly PHCCs toolkit of the World Health Organization.
   Results: Coverage of basic health assessments (such as blood pressure, diabetes, and blood cholesterol) was generally good. However, fewer than half of the PHCCs offered annual comprehensive screening for the common age-related conditions. There was no screening for cancer. Counseling on improving lifestyle was provided by most centers. However, there was no standard protocol for counseling. Coverage of common vaccinations was poor. The layout of most PHCCs and their signage were good, except for lack of Braille signage. There may be issues of access of older adults to PHCCs through lack of public transport, limited parking opportunities, the presence of steps, ramps, and internal stairs, and the lack of handrails.
   Conclusions: Clinical services and the internal environment of PHCCs can be improved. The data will be useful for health-policy makers to improve PHCCs to be more age-friendly.

AB  - The red clay and red weathering crust are widely distributed in southern China. To study the possible relationship between soil color and paleoclimatic environment, three color parameters, lightness (L*), redness (a*) and yellowness (b*), of twelve Quaternary Red Clay (QRC) profiles in southern China were measured using a colorimeter. Colors of the QRC profiles vary vertically: a* and b* generally increase downward and L* decreases downwards. Colors of the QRC also show spatial variation: a* and b* generally increase towards the equator; whereas L* increases away from it. Both a* and b* are positively significantly correlated with clay (<2 mu m) content, free Fe (Fe-d), Fe-d/Fe-t ratios and other soil weathering indices of the QRC (p < 0.05), and the correlations between a* and the weathering indices are much stronger than those between b* and the indices. a* mainly reflects hematite content in soils. Compared with magnetic susceptibility (chi), a* of the QRC is a more promising paleoclimatic indicator, although it is sometimes disturbed by uneven parent materials and dissolution of hematite by water logging. The upward decrease of a* of the QRC profiles reflects a cooling and drying paleoclimate since the end of the Last Interglacial, and the spatial variation of a* coincides with more optimum hydrothermal conditions in lower-latitude areas of southern China.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to introduce a new model for the evaluation of development potentials of regions, including methodology, application and conceptualization of the obtained information. The main components of this model are the business environment quality, innovation potential of companies and use of human resources, interpreted using relevant factors or indicators. The model has been applied to the evaluation of Czech regions - 205 administrative districts (microregional level) and 14 NUTS 3 regions (mesoregional level). Information capacity of the model has been proved by the confirmation of the hypotheses assuming strong relationships among business environment quality and regional GDP and population size of regions. A synthesis allowed us to define the main regularities, evaluate the competitive positions of regions and create the spatial model of the economic development of the Czech Republic. Special attention has been given to the unique method for the identification of territorial systems of poles and axes of development and further to the hierarchy of integration processes (using the profile interaction method). Subsequently, we conceptualized the results from the perspective of regional policy creation using the method of development scenarios. This allows for a flexible optimization of the main priorities and tools of a regional policy (regions are defined and territorially specified by means of flexible sets of relevant measures). From a theoretical perspective, we extend the knowledge about the processes of polarization and integration as key manifestations of the principles of developmental and hierarchical differentiation of society in the conditions of increasing globalisation.

AB  - Deadwood-associated species are increasingly targeted in forest biodiversity conservation. In order to improve structural biodiversity indicators and sustainable management guidelines, we need to elucidate ecological and anthropogenic drivers of saproxylic diversity. Herein we aim to disentangle the effects of local habitat attributes which presumably drive saproxylic beetle communities in temperate lowland deciduous forests. We collected data on saproxylic beetles in 104 oak and 49 beech stands in seven French lowland forests and used deadwood, microhabitat and stand features (large trees, openness) as predictor variables to describe local forest conditions. Deadwood diversity and stand openness were consistent key habitat features for species richness and composition in deciduous forests. Large downed deadwood volume was a significant predictor of beetle species richness in oak forests only. In addition, the density of cavity- and fungus-bearing trees had weak but significant effects. We recommend that forest managers favor the local diversification of deadwood types, especially the number of combinations of deadwood positions and tree species, the retention of large downed deadwood and microhabitat-bearing trees in order to maximize the saproxylic beetle diversity at the stand scale in deciduous forests. To improve our understanding of deadwood-biodiversity relationships, further research should be based on targeted surveys on species-microhabitat relationships and should investigate the role of landscape-scale deadwood resources and of historical gaps in continuity of key features availability at the local scale.

AB  - Background: Alvinella pompejana is an annelid worm that inhabits deep-sea hydrothermal vent sites in the Pacific Ocean. Living at a depth of approximately 2500 meters, these worms experience extreme environmental conditions, including high temperature and pressure as well as high levels of sulfide and heavy metals. A. pompejana is one of the most thermotolerant metazoans, making this animal a subject of great interest for studies of eukaryotic thermoadaptation.
   Results: In order to complement existing EST resources we performed deep sequencing of the A. pompejana transcriptome. We identified several thousand novel protein-coding transcripts, nearly doubling the sequence data for this annelid. We then performed an extensive survey of previously established prokaryotic thermoadaptation measures to search for global signals of thermoadaptation in A. pompejana in comparison with mesophilic eukaryotes. In an orthologous set of 457 proteins, we found that the best indicator of thermoadaptation was the difference in frequency of charged versus polar residues (CvP-bias), which was highest in A. pompejana. CvP-bias robustly distinguished prokaryotic thermophiles from prokaryotic mesophiles, as well as the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum from mesophilic eukaryotes. Experimental values for thermophilic proteins supported higher CvP-bias as a measure of thermal stability when compared to their mesophilic orthologs. Proteome-wide mean CvP-bias also correlated with the body temperatures of homeothermic birds and mammals.
   Conclusions: Our work extends the transcriptome resources for A. pompejana and identifies the CvP-bias as a robust and widely applicable measure of eukaryotic thermoadaptation.

AB  - Stored metallurgy and mining wastes contain relatively high amounts of potentially toxic elements. To monitor the distribution of contaminants originating from dumps, the chemical and physical properties of the wastes must be characterised. In this study, the chemical properties of wastes deposited in two different locations in Southern Poland (Szklary and Zloty Stok) were evaluated. Heaps located in Zloty Stok contain wastes from gold mineralisation comprising arsenic while wastes in Szklary originate from a factory that produced an iron-nickel alloy. In Szklary the total concentrations of Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, Tl, Ag, Cd and Pb were determined, while in Zloty Stok also As is an important contaminant. To assess the risk of contamination of the surrounding environment and to select the proper method for removing the contaminants, information on the distribution of elements between operationally defined phases must be obtained. For this purpose, a six-step sequential extraction was used. The mobility of most elements in the wastes from Szklary and Zloty Stok was relatively low; however, the large amount of As, 40-180 mg L-1, that could be released to environment in case of Zloty Stok was high. The results of fractionation studies indicated that Ag, Cd, Tl, Co, Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn and Mn may be released into environment under low pH and low redox potential conditions, which can be induced by bacterial activity.

AB  - Various lines of evidence indicate that astrocytes can undergo morphological changes that modify their relationship to adjacent neurons in response to physiological stimulation such as dehydration. Supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of hypothalamus represent obvious examples of activity-dependent neuro-astrocytic plasticity. In the present study, Meriones shawi is used as an animal model. Moreover, GFAP and vasopressin expressions are used as indicators successively of astrocytes and neuronal activations. In order to evaluate the reversibility of the neuro-astrocytic plasticity in SON and PVN, prolonged episode of water deprivation followed by episode of rehydration were examined. Hence, we studied the immunoreactivity in various hydration states: water ad libitum, dehydration, and rehydration of animals. Our results showed that dehydration of Meriones induced a significant decrease of GFAP immunoreactivity accompanied by a significant increase of AVP immunoreactivity, the latter concerns both cell bodies and fibers in the same hypothalamic nuclei SON and PVN. Conversely, rehydration of animals shows a reversible phenomenon leading a return of vasopressin and GFAP immunoreactivities to the control level. These results show that both astrocytes and vasopressin neurons display a remarkable structural and physiological plasticity, allowing to M. shawi, a great ability to support the hostile conditions in dry environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to ascertain the effect of the N form (NO3-, NH4+ and organic N) and N concentration on plant isotopic fractionation and on the contribution of the different N sources to the plant N budget, in order to evaluate the feasibility of using plant delta N-15 values for discriminating between conventional and organic crops. To this end, different N concentrations (applied as NO3-), N forms (NO3- versus NH4+), and increasing NO3- applications to an organic N-based fertilization regime were studied.
   RESULTS: When using NO3- as N source, intra-plant fractionation was significant and tended to increase when NO3- concentration increased in the root medium. However, negligible net isotopic fractionation was observed when comparing theoretical and measured plant delta N-15 values. On the other hand, when plants are fertilized with a mixture of NO3- and NH4+, differences in uptake patterns for both salts could result in variation in plant delta N-15 regarding to the expected value. Finally, the application of NO3- to plants was detected when it was combined with high levels of organic N sources, from 99:1 organic : inorganic N ratio.
   CONCLUSION: Under certain conditions and following some considerations concerning sampling, delta N-15 values can be considered to be a potential tool to guarantee the authenticity of organic products. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Paleocommunity research efforts have explored a multitude of faunal assemblages using a wide range of sampling and analytical methods to infer a paleoecological signal. Here, we derive six secondary datasets from a single stratigraphic series of faunal assemblages in the Finis Shale (Pennsylvanian) of Jacksboro, Texas, USA, using a variety of data categorization decisions (i.e., abundance versus calcified biomass, all taxa versus selected indicator taxa, and generic versus higher clade resolution). Biomass- and abundance-derived datasets were not significantly different in terms of evenness, Shannon's information index, or Simpson's diversity index. Using Bray-Curtis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations, with Sorenson and relative Sorenson distance measures, ordination axis scores of the six derived datasets were all significantly correlated with one another, suggesting little difference in their respective paleoecological signals. Three potential explanations for this consistent paleoecological signal, regardless of which data categorizations are employed, include: (1) the dominance of a few brachiopod taxa overwhelmingly influenced the community structure, (2) relatively constrained environmental conditions limited community variation, and (3) low variation in specimen size minimized potential differences among abundance and calcified biomass categorizations. We suggest that other datasets with greater diversities, greater evenness, or from a wider range of paleoenvironments might not show this consistency. Thus, to the degree possible and appropriate, paleoecological investigators should test the effects of these data categorization decisions on a paleoecological signal, regardless of the analytical method employed.

AB  - Beef tenderness is a very complex and multifactorial sensorial meat quality trait, which depends partly on muscle characteristics. This tissue is very variable according to animal type (age, breed and sex) and rearing conditions. Consequently, beef tenderness exhibits a great variability. Different research programs have revealed several genes or proteins which could be good markers of beef tenderness. In order to validate the relation of these markers with beef tenderness on a large population of bovines, it is necessary to have a large-scale and trusty technique which can access different quantities of proteins related to tenderness. In this study we firstly compared Western-Blot and Dot-Blot. Secondly, we evaluated Dot-Blot technical and biological capabilities for the quantification of protein biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the Dot-Blot technique with fluorescence detection presents numerous interests. This technique allows a good reproducibility and permits the simultaneous analysis of a large number of samples. The Dot-Blot technique defined and validated in this study can be used for protein biomarkers analyses, notably to predict beef tenderness. Another major result of this study is that about 5 to 10 animals per group are required to detect large differences (> 1.5) in biomarker expression between tender and tough beef, whereas much larger numbers of animals (10 to 30) are required to detect smaller differences (about 1.2 to 1.3) taking into account the biological variability of these markers.

AB  - Biomineralized structures are often used as indicators of environmental conditions in which they have grown. This study investigates the distribution of two trace elements, Mg and Na, commonly used in these environmental proxies, in the eggshells of seven different avian species to investigate the behavior of these elements in a mineralized system produced in a constant temperature environment where salinity is also strictly controlled. We used electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) in conjunction with electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) to examine the eggshell structure to establish possible relationships between the crystallographic structures and the trace element distribution within each specimen as well as between species. A universal trend between species can be established for crystallographic structure and trace element distribution with some exceptions. Mg and Na vary across the eggshell profile in a carbonate system produced in a constant temperature environment, with links to crystallography remaining ambiguous. The reasons for variability in trace element distribution in such systems may therefore be more closely related to variation in organic distribution than merely environmental and physical crystallographic factors. The crystallographic data show the nucleation of small crystals on the mammillary caps with "fanning" of orientation until fusion of the mammillary caps to create large single crystals in the palisade layer with the elongation along the c-axis in the [0001] direction. The Mg and Na concentrations both decrease after nucleation but vary in their distribution and concentration between species after the nucleation stage of the shell.

AB  - Photosystem II (PSII) electron transfer (ET) in the chlorophyll d-containing cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina (A. marina) was studied by time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy at room temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence, and low-temperature optical spectroscopy. To maximize the ability to measure PSII ET in the intact cells of this organism, growth conditions were optimized to provide the highest specific 02 activity and the instrumental parameters for the EPR measurements of tyrosine Z (Y-Z) reduction were adjusted to give the best signal-to-noise over spectral resolution. Analysis of the Y-Z. reduction kinetics revealed that ET to the oxygen-evolving complex on the donor side of PSII in A. marina is indistinguishable from that in higher plants and other cyanobacteria. Likewise, the charge recombination kinetics between the first plastoquinone acceptor Q(A) and the donor side of PSII monitored by the chlorophyll fluorescence decay on the seconds time scale are not significantly different between A. marina and non-chlorophyll d organisms, while low-temperature optical absorption spectroscopy identified the primary electron acceptor in A. marina as pheophytin a. The results indicate that, if the PSII primary electron donor in A. marina is made up of chlorophyll d instead of chlorophyll a, then there must be very different interactions with the protein environment to account for the ET properties, which are similar to higher plants and other cyanobacteria. Nevertheless, the water oxidation mechanism in A. marina is kinetically unaltered.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that female ornaments in birds not only are genetic correlates of selection on males but may also have evolved by selection acting directly on females. However, most evidence comes from studies in captivity and it is therefore still debated whether male choice is important under natural conditions. The rock sparrow, Petronia petronia, is a monomorphic passerine in which both sexes show a yellow breast patch, although females have a smaller patch than males. Breast patch in females is positively correlated with body mass and fecundity (number of broods per year). We tested whether males preferentially mate with more ornamented females in this species. We examined male mate choice by reducing the size of the yellow breast patch of free-ranging females during the pair formation period in a colony in southeast Spain. We found that females with an experimentally reduced breast patch were courted less intensely and chased less frequently, than control females were. Furthermore, females with an experimentally reduced ornament were less likely to mate and, when mated, did so at a significantly later date than controls. These results are supported by correlational observations from another rock sparrow population, for which a larger data set was available, showing that pairs mated assortatively with respect to breast patch size. Altogether; these results therefore suggest that female ornamentation may be sexually selected in this species. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Potential damage to wetlands by land-use practices has prompted a need for relatively inexpensive, reliable indicators in monitoring ecological conditions. In this study, soil classification and the following soil tests, sodium bicarbonate-extractable P, nitrate (NO3-), organic matter (OM), pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and Cs-137 distribution, were used to compare four wetlands surrounded by cultivated land or grassland. Cumulic A horizons greater than 60-cm thick were found covering the wet meadow zone of the wetland surrounded by cultivated land. No cumulic A horizons were observed in wet meadow zones adjacent to grassland. Laboratory analyses of surface (0-15 cm) soil showed that the wetland surrounded by cultivated land had P concentrations 2.5 to 6 times higher in the wet meadow and shallow marsh zones than did the other wetlands. In the wetland surrounded by cultivated land, the dominant soil separate in the wet meadow was silt, while sand was the dominant soil separate in the wet meadow zone in the other three wetlands. Phosphorus, OM, and NO3- concentrations in wet meadow subsoils (15-60 cm) were higher in the wetland surrounded by cultivated land than in the wetlands surrounded by grasslands. Cesium-137 activities were about 3 to 6 times greater in surface (0-15 cm) soils collected from upland grassy slopes compared to cultivated slopes. Soil morphology, Cs-137, P and OM data indicate higher sedimentation and fertilization rates in wetlands next to cultivated fields.

AB  - In a changing world programming learning is becoming more and more essential in education. And, there are many programming environments and teaching approaches that address the learning needs of students in CS education. A single programming tool or a method do not fit all students. Research has focused on gender differences and there is high interest in increasing female participation. Games and especially game-design tend to impact perceived usefulness of programming environments. Moreover, personality traits like cognitive style and emotional intelligence (EQ) seem to correlate with technology and achievement in programming. In this study, the effects of three different programming environments were investigated, in high school settings, by creating games and taking into account gender and personality characteristics. Three groups were formed, group A created games with Scratch, group B used App Inventor and made games for mobile devices, while group C created interactive stories-games with Alice 3D. This study was seeking to find possible biases based on gender, learning perception, usage and students' personalities between the three experimental conditions. One hundred and sixty three students aged 14-15 years old participated in the study, and data were collected through pre activity and post activity questionnaires. Results show different gender preferences for the three programming tools and, in some cases, different personalities (cognitive styles and EQ) have different learning preferences. Moreover, all programming environments had different emotional effects on the students. The study concludes with guidelines for programming learning environments that respect individual learning preferences and aim to maximize learning effectiveness.

AB  - The fraction transformation from stable to mobile forms in sediments is continuous, slow, and spontaneous chain reactions causing static risks to the aquatic system. However, this process may change into abrupt, rapid, and dynamic paths when certain physicochemical conditions changed. Using the Delayed Geochemical Hazard (DGH) model, comprehensive methods combing both static and dynamic risk assessment were therefore conducted to evaluate the aforementioned processes. By applying these methods, arsenic (As) pollution in surface sediments of the Baiyangdian Lake (BYD Lake) was investigated thoroughly as a case study area. The results showed that the total As concentrations in those sediment samples ranged from 4.87 to 17.94 mg/kg, with an average of 8.75 mg/kg. In a fraction, Fe and Mn were observed to pose effects on the surface-adsorbed (AsS) and residual fractions (AsR) with the coefficient analysis. The static risk assessment showed that both the contamination and ecological risk are at a low level in the total content but a low to moderate risk in the fraction. The dynamic risk assessment posted the potential transformation paths of As in the sediments, indicating a trend of potential DGH burst in 45.24%-78.57% of the BYD Lake.

AB  - The levels of toxic heavy metals (Al, Cd, Pb), macroelements (Ca, K, Mg, Na) and microelements and trace elements (B, Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sr, V, Zn) were determined in 54 muscle samples from three species of fish for human consumption, Balistes capriscus (grey triggerfish), Canthidermis sufflamen (oceanic triggerfish) and Heteropriacanthus fulgens (rock catalufa), using spectrometry of inductively coupled plasma optical emission (ICP-OES). The aims of this study is to determine if the three species are good bioindicators of environmental pollution and to verify whether they are suitable for human consumption. Significant differences were found in the levels of Al, B, Fe, K, Mn, Mo, Na and Zn between the three species studied. The results suggest that the underwater volcano off El Hierro influences the metallic content (Al, K the most characteristic) of H. fulgens. An evaluation of the toxic risk derived from the ingestion of B. capriscus, C. sufflamen and H. fulgens was carried out, analyzing the Admissible Daily Intake (ADI) and the Safety Margin (MoS). For the nutritional study, the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) index was used. Therefore, once the study has been carried out and under the conditions established in terms of daily / weekly fish consumption, proposed by AESAN, there would not be any type of toxic risk after ingesting B. capriscus, C. sufflamen and H. cruentatus.

AB  - This communication briefly presents the results of a longitudinal study conducted for 3 years on a group of electricians working at power lines (at height and on ground) and in power stations to detect possible signs and symptoms of a reversible physical and mental health, of a reduced ability to work, of occurrence of risky behaviors in the activity, which highlight the existence of a possible risk of early wear of the personnel, in relation to the activity carried out and the specific work related risks. Based on a multidimensional, multifactorial ergonomically approach of the problems, the study aimed to: (a) determine a system of exposure indicators and biological response to the action of the identified risks / risk factors; (b) establish a procedure for long-term monitoring of the physical and psychophysiological capacities and health of personnel; (c) establish measures to reduce risk factors for the health and safety of personnel, to preserve health and working capacity during working life. In its development, the study aimed to evaluate some indicators of the physical, psychophysiological and mental capacities of the personnel, capacities involved in carrying out work tasks in specific working conditions; the study also aimed to evaluate neuropsychic effort and analysis of physical and mental health. The study emphasized the occupational risk factors which can contribute, together with the extra-occupational and individual factors, to the etiological-pathogenesis of the investigated personnel' possible illnesses and the necessary measures in the OSH organization policy.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of the influences of nature and production factors relating to the chemical-mineralogical composition of products that formed at the stages of mining and processing apatite-nepheline ores in the Khibiny Mountain Massif. It is shown that all main production processes are connected to the formation of dump waste products that are subject to further changes under the influence of exogenous factors, which include conditions of outdoor storage in dumps and sludge accumulators. According to the dead tails (stale tails) of apatite production, the characteristic changes in the chemical-mineralogical composition and grain-size distribution are determined and have a significant effect on the indicators of their mineral processing. The experimental study of dead tails includes processing a set of technological operations, and their flowsheets are also determined. These flowsheets provide a nepheline concentrate of the required composition with indicators no worse than when processing the tailings of the current composition. It is shown that the existing flowsheets for apatite or nepheline concentrate processing lead to the accumulation of significant amounts of mulls associated with the separation of less valuable components of raw materials into the dump waste products, including calcium and silica. The experimental work also demonstrates the conversion process of gypsum wastes produced during the production of phosphoric acid and shows the importance of additional hydrochemical treatment of belite mull to achieve an economically justified ratio of the main and by-products in the processing of aluminosilicate raw materials.

AB  - The paper presents the results of the petrographic and organic geochemical studies of a jet sample recovered from a Mid-Triassic carbonate succession from the West Balkan tectonic zone in Bulgaria. Total organic carbon contents (TOC =92 % daf) and high vitrinite reflectance (Ro=1.9 %) indicate semi-anthracite coalification rank. Very high T-max (577 degrees C) and low HI (similar to 10 mg HC/g TOC) further support the overmature organic matter. Extractable organic matter is characterized by high portions of NSO compounds and asphaltenes (>75 %). Hydrocarbons constitute about 20 % and are characterized by the predominance of the saturated hydrocarbons over the aromatics. n-Alkanes distribution, dominated by short-chain compounds (n-C17-18), is consistent with the woody origin of the jet and the thermal maturity of the organic matter. The predominance of PAHs with condensed structure over their alkylated isomers is considered to be a result of the complex reaction occurring within the organic matrix during the catagenesis, rather than to the presence of combustion-derived organic matter. Based on the distribution of the diterpenoids, a tentative identification of a possible Voltziales conifer family source is identified. Low Pr/Ph ratio (0.88) and aryl isoprenoids outline anoxic conditions of jet formation, whereas the presence of organic sulfur compounds and tri-MTTchroman suggest marine depositional environment with normal salinity.

AB  - Tree cavities, and especially cavities made by woodpeckers, are important microhabitats in forest ecosystems. However, the properties of woodpecker nest trees and cavities are poorly known even in boreal areas where most tree cavities are made by woodpeckers. We studied the nest tree characteristics of the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos minor) in a 170-km(2) forest-dominated area in southern Finland during 1987-2018. The data included 97 nest trees with 106 nest cavities in five deciduous tree species. During the study period, more than one nest cavity (2-3) was excavated in 7% of all cavity trees. Nests were found in three forest types, but the proportions of nest tree species differed between them. Birch (Betula spp.) was the most common nest tree species with 40% of nests. Nest trees were either dead (79%) or decaying (21%), and the majority (69%) had a broken top. The mean diameter at breast height (DBH) of a nest tree was 24.7 cm and the mean height of a cavity hole was 3.3 m; size and height were significantly positively correlated. The mean ratio of cavity height in relation to the respective nest tree height was 0.49, and did not depend on the nest tree condition. The results highlight the importance of dead and decaying deciduous trees as nest cavity sites for this small woodpecker species. Provision of suitable cavity trees during forest management is important to maintain breeding and cavity building opportunities for the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker in managed forests.

AB  - Green infrastructure, such as green roofs, is increasingly being used to reduce 'heat stresses' associated with urban heat island effects. This article discusses strategies to identify vulnerable neighborhoods in the City of Chicago, where green roofs could achieve multiple goals to mitigate urban heat-related challenges. Numerical simulations were performed using the urbanized version of the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model to predict rooftop temperatures, a representative variable for exposure in this study. The model was dynamically coupled with a physically-based green rooftop algorithm as a part of the urban parameterization within the model. Our approach integrates information from multiple sources: social vulnerability indices (a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity), high-resolution temperature simulations over the urban area, and observed electricity (air conditioning) consumption data. The social vulnerability indicators were used to develop a quantitative heat vulnerability index for Chicago. We found that an analysis of multiple drivers is needed to identify neighborhoods that will likely benefit from mitigation strategies like green roofs. Our case study identified a large number of census tracts in south and west Chicago, along with isolated tracts throughout the city that would strongly benefit from green roof implementation. The tools and methodology from this study can be easily adopted for other urban regions and would be informative for stakeholders and managers, in general, in making adaptation strategies for extreme heat management.

AB  - The lower Eocene McAbee fossil beds (similar to 53 Ma), in south-central British Columbia, Canada, represent a lacustrine sequence deposited during a time of pervasive regional volcanism. Previous studies on fossil assemblages at the McAbee fossil beds consist of amalgamated collections of plants from several disjunct and stratigraphically unconstrained exposures and horizons, with limited knowledge of the spatio-temporal variation in depositional and taphonomic setting. This study presents a high-resolution lithostratigraphic analysis of the McAbee main site to provide stratigraphic, paleoenvironmental, and taphonomic context to fossil collections. A lithostratigraphic framework was developed for the McAbee main site by correlating tuff marker beds. The sequence was divided into eight lithostratigraphic units on the basis of systematic lithologic trends, a result of varying degrees of volcanic influences. An absence of shallow water indicators, bioturbation, and evidence for fluvio-deltaic influence, and the nonrestricted presence of highly abundant and diverse well-preserved plant fossils indicates a deep water, yet relatively near shore facies, suggesting steep sided lake margins. This taphonomic regime imparts minimal transport- and degradation-induced biases in fossil plant assemblages and suggests plant fossils represent local vegetation growing near the point of deposition. The new lithostratigraphic framework coupled with a refined understanding of depositional setting and taphonomic regime demonstrates the opportunity to document conditions of forest ecology within a dynamic volcanic environment over millennial and multi-millennial time scales.

AB  - Color patterns, such as bars or dots that cover the body surface of animals are generally thought to play roles in signaling and camouflage. In birds, however, the macroscopic aspects of plumage coloration are less well understood, as past studies typically described plumage colorations by using spectrophotometric analyses. To provide insight into the evolution of plumage patterns as sexual signals, we characterized interspecific and intersexual variations in the plumage patterns of estrildid finches and tested their associations with other courtship signals and life-history traits using a comparative phylogenetic approach. Our results support the idea that plumage patterns in estrildids are favored by sexual selection because large-sized conspicuous plumage patterns are possessed by species with an elaborate courtship dance. These plumage patterns may also play roles in social signaling because patterns are more conspicuous in species with intraspecific brood parasitism. We predict that pattern traits can be favored by mate choice or intrasexual competition when they can serve as honest indicators of individual condition. As our results are consistent between the sexes, we suggest that the same selective force is acting on the evolution of plumage patterns in males and females in parallel. Finally, we also found a trade-off between large size and vivid color patterns, suggesting that too conspicuous patterns are costly, presumably because of the risk of catching the eyes of potential predators. Therefore, plumage patterns are also shaped by natural selection.

AB  - We used small field plot experiments to evaluate alleviation of water stress damage with four soil or plant amendments. The experiment was conducted in two places during the 2012 growing season with sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) as the crop. The water stress treatments were no stress (S0), moderate stress (S-1) and severe stress (S-2) as main factors. Two soil amendments were control (none), zeolite (4.5 t h(-1)) and a super absorbent hydrogel (100 kg h(-1)). Two plant amendments were applied as foliar sprays, with three levels: control (none), calcium silicate (4 mmol l(-1)), and the triazol hexaconazole (12 mg l(-1)). The results showed the experimental treatments had significant effect on Biological yield, seed yield, oil percent, oil yield, 1000 seed weight, seed per plant, irrigation water productivity, economic water productivity rate in base of seed oil and economic water productivity rate in base of seed oil. 58% oil yield reduction was caused by water deficit stress in severe stress without amendments. The hydrogel and calcium silicate reduced this damage to 19%. Zeolite in all conditions increased the percent yield of oil. The application of both zeolite and hexaconazole resulted in the greatest improvement in irrigation water productivity. Severe water deficit stress reduced irrigation water productivity, economic water productivity rate, and economic water productivity rate in yield of seed oil by 31%, 32% and 24% in comparison with control respectively. Measured indicators showed yield and water use efficiency improvements when use in combination.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing research interests in differentiating the relative importance of climate factors and human activities in impacting vegetation dynamics. In this study, based on residual trend method, we used MOD13A3 (MODIS vegetation index product), MCD12Q1 (MODIS land cover product) and meteorological datasets to differentiate the relative importance of climate factors and human activities in impacting vegetation dynamics during 2000-2015 in the Otindag Sandy Land, northern China. Results show that during the study period (2000-2015), the overall vegetation condition had improved in the Otindag Sandy Land. The driving forces of vegetation dynamics differed spatially in the whole study area over the study period. The area with vegetation degradation solely resulted from human activities accounted for 8.23% of the study area, while the area with vegetation degradation resulted from others (including climate factors and combination of climate factors and human activities) occupied 1.53%. The area with vegetation recovery benefitted from human activities occurred over 26.02% of the study area; the area benefitted from climate factors accounted for 23.69%; and the area benefitted from both climate factors and human activities occupied 37.74%. All in all, impacts of climate factors and human activities on vegetation dynamics varied at the county/city/banner scales and locality-specific measures should be adopted to protect the environments.

AB  - The Ecological Risk Assessment of pesticides and other potentially toxic chemicals is generally based on toxicity data obtained from single-species laboratory experiments. In the field, however, contaminant effects are ubiquitously co-occurring with ecological interactions such as species competition and predation, which might influence the sensitivity of the individuals exposed to toxicants. The present experimental study investigated how intra- and interspecific competition influence the response of sensitive aquatic organisms to a pesticide. For this, the effects of the fungicide carbendazim were assessed on the mortality and growth of the snail Bithynia tentaculata and the crustacean Gammarus pulex under different levels of intraspecific and interspecific competition for a food resource. Interspecific competition was created by adding individuals of Radix peregra and Asellus aquaticus, respectively. The interaction of competition and carbendazim exposure significantly influenced B. tentaculata growth, however, combined effects on survival and immobility were considered transient and were less easily demonstrated. Positive influence of competition on G. pulex survival was observed under low-medium carbendazim concentrations and under medium-high density pressures, being partly related to cannibalistic and predation compensatory mechanisms, enhanced under food limiting conditions. This study shows that intra- and interspecific competition pressure may influence the response of sensitive aquatic organisms in a more complex way (positive, non-significant and negative effects were observed) than just increasing the sensitivity of the studied species, as has generally been hypothesized.

AB  - Riverine export accounts for a large portion of estuarine and coastal nutrients and could lead to severe eutrophication. However, nitrogen (N) sources at the catchment scale remain unclear because of spatial and temporal variations. The stable isotope of N-15, which has been proven to be effective in deducing sources and testing biogeochemical behaviours, is applied in this study to explore multiple sources of riverine N and their nutrient concentrations in the northern section of Jiulong River catchment seasonally. Results show that drastic seasonal variation in external nitrate sources occurs in the river; manure and sewage dominate during base flows, whereas organic N in soil and atmospheric deposition dominate during storm flows. The external sources change throughout the year depending on the environmental conditions. Furthermore, riverine nitrate import in the northern Jiulong River is dominated by an external process because of the increasing NO3- - delta N-15 value accompanied by an increasing NO3- - N concentration (p <0.05). Manure and sewage show an increasing proportion of contribution to the downstream section and proximity to the estuary with high NO3- - delta N-15 values. The findings in this study highlight the fact that the isotopic composition of riverine NO3- - N provides effective evidence for identifying nitrate sources in catchments. The study could serve as a critical reference for nutrient management and eutrophication reversal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems implemented in office buildings under heterogeneous urban settings in the United States, including combined and separated storm sewer systems, will result in varying environmental and economic costs and benefits across multiple water sectors. The potable water saving and stormwater abatement potentials were found to strongly correlate with the local annual precipitation totals and patterns, specifically the long-period antecedent dry weather period. Given the current water rates and stormwater fees in large U.S. cities, RWH systems implemented in office buildings may not be cost-effective compared to the municipal supplies over their lifetime, except in Seattle, which has the highest stormwater fees in the country ($77.50/1000 sf impervious surface/month). The minimum net life cycle costs range from -$1.60 (Seattle) to $11.9 (Phoenix) per m(3) of rainwater yield, resulting in a potential economic gain of over $520 (Seattle) to a net loss of $800 (Phoenix) per building annually. By preventing the rooftop runoff from entering the wastewater treatment plant, between 3 and 9 kg N eq per year could be reduced in combined sewer systems depending on local conditions. This N reduction comes at the expense 0.7-4.6 kg CO2 eq per m(3) rainwater yield. In separate sewer systems, eutrophication reduction benefits result from reducing N loading associated with stormwater runoff. The overall sustainability of implementing RWH depends on the site-specific functional, economic, and environmental benefits, impacts, and trade-offs.

AB  - The researchers investigated psychological health (i.e., levels of depression, anxiety, experiences of discrimination, and self mastery) in a Filipino American sample. Filipino Americans experience health disparities (Nadal, 2011) as they underutilize counseling services when they may have high rates of psychiatric disorders (e.g., Gong, Gage, & Tacata, 2003), and have high risk in terms of cardiovascular disease (Ye, Rust, Baltrus, & Daniels, 2009). Filipino American Women (FAW) specifically, have high rates of metabolic syndrome (MetS) prevalence (Ancheta, Battie, Tuason, & Ancheta, 2012), and diabetes mellitus (e.g., Araneta, Wingard, & Barrett-Connor, 2002). Using the biopsychosocial model, this study aimed to identify which biological risk indicators differentiate FAW's psychological health, and to investigate which best predict their psychological health. In this cross-sectional study of FAW (N = 377), demographic information, clinical measurements (e.g., hemoglobin A1C, serum glucose, blood pressure) and responses to 5 questionnaires were obtained. Results show that controlling for age, FAW with MetS and those without MetS did not report differences in depressive symptomatology, anxiety, experiences of discrimination, and self-mastery. Other biological risk conditions, such as obesity, waist circumference, high blood pressure, and family history of heart disease did not differentiate FAW's psychological health. Multiple regression analyses revealed that lower income and level of education are significant predictors of depression and anxiety, and higher income and education are significant predictors of self-mastery, more than any biological health variable. Findings highlight the interconnection between biological, demographic, and psychological variables in a minority population.

AB  - The microbial structure and activity of biofilm are two important parameters for the successful operation and control of fixed film processes in wastewater treatment. However, the constant interaction between fixed and suspended biomass requires the parallel investigation of these two biological components. The aim of the present article is to study the key microbiological and enzymological parameters of biofilm and suspended biomass from an anaerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor for dairy wastewater treatment. The effectiveness of organic matter (measured as COD) removal and nitrates removal was determined. The microbial structure of biofilm and suspended biomass was investigated by the quantity of anaerobic heterotrophs, anaerobic spore-forming microorganisms and denitrifying bacteria. The total dehydrogenase activity and the nitrate reductase activity were used as indicators for biomass activity. The obtained data showed that the enzyme activity of the fixed biomass was higher in comparison with that of the suspended biomass. This result is related to the more heterogenic media of the inert carrier and more dynamic conditions in the biofilm inner layers. The total dehydrogenase activity of the fixed biomass was four times higher and the nitrate reductase activity of the fixed biomass was two times higher than that of the suspended biomass during stable biofilm functioning. The investigated biological system mineralized the organic matter with high effectiveness (to 90 %) and removed 67 % of the nitrates from dairy wastewater as a result of the controlled water treatment process.

AB  - Aims Levels and sources of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in an ephemeral Florida river were assessed under different rainfall/flow patterns to explore the effects of rainfall on water quality. Methods and Results Quantitative PCR for sewage markers [human-associated Bacteroides HF183 and human polyomaviruses (HPyVs)] and PCR for ruminant faecal markers were used to explore contamination sources. Escherichia coli, faecal coliform and enterococci levels consistently exceeded recreational water quality criteria, and sediment FIB levels were about 100-fold higher compared with water. HPyVs detections cooccurred with HF183, which was frequently detected near septic systems. Ruminant markers were detected only in livestock-grazing areas. Significantly greater faecal coliform and E. coli concentrations were observed under no-flow conditions and the levels of faecal coliforms in water column and sediments were negatively correlated with duration since last rain event. Conclusions Septic systems and cattle grazing in this watershed contributed to the formation of FIB reservoirs in sediments, which were persistent following prolonged rainfall. Significance and Impact of the Study Ephemeral water bodies that flow only under the direct influence of recent rainfall are rarely studied. FIB levels in the New River in Florida were greater during dry weather than wet weather, which contrasts with most observations and may be attributed to bacterial reservoirs formed in still pool, sediments and water-saturated soils in this subtropical environment.

AB  - Fly ash (FA) is predominantly generated from coal-fired power plants. Contamination during disposal of FA can cause significant environmental problems. Knowledge about the interaction of FA and hydrophobic organic pollutants in the environment is very limited. This study investigated the adsorption of phenanthrene at the interface of FA and water. The performance of phenanthrene adsorption on FA and the effects of various aqueous chemistry conditions were evaluated. The adsorption isotherms exhibited an increasing trend in the adsorbed amounts of phenanthrene, while a stepwise pattern was apparent. A stepwise multisite Langmuir model was developed to simulate the stepwise adsorption process. The adsorption of phenanthrene onto FA was noted to be spontaneous at all temperatures. The thermodynamic results indicated that the adsorption was an exothermic process. The adsorption capacity gradually decreased as pH increased from 4 to 8; however, this trend became less significant when pH was changed from 8 to 10. The binding affinity of phenanthrene to FA increased after the addition of humic acid (HA). The pH variation was also responsible for the changes of phenanthrene adsorption on FA in the presence of HA. High ionic strength corresponded to low mobility of phenanthrene in the FA-water system. Results of this study can help reveal the migration patterns of organic contaminants in the FA-water system and facilitate environmental risk assessment at FA disposal sites.

AB  - In this paper, we evaluated how the recovery process of litter and associated ant fauna occurs, after a total removal of the litter. For that, we designed a natural microcosms experiment in a forest remnant in Southeast Brazil, and tested four hypotheses: (I) litter weight increases with time after clearance; (II) litter-dwelling ant species richness increases with time after clearance; (III) litter-dwelling ant species richness increases with litter weight increase and (IV) evenness between ant species becomes higher with restoration time. We also compared the litter weight and ant species richness before disturbance and after a year recovery period. Litter weight and ant species richness presented a significant positive relationship with time. If a habitat is profoundly disturbed, and it is left to a natural recovery process, it is predictable that a condition similar to the former would be established. As expected, ant species richness had also a significant positive relationship with litter weight, once the species could inhabit the litter as it was being reestablished. Evenness did not have a significant relationship with restoration time, which suggests that there is not a "colonization rule" for the litter ant assemblage: in other words, there are no pioneer species. In spite of these results, litter weight and ant species richness were lower even after a year of natural recovery process, in comparison to the undisturbed stage. These variables are expected to be equal only after a recovery period of 820 days, which indicates a low resilience of this system.

AB  - In this paper we present the results of a multi-criteria decision analysis used to identify a comprehensive set of criteria for assigning biodiversity value to sites for conservation planning. For effective conservation management, biodiversity value needs to be a composite of biotic and abiotic factors. However, in the reserve design literature, conservation value is assigned with a limited set of metrics usually based on comprehensiveness, representativeness and persistence which may be insufficient at fully capturing biodiversity value. A group of conservation specialists in California, USA, used a multi-criteria decision making framework to elucidate and weight criteria for scoring biodiversity value at sites. A formal model for consensus and negotiation was applied to aggregate individuals' criteria weights across all group members. The group identified ecological condition, followed by biotic composition as the most important contributors to site conservation value. Long- and short-term threats causing fragmentation and degradation are also important criteria to consider. Key criteria are identified for which further data collection would serve the greatest purpose in prioritizing sites and the role of prioritization criteria in the larger context of systematic conservation planning is discussed. With the recognition that biodiversity value plays an important role in conservation decisions, the criteria presented here represents a comprehensive suite of factors to consider when assigning biodiversity value to sites for conservation planning. These can serve as an encompassing list which other groups can customize for the purpose of biodiversity evaluation for alternative conservation planning contexts.

AB  - Although recent hydrothermal experiments imply that abiogenic methane (CH4) generation from hydrothermal reduction of CO2 can occur, evidence from natural systems was still lacking. Based on the chemical and isotopic equilibrium signatures of low-temperature fumarolic gas discharges, we are able to provide hard evidence for its natural occurrence, namely in three subduction-related bi-phase hydrothermal systems of the Mediterranean, whose temperatures range from 260 to 470 degrees C. The attainment of equilibrium and the time spans of recent volcanic dormancy allowed us to calculate minimum rates for chemical and isotopic equilibration. These are significantly higher than those previously reported and might be due to the presence of a saturated water vapor phase in the investigated systems. The fact that nature provides conditions enabling relatively fast production of hydrocarbons from CO2 strongly supports the concerns that were recently raised from laboratory experiments. These address the use of the carbon isotope composition of reduced carbon in Archean sediments as a tracer of early life and the occurrence of CH4 on extraterrestrial planets as a bioindicator. In view of the potential role of abiogenic CH4 as a precursor of life, we also present an estimate of abiogenic hydrothermal CH4 fluxes throughout the Archean. It is not expected that these fluxes exceeded 80 Mt/yr during the past 4.0 Ga. This, however, would have been enough to facilitate HCN production on the prebiotic Earth. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Southern African Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (SAfMA) evaluated the relationships between ecosystem services and human well-being at multiple scales, ranging from local through to sub-continental. Trends in ecosystem services (fresh water, food, fuel-wood, cultural and biodiversity) over the period 1990-2000 were mixed across scales. Freshwater resources appear strained across the continent with large numbers of people not securing adequate supplies, especially of good quality water. This translates to high infant mortality patterns across the region. In some areas, the use of water resources for irrigated agriculture and urban-industrial expansion is taking place at considerable cost to the quality and quantity of freshwater available to ecosystems and for domestic use. Staple cereal production across the region has increased but was outstripped by population growth while protein malnutrition is on the rise. The much-anticipated wood-fuel crisis on the subcontinent has not materialized but some areas are experiencing shortages while numerous others remain vulnerable. Cultural benefits of biodiversity are considerable, though hard to quantify or track over time. Biodiversity resources remain at reasonable levels, but are declining faster than reflected in species extinction rates and appear highly sensitive to land-use decisions. The SAfMA sub-global assessment provided an opportunity to experiment with innovative ways to assess ecosystem services including the use of supply-demand surfaces, service sources and sink areas, priority areas for service provision, service 'hotspots' and trade-off assessments.

AB  - The effect of annual variations in the daily average soil temperatures, at different depths, on the calculation of pesticide leaching potential indices is presented. This index can be applied to assess the risk of groundwater contamination by a pesticide. It considers the effects of water table depth, daily recharge net rate, pesticide sorption coefficient, and degradation rate of the pesticide in the soil. The leaching potential index is frequently used as a screening indicator in pesticide groundwater contamination studies, and the temperature effect involved in its calculation is usually not considered. It is well known that soil temperature affects pesticide degradation rates, air-water partition coefficient, and water-soil partition coefficient. These three parameters are components of the attenuation and retardation factors, as well as the leaching potential index, and contribute to determine pesticide behavior in the environment. The Arrhenius, van't Hoff, and Clausius-Clapeyron equations were used in this work to estimate the soil temperature effect on pesticide degradation rate, air-water partition coefficient, and water-soil partition coefficient, respectively. The relationship between leaching potential index and soil temperature at different depths is presented and aids in the understanding of how potential pesticide groundwater contamination varies on different climatic conditions. Numerical results will be presented for 31 herbicides known to be used in corn and soybean crops grown on the municipality of Sao Gabriel do Oeste, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil.

AB  - A new computer program, DISCO, running under Windows, has been developed under the project CSA98P22 failing within the Competitive Support Activities initiative launched within the EU 4th Framework Programme. DISCO allows the calculation of the stepwise acid dissociation constants of polyprotic molecules in water and in complex media (i.e., biofluids, etc.) from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data (chemical shifts) by means of two derivative-free methods: Pit-mapping and Simplex. DISCO performances were tested using simulated-unaffected by experimental error-data sets, for systems having up to seven equilibrium constants and experimental NMR data of spermine, 6-monofluorospermine, and 6,6-difluorospermine, dissolved in D2O and in physiological solution (D2O/NaCl). Results demonstrated that (i) DISCO enables the determination of pK(A) values with high precision even when small-sized raw data sets are employed, when chemical shifts are measured with low precision (the usual condition in biofluids due to the impossibility to obtain narrow line shape), and when the guess solution, necessary as an initial step of the mathematical iterative process, is fixed within a large interval of variation; (ii) DISCO always converges to the root; (iii) DISCO permits the calculation of pKA values which lie within the observed pH range, independent of the narrowness of the pH range.

AB  - Knowledge of soil and landscape hydrology is essential to evaluating the processes and quality of terrestrial ecosystems. Of particular interest in Southern Minnesota is the extensive Clarion-Nicollet-Webster catena, for which little quantitative work has been done in the region. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between soil hydrology and morphology for an undrained catena in south-central Minnesota. Seven points along a 125-m summit-to-wetland transect were instrumented with piezometers (25, 50, 100, and 200 cm), observation wells (300 cm), Pt-electrodes (25, 50, 100 cm, footslope only), and thermocouples (10, 25,50, 100 cm). Mollic epipedons were 77-cm thick at the footslope (Cumulic Endoaquoll), thinning to 39 cm at the summit (Oxyaquic Hapludoll). The lower hillslope positions had low chroma colors below the mollic horizon, indicative of reducing conditions. The water table frequently was located in the mollic horizon for these soils and redox potentials at the footslope were frequently <200 mV. Fe content decreased from summit to footslope, indicating the reduction and removal of Fe in the lower landscape positions. With the exception of the wetland, soils had equal piezometric head with depth, indicating lateral throughflow. The wetland had alternating recharge and discharge hydrology during the study. Profile Darkness Index (PDI) had strong correlation with the duration of saturation (r = 0.88, &alpha; = 0.05). Thickness and color of surface horizons in this landscape are strong indicators of landscape hydrology, especially when redoximorphic features associated with normal water table levels are masked by thick mollic epipedons.

AB  - A cDNA library was constructed from macroalgae adapted to prolonged elevated environmental copper levels. To investigate the possible existence of a metallothionein (MT) gene, the library was screened with degenerate probes designed using plant MT cysteine-rich motifs. A gene was identified (1229 bp) with a putative open reading frame (204 bp) encoding a 67-amino-acid protein exhibiting several characteristic features of MT proteins, including 16 cysteine residues (24%) and only one aromatic residue. Although the protein sequence showed high identity with plant and invertebrate MTs, it contained a unique 'linker' region (14 amino acid residues) between the two putative metal-binding domains which contained no cysteine residues. This extended linker is larger than the tripeptide found in archetypal vertebrate MTs, but does not conform either with the 40-amino-acid linkers commonly found in plant MT sequences. An S-peptide Fucus MT fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited a relative molecular mass of similar to 14 kDa. The recombinant fusion bound seven Cd ions, of which 50% were dissociated at pH 4.1. Under anaerobic conditions, the Cd ions were displaced by Cu(I), which associated with the protein at a ratio of 13 : 1. Laboratory exposure of F. vesiculosus to elevated copper resulted in induction of the MT gene. Thus this paper describes, for the first time, an MT gene identified from macroalgae which is induced by copper exposure and whose encoded protein product binds cadmium and copper.

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) are extremely useful in a diverse range of consumer goods. However, their impact on the environment is still under research, especially regarding the mechanisms involved in their effect. Aiming to provide some insight, the present work analyzes the transcriptional activity of six genes (Hsp83, Hsp17.2, Hsp19.8, SOD Cu-Zn, Mn-SOD, and BPI) in the terrestrial snail Helix aspersa in the presence of different concentrations of Ag-NPs. The animals were exposed for seven days to Lactuca sativa soaked for one hour in different concentrations of Ag-NPs (20, 50, 100 mg/L). The results revealed that the highest concentration tested of Ag-NPs (100 mg/L) led to a statistically significant induction of the Hsp83 and BPI expression in the digestive gland compared to the control group. However, a trend to upregulation with no statistical significance was observed for all the genes in the digestive gland and the foot, while in the hemolymph, the trend was to downregulation. Ag-NPs affected the stress response and immunity under the tested conditions, although the impact was weak. It is necessary to explore longer exposure times to confirm that the effect can be maintained and impact on health. Our results highlight the usefulness of the terrestrial snail Helix aspersa as a bioindicator organism for silver nanoparticle pollution biomonitoring and, in particular, the use of molecular biomarkers of pollutant effect as candidates to be included in a multi-biomarker strategy.

AB  - This research aimed for the first time to identify the essential welfare problems on 46 goat dairy farms in Vojvodina,based on the goat AWIN welfare protocol. The study showed that space allowance per goat was 1.55, 1.86 and 2.50 m(2)/goat (large, medium, small-sized farms, respectively). Most farms possessed the soil floor and straw as a flooring material. The small and medium farms more allowed access to the outdoor area. Contrary, large-sized farms mostly kept goats in fully housed systems with reduced opportunities for the goats to express their natural behavior. Management procedures were significantly different (p < 0.05) between the investigated farms. Differences were mainly in bedding, feeding and culling strategies. Low productivity was the main cause of culling in all farm types. Small-sized farms carried out more often disbudding (42.9%) in comparison with medium (21.4%) and large-sized ones (14.3%). Group level observation showed that the main areas of concern were associated with hair coat condition and kneeling at the feeding rack (p < 0.05). Inadequate BCS, udder asymmetry and claw overgrowth were frequently recorded. The prevalence of thin and fat goats was highest in large-sized farms All farm size categories and management systems showed certain welfare weaknesses. Thus, the findings highlighted the need for higher implementation of animal welfare principles and improvement of management techniques to meet the welfare requirements of dairy goats.

AB  - Subsistence adaptations respond to environmental instability as well as sociopolitical demands. On the Andean altiplano, camelid husbandry is a key adaptation utilized for thousands of years to mitigate environmental risks to agricultural productivity, to facilitate transport and to generate wealth for political purposes. Here, we reconstruct the history of camelid utilization on the altiplano with fecal stanol biomarkers from Lake Orurillo in southern Peru. Biomarker samples span a 4000-year interval and document changes at centennial timescales. The abundances of individual fecal stanols appear to be less diagnostic of changes in human occupation in the Orurillo region where human population levels apparently remained far lower than those of domesticated camelids. However, ratios of human (coprostanol) to ruminant (24-ethylcoprosanol) fecal stanol concentrations demonstrate that these proxies are reliable indicators of variations in camelid herd sizes. Our data show that camelid utilization intensified after ca. 1050 CE during a severe and protracted drought that was coincident with widespread population movement away from fertile farmlands to higher elevations favorable for grazing. Camelid herds remained in high abundance around Orurillo during improved climate conditions and through the Inca era until after ca. 1500 CE when our data point to a significant disruption after European conquest. The intensification of camelid husbandry among Andean cultures is therefore linked to major environmental and sociopolitical shifts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the mental workload of a harvester operator when working in late thinning and in windthrown stands of the same type and age, using eye movement patterns as an indicator. Eyeball movement variability was analysed using the eye tracking method. The mean duration of eyesight fixations in windthrown stands was shorter than in the control undamaged stands by about 20% (444 ms and 534 ms, respectively). The mean time of eyesight movements (saccades) in the windthrown stands was shorter than in the control undamaged stands by approx. 15%. The largest differences between the duration of saccades in the windthrown and control stands were observed between the cutting of trees and cutting logs off their root plates: the saccades were longer by about 20% when working in the control stands (49 ms) as compared to the windthrown stands (43 ms). Large differences in the duration of saccades between the windthrown area (42 ms) and the control area (47 ms) were also found when travelling between successive operation sites. In both types of stands, the shortest saccades were observed during processing: 39 ms. Summary durations of saccades observed during the processing of successive trees occurred in sequences showing repeated periods of variable eyeball activity, where longer saccades were followed by shorter ones. Documented more variability of eyesight activities of the harvester operator performing the operations of processing and moving is new standard of eye balls activities for the more taxing work conditions presented by windthrown stands.

AB  - S-metolachlor (S-ME) is a widely used chiral herbicide that can cause potential ecological risks via long-term usage. In this work, we chose a model plant, wheat, as the test material to determine the effects of applying 10 mg/kg S-ME to soil on its fresh weight, chlorophyll and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the diversity and structural composition of the phyllosphere microorganisms after 7 and 14 days of exposure. Our work showed that this concentration of residual S-ME in soil only slightly decreased plant biomass and had little effect on lipid peroxida don, the antioxidant enzyme system and chlorophyll content. Interestingly, although the test concentration of S-ME did not exert strong inhibitory effects on the physiological activities of wheat, it decreased the diversity of phyllosphere microbial communities and changed their structure, indicating that microorganisms were more sensitive stress indicators. S-ME reduced the colonization by some beneficial bacteria related to plant nitrogen fixation among the phyllosphere microorganisms, which influenced the growth and yield of wheat because these bacteria contribute to plant fitness. In addition, S-ME affected the association between the host and the composition of the phyllosphere microbial communities under different growth conditions. Our work provides insights into the ecological implications of the effects of herbicides on the phyllosphere microbiome. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In savannas, mapping grazing resources and indicators of land degradation is important for assessing ecosystem conditions and informing grazing and land management decisions. We investigated the effects of classifiers and used time series imagery-images acquired within and across seasons-on the accuracy of plant species maps. The study site was a grazed savanna in southern Kenya. We used Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery due to its high spatial (10-20 m) and temporal (five days) resolution with support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. The species mapped were important for grazing livestock and wildlife (three grass species), indicators of land degradation (one tree genus and one invasive shrub), and a fig tree species. The results show that increasing the number of images, including dry season imagery, results in improved classification accuracy regardless of the classifier (average increase in overall accuracy (OA) = 0.1632). SVM consistently outperformed RF, and the most accurate model and was SVM with a radial kernel using imagery from both wet and dry seasons (OA = 0.8217). Maps showed that seasonal grazing areas provide functionally different grazing opportunities and have different vegetation characteristics that are critical to a landscape's ability to support large populations of both livestock and wildlife. This study highlights the potential of multi-spectral satellite imagery for species-level mapping of savannas.

AB  - Intelligent packaging system was developed based on natural polymeric films (chitosan, gelatin and starch), containing bioactive compounds from aqueous hibiscus extract (HAE). Anthocyanin, a compound present on HAE, changes colour under different pH conditions. Thus, the application of HAE as a natural pH indicator with visible colour variation incorporated into renewable materials to allow for simple, economic, and easy disposal, can be considered an invocation in the area of intelligent packaging system. Films containing HAE (25 g/100 g of filmogenic dispersion, intelligent films) were produced by casting using 2 g of starch, gelatin or chitosan/100 g of filmogenic dispersion and 30 g of sorbitol/100 g of macromolecules. These films were characterized by the colour change at different pH values (from 2.2 to 8.0 and 13.0), water content, total soluble matter, light barrier properties and morphological structure. Intelligent films presented homogeneous surfaces without visible defects. The colour variation of intelligent films was visibly observed and completely dependent on pH. This was associated with the presence of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds in HAE. The addition of HAE in the films provoked a significant increase in the water content. A significant increase was observed only for the starch film for total soluble matter. The gelatin films presented a barrier to light. The proposed device could be used as an alternative natural pH indicator in intelligent packaging systems.

AB  - Retention soil filters (RSFs) protect water bodies from pollutant loads originating from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by filtering the wastewater through a filter layer having a depth of 0.75 to 1 m. The microbiological processes in the filter material are influenced by the redox potential (Eh). This potential is a strong indicator of the prevailing environmental conditions and the possible type of microbial activity. Previous investigations of filter bodies have been confined to constructed wetlands (CWs) with regular intermittent wastewater inflow. Compared to CWs, RSFs are characterized by higher oxygen availability due to alternating operating and dry periods. This study aimed to determine the Eh in RSFs and investigate its influence on the removal efficiency for different substances. We established a conceptual model for the standard Eh curve following a loading event, and the variations to this standard in two depths and between treatments. Correlations were determined with a canonical correlation analysis between the pollutant removal of COD, ammonium, phosphorous, E. coli, somatic coliphages and diclofenac and the Eh. Although the removal efficiency is influenced by several additional operating factors such as the preceding dry period, filter age and the respective inflow concentrations, our results show that the Eh is an adequate approach to assess the removal efficiency of RSFs for these substances.

AB  - Highly efficient photocatalytic degradation of refractory organic contaminants in wastewater remains a great challenge due to low quantum efficiency and poor solar energy utilization of the currently employed photocatalysts. Herein, a novel BiVO4/CH3COO(BiO) heterojunction photocatalyst is designed and prepared by a simple one-pot solvothermal method, and characterized by various techniques. By using this photocatalyst, degradation efficiency of four kinds of emerging refractory organic pollutants (sulfamethoxazole, bisphenol A, 4-aminoantipyrine and ibuprofen) in water is investigated under simulated solar irradiation. Then, total organic carbon is measured to determine the mineralization degree, and degradation intermediates of the pollutants are identified to propose their degradation pathway. It is found that under the given conditions, complete degradation of the pollutants is observed within the irradiation of 5-24 h, and 81-96% mineralization degree is achieved in 24 h. Furthermore, it is shown that the degradation kinetics can be described by pseudo-first order model. Based on the detected intermediates during the degradation process of 4-aminoantipyrine and ibuprofen, the degradation pathways of these two pollutants are suggested to involve cleavage of side chain, heterocyclic ring opening and hydroxylation of aromatic ring. In addition, the application of the BiVO4/CH3COO(BiO) heterojunction photocatalyst in the purification of the spiked real wastewater is also investigated. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Animals are exposed to the more frequent stressful weather events that may impact parental decisions and their investment in offspring. This study examines whether and how heavy rainfall influences the birds' incubation behavior, hatching date, food volume brought to the nests, the offspring's immune response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and their body mass during the post-hatch period. The research was conducted on the Eurasian blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, living in a nest-box area in the Niepoomice Forest (near Krakow, S Poland) during 3 years: 2009, 2010 and 2011. Rainfall did not directly affect the incubation period, but nestlings from eggs that incubated longer had a higher mass. Later hatching date was beneficial for the chicks' body mass, while earlier hatched chicks responded more efficiently to the PHA antigen. Although the intensity of rainfall did not directly affect the volume of food brought by adults to the chicks, its greater amount was beneficial for both indicators of their condition. With a more intensive rainfall, the weaker chicks responded to the PHA antigen, but achieved greater body mass. In the next years, it can be expected that heavy rainfall will become an increasingly important environmental cue, based on which birds will adapt their reproduction, and which will affect population trends, as the immune response weakened during the intensive rainfall is a survival indicator.

AB  - Stable isotope analysis (SIA) has rapidly become a useful tool to study the ecology of wild animal populations, especially for elusive, wide-ranging predators like marine mammals. The development of projectile biopsy techniques resulted in the collection of thousands of cetacean tissue samples that were archived in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution for long-term, multidecadal preservation. Here we examine the influence of DMSO preservation on carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) values by comparing a set of paired delphinid skin samples stored frozen without preservative and in DMSO for up to 22 yr. Treatment of paired frozen and DMSO-preserved skin in a 2:1 chloroform:methanol solution yielded similar delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, revealing that DMSO and lipid contamination have similar isotopic effects on skin, and that these effects can be removed using routine lipid-extraction methods. Further, amino acid concentrations in DMSO-preserved and frozen skin tissue were similar, providing independent evidence of minimal protein alteration due to preservation. Access to a rich archive of skin samples preserved in DMSO will expand our ability to examine temporal and spatial variability in the isotope values of cetaceans, which will aid our understanding of how their ecology has been influenced by historical changes in environmental conditions.

AB  - The present importance of oceanic topics-fishery included - is characterized by the existence of conflicts at a global, not compartmentalized, level that no country can keep out of. The greatest awareness about questions linked to fishery resource sustainability - such as the need to arbitrate acts designed to regulate fishery access conditions; the application of different business strategies and conflicts among both national and international jurisdictions (high sea and transzonal areas). That is why the need of implementing new enhancements regarding behavior codes applied by producers, as well as regarding the decisions adopted by public authorities within the framework of fishery regulation, in the context of a Global Sustainable Development.
   The main objective of this work is reviewing the successive policies related to the management of the fishery resources, as well as to determine the key elements of the governance, in relation to the behavior of the actors involved in this activity. Fisheries management is also taken into consideration from the institutional level and from the actors involved. The information analyzed was obtained from an extensive review of the academic literature and through interviews with companies and personalities related to the fishing activity. As a conclusion, some measures are proposed to promote a better organizational functioning of the sector, eliminating the existing dysfunctional ones and reconciling conflicting interests. These measures suggest incorporating dimensions from ecosystems, socio-economic systems and institutional aspects. We conclude that management systems should be institutional agreements and administrative processes with the capacity to articulate a fisheries policy.

AB  - There are many definitions of forest degradation, however, most of them are not operational because they do not propose variables to measure it. Its measurement is complex. Evaluation involves comparing the status of the forest at a given time with a previous state (reference condition or baseline). The challenge to follow-up the degradation process begins with its definition and the identification of the baseline. The present paper proposes a General Index of Degradation (IGD, for its meaning in Spanish) to assess forest degradation that occurs in Mexico in the time period between measurements of the National Inventory of Forest and Soil (Infys). The IGD is composed of indicators that take as input the Infys database. At the same time, the study aims to build a base line that will allow monitoring forest degradation in future years. The results at the scale of federal entity indicate that the states of Puebla, Veracruz, Morelos and Colima show no evidence of degradation processes (IGD) during the period evaluated. On the contrary, Queretaro, Tamaulipas and Mexico City recorded certain process of degradation. The value of the IGD weighted at the national scale indicates that in general, for the five-year periods evaluated (e.g. 2004-2009, 2005-2010, etc.) the country's ecosystems do not record any significant degradation, i.e., the value obtained from the IGD is equal to the baseline value. However, at the local scale it is possible to identify areas severely degraded or even deforested.

AB  - The present paper attempts to evolve a new model by considering various indicators of different types of land degradation or desertification, namely, water erosion, soil salinity, vegetation degradation, and lowering of ground water table for finding areas with higher rate of degradation. The Runiz basin, located in the southern Iran, has been selected as a study area to assess the hazard of desertification. The thresholds for the severity classes of indicators were established and then the hazard map for each indicator of types of desertification has been prepared in a GIS. The risk classes of different risk maps were calculated on the basis of classification of risk scores derived by cumulative effect of all the attributes of indicators after overlying them in the GIS. It was possible to distinguish the areas under 'actual risk' from areas under 'potential risk of desertification types. Also areas under potential risk were classified to subclasses with different probability level to show a statistical picture of risk in future, The final map of risk of desertification was produced by overlaying all four maps of degradation types. Results show that potential risk areas and areas under actual risk are almost equal, indicating further threat of desertification in future in the half of the region. Also severe condition in the half of region shows environmentally bad situation in the study area. It is hoped that this attempt using GIS will be found applicable for other regions of the world.

AB  - QuestionHow important is the effect of micro-relief and vegetation type on the characteristics of vascular plants and bryophytes in low-centred polygons?
   LocationSiberian Arctic, Russia.
   MethodsEight low-centred polygons in northern Siberia were surveyed for vegetation along transects running from the rim to the pond via the rim-pond transition of each polygon and across a vegetation type gradient from open forest to tundra.
   ResultsThe cover of vascular plants and bryophytes displays no significant differences between the rim and rim-pond transition but is significantly lower in the pond section of the polygons. Alpha-diversity of vascular plants decreases strongly from rim to pond, whereas bryophyte diversity in pond plots is significantly distinct from the rim and the rim-pond transition. There is no clear trend in cover for either plant group along the vegetation type transect and only a weak trend in -diversity. However, both gradients are reflected in the compositional turnover. The applied indicator species analysis identified taxa characteristic of certain environmental conditions. Among others, we found vascular plants primarily characteristic of the rim and bryophyte taxa characteristic of each micro-relief level and vegetation type.
   ConclusionsThe observed gradual pattern in -diversity and composition of polygonal vegetation suggests that micro-relief is the main driver of changes in the vegetation composition, while vegetation type and the related forest cover change are of subordinate importance for polygonal vegetation patterns along the Siberian tree line.

AB  - The Sangab bentonite deposit is located similar to 20 km southeast of Khur and Biabanak (Isfehan province) in central Iran. This deposit is an alteration product of Eocene ignimbrites. Mineralogical studies show that the bentonites include minerals such as montmorillonite, illite-montmorillonite, beidellite, calcite, quartz, anorthite, albite, orthoclase, sanidine, microcline, and dolomite. Crystal-chemistry consideration indicates that the Sangab bentonite deposit is of Wyoming-type. Fluid inclusion studies demonstrate that the hydrothermal solutions responsible for bentonitization at Sangab had variable temperatures ranging from 140 degrees C to less than 70 degrees C and a narrow salinity range of 6.45-8.41 wt% NaCl equivalent. Geochemical investigations reveal that bentonitization of ignimbrites at Sangab was accompanied by depletion of Si, K, Cs, Rb, Th, V, Cu, and Ti, by enrichment of Ba, Al, Na, and Nb, and by leaching-fixation of Fe, Mg, Ca, P, Mn, Co, Hf, Sr, U, Zr, Y, Pb, Zn, and Ni. Geochemical analyses mark that variation of Eu and Ce anomalies in this deposit was controlled by the degree of feldspar alteration and oxidation potential, respectively. By considering the obtained results, it seems that factors like difference in degree of alteration intensity of the source materials, physico-chemical conditions of the environment, adsorption, incorporation in crystal structure, accessibility to complexing ligands, and difference in degree of resistance of primary minerals against alteration played prominent roles in differential mobilization, distribution, and concentration of elements in this deposit.

AB  - Twelve species of the conifer family Araucariaceae, including Araucaria (6 species), Agathis (3 species) and Wollemia (1 species) genera, were submitted to artificial maturation by confined pyrolysis. The aim of these experiments is to transform the biomolecules synthesized by these species into their homologous geomolecules in laboratory conditions. Determination of the diagenetic molecular signatures of Araucariaceae through experimentation on extant representatives allows us to complete our knowledge in botanical palaeochemotaxonomy. Such knowledge is relevant to palaeoenvironmental, environmental and archaeology purposes. All artificially diagenetic species of Araucariaceae are firstly characterized by a predominance of saturated tetracyclic diterpenoids including ent-beyerane, phyllocladanes and ent-kauranes. Moreover, Araucaria genus shows a high relative abundance of bicyclic sesquiterpenoids, particularly the cadalane-type compounds accompanied by those of eudesmane and bisabolane types as well as chamazulene and pentamethyl-dihydroindenes. Diterpenoids are of labdane, isopimarane and abietane types (essentially derived from abietanoic acids) as well as isohexyl alkylaromatic hydrocarbons. Compared to the tetracyclic diterpenoids, these compounds show a relatively lower abundance, reaching trace levels in the case of saturated abietanes. Distributions of sesquiterpenoids and diterpenoids of Agathis show some similarities to that of Araucaria, with the exception of one species, in which the tetracyclic compounds are absent and the abietane type (essentially derived from abietanoic acids) predominant. High similarities between the Wollemia and Araucaria genera are observed. Both are characterized by some high relative abundance of tetracyclic compounds with no predominance of other specific diterpenoids.

AB  - Stable isotopic measurements (delta N-15 and delta O-18), combined with hydrochemical assessment, were used to elucidate the chemical quality of groundwater and the sources of nitrate (NO3-) in the groundwater in an agricultural region at Huzhou City, China. Paddy rice (Zhejing 41) and vegetables (Chinese cabbage) are the typical crops grown in the study area. The chemical properties of groundwater in the study area were controlled using natural geochemical processes and anthropogenic activities. The results show that SO42- and NH4+ were the major contaminants. Surficial conditions influenced the shallow groundwater. However, no relationship between the ion concentration in groundwater and well depth was found. The combined use of isotopes was useful for identifying NO3- sources. The isotopic values for delta N-15 and delta O-18 ranged from -0.8%. to 20.8% and from -2.0%. to 18.8%., respectively. The isotopic data were definitive and revealed that N-fertilizer, soil organic matter, and manure dominated the sources of NO3- in the study area. The delta N-15 and delta O-18 data for NO3- indicated a significant degree of nitrification and a lesser extent of denitrification in the agricultural area. Spatial variations in delta N-15 for NO3- showed that NO(3)(-)concentration and delta N-15 values in the upper groundwater (<200 cm) were higher than the values in the lower groundwater (>200 cm).

AB  - This paper analyses the viability of Brassica napus as an energy crop cultivated for producing biodiesel in southern Europe. The proposed methodology assessment combines physical variables such as grain production and agroclimate conditions with environmental analysis (LCA) in order to determine the Mediterranean agroclimates areas that could be cultivated for non-food purposes. The results obtained in a local production and distribution scenario (25 km) demonstrate that the biodiesel systems analysed have a better energy balance than diesel. Biodiesel obtained a net energy benefit of 16.25 MJ kg (1) of biodiesel or 35.10 MJ kg(-1) of biodiesel when the avoided impacts from coproducts (glycerine and rapemeal) are considered in comparison with conventional diesel. In terms of environmental performance, the biodiesel system also has less impact compared with diesel in three categories Abiotic Depletion (AD), Photochemical Oxidation (PO) and Global Warming Potential (GWP). The estimated impact reduction in the GWP category when is compared with diesel reached a minimum of 1.76 kg CO2 eq. per kg of biodiesel when emissions of the use phase are included.
   The paper also demonstrates that agroclimates called "e", "b" and "d" that ensure grain productions higher than 2000 kg ha (-1) the biodiesel commercialization from B. napus energy crop is suitable in environmental terms for an energy local and regional production and distribution strategy.

AB  - The present paper analyzed the environmental assessment of short rotation willow plantations in Sweden based on the standard framework of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) from the International Standards Organisation. The analysis is focused on two alternative management regimes for willow plantations dedicated to biomass production for energy purposes. The data used included the averages of a large sample of commercial plantations. One of the scenarios is carried out under nitrogen based fertilized conditions and the other under non-fertilized management with total biomass yields (dry weight) of 140 t/ha and 86 t/ha over a 21 and 22-year life time respectively. The environmental profile was analyzed in terms of the potentials for abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity. In addition, an energy analysis was performed using the cumulative energy demand method (CEO). The application of nitrogen based fertilizers allows an increase in the biomass yield per ha of up to 40% although the contributions to almost all impact categories, particularly the eutrophication potential and toxicity potential impact categories are also considerably higher. Conversely, due to the higher biomass yields achieved with fertilization of these willow plantations, that regime presents a better overall environmental profile in terms of energy yield and global warming potential.

AB  - We analyzed sediment diatoms from core MD05-2908 to infer climate and paleoenvironmental changes in the southern Okinawa Trough (SOT) over the past 1000 years. Because the study area is located in the East Asia monsoon area and beneath the main axis of Kuroshio Current, the climatic and hydrographical conditions are strongly influenced by both of these factors. The species used as environmental indicators, including the Kuroshio Current species (KC species) and freshwater species, were investigated in this paper. Changes in the abundance of the two groups of species revealed significant variations in water temperature and hydrography in the SOT during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). From 950-1500 AD, the abundance of the KC species increased fluctuantly, while the freshwater species decreased, showing that the influence of the Kuroshio Current was intensified at that interval and the precipitation of the study area was relatively low. The KC species decreased remarkably and was maintained at a low abundance during the interval of 1500-1900 AD, which suggests that the impact of the Kuroshio Current on the SOT weakened during the period corresponding to the LIA. Moreover, the high abundance of the freshwater species at the same interval indicates a distinct increase in precipitation in northeastern Taiwan, which may be correlated to the south-detention of the rainfall belt in China caused by the southward migration of the western Pacific subtropical high.

AB  - We estimated target and limit impervious surface reference points (ISRPs) based on Chesapeake Bay dissolved oxygen (DO) criteria, and we examined associations and relationships among the percentage of watershed in impervious surface (IS), summer DO, and the presence of indicator species (blue crab Callinectes sapidus, white perch Morone americana, striped bass M. saxatilis, and spot Leiostomus xanthurus) in bottom waters of nine brackish subestuaries of Chesapeake Bay. Ideally, a target ISRP represented a level of development that maintained mean bottom DO at 5 mg/L or greater, while an ISRP threshold represented development that degraded mean bottom DO to less than 3 mg/L. The proportion of bottom trawls containing each indicator species rapidly declined from about 0.40 to 0.10 when DO fell below 3 mg/L, whereas the proportion remained at about 0.50 when DO was above 5 mg/L. The IS percentage had a significant negative influence on mean bottom DO and the odds that indicator species were present in midchannel bottom waters (0.8-7.0 m deep). Watersheds at or below a target IS of 5.5% (rural watershed) maintained mean bottom DO above 3 mg/L, but mean DO was only occasionally at or above 5 mg/L. Mean DO seldom exceeded 3 mg/L in watersheds with an IS value above 10% (suburban threshold). Comprehensive watershed management will be needed to offset significant degradation of bottom-water fish habitat in brackish subestuaries if rural lands are converted to suburban areas.

AB  - Airborne pollen records constitute a suitable bioindicator for evaluating physiological behaviour and resource conservation of vegetation responding to water deficit, reflected in pollination alterations (fluctuations in the dates of the beginning and end of the pollination period), or variation in total pollen production. The effects of extreme climatic conditions, such as increased inter-annual variability of rainfall and reduced rainfall, can be the limiting factors for pollen production and pollination patterns. We explore the effect that seasonal and inter-annual variation in climatic patterns (emphasizing the alteration of rainfall regimes) exert on pollination pattern in six anemophilous taxa located in the semi-arid area of Almeria (SE Spain), which is considered to be one of the areas with the highest aridity index in Europe. The sampling in a temporal series of 8 years (1998-2005) showed the pulsed and discrete rainfall events interspersed with drought periods are closely related to the alteration of the pollination in certain species. This is manifested in: (i) delayed onset of flowering until reaching the minimum threshold of soil water, in the case of some annual plants (Plantago, Rumex, and Poaceae), or (ii) scant variability both in the flowering period in plants with drought tolerance (Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia) or plants often linked to soil-moisture availability (Urticaceae).

AB  - The temporal and spatial distribution of dry and wet seasons is drastically limiting forage and agricultural production in Honduras. A regional overview on how these patterns influence the income of different types of milk producers was non-existent and would be a beneficial tool for targeting policies and development interventions. This paper examines the regionalized incomes derived from milk production by relating dry season length to milk production parameters for dairy farms. Cattle farms were assessed using two samples. Milk production in the dry and wet seasons was characterized by monthly net income from milk per cow.Sample A (97 farms) was classified according to a) herd size classes and b) performance in dry season milk production. Sample B (30 farms) assessed advanced farms that used more forage technologies than the others.
   The income from milk was related to environmental conditions by means of a countrywide map based on dry season length. The map was created by estimating the water balance for each month in a GIS. Yearly income from milk/cow was regionalized for the farm classifications and combined with agricultural census data.
   Results of the GIS analysis show a detailed zoning of dry season length and yearly income per cow from milk.
   Climate-income maps quantify the income ranges of the examined groups of farms.
   Climate change models predict temperature rise and decreasing precipitation for Honduras. In view of these trends the results can be used for an interpretation of farm vulnerability and resilience to climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Existing data regarding alcohol ethoxylate (AE) surfactants indicate that structures with greater than 20 ethoxylate (EO) units per molecule or with multibranched alkyl chains may not pass a ready biodegradability test. This could have important consequences for complying with regional regulatory requirements and for the potential risks these chemicals could present to the environment. We investigated the influence of chemical structure on the biodegradability of AEs with different alkyl chain branching and EO content. The AEs investigated were a multibranched AE (average, 18 EO), an oxo-AE (monobranched; average, 23 EO), and a linear AE of oleochemical origin (average, 40 EO). The aims of the present study were to assess the ready biodegradability of AEs with high EO content and to establish the mechanism or pathway by which biodegradation occurs for the oxo-AE. Biodegradation studies were conducted using standard test conditions (International Standards Organization 14593). Solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography with electrospray mass spectrometry were used to detect profiles in both derivatized and underivatized extracts of samples. Derivatization with phthalic anhydride was used to improve ionization of the lower-ethoxylated AEs and free alcohol that were key indicators in the present study. All AEs were rapidly biodegraded, achieving more than 60% mineralization of parent material. Central fission was the predominant mechanism for the oxo-AE, as confirmed by identification of the oligomeric distribution and quantification of polyethylene glycol released during biodegradation.

AB  - Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy has been used for quantitative measurement of trace elements, e.g. sulfur and chlorine, in concrete. Chloride and sulfate ions have a large effect on the durability of concrete structures, and quantitative measurement is important for condition assessment and quality assurance. Concrete is a highly heterogeneous material in composition and grain-size distribution, i.e. the spatial distribution of elements. Calibration plots were determined by use of laboratory-made reference samples consisting of pressings of cement powder, hydrated cement, cement mortar, and concrete, in which the heterogeneity of the material is increasing because of the aggregates. Coarse aggregate and cement paste are distinguishable by the intensity of the Ca spectral lines. More advanced evaluation is necessary to account for the effect of the fine aggregate. The three series of reference samples enable systematic study of the effects of heterogeneity on spectral intensity, signal fluctuation, uncertainty, and limits of detection. Spatially resolved measurements and many spectra enable statistical evaluation of the data. The heterogeneity has an effect on measurement of the sulfur and chlorine content, because both occur mainly in the cement matrix. Critical chloride concentrations are approximately 0.04% (m/m). The chlorine spectral line at 837.6 nm is evaluated. The natural sulfur content of concrete is approximately 0.1% (m/m). The spectral line at 921.3 nm is evaluated. One future application may be simultaneous determination of the amount of damaging trace elements and the cement content of the concrete.

AB  - It is believed that atmospheric deposition of S and N in the Adirondack Mountains of New York has depleted soil-base cation pools, reduced soil base saturation (BS), and contributed to enhanced acidification of soils and surface waters. However, data to determine changes in soil characteristics are generally lacking. It is expected that soil acid-base status will improve as acidic deposition declines in response to atmospheric emissions controls. We studied edaphic characteristics at 199 locations within 44 statistically selected Adirondack lake-watersheds, plus 26 additional watersheds that are included in long-term lakewater monitoring programs. The statistically selected watersheds were chosen to be representative of Adirondack watersheds containing lakes larger than 1 ha and deeper than 1 m that have lakewater acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) less than or equal to 200 mu mol(c) L-1. Results of soil analyses were extrapolated to the watersheds of 1320 low ANC lakes. In general, the concentrations of exchangeable base cations, base saturation, and soil pH were low. More than 75% of the target lakes received drainage from watersheds having average B horizon exchangeable Ca concentrations < 0.52 cmol, kg', base saturation < 10.3%, and pH (H2O) < 4.5. Variations in the effective cation exchange capacity in both O and B horizons were closely correlated with soil organic matter content. These data provide a baseline against which to compare future changes in regional soil chemistry, and provide input data for aquatic and terrestrial effects models intended to project future changes in surface water chemistry, biological conditions, and ftirest health.

AB  - Although developmental instability, measured as fluctuating asymmetry (FA), is expected to be positively related to stress and negatively to fitness, empirical evidence is often lacking or contradictory when patterns are compared at the population level. We demonstrate that two important properties of stressed populations may mask such relationships: (i) a stronger relationship between FA and fitness, resulting in stronger selection against low quality (i.e. developmental unstable) individuals and (ii) the evolution of adaptive responses to environmental stress. In an earlier study, we found female wolf spiders Pirata piraticus from metal exposed populations to be characterized by both reduced clutch masses and increased egg sizes, the latter indicating an adaptive response to stress. By studying the relationship between these two fitness related traits and levels of FA at individual level, we here show a significant negative correlation between FA and clutch mass in metal stressed populations but not in unstressed reference populations. As a result, levels of population FA may be biased downward under stressful conditions because of the selective removal of developmentally unstable (low quality) individuals. We further show that females that produced larger eggs in stressed populations exhibited lower individual FA levels. Such interaction between individual FA and fitness with stress may confound the effect of metal stress on FA, resulting in an absence of relationships between FA, fitness and stress at the population level.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) has been associated with a variety of adverse health effects primarily involving the cardiopulmonary system. However, the precise biological mechanisms to explain how exposure to PM exacerbates or directly causes adverse effects are unknown. Particles of varying composition may play a critical role in these effects. To study such a phenomenon, a simple, laminar diffusion flame was used to generate aerosols of soot and iron particles in the ultrafine size range. Exposures of healthy adult rats were for 6 h/day for 3 days. Conditions used included exposure to soot only, iron only, or a combination of soot and iron. We found animals exposed to soot particles at 250 mug/m(3) had no adverse respiratory effects. Exposure to iron alone at a concentration of 57 mug/m(3) also had no respiratory effects. However, the addition of 45 mug/m(3) of iron to soot with a combined total mass concentration of 250 mug/m(3) demonstrated significant pulmonary ferritin induction, oxidative stress, elevation of IL-1beta, and cytochrome P450s, as well as activation of NFkappaB. These findings suggest that a synergistic interaction between soot and iron particles account for biological responses not found with exposure to iron alone or to soot alone.

AB  - Long-term application of poultry (Gallus gallus domesticus) litter has built high levels of P in certain Coastal Plain soils of north Louisiana. However, soil P/runoff P relationships for soil and environmental conditions of the area have not been examined. This study measured soil P (total, Bray 1, Bray 2, Mehlich 3, resin-exchangeable, and water-extractable) and runoff P (dissolved P, DP; and total P, TP) at four pasture sites previously amended with poultry litter. Sites varied in soil P due to annual litter applications ranging from 1 to more than 20. Three replicated plots at each site were subjected to simulated rainfalls over 2 yr, and concentrations of DP and TP in runoff were measured and related to soil P. This allowed examination of soil P/runoff P relationships and their changes over time. Runoff DP was also related to DP desorbed from surface soil in a miscible displacement experiment. Among measures of soil P, only resin-exchangeable and water-extractable P showed significant decreases over 2 yr. These measures of soil P explained 54 to 64% of the variability in runoff DP data. However, the miscible displacement technique proved the best indicator of runoff DP, explaining 70% of the variability. Runoff varied among sites (decreasing with increasing years of litter application), limiting the predictive capability of the soil extraction methods. Linking runoff characteristics with miscible displacement data may he a useful predictive tool and warrants further examination.

AB  - It has been claimed that the present farming environment does not meet foxes' needs for social behaviour. In this study we measured the welfare of farmed blue foxes, Alopex lagopus, housed in two different social and spatial conditions: i) traditional housing (group T) where a male and a female cub were housed together and their vixen alone in standard (1.2m(2)) fox cages; and ii) family housing (group F) where a vixen and her five cubs were housed together in a connected six-cage system (7.2m(2)). Production-related welfare parameters (weight gain and the incidence of bite wounds on fur) as well as physiological ones (adrenal mass and serum cortisol response to ACTH administration) were measured in these two groups.
   No differences were found in any of the measured parameters between the vixens housed in traditional and family units. In cubs, there was less difference between the sexes in weight gain in group F than in group T, and a significantly lower weight gain was evident only in group T female cubs. The serum cortisol level in response to an ACTH challenge was higher in group T cubs and independent of the sex of the animal, while heavier adrenals were observed in group T male cubs only. We conclude that the enlarged cage system combined with group housing had some beneficial effects on the measured performance- and welfare-related indicators in blue fox cubs.

AB  - The performance of Salmonella typhimurium WG49 and Escherichia coli HS(pFamp)R was compared on detecting the different genotypes of F-specific RNA bacteriophages by plaque hybridisation. The sensitivity of this assay was also compared with the sensitivity of RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting for detecting F-specific RNA bacteriophages belonging to genotype III in water. S. typhimurium WG49 detected slightly higher numbers of F-specific RNA bacteriophages than E. coli HS(pFamp)R both in mixtures of pure culture bacteriophage suspensions and in water samples. There were no differences between the two host strains with regard to detection of the four genotypes of F-specific RNA phages both in mixtures of pure culture bacteriophage suspensions and in environmental samples. In urban sewage samples, the host strains detected genotypes II and III as the predominant F-RNA bacteriophages. Plaque transfer to a N+ hybond membrane and posterior hybridisation was easier using S. thyphimurium WG49 as the host strain. The efficiency of detection in sewage of genotype III F-specific RNA bacteriophages by RT-PCR was inferior to that of plaque hybridisation with the assay conditions described below. Hybridisation of plaques obtained on WG49 seems to be the most sensitive method to study the distribution of genotypes of F-specific RNA bacteriophages in water samples.

AB  - delta(13)C and delta(18)O values of pedogenic carbonate concretions from Pleistocene palaeosol sequences of the northwestern part of Bangladesh are presented. The major goal of this study is to test (1) the reproducibility of the delta(13)C and delta(18)O signals within palaeosols and (2) their variation from one palaeosol to the other. The palaeosols that are expected to have formed under different palaeoenvironmental palaeoclimatic or diagenetic conditions provide isotopic signatures (delta(13)C and z delta(18)O) that can be clearly distinguished. In other words the differences between analytical results from the same palaeosol are much smaller than between samples from different palaeosols. This would mean that climatic or environmental changes are recorded as significant differences in isotopic signature. Carbon isotopic compositions vary between -11.5 and +2.0 parts per thousand. The relatively larger delta(13)C variations may be explained by climatically induced changes in floral composition. Changes in humidity are translated into variations of C-3 and C-4 plant proportions, resulting in changes in soil CO2 delta(13)C values. The extreme delta(13)C values found would correspond to nearly single 'phase' C-3 (delta(13)C: -11.5 parts per thousand) or C-4 (delta(13)C: +2.0 parts per thousand). Variations in the oxygen isotopic composition are much smaller, and range between -6.5 parts per thousand and -3.5 parts per thousand. These smaller differences can be induced by temperature changes.

AB  - Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu were sampled from three sites within the Lake Erie drainage (Elk Creek, Twentymile Creek, and Misery Bay, an embayment in Presque Isle Bay). Plasma, tissues for histopathological analyses, and liver and testes preserved in RNALater (R) were sampled from 30 smallmouth bass (of both sexes) at each site. Liver and testes samples were analyzed for transcript abundance with Nanostring nCounter (R) technology. Evidence of estrogenic endocrine disruption was assessed by the presence and severity of intersex (testicular oocytes; TO) and concentrations of plasma vitellogenin in male fish. Abundance of 17 liver transcripts associated with reproductive function, endocrine activity, and contaminant detoxification pathways and 40 testes transcripts associated with male and female reproductive function, germ cell development, and steroid biosynthesis were also measured. Males with a high rate of TO (87-100%) and plasma vitellogenin were noted at all sites; however, TO severity was greatest at the site with the highest agricultural land cover. Numerous transcripts were differentially regulated among the sites and patterns of transcript abundance were used to better understand potential risk factors for estrogenic endocrine disruption. The results of this study suggest endocrine disruption is prevalent in this region and further research would benefit to identify the types of contaminants that may be associated with the observed biological effects.

AB  - Background: Chemical looping combustion (CLC) has attracted wide interests with high-efficiency and nearzero energy penalty carbon capture. However, the low-pressure operation of the most adopted circulating fluidized-bed reactors restricts the application of the downstream combined (gas-steam turbines) cycle, leading to an unsatisfying system efficiency. For this reason, this paper integrates atmosphere CLC with the combined recompression supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle and organic Rankine cycle (CLC-sCO(2)-ORC) for power generation.
   Methods: The proposed system was modeled and simulated with Aspen Plus to manifest its tech-economic feasibility.
   Significant findings: The sensitive analysis suggests that the optimal sCO(2) turbine inlet temperature and pressure are 700 degrees C and 280 bar, respectively, and the recompression split fraction is 0.72. Under the optimal condition, the energy efficiency of 51.79% is superior to the conventional natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) (49.38%) and other CLC-based power generation technology (50.13%). Exergy analysis was also performed to put forward some improvement strategies. Importantly, CLC operating temperature imposes nearly no impact on exergy loss. Besides, the economic indicator, levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is supposed to be profitable at 79.17 $/MWh, which is lower than that of other CLC-based power generation system (83.12 $/MWh).

AB  - High-throughput detection of plant environmental stresses is required for minimizing the reduction in crop yield. Environmental stresses in plants have primarily been validated by the measurements of photosynthesis with gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence, which involve complicated procedures. Remote sensing technologies that monitor leaf reflectance in intact plants enable real-time visualization of plant responses to environmental fluctuations. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI), one of the vegetation indices of spectral leaf reflectance, is related to changes in xanthophyll pigment composition. Xanthophyll dynamics are strongly correlated with plant stress because they contribute to the thermal dissipation of excess energy. However, an accurate assessment of plant stress based on PRI requires correction by baseline PRI (PRIo) in the dark, which is difficult to obtain in the field. In this study, we propose a method to correct the PRI using NPQ(T), which can be measured under light. By this method, we evaluated responses of excess light energy stress under drought in wild watermelon (Citrullus lanatus L.), a xerophyte. Demonstration on the farm, the stress behaviors were observed in maize (Zea mays L.). Furthermore, the stress status of plants and their recovery following re-watering were captured as visual information. These results suggest that the PRI is an excellent indicator of environmental stress and recovery in plants and could be used as a high-throughput stress detection tool in agriculture.

AB  - The discrimination learning of multiple odors, in which multi-odor can be associated with different responses, is important for responding quickly and accurately to changes in the external environment. However, very few studies have been done on multi-odor discrimination by animal sniffing. Herein, we report a novel multi-odor discrimination system by detection rats based on the combination of 2-Choice and Go/No-Go (GNG) tasks into a single paradigm, in which the Go response of GNG was replaced by 2-Choice, for detection of toluene and acetone, which are odor indicators of lung cancer and diabetes, respectively. Three of six trained rats reached performance criterion, in 12 consecutive successful tests within a given set or over 12 sets with a success rate of over 90%. Through a total of 1300 tests, the trained animals (N = 3) showed multi-odor sensing performance with 88% accuracy, 87% sensitivity and 90% specificity. In addition, a dependence of behavior response time on odor concentrations under given concentration conditions was observed, suggesting that the system could be used for quantitative measurements. Furthermore, the animals' multi-odor sensing performance has lasted for 45 days, indicating long-term stability of the learned multi-odor discrimination. These findings demonstrate that multi-odor discrimination can be achieved by rat sniffing, potentially providing insight into the rapid, accurate and cost-effective multi-odor monitoring in the lung cancer and diabetes.

AB  - Silica-gelatin hybrid aerogel of 24 wt% gelatin content is an advanced functional material suitable for the high performance selective adsorption of aqueous Hg(II). The remediation efficacy of this adsorbent was tested under realistic aquatic conditions by exposing cultures of Paramecium caudatum to Hg(II) and monitoring the model cultures by time-lapse video microscopy. The viability of Paramecium was quantified by analyzing the pixel differences of the sequential images caused by the persistent movement (motility) of the cells. The viability of Paramecium displays a clear exposure-response relationship with Hg(II) concentration. Viability decreases with increasing Hg(II) concentration when the latter is higher than 125 mu g L-1. In the presence of 0.1 mg mL(-1) aerogel adsorbent, the viability of the cells decreases only at Hg(II) concentrations higher than 500 mu g L-1, and 220 min survival time was measured even at 1000 mu g L-1 Hg(II). The effective toxicity of Hg(II) is lower in the presence of the aerogel, because the equilibrium concentration of aqueous Hg(II) is low due to adsorption, thus Paramecium cells do not uptake as much Hg(II) as in the un-remediated cultures.

AB  - Lichens occupy diverse substrates across tremendous ranges of environmental variation. In boreal forests, lichen communities co-occur in 'strata' defined by terrestrial or arboreal substrates, but these strata may or may not be interchangeable as bioindicators. Do co-occurring lichen strata have similar community structures and environmental responses? Could one stratum serve as a proxy for the other? We assessed variation in species richness and community compositions between ground-layer versus epiphyte-layer lichen strata in boreal forests and peatlands of interior Alaska. Species richness was lower and more spatially structured in the ground layer than the epiphyte layer. Richness of strata was not correlated. The most compositionally unique ground-layer communities were species-poor but contained regionally rare species not common in other plots. Variation in community compositions (ordination scores) were not congruent between strata (Procrustes congruence < 0.16 on 0-1 scale); the largest departures from congruence occurred where ground layers were species-poor. The best predictors of ground-layer community compositions were hydrological and topographic, whereas epiphytes were most associated with macroclimate and tree abundances. We conclude that lichens on different substrates 'move in different circles': compositional gradients did not agree and the environmental gradients most important to each lichen stratum were not the same. The conditions which strongly influence one vegetation stratum may have little bearing upon another. As global changes modify habitats, an incremental change in environment may lead community trajectories to diverge among lichen strata.

AB  - Visual pollution (VP) in the form of outdoor advertisements (OA) is a threat to landscape physiognomy. Despite their proven usefulness in landscape aesthetic studies, landscape metrics have not yet been applied to address the phenomenon of VP. To fill this knowledge gap, a methodological framework for the measurement of VP using tangential view landscape metrics is proposed, which is accompanied by statistically significant proofs. Raster products derived from aerial laser scanning data were used to characterize two study areas with different topographic conditions in the city of Lublin, East Poland. The visibility of the cityscape in motion was simulated through viewshed measurements taken at equal intervals in the forwards and backwards directions along pedestrian walkways. The scrutinized tangential view landscape metrics (visible area, maximum visible distance, skyline, Shannon depth, view depth line) was the object of a two-fold interpretation wherein the spatial occurrence of VP as well as its impacts on the visual landscape character (VLC) were examined. The visible area metrics were found to be highly sensitive VP indicators. The maximum visible distance metrics provided evidence for the destructive effect of OA on view corridors. The Shannon depth and depth line metrics were not found to be statistically significant indicators of VP. Results from directional viewshed modelling indicate that distortion in the analyzed cityscape physiognomy depends on the view direction. The findings allow for particular recommendations with practical implementations in land use planning, which are discussed along with limitations to our proposed methods.

AB  - Projected changes in the frequency and severity of climatic events are expected to negatively affect wheat yields. India being the sub-continent reflects all global climatic conditions is greatly prone to micro climatic changes. In this scenario, there is an exigency to relook into our abiotic hotspot centres for their consistency to use them for wheat germplasm screening. The present study is a first of its kind to analyze the status of drought and heat stress hotspots for wheat screening in India. We developed a unique analytical approach considering 11 years daily weather variables (indicators) like maximum and minimum temperature, maximum and minimum humidity and rainfall to re-prioritize the experimental locations according to their stress intensity index. The principal component analysis based indexing revealed that some of the locations like Dharwad, Indore, Pune and Parbhani are maintaining high stress intensity and a few centres like Kanpur, Faizabad and Malda are having lower stress intensity. Interestingly, Ranchi, a centre which was not recognized much as a hotspot earlier, but over years started to experience high drought stress in the recent decade. The study also indicates that the changes in minimum humidity have contributed significantly for the stress intensity. The outcome of the study will help researchers in prioritizing the experimental sites for screening wheat under heat and drought stress, in limited resource scenario and also to understand the micro environmental changes.

AB  - Exposure assessment of pesticides has substantially improved over time, with methods that now include a combination of advanced analytical techniques and fate/transport models to evaluate their spatiotemporal distribution. However, the current regulatory environmental risk assessment considers thresholds from laboratory studies completed under standardized conditions that do not reflect environmental dynamics. Using the General Unified Threshold model for Survival (GUTS) model framework, we predicted the impact of time-varying pesticide exposures on the survival of gammarids in a small agricultural stream. The LP50 values were used as an additional metric for assessing risks (defined in GUTS as a multiplication factor applied to the concentration time series to induce 50% mortality by the end of exposure). Although real-case exposures to individual pesticides were predicted to produce little to no impact on survival, the LP50 values indicate acute (LP50 <= 100) and/or chronic (LP50 <= 10) toxicities for azoxystrobin, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and imidacloprid, while risk to propiconazole exposure was considered very low (LP50 >> 100). Finally, the model was extended to reflect mixture toxicity via concentration addition. It predicted risks under acute and chronic exposures to organophosphates and neonicotinoids. Given that gammarids are simultaneously exposed to multiple chemicals and other stressors throughout their lifetime, a decline in survival probabilities due to chemical stress can likely influence their overall fitness. We recognize that some assumptions require validation, but our work included a level of realism that can assist risk managers when evaluating the cumulative consequences of chemical exposure.

AB  - BackgroundTelemetry applied to aquatic organisms has recently developed greatly. Physiological sensors have been increasingly used as tools for fish welfare monitoring. However, for the technology to be used as a reliable welfare indicator, it is important that the tagging procedure does not disrupt fish physiology, behaviour and performance. In this communication, we share our medium-term data on stress physiological profile and growth performance after surgical tag implantation in two important marine fish species for European aquaculture, the sea bream (Sparus aurata) and the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax).ResultsBlood samples after surgical tag implantation (46 days for the sea bream and 95 days for the sea bass) revealed no differences between tagged and untagged fish in cortisol, glucose and lactate levels, suggesting that the tag implantation does not induce prolonged stress in these species. Moreover, the specific growth rates were similar in the tagged and untagged fish of both species.ConclusionSurgical tag implantation does not have medium-term consequences for the stress physiology and growth performance of these two marine fish species in a controlled environment. These observations support the use of accelerometer tags as valuable tools for welfare monitoring in aquaculture conditions. This study also shows that tagged fish can be sampled during experiments and considered a representative portion of the population, as they display growth and physiological parameters comparable to those of untagged fish.

AB  - To fight invasion of Spartina alterniflora and conserve biodiversity of migratory shorebirds, several S. alterniflora marshes and bare mudflats have been restored back to Scirpus mariqueter marshes in the Yangtze River estuary in recent years. Although it is known that changes in plant cover in salt marshes alters the physical environment, findings on its effects on benthic communities are inconsistent and site-specific. In the present study, we tested how ciliates were influenced by a recent restoration. Ciliated protozoa play a key role in wetland benthic food webs and are useful bioindicators. We investigated 3 habitats: restored S. mariqueter meadow, S. alterniflora-invaded meadow, and bare mudflats, where we quantified environmental conditions, community composition (species and traits), and 3 aspects of biodiversity (classic, taxonomic, and functional diversity) over 4 seasons. CAP and ANOSIM were used to determine the differences among samples, while RDA and GLMs were used to reveal potential driving factors. We found that, although changes in the type of vegetation due to restoration or invasion significantly modified the sediment properties and ciliate species composition, it had limited influence on functional trait composition as well as on diversity, especially on functional diversity. These results indicate that the conversion of mudflats to S. mariqueter meadow did not affect ciliate community functions at the time scale of this study. However, biomonitoring based on microbenthic communities should be included when evaluating the long-term success of coastal wetland restoration.

AB  - Trace fossils are sensitive indicators for environmental parameters (e.g., hydrodynamics, oxygen content, water depth, depositional rates, salinity), providing invaluable information to understand past depositional regimes not attainable from other sources of approaches. Here we report a new trace fossil assemblage dominated by a potential bivalve trace Parahaentzschelinia from the Lower Permian Snapper Point Formation, which records deposition in a storm-influenced delta front environment. Dense populations of Parahaenrzschelinia occurred in two sections, forming stacked Parahaentzschelinia ichnofabrics and representing multiple burrow adjustments of a single trace maker (tellinid bivalve) subsequent to rapid sedimentation events caused by possible seasonal/annual runoffs. Statistical analysis of burrow lengths and numbers of adjustments suggests up to seven sequences of sediment accumulation events, supplying 3-13 cm thick clastic deposits at each time. A conservative sedimentation rate of 0.24 cm/year was estimated on the basis of two stacked Parahaentzschelinia ichnofabrics and the probable maximum lifespan of the modern tellinid genus. This rate is generally comparable to those derived from modem deltaic environments, lending further support to the interpretation that the ichnofabrics were formed in and characteristic of a deltaic setting. Our research highlights the utility of stacked equilibrium structures as a sensitive indicator of certain depositional regimes, and its applicability for assessing sedimentation rates as well as depositional conditions in the geological past.

AB  - Arthropods, within the olive tree canopy, which can act as bioindicators of different management systems (conventional, integrated and organic), were collected in costal Croatia during 2007-2009. The aim of the research was to determine the arthropod orders present in each of the observed olive groves, to identify the number of individuals in each order, and to set potential bioindicators of different management systems. In order to do that, arthropods were collected from the olive canopies at three locations (Supetar, Kastel Stari and Duilovo). After the samples were sorted according to orders, and determined according to arthropods determination keys. Olive groves were characterised by the same growth conditions and environment, with differences in agricultural management systems. In this investigation, 7882 arthropods were collected, belonging to 17 orders. It was found that Diptera, Heteroptera and other Hemiptera individuals, excluded Cicadidae and Psyllidae family individuals, could be defined as potential bioindicators of olive groves under different management systems. The number of Araneae and Coleoptera individuals significantly differed in all researched olive groves. So, these orders can be considered as bioindicators of different management systems. The knowledge obtained in this research can potentially be exploited in olive production in the future. Obtained results represent an important contribution to the inventory of arthropods in olive canopy. Also, this research significantly improves understanding of both harmful and beneficial entomofauna in olive groves and consequently contributes to better understanding of the total entomofauna in Croatia.

AB  - New benzimidazolium salts 1a-c and their palladium bis-N-heterocyclic carbene complexes 2a-c and palladium PEPPSI-type complexes 3a-c were designed, synthesized and structurally characterized by NMR (H-1 and C-13), IR, DART-TOF mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Then these complexes 2-3 were employed in the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of substituted arenes with phenylboronic acid under mild conditions in toluene and DMF/H2O (1/1) to afford functionalized biaryl derivatives in good to excellent yields. The antibacterial activity of palladium bis-N-heterocyclic carbene complexes 2a-c and palladium PEPPSI-type complexes 3a-c was measured by disc diffusion method against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Compounds 2a, 2c and 3a-c exhibited potential antibacterial activity against four bacterial species among the five used indicator cells. The product 2b inhibits the growth of the all five tested microorganisms. Moreover, the antioxidant activity determination of these complexes 2-3, using 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as a reagent, showed that compounds 2a-c and 3b possess DPPH antiradical activity. The higher antioxidant activity was obtained from the product 2b which has radical scavenging activity comparable to that of the two used positive controls (gallic acid GA and tutylatedhydroxytoluene BHT). Investigation of the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of the studied complexes showed that compounds 2b, 3a, and 3b exhibited moderate activity at 100 g/mL and product 2b is the most active.

AB  - The normal operation of gear systems ensures the power transmission in coal cutters. Due to harsh work environment, the gears in coal cutters are prone to crack. By analyzing the gear dynamic response, useful crack detection indicators could be obtained. The literature review indicates that most of the gear dynamic models have been built with single-frequency excitation, but very limited work has considered multi-frequency excitations. The coal cutter gear systems are always subjected to multi-frequency excitations. Hence, a nonlinear gear dynamic model taking multi-frequency excitations into account was established in this work. A meshing stiffness coefficient was defined to model the crack fault influence on the gear model. The amplitude-frequency of the model main resonance was analyzed by means of multi-scale method, and the model dynamic response was calculated by the incremental harmonic balance method. Numerical simulation results show that the dynamic response of the presented gear model provided strong chaotic characteristics and the chaotic degree of the gear dynamics increased with the deterioration of the crack level. Experimental validation was carried out on a real gearbox, and the analysis results were consistent with the simulations. Hence, the simulation and experimental analysis demonstrates that the multi-frequency excitation-based gear dynamic model was more correct than the single-frequency excitation-based model in representing the system dynamics.

AB  - Drought stress is one of the most important environmental factors that adversely affect the productivity and quality of crops. Most studies focus on elucidating plant responses to this stress but the reversibility of these effects is less known. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether drought-stressed peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) plants were capable of recovering their metabolism upon rehydration, with a focus on their antioxidant system. Peanut plants in the flowering phase (30 days after sowing) were exposed to drought stress by withholding irrigation during 14 days and subsequent rehydration during 3 days. Under these conditions, physiological status indicators, reactive oxygen species production and antioxidant system activity were evaluated. Under drought stress, the stomatal conductance, photosynthetic quantum yield and C-13:C-12 ratio of the peanut plants were negatively affected, and also they accumulated reactive oxygen species. The antioxidant system of peanut plants showed increases in superoxide dismutase-, ascorbate peroxidase- and glutathione reductase-specific activities, as well as the total ascorbate content. All of these responses were reversed upon rehydration at 3 days. The efficient and dynamic regulation of variables related to photosynthesis and the antioxidant system during a drought and rehydration cycle in peanut plants was demonstrated. It is suggested that the activation of the antioxidant system could mediate the signalling of drought stress responses that enable the plant to survive and recover completely within 3 days of rehydration.

AB  - Sustained and coordinated vaccination efforts have brought polio eradication within reach. Anticipating the eradication of wild poliovirus (WPV) and the subsequent challenges in preventing its re-emergence, we look to the past to identify why polio rose to epidemic levels in the mid-20th century, and how WPV persisted over large geographic scales. We analyzed an extensive epidemiological dataset, spanning the 1930s to the 1950s and spatially replicated across each state in the United States, to glean insight into the drivers of polio's historical expansion and the ecological mode of its persistence prior to vaccine introduction. We document a latitudinal gradient in polio's seasonality. Additionally, we fitted and validated mechanistic transmission models to data from each US state independently. The fitted models revealed that: (1) polio persistence was the product of a dynamic mosaic of source and sink populations; (2) geographic heterogeneity of seasonal transmission conditions account for the latitudinal structure of polio epidemics; (3) contrary to the prevailing "disease of development" hypothesis, our analyses demonstrate that polio's historical expansion was straightforwardly explained by demographic trends rather than improvements in sanitation and hygiene; and (4) the absence of clinical disease is not a reliable indicator of polio transmission, because widespread polio transmission was likely in the multiyear absence of clinical disease. As the world edges closer to global polio eradication and continues the strategic withdrawal of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), the regular identification of, and rapid response to, these silent chains of transmission is of the utmost importance.

AB  - The contaminant release from estuarine sediment due to pH changes was investigated using a modified CEN/TS 14429 pH-dependence leaching test. The test is performed in the range of pH values of 0-14 using deionised water and seawater as leaching solutions. The experimental conditions mimic different circumstances of the marine environment due to the global acidification, carbon dioxide (CO2) leakages from carbon capture and sequestration technologies, and accidental chemical spills in seawater. Leaching test results using seawater as leaching solution show a better neutralisation capacity giving slightly lower metal leaching concentrations than when using deionised water. The contaminated sediment shows a low base-neutralisation capacity (BNCpH 12 = -0.44 eq/kg for deionised water and BNCpH 12 = -1.38 eq/kg for seawater) but a high acid-neutralisation capacity when using deionised water (ANC(pH 4) = 3.58 eq/kg) and seawater (ANC(pH 4) = 3.97 eq/kg). Experimental results are modelled with the Visual MINTEQ geochemical software to predict metal release from sediment using both leaching liquids. Surface adsorption to iron- and aluminium-(hydr)oxides was applied for all studied elements. The consideration of the metal-organic matter binding through the NICA-Donnan model and Stockholm Humic Model for lead and copper, respectively, improves the former metal release prediction. Modelled curves can be useful for the environmental impact assessment of seawater acidification due to its match with the experimental values.

AB  - The development of synthetic nanopores and nanochannels that mimick ion channels in living organisms for biosensing applications has been, and still remains, a great challenge. Although the biological applications of nanopores and nanochannels have achieved considerable development as a result of nanotechnology advancements, there are few reports of a facile way to realize those applications. Herein, a nanochannel-based electrochemical platform was developed for the quantitative detection of biorelated small molecules such as potassium ions (K+) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in a facile way. For this purpose, K+ or ATP G-quadruplex aptamers were covalently assembled onto the inner wall of porous anodic alumina (PAA) nanochannels through a Schiff reaction between -CHO groups in the aptamer and amino groups on the inner wall of the PAA nanochannels under mild reaction conditions. Conformational switching of the aptamers confined in the nanochannels occurs in the presence of the target molecules, resulting in increased steric hindrance in the nanochannels. Changes in steric hindrance in the nanochannels were monitored by the anodic current of indicator molecules transported through the nanochannels. As a result, quantitative detection of K+ and ATP was realized with a concentration ranging from 0.005 to 1.0 mM for K+ and 0.05 to 10.0 mM for ATP. The proposed platform displayed significant selectivity, good reproducibility, and universality. Moreover, this platform showed its potential for use in the detection of other aptamer-based analytes, which could promote its development for use in biological detection and clinical diagnosis.

AB  - We investigated the formation mechanisms of rounded clast-cortex aggregates, a composite grain found in the slipping zones of faults hosted in calcite- and clay-rich rocks. The natural aggregates contain a central clast commonly made of host-rock fragments or reworked cataclasite from the slipping zone. The central clasts are surrounded by an outer cortex of calcite or clay grains a few mu m or less in size. In laboratory experiments on calcite gouges using two rotary-shear apparatus we investigated the dependence of clast-cortex aggregate formation on the applied slip rate, normal stress, total displacement and ambient humidity. Clast-cortex aggregates formed at all investigated slip rates (100 mu m/s to 1 m/s) but only at relatively low normal stresses (<= 5 MPa). The aggregates were better developed with increasing displacement (up to 5 m) and did not form in experiments with water-dampened gouges. In the experiments, aggregates formed in low-strain regions within the gouge layers, adjacent to the highest-strain slip zones. We propose that clast-cortex aggregates in calcite-bearing slip zones form in the shallow portions of faults during shearing in relatively dry conditions, but our experiments suggest that they cannot be used as indicators of seismic slip. Formation involves clast rotation due to granular flow accompanied by accretion of fine matrix material possibly facilitated by electrostatic forces. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data from the Central German variety trials was evaluated, to with the Silage maize Ripeness-Index (SRI) the off-ripe-specific type in its significance and impact on selected parameters of the quality, the yield of silage and energy maize, as well as the appropriate feeding of ruminants with rations of higher maize proportions.
   The characterization of the ripe type on the basis of SRI is closely associated with statements to maize ripening, reproducibility of variety performance, site suitability and environmental conditions of production in the context of the Dynamic Ripening and Analysis system (DRA).
   The environmental stability of maize varieties characterizes the type of variety that exerts a dominant role over the ripeness level on the production of silage maize. The difference between type and productivity as well as feed value was demonstrated.
   For a location and physiological ruminant feeding of maize in relation to the type are been conclusions in the field of plant health, ground feeding uptake, structure impact and physiological grain hardness.
   As a result of this evaluation a comprehensive advantage of the environment stable variety type with slow ripening maize (residual) plant is to determine which cannot be evidenced and used with the present system of ripeness of use-specific classification.

AB  - Research was conducted at 28-30 sites within eight study areas across the United States along a gradient of nutrient enrichment/agricultural land use between 2003 and 2007. Objectives were to test the application of an agricultural intensity index (AG-Index) and compare among various invertebrate and algal metrics to determine indicators of nutrient enrichment nationally and within three regions. The agricultural index was based on total nitrogen and phosphorus input to the watershed, percent watershed agriculture, and percent riparian agriculture. Among data sources, agriculture within riparian zone showed significant differences among values generated from remote sensing or from higher resolution orthophotography; median values dropped significantly when estimated by orthophotography. Percent agriculture in the watershed consistently had lower correlations to invertebrate and algal metrics than the developed AG-Index across all regions. Percent agriculture showed fewer pairwise comparisons that were significant than the same comparisons using the AG-Index. Highest correlations to the AG-Index regionally were 0.75 for Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera richness (EPTR) and 0.70 for algae Observed/Expected (O/E), nationally the highest was 0.43 for EPTR vs. total nitrogen and 0.62 for algae O/E vs. AG-Index. Results suggest that analysis of metrics at national scale can often detect large differences in disturbance, but more detail and specificity is obtained by analyzing data at regional scales.

AB  - Oxidative stress is one of the major causes of damage in plants exposed to different types of environmental stress, including heavy metals. Accumulation of heavy metals in plants can disrupt many cellular functions and plant growth. To assess the contribution of oxidative stress to heavy metal toxicity in plants, young sweetpotato plants (Ipomoea batatas) were treated with increasing concentrations of Cd. Cu and Zn, and grown in half Murashige and Skoog nutrient solution culture. Plant growth was significantly inhibited and internal metal content was increased in a dose-dependent manner for each metal. The generation of H2O2 in leaves and fibrous roots correlated positively with metal dose. The specific activity of peroxidases (PODS) in fibrous roots was markedly enhanced by metal treatment, whereas in leaves, activity was low and only slightly affected by metal treatment. Analysis of 13 POD genes revealed differential expression of PODs in response to heavy metals. Several genes for acidic PODs (swpa2, swpa3 and swpa4) and basic PODs (swpb1, swpb3 and swpab4) were strongly expressed under all metal treatment conditions in leaves or fibrous roots. The expression of swpa1 was increased in leaves and fibrous roots by Cd and Cu treatment, whereas swpb5 expression was reduced by all metals in fibrous roots. These results indicate that increased H2O2 levels in response to heavy metal stress are closely linked to an improved antioxidant defense capability mediated by POD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Among the traits of breeding interest for the common walnut tree Juglans regia L., characteristics such as timing of budbreak and leaf fall, water-use efficiency and growth performance are regarded as being of utmost relevance in Mediterranean conditions.
   The authors evaluated intraspecific variation in delta C-13 (carbon isotope composition, surrogate of intrinsic water-use efficiency, WUEi) for 22 J. regia families grown in a progeny test under supplementary irrigation, and investigated whether such variation correlated with climatic indicators of native habitats. The genetic relationships between delta C-13, growth and phenology were also assessed during two consecutive years.
   Overall, the most water-use-efficient families (i.e. with higher delta C-13), which originated mainly from drought-prone provenance regions which have a high vapour pressure deficit and low rainfall, exhibited less height growth and smaller DBH. Using a stepwise regression procedure, delta C-13 was included as the main explanatory variable of genotypic variation in growth traits, together with growing season duration (for DBH in both years) and flushing (for height in 2007).
   It was concluded that WUEi is largely unconnected to phenology effects in the explanation of growth performance for J. regia, therefore suggesting the opportunity of simultaneously selecting for low WUEi and extended growing period to maximise productivity in non-water-limited environments.

AB  - L-Ascorbate (the reduced form of vitamin C) participates in diverse biological processes including pathogen defence mechanisms, and the modulation of plant growth and morphology, and also acts as an enzyme cofactor and redox status indicator. One of its chief biological functions is as an antioxidant. L-Ascorbate intake has been implicated in the prevention/alleviation of varied human ailments and diseases including cancer. To study the regulation of accumulation of this important nutraceutical in fruit, the expression of 24 tomato (Solanum lycopersicon) genes involved in the biosynthesis, oxidation, and recycling of L-ascorbate during the development and ripening of fruit have been characterized. Taken together with L-ascorbate abundance data, the results show distinct changes in the expression profiles for these genes, implicating them in nodal regulatory roles during the process of L-ascorbate accumulation in tomato fruit. The expression of these genes was further studied in the context of abiotic and post-harvest stress, including the effects of heat, cold, wounding, oxygen supply, and ethylene. Important aspects of the hypoxic and post-anoxic response in tomato fruit are discussed. The data suggest that L-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase could play an important role in regulating ascorbic acid accumulation during tomato fruit development and ripening.

AB  - This study of environmental equity uses secondary quantitative data to analyze socioeconomic disparities in environmental conditions in the Rijnmond region of the Netherlands. The disparities of selected environmental indicators-exposure to traffic noise (road, rail, and air), NO2, external safety risks, and the availability of public green space-are analyzed both separately and in combination. Not only exposures to environmental burdens ("bads") were investigated, but also access to environmental benefits ("goods"). Additionally, we held interviews and reviewed documents to grasp the mechanisms underlying the environmental equity situation, with an emphasis on the role of public policy. Environmental equity is not a priority in public policy for the greater Rotterdam region known as the Rijnmond region, yet environmental standards have been established to provide a minimum environmental quality to all local residents. In general, environmental quality has improved in this region, and the accumulation of negative environmental outcomes ("bads") has been limited. However, environmental standards for road traffic noise and NO2 are being exceeded, probably because of the pressure on space and the traffic intensity. We found an association of environmental "bads" with income for rail traffic noise and availability of public green space. In the absence of regulation, positive environmental outcomes ("goods") are mainly left up to market forces. Consequently, higher-income groups generally have more access to environmental "goods" than lower-income groups.

AB  - Although species reintroduction is useful as both an integral part and a performance indicator of habitat restoration, it is not a risk-free process. Evaluation of potential reintroduction sites is often crucially important in reducing chances of failure. Despite its importance, there is no standard way to do so. This study applied a systematic scheme to evaluate five potential reintroduction sites for the endangered Karner Blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis Nabokov) in Ontario, Canada, by looking at both biotic and abiotic aspects. Field data were collected in 2003 from these sites, and three potential founder butterfly sites in the United States. We used data collected from the U.S. sites to determine the minimum standards for ecological requirements of the Karner Blue. Data from the Ontario sites were then compared against these standards. The results show that all five potential reintroduction sites are of lower quality, at least in certain aspects, compared with the three potential founder butterfly sites. This implies that success is not guaranteed if the Karner Blue is reintroduced into these sites under current habitat conditions. Further site restoration is required and should focus on the shortcomings identified for individual sites in this study. The lessons from this study are useful for potential reintroduction site assessment in other restoration projects because they reveal whether the sites are ready for species reintroduction and, if not, how they need to be improved.

AB  - Nitrogen amendment based on soil mineral N content before planting is unreliable in humid regions. A field experiment was conducted for 3 yr to (i) determine the appropriate rates and timing of N applications in the humid environment of eastern Ontario, Canada (45 degrees 23' N, 75 degrees 43' W); (ii) evaluate the ability of nondestructive plant-based methods compared with presidedress soil nitrate concentration test in discriminating fertilization N rates near sidedress time; and (iii) document how yearly variations in environmental conditions affect the ability of different approaches to assess corn (Zea mays L.) N status. Two hybrids were grown under eight combinations of rates and timing of N application in a factorial experiment. Leaf greenness and canopy reflectance were simultaneously measured from the V5 to V8 stages and at three occasions thereafter. Plant total N and soil available N (NO3- and NH4+) at V6 were analyzed. Relationships of parameters Collected early in the growing season vs. grain yield, harvest index, and total plant N uptake at maturity were determined. In 2 yr (2000 and 2002), grain yields increased significantly with fertilizer rates up to 120 kg N ha(-1). While soil mineral N and plant N concentrations differentiated 0 N from preplant N at 40 kg N ha(-1), both leaf chlorophyll and canopy reflectance measured at V6 stage responded linearly to fertilizer N up to 120 kg N ha(-1). We concluded that these leaf and canopy optical measurements could be used as crop-based indicators for early-season N amendment.

AB  - The alga Klebsormidium flaccidum from the Moroccan desert was studied using the measurement of the Fluorescence Temperature Curve - FTC (a dependence of chlorophyll fluorescence Intensity on linearly increasing temperature) during the cell cycle. The green alga was cultivated at an alternating temperature regime (35 degreesC - light/5 degreesC - dark) simulating natural desert conditions, or at a constant temperature (20 degreesC). Pronounced reversible changes in FTC were detected during the diurnal cycle with alga cultivated at alternating temperatures. The critical temperature (T-C) of the steep fluorescence rise up to the FTC maximum (the M1 maximum) and the temperature of the M1 FTC maximum (T-P), which are usually used as the indicators of photosystem II. (PSII) thermostability, gradually Increased by about 2.5 degreesC during the light phase. The ratio of the height of M1 FTC maximum to the fluorescence Intensity at 30 degreesC (M1/F(T30) ratio), usually reflecting PSII photochemistry, also significantly increased during the light phase of the diurnal cycle. However, the changes in the parameters corresponded with changes in the slope of the fluorescence rise to the M1 FTC maximum, and with changing temperature dependence of the maximal fluorescence - F-M. Analysis of the data led to the conclusion that the change in the T-C parameter and the M1/F(T30) ratio need not merely reflect the changes in the PSII thermostability and PSII photochemistry, respectively. The causes of these discrepancies are discussed.

KW  - SYSTEMS
AB  - A method for assessing and implementing sustainable crop production is needed to give practical relevance to the frequently used term "sustainable agriculture", The objective of this paper is to present such a theoretical procedure. Therefore the terms "sustainability" and "sustainable crop production" are discussed and defined. On the basis of the definitions, an eight-step procedure for assessing and implementing sustainable crop production is outlined. The steps are (1) identify emissions and other releases linked to different crop production practices. (2) trace each different release from its source (the crop management practice) to its sinks (i.e., agroecosystems and other ecosystems or components of ecosystems directly or indirectly affected by these releases). (3) select indicators that adequately describe the condition of the ecosystem affected directly or indirectly by crop production practices, (4) determine threshold values for the selected ecosystem indicators (i.e., values which should not be exceeded if irreversible changes in the affected ecosystems are to be avoided), (5) transpose the ecosystem threshold values to the farm level by retracing the impact pathways (from Step 2) backward to crop production itself, (6) derive farm-level indicators that point to separate or combined agronomic practices that could cause irreversible changes in affected ecosystems, (7) determine farm-level threshold values for management-induced releases on the basis of ecosystem level threshold values, and (8) identify production schemes that adhere to the framework set by the farm-level thresholds. From these production schemes the farmer can select those most in line with his available resources and objectives.

AB  - We present a new model for the evolution of volcanic table mountains, based on volcanological and petrological studies of Herdubreid/Herdubreidartogl, an upper Pleistocene volcanic complex within the active Icelandic rift zone. The evolution of these table mountains is highly complex and influenced substantially by different eruptive environments as well as changing magma sources and volcanic and magmatic processes. Whereas current models imply entirely subglacial conditions and continuous compositional (''monogenetic'') evolution for these volcanoes, we subdivide their evolution into four eruptive periods characterized by different environments: (a) Subaerial lava flows erupted during an interglacial period. (b) Lavas and voluminous hydroclastic deposits formed in a lake during a waning period of the last glaciation. (c) Subglacial eruptions during thickening of the ice sheet as a result of a climatic deterioration built pillow lava piles overlain by steep-sided complexes of hydroclastic deposits. These deposits differ from those of the second eruptive period in structure, texture, and degree of alteration. Subaerial lava flows and agglutinates covered these deposits after buildup above the ice sheet. (d) Subaerial lava flows and fallout deposits during a postglacial period. The detailed analysis of volcanic table mountains appears to be a very sensitive indicator of climatic fluctuations. Although most deposits of the studied volcanoes were formed during the waning period of the last glaciation, the subglacial deposits in the upper part of the volcanic complex reflect a temporary, but major, thickening of the ice sheet.

TI  - RED-CLOVER SEED PRODUCTION .3. EFFECT OF FORAGE REMOVAL TIME UNDER VARIED ENVIRONMENTS
T2  - CROP SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) grown for seed in western Oregon must have the forage removed in spring so that flowering and seed maturation nili be more uniform. There is Little available information that describes the effects of time of forage removal on red clover seed production. This study was conducted to determine (i) the effects of time of forage removal on seed production of red clover grown under a range of common environmental conditions found in western Oregon and (ii) whether any crop phenological or environmental indicators can be used to describe optimal forage removal time. Twelve different experimental locations per year were established in 1990 and 1991 in commercial red clover seed production fields throughout a six-county area in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Forage was removed once per treatment and there were seven forage removal time treatments from early May to late June. Red clover seed yields are dependent on a relationship with the number of accumulated heat units (HUs) at the time of forage removal. The average HU optimum (199 HUs) is not exact for all sites, but can be adjusted for the estimated combined effects of factors that influence the relative productivity of each site. Relatively low yielding sites should have forage removal time advanced relative to the HU optimum, and high yielding sites should have forage removal time delayed. Also, named improved cultivars were not as sensitive to time of forage removal as are Oregon-adapted ecotypes. Forage removal time is a critical factor that needs to be considered to achieve maximal seed yields.

AB  - This article deliberates the processes, principles, and rules relevant to forest-sector climate change mitigation and adaptation in light of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of the Paris Agreement (PA). We tackle such issues as targets and indicators, scope and information needs of forest-sector actions, progress tracking, stock taking, anthropogenic testing, carbon (C) accounting, and jurisdictional governance. Along the way, we also offer our perspectives of and solutions to some of the problems likely to be encountered in implementing the PA. We note that a Party must possess consecutive inventories for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals to determine, communicate, and update its NDC. While there is little concern over the availability of GHG emission inventories, there remain gaps between the available information and what is needed for accounting forest-based actions. Improved measurement and monitoring is needed if the Party desires to include the C pools as part of the offsetting credits in its NDC accounting. Also, the jurisdictional governance means that actions taken by subnational and other entities should be nested within the NDC. As to the results-based payments scheme for REDD+, it will take time to be carried out at scale, because of the challenge of determining the baseline of an action and the failure to deliver the promised finance. Finally, Parties must do more to maintain and improve their forest conditions to shore up the significance and sustainability of forest-sector actions.

AB  - The present investigation demonstrates the synergistic action of using a sedimentation unit together with Cyperus papyrus (L.) wetland enriched with zeolite mineral in one-year round experiment for treating wastewater. The system was designed to support a horizontal surface flow pattern and showed satisfactory removal efficiencies for both physicochemical and bacteriological contaminants within 3 days of residence time. The removal efficiencies ranged between 76.3% and 98.8% for total suspended solids, turbidity, iron, biological oxygen demand, and ammonia. The bacterial indicators (total and fecal coliforms, as well as fecal streptococci) and the potential pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) showed removal efficiencies ranged between 96.9% and 99.8%. We expect the system to offer a smart management for every component according to zero waste principle. The treated effluent was reused to irrigate the landscape of pilot area, and the excess sludge was recycled as fertilizer and soil conditioner. The zeolite mineral did not require regeneration for almost 36 weeks of operation, and enhanced the density of shoots (14.11%) and the height of shoots (15.88%). The harvested plant biomass could be a profitable resource for potent antibacterial and antioxidant bioactive compounds. This could certainly offset part of the operation and maintenance costs and optimize the system implementation feasibility. Although the experiment was designed under local conditions, its results could provide insights to upgrade and optimize the performance of other analogous large-scale constructed wetlands.

AB  - While the bicycle is commonly understood as a suitable alternative to fulfil most of urban mobility needs, adoption rates of this transport mode vary considerably among urban areas. Those at early stages of adoption, identified as starter cycling cities, face numerous challenges, reducing the effectiveness of policies and strategies. Much research has been dedicated at identifying social and physical environment conditions favouring the use of the bicycle. Assuming cycling potential results of a good combination of physical and socio-demographic factors, we set out to identify dominant contexts generating high levels of cycling potential. The previously developed Gross Potential for Cycling is applied to 21 Portuguese municipalities of different spatial contexts. By looking at the particularities of different typologies of urban territories, a set of k-means clustering analyses investigates which combination of factors contribute to the establishment of a high cycling potential. The results indicate that, in the set of case studies, high accessibility to schools and urban centralities are common in high cycling potential areas, regardless of spatial context. Three clusters were identified from the combination of the age profile of residents and the connectivity features of the territory, defining the main typologies of high cycling potential areas. As different urban typologies pose distinct configurations on the performance of the different evaluated indicators, these outcomes are crucial to inform policy makers on where to prioritize investment for the establishment of a new cycling culture.

AB  - The Korean government is currently evaluating two alternatives, direct disposal and pyroprocessing, for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel. This paper presents the ranking results of comparing and evaluating direct disposal and pyro-SFR fuel cycle alternatives using multi-criteria decision-making methods such as AHP, TOPSIS, and PROMETHEE. In considering the various evaluation criteria involved in these two alternatives, we aimed to determine the optimal choice in terms of the economic and social conditions of Korea. The evaluation criteria considered were safety, resource availability, environmental impact, economics, nuclear proliferation resistance, and public acceptance. The results show that the pyro-SFR fuel cycle alternative is more advantageous than direct disposal in the AHP and TOPSIS methods, whereas direct disposal is more advantageous in the PROMETHEE method because the ranking is reversed. TOPSIS assigns the ideal value and the most negative value among the input values to each criterion as a parameter reflecting the concept of distance between the best alternative and the worst alternative. In contrast, the PROMETHEE method first selects the preference function including the preference threshold, and calculates the preferred outflow and the preferred inflow for the detailed evaluation indicators. Therefore, differences exist in the methodologies of multi-criteria decision making. Nonetheless, the analysis results of the back-end fuel cycle option can greatly contribute to establishing a nuclear policy for the back-end nuclear fuel cycle, and these efforts will enable sustainable nuclear power generation.

AB  - In the interests of the environment, many countries set limits on the use of non-renewable energy sources and promote renewable energy sources through policy and legislation. Consequently, the demand for components for renewable energy systems exhibits an upward trend. For this reason, managers, investors, and banks are interested in knowing whether investing in a business associated with the semiconductor and related device manufacturing sector, especially the photovoltaic (PV) systems manufacturers, is worthy of a penny. Using a sample for the period of 2015-2018, we apply a new approach to panel data, extending existing research using Classification Trees with the k-Nearest Neighbor and Altman model. Our aim is to analyze the financial conditions of enterprises to identify key indicators that distinguish companies producing PV system components (labeled "green, G") from companies that do not manufacture PV components ("red, R"). Our results show that green companies can be distinguished from red companies at classification accuracies of 86% and 90% for CRT and CHAID algorithms in Classification Trees method and 93% for k-Nearest Neighbor method, respectively. Based on the Altman model and the analysis of crucial ratios, we also find that green businesses are characterized by lower financial performance although future ratio values may equal or exceed the values for the red companies if current upward trends are sustained. Therefore, investing in green companies presents a viable alternative.

AB  - Worldwide, asset managers are struggling with the management of ageing infrastructure in reinforced concrete. Early detection of reinforcement corrosion, which is generally considered as the major problem, can help to perform dedicated maintenance and repair. The acoustic emission technique is promising to reach this goal. However, research on the characterisation of the different damage sources during corrosion in reinforced concrete remains scarce. In this article, the characterisation of damage processes is investigated on small reinforced concrete prisms and upscaled to reinforced concrete beams under accelerated conditions in a laboratory environment. Damage sources are assigned based on careful validation with crack width measurements and dummy samples. Signals originating from different acoustic emission sources are compared in the time and frequency domain. Moreover, the continuous wavelet transform is applied to provide information on time-frequency characteristics. The results show that the moment of concrete macro-cracking can be derived from a sudden increase of the cumulative acoustic emission events and cumulative acoustic emission energy. However, validation with crack measurements is required. The shift in both peak and centre frequency of the acoustic emission signals is found to be a better indicator. Wavelet transform allows to distinguish acoustic emission sources when frequency ranges are overlapping. Possible acoustic emission sources such as the corrosion process and concrete cover cracking, are successfully assigned. The major contributions of this article are the characterisation of acoustic emission sources from corrosion damage in reinforced concrete, validation with crack measurements and dummy samples, as well as a dedicated wavelet analysis.

AB  - Social vulnerability illuminates differences in human capacity to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters. It varies over space and time and among social groups, largely due to variations in socioeconomic and demographic features. The Makran Subduction Zone is one of the known active seismic sources that can generate devastating shaking and tsunami disasters in District Gwadar, Pakistan, such as a large earthquake of moment magnitude 8.1 in 1945. This study presents the first social vulnerability index study for District Gwadar in relation to imminent earthquake-tsunami hazards and shows how SoVI concepts and indicators are adopted. SoVI follows a place-based framework that was originally adopted in developing social vulnerability index for the USA. To assess social vulnerability to earthquakes and tsunamis in Gwadar, we evaluate a social vulnerability index at village level. Using a principal component analysis, 16 village-level indicators are condensed to five factors that explain 64.2% of the variance in the data. Although different factors contribute to the social vulnerability in each village, the overall results confirm the social and economic disparities among villages and reflect differential vulnerability to natural hazards at local to regional scales. Finally, a map of social vulnerability index is compared with seismic-tsunami hazard maps to identify the communities living in risky zones. The approaches and results presented in this study will help emergency managers to identify community sub-groups that are more susceptible to disaster risks and to develop effective risk reduction strategies that are tailored to local conditions.

AB  - Bats utilize forests as roosting sites and feeding areas. However, it has not been documented how bats utilize these habitats in the boreal zone with methods afforded by recent technological advances. Forest structure and management practices can create a variety of three-dimensional habitats for organisms capable of flight, such as bats. Here, we study the presence of boreal bats in a forest forming a mosaic of different age classes, dominant tree species, canopy cover, soil fertility, and other environmental variables, throughout their active season in the summer using passive ultrasound detectors. Our results indicate a preference for mature forest by Eptesicus nilssonii and a pooled set of Myotis bats. Both groups of bats also showed temporal changes in their habitat use regarding forest age. In June and July, both groups occurred more often in mature than young forests, but from August onwards, the difference in occurrence became less evident in Myotis and disappeared completely in E. nilssonii. In addition, E. nilssonii was more often present in forests with low canopy cover, and its occurrence shifted from coniferous forests to deciduous forests during the season. The results reflect the within-season dynamics of bat communities and their ability to utilize different types of forest as environmental conditions change. Yet, the results most importantly emphasize the importance of mature forests to bat diversity and the need to conserve such environments in the boreal zone.

AB  - We examined surface sediment diatom assemblages from 33 subarctic lakes around the historic gold mines in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (Canada), where lake-water As concentrations ([As]) still range between 1.5 and 2,780 mu g/l, even though the roasting of the arsenopyrite-bearing gold ores ceased in 1999. Water chemistry variables related to gold mining pollution (arsenic, antimony, and sulfate) declined with increasing distance from the mines. The diatom assemblages varied substantially in species composition across our study lakes with the planktonic Discostella stelligera/pseudostelligera complex dominating in deep lakes where [As] were less than 5 mu g/l. However, in lakes that exceeded the guideline for the protection of aquatic life ([As] > 5 mu g/l), opportunistic benthic diatoms (small fragilarioid taxa and Achnanthidium minutissimum) were generally present in higher abundances. The subtle differences in diatom species richness and diversity among lakes with varying [As] suggest these indices may not be affected strongly by long-term arsenic pollution. Furthermore, canonical correspondence analysis of the diatom assemblage and environmental data indicated that nutrient and ionic compounds explained most of the variation in the assemblages, while mining-related variables played a limited role. Our results indicate that multiple limnological variables (nutrients, ions, and contaminants) and subarctic climatic conditions are important factors shaping the diatom assemblage composition in lakes impacted by mining activities and land-use changes near Yellowknife.

AB  - Shade coffee farming has been promotedas ameans of combining sustainable coffee production and biodiversity conservation. Supporting this idea, similar levels of diversity and abundance of birds have been found in shade coffee and natural forests. However, diversity and abundance are not always good indicators of habitat quality because there may be a lag before population effects are observed following habitat conversion. Therefore, other indicators of habitat quality should be tested. In this paper, we investigate the use of two biomarkers: fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of tarsus length and rectrix mass, and feather growth bars (average growth bar width) to characterize the habitat quality of shade coffee and natural forests. We predicted higher FA and narrower feather growth bars in shade coffee forest versus natural forest, indicating higher quality in the latter. We measured and compared FA in tarsus length and rectrix mass and average growth bar width in more than 200 individuals of five bird species. The extent of FA in both tarsus length and rectrix mass was not different between the two forest types in any of the five species. Similarly, we found no difference in feather growth between shade coffee and natural forests for any species. Therefore, we conclude our comparison of biomarkers suggests that shade coffee farms and natural forests provide similar habitat quality for the five species we examined.

AB  - Italy is a territory frequently affected by natural disasters that have a huge impact on urban transformations. The physical and socio-economical reconstruction process of a territory damaged by a traumatic event at first pursues the path of emergency management and subsequently the rehabilitation of the damaged areas. These political and economic strategies are still unsystematic, so it is difficult to predict either long or short term effects. This paper presents an analysis carried out on the city of L'Aquila following the earthquake of 2009, in which indicators were defined to assess and monitor the reconstruction process. The method used to define the indicators is 'absolute'; in such a way as to represent a replicable model that can be adapted to different territorial and emergency contexts. Furthermore, the set of indicators proposed can be used not only to monitor the reconstruction process, but also to guide public policies and to suggest shared strategic guidelines, not originated by the urgency of after-shock conditions. The proposed model is a tool to be used from the early stages of reconstruction, in order to predict the outcome of the reconstruction itself. In this way, it is possible to manage urban transformation in a coherent and organic way in all its phases by adopting a single tool. The use of the model shown in the research also makes it possible to enhance the resilience of a territory by exploiting its intrinsic characteristics.

AB  - In data-limited fisheries, making informed management decisions based on scientific advice is challenging. Here, we evaluate a multi-indicator adaptive management framework (AMF) that allows dynamic responses to changing environmental, socioeconomic, and fishing conditions. Using stakeholder-defined goals as a foundation for specifying performance metrics, we employ management strategy evaluation (MSE) to explore the performance of the AMF relative to prescriptive alternatives that are sometimes used in data-limited situations. We conduct simulations involving the two most economically important fisheries in Belize, spiny lobster, Panulirus argus (Latreille, 1804), and queen conch, Strornbus gigas (Linnaeus, 1758). Spiny lobster fishery simulations demonstrate that when relatively stable catches have historically persisted, an AMF can help to ensure that stable catches continue to persist into the foreseeable future when faced with factors such as increased entry to the fishery or environmentally induced recruitment fluctuations. The queen conch fishery simulations demonstrate that optimizing economic performance is complicated without stock status indicators and depends greatly upon the current, yet typically unknown, state of the resource. Since our indicator-based approach could not provide direct information about resource status in relation to management reference points such as maximum sustainable yield, economic objectives could not be achieved. Nevertheless, implementing the AMF served as a beneficial control against stock collapse and could function well as an interim fishery policy during which sufficient fishery data could be collected to inform population modeling and quantitative stock assessment.

AB  - Key message Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen compounds and soil and foliar variables related to N deposition resulted important factors accounting for the variability of defoliation in European forest plots.
   Context Nitrogen (N) deposition has increased in the northern hemisphere because of anthropogenic-related emission of N compounds. Increased N availability may have an adverse impact on forest sustainability.
   Aims This study aims to test the importance of throughfall N (N-thr) deposition in explaining the variability of the frequency of trees with defoliation > 25 % (F (25)), an indicator of forest condition.
   Methods A pan-European data set (71 plots) with enhanced quality control was considered. The additive effect of N-thr-related predictors (identified conceptually and by rank correlation) in explaining F (25) was investigated by partial least square regression in comparison with a reference model based on site, stand, management and climate data. Reported damage to foliage, N-thr deposition, foliar N ratios and mineral top-soil variables were added stepwise to the reference model.
   Results N-related variables improved defoliation models. Higher N-thr deposition led to higher F (25) for beech and Norway spruce, while the effect was opposite for Scots pine. Higher foliar N ratios led to higher F (25) for all species.
   Conclusion N-thr deposition, damage to foliage, foliar N/P, N/Ca, N/Mg, N/K, top-soil pH, C/N and exchangeable base cation resulted important factors (although with possible diverse effect) in explaining the variability of F (25) among plots.

AB  - Biological urban water treatment plants utilize microorganisms for wastewater purification so that microbiological characterization of processes is very important. In addition, its removal in the effluent and outlet sludge for their reuse is important. This work aims to characterize the presence of bacteria and parasites along the processes in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the possibility of using the purifying water and sludge in agriculture.
   The results show a high level of Escherichia coli in the raw water. Although their total removal is not achieved, a reduction of 2.34 and 1.36 log in the concentration of E. coli was produced along the water and sludge treatment lines, respectively, being the trickling filters (TF) and autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion (ATAD) the most effective processes against bacteria.
   Clostridium perfringens, which is a Grampositive bacillus and fecal contamination indicator, although less usual than E.coli, is detected in washing water of solids which are stored in anoxic conditions and in the sludge treatment line where dissolved oxygen is absent including in the outlet of plant.
   Salmonella spp, Entamoeba and Cryptosporidium were not detected in any of the samples, meanwhile Giardia duodenalis was identified only in two samples from washing coarse solids and sludge, but it was not identified in outlet water and sludge. Acanthamoda was the most frequent protozoa isolated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of stocking density and litter type on growth performance of broiler chickens as well as dressing percentage and some litter quality indicators. 684 male broiler (Ross PM3) was used for a 6 weeks period in the experiment. The day-old chicks were randomly assigned in two litter groups: Rice hulls and wood shavings. Each litter group was further divided in three stocking density (15, 19 and 23 chicks/m(2)). Chicks in the each group were randomized into three replicates at hatch and they were housed in a deep litter pens (1x2 m, each) in an environmentally controlled house. The litter type and stocking density had significant effect on the final body weight of broiler (P<0.05, P<0.001), lenght of foot pad lesions of the birds (P<0.001, P<0.001), litter moisture (P<0.01, P<0.05) and litter pH contents (P<0.05, P<0.05). The results of this study suggest that greater stocking density more than 15 chicks per square meter and rice hull adversely affects live body weight of broilers and main litter quality indicators. But up to a critical point, profitability increases with increased stocking density because of the reduction of fixed cost and more kilograms production of broiler per area. Depends on the price and availability rice hull can be used as litter material instead of wood shaving.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate whether cell length alternations of Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533 can be used to monitor the response of this bacterium towards various stress factors during its growth. The selected stressors were heat shock (46 to 55 degrees C for 15,25 min) and pulsed electric fields (PEF; at 15,20 kJ kg(-1) with 7 to 20 kV cm(-1)), These stress factors were applied either at the beginning or at the end of the log-phase in MRS broth. The cell length changes were also monitored during normal growth conditions. It was found, that the cell lengths of bacteria changed in the course of growth; with clear differences between lag, log and stationary growth phases. Heat shock led to significant cell elongation, whereas PEF-stress resulted in cell shrinkage. The stress treatments by heat and PEF were more influential on cell length changes at the beginning than at the end of the log-phase. The magnitude of cell length changes correlated with the intensity of the applied stresses.
   Industrial relevance: Microbial fermentations require a reliable online monitoring, which rapidly gives information about occurring stresses, their extent and nature as well as the cell damage, the capability of cell recovery and the possibility of reaching the desired cell count. The present investigations and method developments could improve the understanding of these mechanisms to lead to better controlled industrial fermentations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Social stress is both species and gender specific. For female rats, individual housing and social instability housing conditions are associated with behavioral indicators of stress and depression. The present study directly compared the effects of six weeks of individual housing, social instability and mixed sex, semi-crowded housing in a visible burrow system (VBS) on ovariectomized female rats. Paired, stable housing was used as the control. Behavioral tests were conducted two, four and six weeks into the housing manipulations and included sucrose consumption, social interest, and activity in the open field. Following a series of four behavioral tests, animals were sacrificed and brains were processed for Golgi impregnation. Basal dendrites of CA3 hippocampal neurons were measured. Results indicate that the individual housing and social instability groups were comparable to the control group for all measures. In contrast, the rats housed in the VBS exhibited reduced activity in open field testing, and alterations in social interest. Dendritic lengths were also reduced in those animals living in the VBS in comparison to the animals housed in pairs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of behavioral and neural effects of VBS housing on female rats. Further research is necessary to determine what facets of the VBS housing are responsible for the behavioral and neural changes.

AB  - The innate immune system in insects is composed of a large variety of specific and non-specific responses that are activated in response to the presence of foreign agents. One important element in such responses is the enzyme phenoloxidase (PO). Here, we review recent progress in PO research and discuss new applications in the emerging field of ecological immunology. Phenoloxidase produces indole groups, which are subsequently polymerized to melanin. The enzymatic reactions in turn produce a set of intermediate products such as quinones, diphenols, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and reactive nitrogen intermediates, which are important during defense against bacterial (gram+ and -), fungal, and viral agents. Phenoloxidase requires a complex system of activation and inhibition that involves various cell types, PO zymogens, inhibitor enzymes, and signaling molecules. Finally, research in evolutionary ecology has studied the costs of PO in terms of resource use and pleiotropic relations with other key traits and functions. These studies indicate that PO is a costly trait, whose production and maintenance have fitness costs for hosts. Phenoloxidase does not seem to be an indicator of resistance but rather of host condition. Finally, we put forward some basic directions for future investigation of PO aimed at explaining its activating system, its substrates, its coordination with other immune components to fight off pathogens, and variation in PO in relation to gender, life stages, seasonality, and across different host species.

AB  - Particles and natural organic matter (NOM) are two major concerns in surface water, which greatly influence the membrane filtration process. The objective of this article is to investigate the effect of particles, NOM and their interaction on the submerged ultrafiltration (UF) membrane flux under conditions of solo UF and coagulation and PAC adsorption as the pretreatment of UF. Particles, NOM and their mixture were spiked in tap water to simulate raw water. Exponential relationship, (J(P)/J(P0) = axexpt{-k[t-(n-1)T]}), was developed to quantify the normalized membrane flux dynamics during the filtration period and fitted the results well. In this equation, coefficient a was determined by the value of J(P)/J(P0) at the beginning of a filtration cycle, reflecting the flux recovery after backwashing, that is, the irreversible fouling. The coefficient k reflected the trend of flux dynamics. Integrated total permeability (Sigma J(P)) in one filtration period could be used as a quantified indicator for comparison of different hybrid membrane processes or under different scenarios. According to the results, there was an additive effect on membrane flux by NOM and particles during solo UF process. This additive fouling could be alleviated by coagulation pretreatment since particles helped the formation of flocs with coagulant, which further delayed the decrease of membrane flux and benefited flux recovery by backwashing. The addition of PAC also increased membrane flux by adsorbing NOM and improved flux recovery through backwashing.

AB  - The article presents results of a case study in northeastern Germany, where magnetic susceptibility assessment was carried out at grid-wise field measurements. The measurements were clustered into three different depth levels, which represent the humus layer, the transition zone between humus layer and mineral horizon, and the mineral horizon. Taking these three depth levels, a multiple regression-based regionalization approach was applied, testing and using additional environmental parameters derived from geology, topography, and stand type with the aim to develop a comprehensive model for spatial variability of magnetic susceptibility. Spatial variation of magnetic susceptibility was predicted with a high precision by the multiple linear regression models. A slightly differing set of model parameters was selected for the single depth levels. In tendency, magnetic susceptibility values in depth level 6-10 cm were best explained by the distance to Bitterfeld and by soil properties. In depth level 11-15 cm, variables which describe the orographic conditions and stand properties gain in importance. In depth level 21-25 cm, variables indicating soil and site properties disappear completely. Here, aspect and land surface characteristics play a major role together with stand properties. A spatial stratification of the model for a distance of up to 25 km to the former emitters provided a further improvement of the model quality considering the prediction of small-scale variations of magnetic susceptibility.

AB  - Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles likely have adaptive value because of overdominance, in which case MHC heterozygous individuals have increased fitness relative to homozygotes. Because of this potential benefit, the evolution of sexual reproduction between MHC-divergent individuals (i.e. negative assortative mating, NAM) may be favoured. However, the strongest evidence for MHC-based NAM comes from inbred animals, and context-dependent mating preferences have rarely been evaluated although they often occur in nature. We assessed the extent MHC-based mating preferences among wild tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) using multiple molecular approaches. We genotyped 102 adults and 864 larvae from 36 breeding trials at both microsatellite and MHC loci. Parentage analysis revealed that reproductive success among males was positively associated with increased tail length and that with respect to the focal female, MHC-similar males sired a significantly higher number of offspring than more dissimilar males. This trend was consistent, even under context-dependent scenarios that favour traditional MHC-based NAM. These results suggest that the most MHC-divergent males may be at a reproductive disadvantage in pairwise breeding trials. Our data add to a growing body of evidence that suggests where it exists, MHC-based choice is probably dynamic and mediated by many factors that vary in the wild, notably signals from other indicator traits and by the quality and quantity of potential mates.

AB  - The feasibility of obtaining sap flow (SF), maximum daily trunk shrinkage (MDS) and midday stem water potential (Psi(stem)) baselines or reference values for use in irrigation scheduling was studied in adult Fino lemon trees (Citrus limon (L.) Burm. fil.) grafted on sour orange (C. aurantium L.) rootstocks. Plants were irrigated daily above their water requirements in order to obtain non-limiting soil water conditions. The results indicated that baselines for plant-based water status indicators (MDS, SF and Psi(stem)) can be obtained, even though there was a certain scattering of the data points representing the relations between the plant-based measurements and the environmental variables (reference evapotranspiration, solar radiation, vapour pressure deficit and temperature). SF was more closely associated with changes in the studied evaporative demand variables than were MDS and Psi(stem). SF and Psi(stem) were more closely correlated with changes in reference evapotranspiration (ETo) (r(2) = 0.93 and 0.79, respectively), while MDS behaviour was best correlated with mean daily air temperature (T-m) (r(2) = 0.76). Increases in the evaporative demand induced more negative Psi(stem) values and, as a consequence, SF increased, which, in turn, was translated into an increase in MDS. This confirmed that SF and MDS were very good predictors of the plant water status during the observation period and their continuous recording offers the promising possibility of their use in automatic irrigation scheduling in lemon trees.

AB  - The potential productivity of forests is an important parameter in the evaluation of vegetation as a carbon sink. At the same time, potential productivity can be considered as an indicator of growth conditions and also as a measure of available fuel loads, which, in Mediterranean-type ecosystems, are a main factor of regional fire incidence. The present work deals with the relationship between an estimation of forest potential productivity and the fire incidence registered in peninsular Spain. Fire incidence was characterized by means of several fire regime variables. In order to contrast the patterns obtained, a similar analysis of the relationship between fire regime and human population density was also carried out. The results show that higher fire incidence was registered in more productive areas. Potential productivity was correlated to variables related to the number of fires and to the area burned, whereas the population density was also correlated to the number of fire variables and to the area burned, but with lower correlation coefficients. Although it is difficult to establish cause-and-effect relationships between complex phenomena that depend on a large number of factors, finding statistically significant relationships between fire incidence and the estimation of potential forest productivity used over a long time period is considered very relevant. These relationships make it necessary to take into account the fire regime when evaluating both forests and other terrestrial ecosystems as carbon sinks so as to meet the demands of the Kyoto Protocol.

AB  - The influence of pollution stress (SO2, Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+ and fluoride) on composition changes in cellular membranes of roots of three European of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations were examined. Plant material growing in three experimental areas: Kornik relatively free of air pollution (control), Lubon: SO2 and HF and Glogow: SO2 and heavy metals. Analysis of total phospholipids and their composition indicates that the phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were present in lower concentration in the root tissues from both polluted sites (Lubon and Glogow). The difference in PC:PE ratio between control and both polluted sites was greater in root of Scots pine population from Russia than in the population from Slovakia. Under pollution conditions the content of lipid soluble antioxidant (x-tocopherol was lower about 220 %, in comparison to the control. The action of pollution stress also lead to lowering of unsaturated: saturated ratio of total fatty acid, and lower content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid (18:2) and cicosatrienoic acid (20:3). We concluded that the long-term pollution stress markedly inhibited lipid biosynthesis in root tissue of Scots pine and it is probably contribute to the reduction of productivity of forests. These results also suggest that lipid composition can be used as an indicator of changes in tissue roots of Scots pine caused by air and/or soil long-term pollution.

AB  - Some insectivorous birds wintering in an open Mediterranean habitat show following behaviour. Only typical gleaner species, such as the Dartford Warbler Sylvia undata, behaved as followers, whereas sit-and-wait species, such as the Stonechat Saxicola torquata, were followed. Both single individuals and homo- or heterospecific flocks acted as followers. The composition of the following flock was highly dynamic, both with respect to number of species and individuals. The result was ephemeral groups consisting of one host and one or more follower individuals which usually broke up when the followed bird flew to a perch without being followed.
   We analysed the follower-followed relationships between the most interactive pair of species (Dartford Warbler and Stonechat). Following behaviour appeared to consist of two behavioural components: to follow the host when it changed foraging site and to glean prey close to it. When together with a Stonechat, the Dartford Warbler looked for prey mainly on the ground close to the former; when searching alone, it fed mainly in shrubs. The host may be a reliable and predictable indicator of optimum search areas, or the warbler may exploit its vigilance when looking for prey on the ground, or both. The proximity of a follower species altered the searching behaviour of the Stonechat and reduced its capture success by half. The Stonechat's antiparasite strategy mainly consisted of perch changes, to avoid interference. The ecological conditions favouring the development of this kind of following behaviour (habitat openness, cold temperatures, low prey availability, etc.) are discussed.

AB  - Size of antlers in polygynous male cervids is a result of their genetic potential and nutrition and is believed to be a reliable indicator of males' fitness and habitat quality. We used data on antler size of 1390 red deer males harvested during hunting seasons 2014/2015-2018/2019 in Slovakia to test the hypothesis that spatial variation in the size of antlers, including number of tines, mass and length of antlers, is related to environmental conditions such as availability of calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen in soils and deer density. We found that overall hunting value of antlers including number of tines, mass and length of antlers were higher in areas with higher availability of the CaCO3, P and N in soils. Moreover, we found no signs of decline in the overall score and in number of tines when availability of CaCO3 was high, in the length of antler when availability of P was high, and in the antler mass when availability of N was high. Deer density had negative effect on the antler size including the number of tines and antler length and had no effect on the onset of the peak and rate of decline except for the antler mass. Understanding the extent to which environment influences antler size in cervids is important to develop structured and region-specific policies.

AB  - By modifying underground spaces of abandoned coal mines into underground pumped storage power stations, it can realize the efficient and reasonable utilization of underground space and, at the same time, meet the increasing demand for energy storage facilities of the grid, bringing social, economic, and environmental benefits. Previous research in this area has been limited to the stage of conceptual discussion, and there is no scientific evaluation method for the modification and utilization potential of abandoned coal mine spaces. Establishing a scientific evaluation indicator system forms the basis for evaluating the underground space development and utilization capacity of abandoned mines. Based on the principle of pumped energy storage and the characteristics of coal mine roadway conditions, this paper utilized an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate the main influencing factors, including elevation difference between the upper and lower reservoirs, reservoir capacity, roadway surrounding rock stability, and roadway permeability. It analyzed the modification potential of underground spaces and then verified the development potential of the underground spaces of abandoned mines by a statistic model. The study found that the elevation difference between the upper and lower reservoirs is the most influential indicator; second, the capacity of the upper and lower reservoirs is also an important evaluation indicator. The research methods and conclusions will provide useful tools and decision-making basis for analyzing the feasibility and techno-economic benefit of modifying the underground spaces of abandoned coal mines into pumped storage power stations.

AB  - Nitrogen fertilizers have been identified in energy crops LCAs as the main contributors to global warming, as well as to many other environmental impacts. The distinct production process and application emissions of nitrogen fertilizer types for top dressing produce different GHG savings when energy crops value chains are compared to fossil energy alternatives. In this study, three types of fertilizers (calcium ammonium nitrate, urea and ammonium sulphate) at N top dressing rates of 80 kg N/ha are used to grow rye for electricity generation under the conditions of the Continental Mediterranean climate of central-northern Spain. Complete LCAs for the whole value chain based on real data were performed in conjunction with soil nitrogen balances (SNBs) to assess the accomplishment of European Union (EU) GHG savings sustainability criteria, as well as the sustainability of fertilization practices for soil nitrogen stocks. The results obtained can provide interesting insights for policy making, since calcium ammonium nitrate, the most common fertilizer for rye crops, led to 66% GHG savings, as opposed to the 69% achieved when applying urea and 77% when ammonium sulphate was used. Nevertheless, the three fertilizers produced annual soil deficits greater than 50 kg N/ha. In order to ensure savings above 80%, as required by the EU sustainability criteria, and sustainable SNBs, additional optimization measures should be taken at key points of the value chain.

AB  - Extensive livestock production in Mediterranean climate conditions and acidic soils requires animal feed supplementation. This occurs during the summer and, frequently, also in the autumn and winter, depending on the prevailing rainfall patterns. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of dolomitic limestone application and of tree canopy on availability, quality, and floristic composition of a permanent pasture, grazed by sheep. At the end of autumn, winter, and spring of 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 pasture green and dry matter production (GM and DM, respectively), crude protein (CP), and fiber (neutral detergent fiber) were monitored in 24 sampling points. Half of these points were located in areas amended with dolomitic limestone (COR) and half in unamended areas (UCOR). In each of these, half of the sampling points were located under tree canopy (UTC) and half outside tree canopy (OTC). Pasture floristic composition was monitored in spring 2020. The results show, in autumn, a positive and significant effect (i) of soil pH amendment on pasture DM and CP daily growth rate (kg.ha(-1).day(-1)) (+28.8% and +42.6%, respectively), and (ii) of tree canopy on pasture CP daily growth rate (+26.4%). Both factors affect pasture floristic composition. Pasture species were identified as potential bio-indicators, characteristic of each field area. These results show the practical interest of the soil pH correction to reduce the animal supplementation needs in the critical autumn period in the Mediterranean montado ecosystem.

AB  - Traffic planning should focus on the promotion of public transport to ensure sustainability. Buses have a vital role to play in this as they optimize the use of limited road space by carrying more passengers, compared to personal vehicles. This study is aimed at systematically simulating the impacts of various bus priority measures with respect to existing conditions by evaluating travel time savings, various traffic performance indicators and reliability benefits to address transportation challenges such as delays. The results obtained from the developed simulation experiments in VISSIM and the comparison with the field traffic behavior confirmed that the developed models accurately represent the actual traffic nature with less than 10% margin of error. The evaluation of the validated bus priority models showed that the priority schemes reduce bus delays by a minimum of 21.32% at intersections and some of the strategies can easily be incorporated with less investment. Because of the simulated priority attributes, the modal shift assessment result showed that 62% of other mode users have high tendency to shift to buses; except for private car users in which 66% of the users have low mode shifting interest. Policy makers and transport planners should implement priority measures to reduce delays, improve service management and reliability, as they are low-cost with highly efficient traffic management that keep buses moving and boosting mobility in areas that attract many people.

AB  - Transportation and refining of heavy metal-bearing oil are associated with the problems of localized destruction of metal structures and elements due to corrosion. In the process of equipment operation, it was revealed that premature failure of steel coils of heating tube furnaces at oil refineries and petrochemical plants was associated with insufficient strength and corrosion resistance of the steelwork. The study of the effect that structure and phase composition of 15KH5M-alloy steel elements of heating furnaces at oil refineries have on the corrosion properties, associated with mass loss and localized destructions in the process of heat treatment, allows to develop protective measures and determine heating modes with a rate-limiting step of oxidation. The rate of various corrosion types of 15KH5M steel is used as an indicator to assess the effectiveness of the applied modes of coil heat treatment in order to increase their corrosion resistance and improve their operational characteristics. Conducted experiments on heat treatment of certain steel coil sections allowed to determine rational heating modes for the studied coils, which made it possible to reduce their mass loss and increase corrosion resistance of working surfaces in the process of operation. Proposed heat treatment of steel coils at specified intervals of their operation in the tube furnaces creates conditions for their stable performance and affects the degree of industrial and environmental safety, as well as reduces material costs associated with the repair and replacement of individual assemblies and parts of tube furnaces.

AB  - The present work intends to investigate the application potential of coconut oil, as cutting fluid, during metal machining of a nickel-based superalloy. In doing so, machining performance of difficult-to-cut aerospace superalloy Inconel 718 is studied under dry, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), and nanofluid MQL (NFMQL) using uncoated WC-Co tool, operated at varied cutting speeds. MQL environment is created by supplying air-oil mist in which commercially available coconut oil is used as cutting fluid. On the other hand, nanofluid is prepared by dispersing a specific concentration of multi-walled carbon nanotubes within coconut oil. Machining performance as observed in MQL and NFMQL is compared to that of dry machining. The following machining performance indicators are considered herein: cutting force magnitude, tool-tip temperature, and width of flank wear progression. In addition, studies on dominant modes and mechanisms of cutting tool wear, chip morphology (macro/micro), and surface roughness of the machined work part are also carried out. In the purview of machined surface roughness, it is concluded that NFMQL performs better than dry machining and conventional MQL. Flank wear is witnessed more severe during dry machining than MQL/NFMQL. However, beyond 83 m/min cutting speed, conventional MQL outperforms NFMQL (with 0.2 wt% nano-additives concentration) machining, from the viewpoint of flank wear width.

AB  - This study aims to identify the optimal configuration of a hose reel traveling irrigator based on a multi-objective evaluation. We identified nine evaluation indicators (two empirical: irrigation efficiency, yield increase; two technical: spray uniformity, application rate; two economic: initial investment, annual operating costs; three social and environmental: labor intensity, productivity, greenhouse gas emissions) selected from aspects of technology, economy, society and the environment. We evaluated a primary set of seven technical, economic, and social and environmental indicators and a smaller subset of only the technical and economic indicators. The multi-objective evaluation ranked 144 alternatives using Principal component analysis and Data envelopment analysis methods. The optimal scheme was exactly the same for both analysis methods, and the number of schemes within a deviation of five reached 88.2 % of all alternatives. The comparison results support the accuracy of the evaluation and the results were not affected by the evaluation methods. The influence of a single configuration parameter on the comprehensive evaluation efficiency of the hose reel traveling irrigator was discussed. A 200 m pipe length, 0.45 MPa operating pressure of the sprinkler, 0.2R overlapping distance and 65 mm pipe diameter was preferred under the working conditions of the case study. The impacts of social and environmental indicators on the overall evaluation were significant, which can help designers/users make cleaner and more user-friendly configuration schemes of the hose reel traveling irrigator.

AB  - The wide spread of smartphones and QR codes for various end-user applications has had an impact beyond traditional fields of use, recently also reaching point-of-care testing (POCT). This work presents the integration of QR code recognition into paper-based analytical devices (PADs) with "distance-based" colorimetric signalling, resulting in semiquantitative readout fully relying on straightforward barcode reader solutions. PADs consist of an array of QR codes arranged in series inside a paperfluidic channel. A mask dye concept has been developed, which enables utilisation of colour changing indicators by initially hiding QR codes. The colour change of the indicator induced by the presence of an analyte of interest results in gradual unmasking of QR codes, which become recognisable by the smartphone barcode reader app. To reproducibly fabricate devices, all fabrication steps were performed by commercial desktop solid ink and inkjet printing. The QR code masking function was optimised by controlling the amount of printed mask dye through adjusting the opacity of printing patterns during the inkjet deposition process. For proof-of-concept, a model assay in the form of colorimetric copper ion (Cu2+) detection in the concentration range of 0.4 mM to 3.2 mM was evaluated. Consistent results independent of the smartphone model and environmental light condition were achieved with a free barcode reader app. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration of a semiquantitative assay approach fully relying on QR code readout without digital colour analysis, customised app or hardware modification.

AB  - Plant protection products (PPPs) undergo rigorous regulatory assessment to ensure that they do not pose unacceptable risks to the environment. Elucidation of their fate and behavior in soil is an integral part of this environmental risk assessment. The active substance degradation in soil of PPPs is first assessed in laboratory studies (typically following Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] test guideline 307). Conditions in guideline laboratory studies are far removed from those occurring under agricultural use, and the contribution of crop roots has currently not been assessed. We integrated viable plant root systems, representative of 3 different crop types, into the OECD test guideline 307 design to assess their impact on the dissipation of the herbicide prometryn. Significantly faster decline of parent residue and higher formation of nonextractable residues were observed in all 3 planted systems. This led to a reduction in the time required for 50% of the compound to dissipate (DT50) of approximately one-half in the presence of rye grass and hot pepper and of approximately one-third in the presence of red clover. These findings imply that plants and their associated root networks can have a significant influence on PPP dissipation. Based on these data, greater environmental realism could be added to the standardized laboratory study design by the inclusion of plant root systems into higher tier studies, which, in turn, could serve to improve the environmental risk assessment process.

AB  - Power engineering is one of the main types of economic activity of the Republic of Belarus. The priority development of the country's energy sector is determined by its key role in ensuring the efficient functioning of the national economy, stable operation of the social infrastructure, and observance of social norms and standards for the population. and importance of energy resources for the development of the economy and society as a whole can hardly be overestimated because of their active influence on the intensity of production and consumption processes. Currently, the main sources of energy are oil, natural gas, coal, oil shale and nuclear energy. Economy of the Republic is very dependent on energy imports. This is a serious test for the country under conditions of constant rise in hydrocarbon prices. Belarus imports more than 90 % of oil, 100 % of natural gas and 25 % of liquefied gas and 100 % of the whole consumed coal. The energy intensity of domestic enterprise products is significantly higher than in industrialized countries. Therefore, improvement of energy efficiency is fundamental for our country. In this regard, a real economic sector depends on the stable operation of energy enterprises, timely modernization of equipment, rational use of fuel and energy resources and effective implementation of energy conservation measures. Most of the energy sector problems can be solved by improving the energy security indicators of the Republic, namely, as a result of the introduction of a range of energy-saving measures, use of secondary energy resources and development of renewable energy sources.

AB  - We examine the landscape structural features of the Mukhtel lowland and the mountains surrounding it on the southwestern coast of the Sea of Okhotsk. An analysis is made of the main formation factors for modern landscapes and for the structure of vegetation as the main indicator of its spatial organization. The influence of the landscape inversion is determined, which manifests itself in the formation of extensive swamps (mari) within the lowland and forest natural complexes in the lower parts of the slopes of the surrounding mountain ranges. The landscapes of hummocky-swale swamps with subarctic components of the flora in the areas of permafrost stretching along the shore of St. Nicholas Bay (Bugristaya Mar' stow) and landscapes of abrasion-denudation ledges similar in natural conditions to the landscapes of the mountain tundra in the northern part of the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk have been identified. The description is provided for the altitudinal zonality of landscapes of low mountains and azonal landscapes of river valleys and coastal-marine accumulative landforms. A rare (for the Okhotsk Sea region) combination of diverse landscapes is observed in a small area s well as a sharp difference between plain and low-mountain natural complexes. Characteristic features of the distribution of elementary landscapes depending on the exposure of slopes, topography and soil composition were revealed. The 1:250 000 landscape map has been compiled on the basis of a conjugate analysis of thematic maps displaying the topography, soils and vegetation cover.

AB  - Stabilization of waste activated sludge (WAS) is an essential step for the disposal or reuse. In this study, WAS stabilization via electrochemical pretreatment (EPT) at 0-15V was evaluated for simultaneous dewaterability enhancement, pathogen removal and H2S mitigation. The mechanism underlying EPT was investigated and discussed based on the changes in the physicochemical (e.g., particle size, zeta potential, hydrophobicity and extracellular polymeric substances) and biological characteristics (i.e. cell morphology, and distribution and percentages of live/dead cells) of WAS with different EPT voltages. The results revealed that EPT disintegrated WAS flocs and disrupted the cell walls leading to a reduction in particle size (by up to 50%), increased release of extracellular and intracellular substances (by up to 4 times) to facilitate WAS stabilization. With EPT at 15V, the capillary suction time of WAS decreased by 42%, and the concentrations of E. coli and indicator pathogens (Salmonella spp. and Streptococcus faecalis) fell by nearly 5 log(10) reaching U.S. EPA hygienization levels. Furthermore, EPT at 12V or higher suppressed the amounts of dissolved sulfide and H2S(g) produced from the WAS under anaerobic conditions by over 99%. This study demonstrates the feasibility of EPT for simultaneous WAS dewaterability enhancement, pathogen inactivation and H2S mitigation, providing a one-step alternative for sludge stabilization.

AB  - Information on the effect of cowpea-based rotations in horticulture under arid and semiarid environments are scarce despite the potential for increasing soil quality and fertility. Cowpea is a suitable legume in rotated cropping systems due to its relative tolerance to drought. The main goal of this study was to assess the effect of two cowpea cultivars, Feijao frade de fio preto (FP) and Feijao frade de fio claro (FC), during three crop rotation cycles, on soil fertility, yield, crop quality and nutritional composition of subsequent broccoli crops grown using mineral and organic fertilizers while decreasing fertilization rates by 20% compared with a broccoli monocrop. A cowpea crop was seen to contribute to increasing subsequent soil available P after three crop rotations compared to monocrop, using both fertilizers type (an increase of 30% and 120% using mineral and organic fertilizers, respectively). The use of mineral fertilizers increased broccoli head diameter (13-41 %) and yields (33-80 %), while the use of organic fertilizer increased soil aggregate stability (23-36 %) and soil enzyme activities (40-110 %). The use of organic fertilizers improved broccoli crop yield with time, with similar values than those obtained from mineral fertilizers at the end of the experiment. Thus, the introduction of cowpea in rotation under Mediterranean conditions was seen to be a good strategy for crop diversification and for reducing current N fertilizer dependency.

AB  - Many sapphire and ruby occurrences are spatially linked with orogenic belts such as the Pan-African Orogen, the Himalayas, and regions of active or former subduction along the western margin of the Pacific Ocean. These gemstones have oxygen isotope compositions (O-18) that span >45 parts per thousand, reflecting the wide range of environments and conditions involved in corundum (Al2O3) formation. We compiled a global data base of sapphire and ruby O-18, from which the following major groups of gemstones emerge: a dominant population of sapphires with O-18 centred around 5.5 parts per thousand (the mantle value) that is spatially related to regions of former subduction; a lesser population of sapphires and rubies with slightly higher O-18 that are associated with skarn and pegmatite; rubies with relatively low O-18 of 0 parts per thousand-7 parts per thousand that occur in hydrothermally altered ultramafic metamorphic rocks in collision zones; and rubies with high O-18 of 14 parts per thousand-25 parts per thousand that are found, almost exclusively, in Himalayan marble. The spatial distribution of the O-18 groups relative to plate boundaries provides insight into the two major periods of continental collision involved in sapphire and ruby formation: the Ediacaran collision of East and West Gondwana (the East African Orogeny) and the Cenozoic collision of India and Asia.

AB  - The urban environment holds numerous emission sources for air and noise pollution, creating optimum conditions for environmental multi-exposure situations. Evaluation of the joint-exposure levels is the main obstacle for multi-exposure studies and one of the biggest challenges of the next decade. The present study aims to describe the noise/NO2 multi-exposure situations in the urban environment by exploring the possible discordant and concordant situations of both exposures. Fine-scale diffusion models were developed in the European medium-sized city of Besancon (France), and a classification method was used to evaluate the multi-exposure situations in the facade perimeter of 10,825 buildings. Although correlated (Pearson's r = 0.64, p < 0.01), urban spatial distributions of the noise and NO2 around buildings do not overlap, and 30% of the buildings were considered to be discordant in terms of the noise and NO2 exposure levels. This discrepancy is spatially structured and associated with variables describing the building's environment. Our results support the presence of several co-existing, multi exposure situations across the city impacted by both the urban morphology and the emission and diffusion/propagation phases of each pollutant. Identifying the mechanisms of discrepancy and convergence of multi-exposure situations could help improve the health risk assessment and public health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, we developed a fabricated microfluidic paper-based analytical device (PAD) for in situ rapid colorimetric detection of microorganisms in environmental water samples. We fabricated the PAD with the wax printing method at curing conditions of 100 degrees C for 7 seconds. For quick bacterial detection, we modified the catalase test with Fenton's reaction as a colorimetric biochemical reaction. This modified catalase test provided a color indicator according to the concentration of Escherichia coli (E. coli, XL-1 Blue strain). All of the image data from the detection chamber of the PAD was analyzed at the precision of 300 pixels for each color space component (i.e., hue, saturation, and value in HSV color). In addition, environmental samples were tested with our PAD, and the data were fitted in the range of colorimetric reference chart for E. coli sample testing.
   Twenty microliters of 50% hydrogen peroxide solution was used for a single-color detection test. Before adding the E. coli sample on the chip, the detection chambers were loaded twice with 1 mu L of ferrous sulfate (0.3 g/mL, 0.97 M) and dried. The mean values for all of the samples (n = 10) were rounded to the nearest integer. The P values (P<0.01, P<0.05) for all three of the color space components of HSV were considered to be statistically significant.

AB  - The assessment of the risk of human exposure to heat is a topic as relevant today as a century ago. The introduction and use of heat stress indices and models to predict and quantify heat stress and heat strain has helped to reduce morbidity and mortality in industrial, military, sports, and leisure activities dramatically. Models used range from simple instruments that attempt to mimic the human-environment heat exchange to complex thermophysiological models that simulate both internal and external heat and mass transfer, including related processes through (protective) clothing. This article discusses the most commonly used indices and models and looks at how these are deployed in the different contexts of industrial, military, and biometeorological applications, with focus on use to predict related thermal sensations, acute risk of heat illness, and epidemiological analysis of morbidity and mortality. A critical assessment is made of tendencies to use simple indices such as WBGT in more complex conditions (e.g., while wearing protective clothing), or when employed in conjunction with inappropriate sensors. Regarding the more complex thermophysiological models, the article discusses more recent developments including model individualization approaches and advanced systems that combine simulation models with (body worn) sensors to provide real-time risk assessment. The models discussed in the article range from historical indices to recent developments in using thermophysiological models in (bio) meteorological applications as an indicator of the combined effect of outdoor weather settings on humans.

AB  - The tambaqui Colossoma macropomum is rearing on different systems and environments and has shown good production in cages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the growth of tambaqui at different stocking densities in a lake supplied by rainwater and its effects on environmental quality. The experiment was conducted in consecutive phases: nursery at densities of 50, 100, 200 and 300 fingerlings m(-3) and growth at densities of 20, 40 and 60 juveniles m(-3). Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and conductivity were monitored daily. Sediment and water samples were collected for analyses of nitrogen and phosphorus monthly. In the nursery, yield of 14,03 kg m(-3) was significantly higher for fish at 300 fingerlings m(-3). The highest weight gain was obtained at 50 fingerlings m(-3). Survival over 97% was observed in the nursery. In the growth phase, weight gain and specific growth were inversely proportional to densities. Feed conversion and condition factor were not influenced by the evaluated densities. The density of 20 juveniles m(-3) is more adequate to grow tambaqui in cages. Tambaqui cage culture did not alter the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients of lake water. Increased levels of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus in the sediment below the cages were verified without creating events of eutrophication. The results show that the tambaqui cage culture is viable in lakes provided with rainwater and can be integrated with multiple-use water services.

AB  - In this study, we developed a simple and selective spin column extraction technology utilizing hydrophilic molecularly imprinted polymers as the sorbents for extracting nitrophenol pollutants in water samples (the East Lake, the Yangtze River, and wastewater). The whole procedure was achieved by centrifugation of the spin column, and multiple samples were simultaneously processed with a low volume of solvent and without evaporation. Under the optimized condition, recoveries of nitrophenol compounds on the spin column packed with hydrophilic molecularly imprinted polymers ranged from 87.3 to 92.9% and an excellent purification effect was obtained. Compared with activated carbon, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, LC-C-18 sorbents, hydrophilic molecularly imprinted polymers exhibited a highly selective recognition ability for nitrophenol compounds and satisfactory sample extraction efficiency. Subsequently, the spin column extraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography was established, which was found to be linear in the range of 2-1000 ng/mL for 2,4-dinitropehnol and 2-nitrophenol, and 6-1000 ng/mL for 4-nitrophenol with correlation coefficients greater than 0.998. The detection limits ranged from 0.3-0.5 ng/mL. It is shown that the proposed method can be used for the determination of trace nitrophenol pollutants in complex samples, which is not only beneficial for water quality analysis but also for environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Oil and gas platforms are energy-intensive systems, which operate under changing boundary conditions over time. In this paper, the life performance of an offshore platform is analysed by comparing three representative stages of an oil field (early-life, plateau and end-life productions). The energy requirements are assessed by a process integration study, and the system inefficiencies are pinpointed by performing an exergy accounting. The heating and cooling requirements vary significantly over time, and most inefficiencies take place in processes where chemical exergy is consumed (similar or equal to 50-55%), thermal exergy is transferred (similar or equal to 15-20%), or mechanical exergy is varied (similar or equal to 0-15%). These findings are valid for all production periods: this suggests that more attention should be paid on a proper integration of the processing and utility plants, by, for instance, recovering heat from the turbine exhausts and from the exported gas. Multi-objective optimisations are conducted for evaluating the integration of steam and organic Rankine cycles, considering thermodynamic, economic and environmental performance indicators. They indicate that the profitability of a given improvement measure mainly depends on (i) the field properties, (ii) the platform operating strategy, and (iii) the production stage of the oil field. The implementation of steam networks appears promising, as it results in a better performance of the offshore platform and in larger economic profits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, blackcurrant fruit and leaf samples from four main cultivation regions of China were collected to analyze their carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen isotope compositions in order to develop an approach for tracing geographic origins of blackcurrant fruits and juice concentrates. The stable isotope compositions of the soils from these locations were also analyzed to link blackcurrant leaves and fruits with the environmental conditions they grew under. In most cases, there were significant differences in the nitrogen isotope ratios of organic matter in fruits, leaves, and topsoil as well as the hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of water in blackcurrant fruits and topsoil among blackcurrant from four sampling sites; thus, the four main cultivation regions of blackcurrant fruits in China could be discriminated through the combination of the stable isotope ratios of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. However, carbon isotope ratio did not offer any clue for blackcurrant geographic origin. In addition, there were positive correlations of nitrogen isotope signature between blackcurrant fruits and leaves or the topsoil (0-10 cm); thus, the isotope signature of blackcurrant leaves and the topsoil of the cropland could be good indicators of the isotope compositions of blackcurrant fruits when tracing potential geographic origins of blackcurrant fruit concentrated juices or their juice produces. Therefore, stable isotope signatures of blackcurrant materials offer great potentials for tracing geographic origins of blackcurrant fruits or their related produce in China or other cultivation regions.

AB  - In this paper, a new photo-catalytic energy conversion system is analyzed for continuous production of hydrogen at a pilot-plant scale. Two methods of photo-catalytic water splitting and solar methanol steam reforming are investigated as two potential solar-based methods of catalytic hydrogen production. The exergy efficiency, exergy destruction, environmental impact and sustainability index are investigated for these systems, as well as exergoenvironmental analyses. A Compound Parabolic Concentrator (CPC) is presented for the sunlight-driven hydrogen production system. This study shows that an optimum water flow rate exists, where the exergy efficiency of the photo-catalytic hydrogen production is maximized. The amount of CO2 emissions that are reduced by this process increases at higher flow rates. The light intensity is one of the key parameters in design optimization of the photo-reactors, in conjunction with light absorptivity of the catalyst. The results show that a trade-off exists in terms of exergy efficiency improvement and CO2 emissions of the photo catalytic hydrogen production system. The optimal working condition of solar methanol reforming to satisfy the exergy-environmental considerations is found to be light intensity range of 530W m(-2) < J < 600W m(-2) and water-methanol mole ratio of 1.5-2. An optimum methanol feeding rate associated with CO2 emissions of methanol steam reforming is determined in order to establish the required solar flux for photo-catalytic conversion of methanol to hydrogen.(C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT) eruption similar to 74 ka is the largest volcanic event to occur during the last two million years. This paper presents a high resolution landscape reconstruction for the Jurreru Valley, south India, immediately prior to this eruption. Primary ash fall deposits have sealed the pre-Toba surface of the Jurreru Valley, and subsequent deposition of remobilised ash has helped preserve this horizon. These primary YTT deposits provide an isochron that allows for the study of palaeoenvironmental conditions across a 25,000 m(2) area in the Jurreru Valley, permitting the reconstruction of the pre-Toba landscape. Sixty sites with exposed primary ash deposits have been recorded as part of a Total Station survey, twelve of which have been subject to detailed stratigraphical study. This has enabled a reconstruction of the topography of the buried surface in the Jurreru Valley. Stable isotope and phytolith analyses are used to explore diversity across this buried landscape, indicating that the ratio of C-3 to C-4 plants varies with regard to changes in topographic height in the landscape of up to similar to 5 m. High levels of spatial heterogeneity within these proxy data are indicated by this study, highlighting the risks of extrapolating regional palaeoenvironmental sequences from vertically sampled sedimentary sections, which may well reflect highly localised influences of topography and geomorphology.

AB  - The scientific investigation of the influence of wind on tree growth has been conducted for over 200 years. One influence of wind on trees is the formation of an asymmetric crown, usually characterized as being windswept under moderate windy conditions. As wind exposure increases, the terms applied to this growth form include flag-tree, banner-tree, and krummholz. The modification in crown morphology has been widely recognized and studied, especial in the area of wind prospecting or as a bioindicator of wind speed in environments lacking monitoring stations. However, the causes and physiology underlying this response is little understood. The windswept morphology is consistent with the morphologies associated with other tropisms (i.e. phototropism and gravitropism). Tropisms are defined as a growth response towards (positive) or away (negative) from an environmental stimulus. The asymmetric growth form of windswept trees appears to be a negative thigmotropic growth response to wind. In this review, evidence will be presented to support or reject two hypotheses; H-1 the windswept growth form is the result of a negative thigmotropic growth response or H-2 the windswept growth form is determined by the biophysical properties of wood. It is argued that the windswept growth form is more likely the product of biomechanical properties (accept H-2) than of a physiological thigmotropic growth response (reject H-1). However, proper testing of both hypotheses is still required before a final confirmation can be established. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Low molecular weight flavan-3-ols are thought to be responsible, in part, for the cardiovascular benefits associated with cocoa powder and dark chocolate. The levels of epicatechin and catechin were determined in raw and conventionally fermented cacao beans and during conventional processing, which included drying, roasting, and Dutch (alkali) processing. Unripe cacao beans had 29% higher levels of epicatechin and the same level of catechin compared to fully ripe beans. Drying had minimal effect on the epicatechin and catechin levels. Substantial decreases (>80%) in catechin and epicatechin levels were observed in fermented versus unfermented beans. When both Ivory Coast and Papua New Guinea beans were subjected to roasting under controlled conditions, there was a distinct loss of epicatechin when bean temperatures exceeded 70 C. When cacao beans were roasted to 120 degrees C, the catechin level in beans increased by 696% in unfermented beans, by 650% in Ivory Coast beans, and by 640% in Papua New Guinea fermented beans compared to the same unroasted beans. These results suggest that roasting in excess of 70 degrees C generates significant amounts of (-)-catechin, probably due to epimerization of (-)-epicatechin. Compared to natural cocoa powders, Dutch processing caused a loss in both epicatechin (up to 98%) and catechin (up to 80%). The epicatechin/catechin ratio is proposed as a useful and sensitive indicator for the processing history of cacao beans.

AB  - Development of novel natural dietary adjunct/agent with significant therapeutic effects on metabolic disease conditions such as obesity and heart disease raises concern in recent times. We studied chronic toxicity of the combined active ingredients present in the sesame leaves and their interaction on the fasting serum lipid profiles with their ratios in thirty adult male non-obese Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Such that, both treated groups received 14.0 and 28.0 mg/kg body weight doses of aqueous leaves extract of Sesamum radiatum respectively on a daily basis via gastric gavage, while, the control received equal volume of normal saline daily for six weeks. Significant (P < 0.05) weight loss observed in the treated groups was associated with significant (P < 0.05) reductions in both serum cholesterol and triglycerides (TG). The effect on the serum lipoprotein cholesterol components and ratios were significant in a dose related manner, such that increase in HDL accompanied a corresponding decrease in both LDL and LDL/HDL ratio. In addition, to increased in TG/HDL ratio. However, no significant differences in the relative reduction level of VLDL and triglycerides in the treated groups were found compared to control. Thus, LDL/HDL ratio is significantly a better indicator than the TG/HDL ratio in assessing the impact of sesame treatment with evidence of weight loss and hypolipidaemia especially in hypertensive heart diseases.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the frictional behavior of both hydrogenated and hydrogen-free diamondlike carbon (DLC) films in high vacuum (10(-6) Pa) at room temperature. Water was also introduced into the vacuum chamber to elucidate its effects on DLC film tribology. The hydrogen-free DLC (also referred to as tetrahedral amorphous carbon, or ta-C) was produced by an arc-PVD process, and the highly hydrogenated DLC was produced by plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition. Tribological measurements of these films were made with a pin-on-disc machine with coated steel balls and coated steel discs in matched pairs under a I N load. The ball/disk pairs were rotated at sliding speeds in the range of 0.025-0.075 m/s. In vacuum, the steady-state friction coefficient of ta-C was of the order of 0.6 and the wear was severe, whereas for the highly hydrogenated film, friction was below 0.01, and in an optical microscope no wear could be detected. Adding water vapor to the sliding ta-C system in a vacuum chamber caused friction to decrease monotonically from 0.6 to approximate to0.07. In contrast, adding water vapor to the sliding DLC system caused the friction to increase linearly with pressure from 0.01 to 0.07. The results illustrate the importance of taking into account environmental conditions, especially the presence of water, when DLC films are being considered for a given application.

AB  - With the rapid development of the rail industry, a large amount of construction waste will be generated during the construction phase, posing a significant risk of environmental pollution and exacerbating the plight of global resource shortages. This study establishes a green disposal system for rail transportation based on the theory of sustainable development. Shield slag, shield weathered sand, shale, and engineering slag are used as raw materials, and sintered bricks are adopted as their innovative disposal method. The heavy metals in the four types of construction waste and recycled products were tested by X-ray fluorescence analysis technique to analyze the actual environmental pollution risk and explore the influence of the firing stage on the performance of the recycled products through the enrichment factor evaluation method. The results of the physical and chemical property tests of the fired samples showed that the environmental pollution risk of the four recycled products after firing was at a low-risk level (EF < 2), the strength test results showed that the best specimens had a strength rating of 20 MPa and the other performance indicators (frosting degree, lime bursting test) measured also met the requirements of the recycled bricks. This study achieves the harmless treatment of construction waste, provides a disposal system for the green recycling of construction waste from rail transport, and provides a theoretical basis for subsequent studies on the effects of different external conditions on such recycled products.

AB  - Increasing recognition of the potential ecosystem services provided by urban forests suggests a need to examine soil quality under urban conditions. Soil quality assessment tools are presently mostly applied in agricultural production, but these approaches must also be evaluated in the urban context. This proof-of-concept exploratory study evaluates whether Worldview-3 spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) generated for individual tree crown (ITC) objects can be correlated to soil health attributes measured in the field in Metro Boston, Massachusetts, USA. While similar studies have completed such analysis for agricultural crops, none have done so for urban trees. The statistical analysis by Pearson correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) showed that SVIs, specifically the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), correlated significantly and positively with bulk density (BD) (r = 0.536) and soil luminance (r = 0.562) and negatively with CO2 respiration (r = - 0.536), active fungi and active bacteria (r = - 0.401), and total carbon (r = - 0.548). The negative correlations with parameters commonly considered positive for soil health in agricultural settings may indicate strong perturbation at the urban soil surface level; they also suggest soil health attributes measured at this study's 0-15 cm sampling depth may not be satisfactorily indicative of tree health as measured by SVIs. This study evidences the ground truthing of satellite-based urban SVIs, including their relationships with soil health attributes at the individual tree level.

AB  - In developing countries, especially in Latin America, unequal land distribution and access remain a significant problem. In this paper, we explore the potential of participatory action research (PAR) in promoting the social learning needed to mobilize actions that improve the situation for disadvantaged actors in the context of land tenure conflicts. Our case study was composed by four socio-ecological systems in the north of Misiones province, Argentina, where we combined focus groups, participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and social network analysis (SNA) to obtain empirical evidence of social learning at different levels (individual and small group, collective, and system). We evaluated early social learning (e.g. the consolidation of a coordination network of collective actions, the emergence of cooperatives, changes in productive practices) triggered by PAR, according to changes in the actors' network, both at actors' nodal metrics and nodal structure levels. Changes in nodal metrics indicated improvements in the connections between actors and in their cohesion level, as well as the empowerment of the most disadvantaged, resulting in more effective interactions for problem-solving and exchange of information. Changes in network structure metrics also indicated favorable conditions for social learning. We argue that our PAR intervention has contributed to these aspects. In addition, we compare the usefulness of different network metrics as indicators of social learning. Future evaluations are needed to analyze which initiatives are consolidated within communities and to better understand the potential and limitations of this approach.

AB  - The implementation of structural health monitoring systems in civil engineering structures already in the construction phase could contribute to safer and more resilient infrastructure. Due to their lightweight, small size and high resistance to the environment, distributed optical fibre sensors stand out as a very promising technology for damage detection and quantification in reinforced concrete structures. In this article, the suitability of embedding robust distributed optical fibre sensors featuring a protective sheath to accurately assess the performance indicators, in terms of vertical deflection and crack width, of three reinforced concrete beams subjected to four-point bending is investigated. The results revealed that a certain strain attenuation occurs in embedded robust distributed optical fibre sensors compared to commonly used thin polyimide-coated distributed optical fibre sensors bonded to steel reinforcement bars. However, the presence of the protective sheath prevented the appearance of strain reading anomalies which has been a frequently reported issue. Performance wise, the robust distributed optical fibre sensors were able to provide a good estimate of the beam deflections with errors of between 12.3% and 6.5%. Similarly, crack widths computed based on distributed optical fibre sensor strain measurements differed by as little as +/- 20 mu m with results from digital image correlation, provided individual cracks could be successfully detected in the strain profiles. Finally, a post-processing procedure is presented to generate intuitive contour plots that can help delivering critical information about the element's structural condition in a clear and straightforward manner.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the antioxidant responses of sugarcane ( Saccharum spp.) varieties subjected to water and saline stress. Sugarcane seedlings of six different varieties obtained through micropropagation were subjected to either water or saline stress, or a combination of water + saline stress. The study was carried out in May 2012, in a greenhouse at the Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE). The experimental design was randomized, with treatments arranged in a 6 x 4 factorial scheme (six varieties and four treatments), and four replicates. Lipid peroxidation, hydrogen peroxide (H2O)(2) concentrations, and relative water content (RWC) were evaluated. Furthermore, we evaluated the plants' ant oxidative defense systems by measuring the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase (CAT). The sugarcane varieties had higher lipid peroxidation and/or higher Hp, concentrations when subjected to the combined water + saline stress. The antioxidant enzymes responded to the water and saline stress treatments differently depending on the sugarcane variety. However, under combined saline + water stress conditions, the enzymes may have become inactivated, which indicates that the response to the combined water + saline stress was different from the sum of the responses to only water stress or only saline stress. High concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) associated with low RWC maybe an effective indicator of multiple stress sensitivity in sugarcane varieties. The RB99395 and RB867515 sugarcane varieties responded more efficiently to environmental stress, and maintained their cell water content when subjected to either water or saline stress.

AB  - Circular economy is a theoretical concept that is widely discussed in recent literature as a way to achieve increased sustainability. However, published literature focuses on how to increase circularity without analysing the status quo of circularity, which necessitates answering the question of how to measure the effectiveness of any actions implemented to advance Circular economy. Currently, there is no agreed methodology in literature on measuring the existing circularity. Therefore, this article proposes an analytical way to measure and map a regional waste economy's circularity. The framework can be applied at a granularity of an individual materials level as well as overall at a regional level, and can quantify with a potential to improve towards a more circular economy in value as well as in volume. Data mining, conditioning, and, mathematical analysis was conducted across a number of public and private databases such as ORBIS and The Environment Agency. The proposed framework was tested taking a case of a region in the North East of England with 35,116 active companies. The methodology was validated on a different data set from another region. The results show that the methodology is able to measure a regional circularity overall as well as at an individual material level. The outcome of this research would be useful for policy makers as well as manufacturing organisations, and waste management companies as benchmarking allows a comparison between effectiveness of regional environmental regulations with their influence on driving sustainability and circular economy.

AB  - Purpose This is a comparative study of the nature of operating decisions made by agricultural and non-agricultural banks, affecting their actual growth plans in the years around and during the Great Recession of 2008. The main empirical question is whether banks under greater economic stress shortly before, during, and immediately after the recession made deliberate adjustments in their growth decisions vis-a-vis predetermined sustainable levels. Design/methodology/approach Higgins' sustainable growth challenge is employed to evaluate banks' growth decisions involving four growth levers (profitability, earnings retention, asset management, and financial leverage). Actual growth trends are related to business growth rates deemed sustainable given available financial capability as prescribed by Higgins' model. Findings Both banking groups made cautious growth decisions during the sample period. Actual growth rates were below sustainable levels. Agricultural banks registered steadily increasing sustainable growth rates from the pre-recession years until the recovery period, while non-agricultural banks were more constrained to grow given their declining sustainable growth levels. Notably, agricultural banks showed relatively more aggressiveness in raising slightly actual revenue growth to levels much closer to sustainable levels. This could have resulted from their less volatile profit margin trends and usual pressure to maintain acceptable liquidity conditions in order to gain access to external funds. Originality/value This study presents an additional application of Higgins' model to agricultural finance. The comparative analysis of banking groups becomes even more relevant these days as recent economic discussions focus on indicators of an imminent recessionary period.

AB  - Innovation in agriculture is responding to the requirements of increasing the competitiveness of the agricultural sector in national and international markets, in conditions of increasing social and political pressures to combat climate change and ensure food security. The aim of the research is to highlight the development level of agriculture in the European Union, by geographical groups of countries.
   The research methodology is based on a comparative analysis of the various absolute and relative indicators of economic efficiency, environmental impact and innovative capacity of European agriculture.
   The results showed important disparities between analysed regions for all the indicators evaluated. Thus, Scandinavian countries have been noted by very high levels of indicators: production per standard agricultural production unit; work productivity; the degree of renewable energy resources use; the degree of investment in research and development activities. However, agriculture in these countries exerts a strong pressure on the environment, generating significant amounts of greenhouse gases and high energy consumption. On the opposite side, we find for most of the indicators, the countries of South Eastern Europe. From an economic point of view, these countries get the lowest labour productivity and average output per agricultural production unit, but from the point of view of their environmental impact, the agriculture of these countries exerts less pressure on the environment. Regarding the innovative potential of the agriculture of these countries, we have noted a very low share of the R&D expenditures in the agricultural value added.

AB  - The November 2017 MW 5.5 Pohang earthquake is one of the largest and most damaging seismic events to have occurred in the Korean peninsula over the last century. Its close proximity to an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) site, where hydraulic injection into granite had taken place over the previous two years, has raised the possibility that it was anthropogenic; if so, it was by far the largest earthquake caused by any EGS project worldwide. However, a potential argument that this earthquake was independent of anthropogenic activity considers the delay of two or three months before its occurrence, following the most recent injection into each of the wells. A better understanding of the physical and chemical processes that occur following fluid injection into granite is thus warranted. We show that hydrochemical changes occurring while surface water, injected into granite, reequilibrates chemically with its subsurface environment, can account for time delays for earthquake occurrence of such duration, provided the seismogenic fault was already critically stressed, or very close to the condition for slip. This candidate causal mechanism counters the potential argument that the time delay militates against an anthropogenic cause of the Pohang earthquake and can account for its relatively large magnitude as a consequence of a relatively small-volume injection. The resulting analysis places bounds on combinations of physical and chemical properties of rocks, injected volume, and potential postinjection time delays for significant anthropogenic seismicity during future EGS projects in granite.

AB  - The contamination patterns and fate of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) were investigated in the Evrotas River (Southern Greece). This is a temporary river with differing levels of water stress and water quality impairment in a number of its reaches. Three sampling campaigns were conducted in order to capture different levels of water stress and water quality. Four sampling sites located on the main channel of the Evrotas River were sampled in July 2015 (moderate stream flow), and June and September 2016 (low stream flow). Discharge of urban wastewater has been determined as the main source of pollution, with PhACs, nutrients and other physicochemical parameters considerably increasing downstream the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Sparta city. Due to the pronounced hydrological variation of the Evrotas River, generally, the highest concentrations of PhACs have been detected during low flow conditions. Simultaneously, low flow resulted in an increased water travel time and consequently longer residence time that accounted for the higher attenuation of most PhACs. The average decrease in total concentration of PhACs within the studied waterbody segment (downstream of Sparta city) increased from 22% in July 2015 to 25% in June 2016 and 77% in September 2016. The PhACs with the highest average concentration decrease throughout the sampling campaigns were hydrochlorothiazide, followed by sotalol, carbamazepine, valsartan, and naproxen.

AB  - Sustainable management of agricultural land requires not only an accurate assessment of the biophysical status of the soil but also estimates of the social and economic aspects of the soil. This paper focuses on soil security mapping of an approximately 80 000 km(2) agricultural area in middle-eastern China. We examined a digital soil assessment framework in mapping soil security and its five dimensions (capability, condition, capital, connectivity and codification) using digital soil maps and environmental variables. The main objective is to improve the understanding of soil protection in agricultural practices. Soil and environmental variables were coded as indicator values based on their functions, and three averaging models were used to integrate the indicators for soil security mapping. Results show that agricultural land in the study area currently has a high potential to achieve the crop production function, while there is still lack of sufficient social connectivity. Most of agricultural land has been properly protected by the public policy. More than half of the agricultural land has high security for cropping, while there is no unsecured soil. In general, most of the agricultural lands have already been well developed for cropping. The low soil security mainly contributes to the lack of proper connection to the soil. The findings suggest that digital soil security assessment is highly recommended for guiding sustainable development of agricultural land, because it could provide the knowledge of factors affecting soil security from complex multifaceted dimensions, and potential solutions to make agriculture soil more secure.

AB  - Due to the high resource consumption and environmental impacts of textile production, better handling of discarded materials has a great environmental improvement potential. A uniform definition of textile waste and a stringent sorting procedure is a precondition for thorough investigations of discarded textiles. A review of waste sorting studies showed that only a few included textiles, and mainly considered content and not quality. A lack of definition and quality assessment causes a high risk of mistakes when assessing the potential of textile waste prevention. This study establishes a method for sorting and quality assessment of textiles in household waste, validated through dialogue with professional textile sorting centres. It also suggests a minimum waste sample size. The quality assessment is based on analysis of product types, manufacturing methods, fibre composition and a product condition assessment based on 17 criteria. The developed method was applied in a case study and compared with other sorting methods. It showed that 61% of the clothing in residual waste and 83% in small combustibles and that 78% of the household textiles in residual waste and 85% in small combustibles was reusable or recyclable. The comparison with existing methods showed that sorted quantities varied significantly when different sorting methods were applied even when the sorting was done on the same sample. This study suggests a new standard for defining and assessing categories and qualities of used textiles, adapted to real contemporary sorting technologies, and tested on waste samples.

AB  - Some authors suggest a relation between Unconjugated Bilirubin (UCB) plasma high levels and schizophrenia, as schizophrenia patients have been showing higher UCB levels when compared with other psychiatric patients and general population. These higher UCB levels have been already correlated with acute psychotic states, positive symptoms, and poor outcome in patients with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders share common symptoms but there aren't yet accepted biomarkers for their distinction. In our study protocol we propose an observational longitudinal study on a sample composed of two subgroups: patients with schizophrenia and patients with schizoaffective disorder. We will compare the UCB levels between groups, and search for a possible correlation with patient's psychopathology. For that purpose we will use nosological, psychopathological, neuropsychological, and psychosocial instruments. Thus we will be testing two different hypotheses: (1) Is UCB serum level a diagnosis indicator, with categorical distinction potential, between groups of patients with different psychotic disorders? (2) Is UCB serum level a severity indicator, with dimensional distinction potential, among groups of patients with the same psychotic disorder? We believe that UCB mean levels may contribute to some clarification of this controversy, as a potential biological indicator, facilitating the distinction between these two diagnostic categories and\or discriminating the dimensional severity among each of these psychotic conditions. Thus we may be opening a new opportunities for innovative and exciting biological psychiatry research regarding organic aspects in the schizophrenia spectrum.

AB  - Purpose The limitation of bridges' operation can cause serious social, environmental and economic losses. Therefore, the monitoring and maintenance actions of these structures must be efficient and periodic, especially for bridges located in aggressive environments, such as urban-industrial centres, where the higher volume of carbon dioxide emissions favours carbonation induced corrosion. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the utility of including non-destructive testing (NDTs) to bridges assessment in that regions as a way of obtaining more in-depth information on the conditions of the material composing the structure.
   Design/methodology/approach First, the main bridges' damages were detected by visual inspection. Then, based on the observations of bridges design, environment and main damages, an NDT programme was executed including surface hardness, ultrasonic pulse velocity test, pH indicator spraying, half-cell potential measurements and concrete resistivity tests.
   Findings It was observed that, for the studied cases, the carbonation did not present harmful depths, except for the structural elements where segregation and wear of the concrete were noticed. NDTs, associated with visual inspection, indicated the regions where corrective or preventive maintenance actions were actually needed, bringing greater security to the decision maker in regions where repairs are unnecessary or could be postponed.
   Originality/value This paper highlights the contribution of NDTs application in structures in urban-industrial regions where the main mechanism of deterioration is carbonation-induced corrosion, demonstrating the importance of these methods in the rational decision making of investments for maintenance.

AB  - Green Bio-Refineries (GBRs) have economic and environmental potentials through changing land use from cereals to grass production and provision of grass-based protein feed for livestock production and other valuable byproducts. However, the potentials are dependent on local conditions of the GBRs, such as land productivity, environmental sensitivity and transport distances for feedstock as well as the regional economy which GBRs are a part of. In this paper, we compare the total (direct, indirect and induced) effects of different location choices of GBRs in Denmark at different (municipal, regional, national) scales - a key step for decisions about development of GBRs from both investors' and authorities' perspectives. We integrate a local life-cycle assessment (LCA), a geographic information system (GIS) analysis and an economic-environmental input-output (EEIO) based model (LINE) into a common framework (GIS-LCA-EEIO). We show that locating GBRs in Western Denmark, where the soils are primarily sandy and livestock densities are high, generates higher socio-economic gains than in Eastern Denmark, where the soils are primarily loamy and the concentrations of livestock are lower. We conclude by sketching out priority areas for developing GBRs and discuss the policy implications of the results within the context of development of a bio-based economy.

AB  - The paper presents the results of biological tests of granular complex humic fertilizers (CHF) with the addition of carbamide (urea) and simple superphosphate. CHF samples were obtained from lignite (brown coal) of the Tisul deposit (Kaychak plot, Kemerovo Region), their production method is given. Samples of complex granular fertilizers, initial coal and humic acids (HA) were characterized using C-13 CP/MAS NMR, technical and elemental analysis. An integral indice, i.e. the index of phytoactivity (IP) that was calculated as the average value of the sum of indicators of the germinative energy, the seedling height (SH) and root length of seeds was used for objective testing. It was performed on seeds of spring wheat Iren by soaking them in an aqueous solution of CHF. Seeds were germinated under the conditions of State Standard GOST 12038-84. The effect of major components that were HA and mineral additives contained in the composition of CHF was determined. It was found that alongside with the composition of CHF, the functional group composition parameters might affect biological activity. It was demonstrated that the synergistic effect of HA and introduced mineral additives was observed. The presence of HA in CHF allowed decreasing the concentration of the solution to soak seeds without decreasing its biological activity. The tested CHF showed high phytoactivity (IP = 1.19-1.45). The maximum biological activity was noted in samples treated with superphosphate. The ability of HA to decrease the suppressive effect of large concentrations in solutions of mineral fertilizers was determined.

AB  - An innovative combination of green chemistry and quality by design (QbD) approach is presented through the development of an UHPLC method for the analysis of the main degradation products of dextromethorphan hydrobromide. QbD strategy was integrated to the field of green analytical chemistry to improve method understanding while assuring quality and minimizing environmental impacts, and analyst exposure. This analytical method was thoroughly evaluated by applying risk assessment and multivariate analysis tools. After a scouting phase aimed at selecting a suitable stationary phase and an organic solvent in accordance with green chemistry principles, quality risk assessment tools were applied to determine the critical process parameters (CPPs). The effects of the CPPs on critical quality attributes (CQAs), i.e., resolutions, efficiencies, and solvent consumption were further evaluated by means of a screening design. A response surface methodology was then carried out to model CQAs as function of the selected CPPs and the optimal separation conditions were determined through a desirability analysis. Resulting contour plots enabled to establish the design space (DS) (method operable design region) where all CQAs fulfilled the requirements. An experimental validation of the DS proved that quality within the DS was guaranteed; therefore no more robustness study was required before the validation. Finally, this UHPLC method was validated using the concept of total error and was used to analyze a pharmaceutical drug product. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Along the arid Arava, southern Israel, acacia trees are considered keystone species. Based on survival of acacias through drought years that have not seen a single rainfall or flood, it is assumed that acacias endure the local harsh conditions by drawing water from deep underground water reservoirs. Studying water use of acacias has so far been done by exposing root systems or by isotopic water measurements, both problematic methods.
   We present a new application of a two-dimensional direct current electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to measure the electrical resistivity of the subsurface. We applied the ERT device to two fixed 100 m transects cutting across (north-south) and along (west-east) the super arid Gidron Wadi during March, April and August 2013. An inversion model was used to create a map of electrical resistivity of the layers below ground, an indirect indicator of the underground water content. We identified a conductive layer located at similar to 7-10 m below ground in all surveys. Although we could not identify changes to this apparent perched aquifer, such a layer may be a secondary source of water for acacias that can explain their survival in drought years. Further ERT-aided studies are needed to correlate acacia distribution and ecophysiological state with perched aquifers, even if quantitative analysis of their replenishment in such desert environments is not trivial.

AB  - We investigated the factors influencing cyanobacterial biomass and microcystin (MC) concentrations in several Ugandan lakes from September 2008 to February 2009. We characterized thermal structure, light availability, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll a, phytoplankton delta C-13 (as an indicator of CO2 limitation), and phytoplankton community composition and abundance as well as MC concentrations. We used these data to test several hypotheses based on previous research in temperate lakes regarding the factors that encourage high cyanobacterial biomass and MC concentrations. Site characteristics that appeared to favor high cyanobacterial biomass (especially Microcystis) included: high total phosphorus concentrations, low total nitrogen to total phosphorus (TN : TP) ratios, and possibly low CO2 availability. Light availability, total nitrogen concentrations, and thermal structure of the water column were not related to cyanobacterial biomass. MC concentrations were strongly related to Microcystis biomass (and were not related to the biomass of any other cyanobacterial taxa), which was positively correlated with total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations. MC cell content may be moderated by CO2 availability, with MC cell quotas tending to be lower where the potential for C-limitation of photosynthesis was higher. In these phosphorus-rich tropical lakes, the shallowest study sites were most conducive to the development of large standing crops of Microcystis and high MC concentrations. The environmental conditions that appear to favor high cyanobacterial biomass and MC concentrations in our Ugandan study lakes are similar to what has been observed for temperate lakes.

AB  - Fish species possess many specific characteristics that support their use in ecotoxicology. Widely used in clinical research, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can reasonably be exploited as relevant target cells in the assessment of environmental chemical toxicity. The current article focuses on the methods necessary to isolate, characterize, and culture fish PBMCs. These procedures were successfully applied on an endangered species, the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.), and on an economically important and worldwide exported species, the Asian catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus S.). Proteomic approaches can be useful to screen xenobiotic exposure at the protein expression level, giving the opportunity to develop early warning signals thanks to molecular signatures of toxicity. To date, a major limitation of proteomic analyses is that most protein expression profiles often reveal the same predominant and frequently differentially expressed families of proteins regardless of the experimental stressing conditions. The current study describes a methodology to get a postnuclear fraction of high quality isolated from fish PBMCs in order to perform subsequent subproteomic analyses. Applied on samples from eel, the subproteomic analysis (two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis) allowed the identification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and searches in the full NCBInr (National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant) database of 66 proteins representing 36 different proteins validated through Peptide and Protein Prophet of Scaffold software.

AB  - The pollen signatures preserved in the mangrove sediments provided records of species variation over a period of time with past climate and sea level changes. The Airoli profile has a Late Pleistocene sequence, and all the other studied profiles and intervals cover the Holocene only. The absence of mangrove signatures during the Late Pleistocene interval is attributed to a relatively low sea level. The ideal conditions for mangrove development along Konkan prevailed during Middle Holocene, when the first extensive mangrove swamps appeared in Sindhudurg (Dhamapur-Hadi) area particularly between 7220 and 4770 yrs BP. This period coincides with the Holocene Climate Optimum (HCO) when Monsoon Asia witnessed much higher precipitation. However, the mangroves responded to environmental changes due to relative abundance of fresh water leading to change in species composition. Two different scenarios of mangrove response during the Late Holocene, one in Dhamapur and the other in Palm Beach, are found to be significant. The Rhizophora-Sonneratia transition from Early Mid-Holocene to Late Holocene is considered to be the most distinctive feature. The decline of mangroves since 3500 yrs BP and further degradation has been attributed to the prevailing arid climate and weakening trends of the monsoon until 1500 yrs BP. However, there seems to be a positive trend in emergence of mangroves in the least disturbed areas of south Konkan, attributed to strengthening of summer monsoon in the recent past.

AB  - Aims: To improve our understanding of the survival and splash-mediated transfer of zoonotic agents and faecal indicator bacteria introduced into soils used for crop cultivation via contaminated irrigation waters.
   Methods and Results: Zoonotic agents and an Escherichia coli marker bacterium were inoculated into borehole water, which was applied to two different soil types in early-, mid- and late summer. Decline of the zoonotic agents was influenced by soil type. Marker bacteria applied to columns of two soil types in irrigation water did not concentrate at the surface of the soils. Decline of zoonotic agents at the surface was influenced by soil type and environmental conditions. Typically, declines were rapid and bacteria were not detectable after 5 weeks. Selective agar strips were used to determine that the impact of water drops 24-87 mu l could splash marker bacteria from soil surfaces horizontal distances of at least 25 cm and heights of 20 cm.
   Conclusions: Soil splash created by rain-sized water droplets can transfer enteric bacteria from soil to ready-to-eat crops. Persistence of zoonotic agents was reduced at the hottest part of the growing season when irrigation is most likely.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Soil splash can cause crop contamination. We report the penetration depths and seasonally influenced declines of bacteria applied in irrigation water into two soil types.

AB  - The Three Gorges Dam (TGD) is by far the world's largest hydroelectric scheme. Due to its unprecedented magnitude, the TGD has been controversial ever since it was proposed in the early 20th century and building commenced in 1993. Recent problems, including geological disasters (e.g., landslides) in the uplands and algal blooms in the aquatic environment since the reservoir's partial filling to 156 m in 2006, suggest that the environmental challenge has never been greater than now. The environmental deterioration might be further intensified when the reservoir reaches its final water level of 175 m. Solving the environmental challenges will be essential for the sustainable development of the Three Gorges Reservoir region (TGRR), and environmental sustainability in the TGRR is a high priority for the nation considering its critical location in the Yangtze Basin, which contributes 40% of China's GDP. This article reviews primary environmental assessments for biodiversity conservation, the water environment, water level fluctuation zone, and the uplands after the partial filling in the reservoir region. It also discusses the success of mitigation efforts to date. Although there are successes in mitigation particularly in conservation of endangered plants and fishes, it seems likely that environmental conditions in the TGRR could only get worse in the short term. Building a partnership among the TGD stakeholders, including local residents, governments, and international communities is necessary to meet the mounting environmental challenge in the TGRR and beyond.

AB  - Adenoviruses and polyomaviruses are two distinct DNA viral families that are excreted in high concentrations and distributed inhuman and animal populations. Targeting specific virus included in these families has proved to be a promising and useful tool for tracing specifically sources of environmental contamination. In this study, a quantitative PCR assay that is specific for bovine polyomaviruses was developed and used to determine the excretion level and concentration of bovine polyomaviruses in urine and environmental samples, including urban sewage, slaughterhouse sewage, and river water. A set of primers and a TaqMan probe were designed to target a 77-bp region of the bovine polyomavirus VP1 gene, and the conditions of the reaction were optimized. A detection limit was established at 1-10 genome copies per test tube. The assay was specific and produced negative results when samples containing human or porcine fecal contamination were analyzed. This is, to our knowledge, the first description of bovine polyomaviruses excreted in bovine urine samples (mean values of 10(4) GC/1). Bovine polyomaviruses were also detected and quantified in slaughterhouse wastewater and river waters, which shows the spread of these viruses in many environmental samples containing contamination of bovine origin. The procedure described in this paper provides a quantitative source-tracking tool for the analysis of bovine polyomaviruses as indicators of the presence of bovine contamination in environmental samples.

AB  - Vehicles cause environmental damage on sandy beaches, including physical displacement and compaction of the sediment. Such physical habitat disturbance provides a relatively simple indicator of ORV-related impacts that is potentially useful in monitoring the efficacy of beach traffic management interventions; such interventions also require data on the relationship between traffic volumes and the resulting levels of impact. Here we determined how the extent of beach disturbance is linked to traffic volumes and tested the utility of image-based data acquisition to monitor beach surfaces. Experimental traffic application resulted in disturbance effects ranging from 15% of the intertidal zone being rutted after 10 vehicle passes to 85% after 100 passes. A new camera platform, specifically designed for beach surveys, was field tested and the resulting image-based data compared with traditional line-intercept methods and in situ measurements using quadrats. All techniques gave similar results in terms of quantifying the relationship between traffic intensity and beach disturbance. However, the physical, in situ measurements,, using quadrats, generally produced higher (+4.68%) estimates than photos taken with the camera platform coupled with off-site image analysis. Image-based methods can be more costly, but in politically and socially sensitive monitoring applications, such as ORV use on sandy beaches, they are superior in providing unbiased and permanent records of environmental conditions in relation to anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - A distinct lens of marine sand, up to 90 cm thick, confined vertically by peat, is found in the upper fill of a closed freshwater back-barrier lagoon on the southeast Australian coast. Coring of the deposit suggests it extends continuously up to 600 m inland and tapers landward rising to similar to 1.6 m above principle datum. In places the sand is overlain by accumulations of organic-rich silt that contain charophytes, indicating re-establishment of lagoon conditions. Hypotheses considered for the deposition of the sandsheet are higher Holocene sea level, storms and tsunami. Ground-penetrating radar transects of the seaward dune system suggest a penecontemporaneous erosional contact between a series of truncated pre-event dunes and several small overlying post-event dunes. Dating the sandsheet was problematic but it is confined to the last 800 years. The young age combined with a lack of associated beach deposits and evidence of wave scouring suggest that a higher sealevel hypothesis is unlikely. This sand lens is attributed to a large-scale washover event from the southeast. Based on comparisons with modern storm deposits from the same coast and sedimentological diagnostic criteria derived from studies of modern storm- and tsunami-deposited sandsheets, it is concluded that this sand deposit is the product of a short-lived, large-scale overwash event attributed to a late-Holocene tsunami.

AB  - Several freshness and spoilage indicators were monitored to characterize the postmortem biochemistry of giant aquid (Dosidicus gigas) mantle muscle. Squid sampler were obtained directly from the sea and kept at 0 degrees C during a 15-d storage period. Data at zero time were obtained from cryogenically frozen samples at time of capture. The adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) degradation followed a different pattern as compared with that from ofish species. ATP was almost completely depleted at 24-h postcatch from 6.54 to < 1 mu mol/mg, while at the same time Hx was the predominant carbolite with a concentration of 4 mu mol/g, reaching 6.85 mu mol/g at day 15. K-value data followed a logarithmic pattern with time instead of a linear one, with no change after days 3, thus reducing its suitability as a freshness index. The coefficient Hx/AMP seems to be an adequate alternative for this purpose due to its constant increment with time. The high NH4Cl content in mantle muscle (461.3 +/- 24.5 mg of NH4(+)/100 g) derived from its physiological importance for the species compromises the use of the discillation step of the TVB-N detected in mantle muscle (243.7 mg N/100g) did not correlate with the initial low TMA-N content (1.5 +/- 0.1 mg/100g of muscle). The results suggested that under the experimental conditions the shelf life of squid exceeds 15d.

AB  - Gene flow from genetically modified (GM) crops to the same species or wild relatives is a major concern in risk assessment. Transgenic rice with insect and/or disease resistance, herbicide, salt and/or drought tolerance and improved quality has been successfully developed. However, data on rice gene flow from environmental risk assessment studies are currently insufficient for the large-scale commercialization of GM rice. We have provided data on the gene flow frequency at 17 distances between a GM japonica line containing the bar gene as a pollen donor and two indica hybrid rice varieties and four male-sterile (ms) lines. The GM line was planted in a 640m(2) in an isolated experimental plot (2.4 ha), which simulates actual conditions of rice production with pollen competition. Results showed that: (1) under parallel plantation at the 0-m zone, the transgene flow frequency to the ms lines ranged from 3.145 to 36.116% and was significantly higher than that to hybrid rice cultivars (0.037-0.045%). (2) Gene flow frequency decreased as the distance increased, with a sharp cutoff point at about 1-2 m; (3) The maximum distance of transgene flow was 30-40 m to rice cultivars and 40-150 m to ms lines. We believe that these data will be useful for the risk assessment and management of transgenic rice lines, especially in Asia where 90% of world's rice is produced and hybrid rice varieties are extensively used.

AB  - The distribution of Calanus finmarchicus was studied on a transect across the central Greenland Sea, and on five transects from the Eurasian shelves across the Atlantic Inflow in the Arctic Ocean. Stage composition was used as an indicator for successful growth; gonad maturity and egg production were taken as indicators for reproductive activity. On the Arctic Ocean transects, these parameters were measured simultaneously from the sibling species Calanus glacialis. Response of egg production rate to different temperatures at optimal food conditions was very similar between both species in the laboratory. C. finmarchicus was present at all stations studied, but young developmental stages were only present close to the regions of submergence of Atlantic water under the Polar water. This together with a decreasing abundance and biomass from west to east along the Atlantic Inflow in the Arctic Ocean and reproductive failure indicates that C. finmarchicus is expatriated in the Arctic Ocean. We hypothesize that the late availability of food in the Arctic Ocean, rather than low temperature per se, limits reproductive success. Better reproductive success in the very low temperature regions of the Return Atlantic Current and the marginal ice zone in the Greenland Sea supports this hypothesis. The possibility for a replacement of C. glacialis by C. finmarchicus and consequences for the ecosystem after increasing warming of the Arctic are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soil organic matter is an effective indicator of soil resource condition that reflects functional traits such as aggregation and infiltration and plays a critical role in sustaining production and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Agricultural practices typically reduce soil carbon through the action of soil disturbance and mineralization. In the Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) landscape we studied, soil carbon levels in pellic vertisols were significantly lower in the agricultural matrix of cropping and grasslands than in remnant Brigalow vegetation. There was no detectable gradient of soil carbon across Brigalow/matrix boundaries. Uncultivated grasslands showed significantly higher carbon levels than currently and previously cultivated grasslands. Regenerating grasslands showed no significant recovery of soil carbon over 15 years. Total, organic and labile soil carbon fractions were used to indicate different aspects of soil function, with the more active (labile) components reacting more sensitively to changes in land management. The carbon management index (CMI) was used to combine the active and passive components of soil carbon to provide a sensitive indicator of the rate of change of carbon dynamics in response to changes in land management at local-scales. A landscape CMI (CMIL) was developed using a combination of soil samples and GIS-derived spatial data and is proposed as a potentially useful tool for modelling soil carbon dynamics in agro-ecosystems at local and landscape scales.

AB  - Hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) solar systems provide a simultaneous conversion of solar radiation into electricity and heat. In these devices, the PV modules are mounted together with heat recovery units, by which a circulating fluid allows one to cool them down during their operation. An extensive study on water-cooled PV/ T solar systems has been conducted at the University of Patras, where hybrid prototypes have been experimentally studied. In this paper the electrical and thermal efficiencies are given and the annual energy output under the weather conditions of Patras is calculated for horizontal and tilted building roof installation. In addition, the costs of all system parts are included and the cost payback time is estimated. Finally, the methodology of life cycle assessment (LCA) has been applied to perform an energy and environmental assessment of the analysed system. The goal of this study, carried out at the University of Rome 'La Sapienza' by means of SimaPro 5.1 software, was to verify the benefits of heat recovery. The concepts and results of this work on energy performance, economic aspects and LCA results of modified PV and water-cooled PV/T solar systems, give a clear idea of their application advantages. From the results, the most important conclusion is that PV/T systems are cost effective and of better environmental impact compared with standard PV modules.

AB  - Germination of seed of Anigozanthos (Haemodoraceae) species is usually low and unreliable which hinders the propagation of sexually generated progeny, impedes plant breeding activities and their use in horticulture. This study was undertaken to investigate the basis of these germination problems. Seeds of cultivated Anigozanthos manglesii D. Don. were shown to possess two mechanisms for regulating seed germination, both of which were external to the embryo. Embryos germinated freely on excision and culture on nutrient agar. This first barrier is a physico-chemical barrier and can be eliminated by a brief treatment with 5 M KOH and less effectively by physical abrasion with 50% H2SO4 or 0.7% NaOCl. Release of this barrier was correlated with permeability to fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and this proved to be a more useful indicator of seed viability than 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC). The other barrier was physiological and could be eliminated by treatment with GA(3) or KNO3. Treatment of A, viridis Endl., A. humilis Lindley and A, flavidus DC. with KOH or H2SO2 with or without GA(3) elicited a small, a nil or negative response showing that mechanisms of control of germination may differ between taxa. Observations on the effects of temperature and duration of storage suggest mechanisms which may be significant in natural systems: moist stratification at 5 degrees C caused reduced germination but sustained viability (as assessed by FDA) while dry seed stored at room temperature, showed increased germination with increasing duration of storage. The chilling response may indicate the capacity to initiate secondary dormancy under unfavourable germination conditions.

AB  - Coastal areas are increasingly vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise, and the coastal Everglades is no exception. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was launched in 2000 to restore the natural flow regime to the freshwater marshes of the Everglades. However, sea level rise has been affecting coastal habitats with increasing water levels and residence times of both salinity and marine nutrients. Here, we combined empirical data of water levels and sea levels with modeled CERP restoration scenarios. Water levels and fresh-to-marine head differences (FMHDs) were used as primary indicators of the vulnerability of the Everglades coastal areas to sea level rise and evaluate the relative benefits of restoration to these habitats. Four model scenarios were considered: a simulation of existing conditions baseline (ECB), full CERP implementation (CERP0), Central Everglades Planning Project with the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir (CEPPP), and a simulation of the natural/pre-drainage system scenario (NSM). Results demonstrated the differential vulnerability of coastal areas to sea level rise. The CEPPP restoration scenario achieved at least 60% and 30% of the full CERP freshwater and FMHD benefits in Shark River Slough, the largest freshwater flow-way in ENP, and Taylor Slough, the smaller flow-way in southeastern ENP, respectively. Hence, integration of FMHD metric in restoration efforts is essential to ensure restoration benefits extend beyond the freshwater marshes and improve coastal habitats.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the research is to be investigated and assessed the significance of variables related to gingivitis in children with diagnosed pyelonephritis and nephrotic syndrome.
   Materials and Methods: The subject of the study is represented by participants in the age interval from 0 to 18 years. They are divided into two main groups, namely a group of 92 children with diagnosed pyelonephritis and 24 children with nephrotic syndrome. There is a group of 41 healthy children. Clinical, para-clinical, sociological and statistical methods are implemented in association with the study's aim. The model of the research is based on an investigation of the significance of definite variables: gingival index GI Loe-Silness, level of salivary leucocytes, salivary blood and salivary glucose. In addition to these indicators are recorded some patterns of environmental matter.
   Results: Among the participants with the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome is recorded the maximal value of GI= 2.04. A similar maximal value of GI=2.00 corresponds to the group of children with pyelonephritis. In both of the subgroups of children suffering from renal disorders is registered the considerable maximal value of salivary blood equal to 250.00 RBC/mu l, compared to the maximal value of 50.00 RISC /mu l for healthy participants. It is ascertained that the variables of salivary blood and salivary leucocytes correspond to the condition of gingivitis in children with diagnosed pyelonephritis and nephrotic syndrome.
   Conclusion: A definite impingement of excretory system disorders upon gingiva, especially among children suffering from nephrotic syndrome, is ascertained.

AB  - Repeated applications and combination of glyphosate-containing herbicides (GCH) with other herbicides are two weed management practices (WMP) used to compensate for GCH decreasing efficiency impacts in field crops. These practices may have serious impacts on soil functions because GCH affect soil biota and soil biological activity (SBA). Two field experiments, one with corn and one with soybean crops, were conducted during one growing season. SBA indicators, soil respiration (SR) and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis, were measured at two sampling times following six WMP. These WMP included one or two GCH applications (GCH alone or combined with other herbicides), applications of other herbicides only and mechanical weeding. WMP did not affect FDA neither for corn or soybean at either sampling times. In contrast, WMP affected SR in corn fields at both sampling times and SR in soybean field at the first sampling time. Repeating GCH applications and combining different herbicides led to lower SR, suggesting that these practices decreased SBA, whilst one single GCH application presented higher SR, suggesting that this practice stimulated SBA. Our study demonstrates that using GCH in combination with other herbicides or in multiple applications affects SBA in field conditions. Affecting soil functions and carbon cycle do bear serious weed management implications, and the choice of WMP should be taken into consideration to minimize their impacts on SBA for field crops sustainability.

AB  - Here we present the results of studying the effect of aerotechnogenic emissions of pulp and paper production of Mondi Syktyvkar Timber Processing Complex JSC (STPC) on the pigment system of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needles in blueberry and lichen pine forests over a 25-year observation period. We conducted comparative analysis of the indicators of the pigment complex of the pine in background and impacted areas. In 1993-1995, aerotechnogenic pollution of the environment was 20-100 times higher in the area of strong impact compared to the background and had a negative impact on the Scots pine pigment complex. Pollutants were found to inhibit the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. The pine plastid apparatus adapts to the condition of pollution by changing the ratio of pigment components. Changes in the pigment complex of needles occurred in lichen pine forests due to reduction of chlorophyll b content, in blueberry type of forest -chlorophyll a. After the decrease in volume of industrial emissions in 2015 and 2018, several changes occurred in the pigment apparatus of pine needles in the impacted area. In view of a significant reduction in industrial emissions, chloroplasts demonstrated an increase in pigment content even in the area adjacent to the emission source. With a weakening technogenic impact (in the area of moderate contamination), the photosynthetic and respiration abilities of the needles do not undergo changes. This indicates the stability of the basic processes of pine vital activity, and its resistance to pollution.

AB  - The implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy as an analytical method for the quantification of major wine parameters is limited due to the aqueous nature of wines. Water molecules contribute to a poor signal-to-noise ratio and to suppress important groups' vibrations frequencies, preventing the quantification of most chemical compounds present. This paper proposes an alternative approach for the quantification of major wine indicators based on near infrared spectroscopy using lyophilized wine samples. A diversity of wine samples, including red, white and rose, were lyophilized and analyzed by NIR spectroscopy. The parameters quantified were: alcoholic degree, volumic mass, total dry extract, total sugars, total acidity, volatile acidity, pH, free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide. Calibrations using partial least squares (PLS) regression were performed against the results obtained by reference methods. Spectra collected within 10,000 to 4000 cm(-1) range were randomly divided in two sets: one for the optimization of the PLS models and the remaining for external testing. The PLS models obtained were able to accurately quantify total sugars, pH, volumic mass and total dry extract with a range-errorratio above 10. The quantification of the remaining parameters yielded unsatisfactory results. This methodology proved to be an interesting alternative for the quantification of major wine quality descriptors by circumventing the interference of water bands. Further studies exploring different lyophilization conditions and additional wine chemical compounds present at low concentrations are needed.

AB  - Purpose Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications of pregnancy. GDM is defined as glucose intolerance of variable severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. The purpose of this paper is to produce information on prevalence, screening and diagnosis, pathophysiology and dietary, medical and lifestyle management of GDM. Design/methodology/approach This literature review aimed to document and record the results of the most updated studies published dealing with dietary, medical and lifestyle factors in managing GDM. Findings The prevalence of GDM differs worldwide based on population characteristics, race/ethnicity and diagnostic criteria. The pathophysiology of GDM is multifactorial and it is likely that genetic and environmental factors are associated with the occurrence of GDM. Medical nutritional therapy remains the mainstay of GDM management and aerobic and resistance physical activities are helpful adjunctive therapy when euglycemia is not attained by the medical nutritional therapy alone. When diet and exercise fail to achieve glycemic control, pharmacological agents such as insulin therapy and oral hypoglycemic medications are prescribed. Plasma glucose measurement is an essential part of glycemic control during pregnancy, as well as glycemic control can be evaluated using indicators of glycemic control such as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), glycated albumin and fructosamine. Originality/value This review is a comprehensive review that illustrates the effect of healthy diet, medical therapy and lifestyle change on improving GDM condition.

AB  - Samples were taken at different levels of thermal maturity in the unconventional Bakken source rock. Programmed pyrolysis derived T-max, solid bitumen reflectance, liptinite group maceral UV fluorescence, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as different thermal maturity indicators were utilized in order to compare redox-sensitive trace metal (TM) concentration to maturity variations and disclose any probable relationship. Comparing redox-sensitive TMs with total organic carbon revealed the presence of anoxic/euxinic conditions in the depositional environment of the Bakken Shale. Although some of the TMs (V and Mo) exhibit slightly positive correlations with some of the thermal maturity indices used in this study, the correlations between other redox-sensitive TMs with maturity were neutral. Collectively, this study demonstrates that thermal maturity may have an impact on some redox-sensitive TMs such as Mo and V concentrations in marine sediments. Additional samples spanning higher maturities will need to be included because there is a possibility that an increase in thermal maturity may lead to the release and liberation of some redox-sensitive TMs from the organic matter (OM) directly. Remineralization and decomposition of OM with thermal maturity advance could release sulfur as a source of thermogenic H2S, which could accelerate pore water/rock interaction and authigenic Fe-sulfides. This could enhance the capability of uptaking of most of the redox-sensitive TMs and increase their concentration in pore water.

AB  - An Environmental Risk Assessment is an efficient technical and analytical method for analyzing environmental impacts and it supports the decision-making process connected with projects variants by using historical data collection, identification of regional risk sources, probability and impact estimation of signal risk type. In this article, an Environmental Risk Assessment was performed for groundwater quality in the region of municipal landfills in Tychy-Urbanowice (Southern Poland) to assess the impact of various factors on the quality of groundwater in the region. The assessment used qualitative and quantitative risk analysis methods, including cause and consequence analysis, completion of an effect/probability matrix and utilization of the SWOT analysis method. The results of the assessment indicate that use of the SWOT analysis was the best method for groundwater risk assessment in the examined area. The analysis included an assessment of the spatial and temporal variability of leachate and groundwater quality (using data from a groundwater monitoring system), simulation of the longevity of both the top and bottom security system, spatial planning and an assessment of the impact of other parameters on groundwater, terrain and climatic conditions. The overall result for this analysis for the likely potential groundwater hazard was a score of -4. For the purposes of further risk analyses, it is possible to consider additional factors that are likely to affect the water quality of the area under investigation or to use other methods that will be based on a time series analysis.

AB  - Land use change (LUC) alters soil structure and, consequently, the functions and services provided by these soils. Conversion from extensive pasture to sugarcane is one of the largest land transitions in Brazil as a result of the growth of the domestic and global demands of bioenergy. However, the impacts of sugarcane expansion on the soil structure under extensive pasture remains unclear, especially when considering changes at the microscale. We investigated whether LUC for sugarcane cultivation impacted soil microstructure quality. Undisturbed soil samples were taken from two soil layers (0-10 and 10-20 cm) under three contrasting land uses (native vegetation-NV, pasture-PA and sugarcane-SC) in three different locations in the central-southern Brazil. Oriented thin sections (30 mu m) were used for micromorphological analysis. The total area of pores decreased following the LUC in the following order: NV > PA > SC in both soil layers. The area of large complex packing pores (>0.01 mm(2)) also decreased with the LUC sequence: NV>PA>SC. Qualitative and semi-quantitative micromorphological analysis confirmed porosity reduction was driven by the decrease in complex packing pores and that biological features decreased in the same LUC sequence as the quantitative parameters. Therefore, LUC for sugarcane expansion reduced microscale soil porosity, irrespectively of soil type and site-specific conditions, indicating that the adoption of more sustainable management practices is imperative to preserve soil structure and sustain soil functions in Brazilian sugarcane fields.

AB  - Aim. The purpose of these studies is to assess the phytotoxicity and insectoacaricidal activity of actinomycetes culture fluid. The results of phytosanitary monitoring on plantings of crops indicate the massive development of pathogens of viral phytopathogens which can spread through insects - pests and ticks. In this connection, the study of soil actinomycetes of the Astrakhan region provides a promising direction for creating a microbial preparation for regulating pests which are carriers of phytopathogenic viruses.
   Material and Methods. The phytotoxicity of the actinomycetes culture fluid was assessed in laboratory experiments on seeds of the Novichok tomato variety. Acidic and acaricidal activity was determined in the laboratory by a method based on contact interaction between the preparation and the test object.
   Results. As the result of the studies, ten isolates showed a phytotoxic effect on the Novichok tomato. The highest biometric indicators of the plants studied - biomass (15.3-17.0 mg), root length (3.7-5.0 cm) and stem length (2.0-2.7 cm) were found in variants with isolates No2, No3, No 10, No11 and No18, which also had high rates of seed germination. These isolates most actively suppressed the vitality (90-100%) of melon (Aphis gossypii Glover.) and legume (beet) (Aphis fabae Black.) aphids and spider mites (Tetranychus urticae Koch.) in laboratory conditions.
   Conclusion. The study of isolates No2, No3, No10, No11 and No18 showed high insectoacaricidal activity and phytostimulating properties. Using 16S DNA sequencing, 2 strains, No2 and No18, that are represented by Nocordiopsis umidischolae species, were identified.

AB  - In the municipality of Saboya, Boyaca, Colombia, the number of Haematobia irritans flies, coat temperature, respiratory rate, motor activity, flight distance, level of dirt and occurrence of subclinical mastitis were evaluated as indicators of animal welfare in Holstein cows reared in a silvopastoral system (association of Cenchrus clandestinus and Alnus acuminata) and a traditional system based on grazing C. clandestinus in monoculture. Monthly samplings were carried out between August 2015 and May 2016 in 20-30 lactating cows selected at random in each farm. The data were analyzed using generalized linear regression models. The number of flies per animal was higher (p<0.05) in the traditional system compared to the silvopastoral system (56 +/- 47.5 and 44 +/- 40.0 flies/animal, respectively); the average coat temperature in the animals of the traditional system was 37.4 degrees C, while 33.8 degrees C in the silvopastoral system (p<0.05). There were no differences in respiratory rate. Cows had higher feed intake during the first hours of the day in both systems. The creepage distance and level of dirt were lower in the silvopastoral system (p<0.05), while the percentages of subclinical mastitis were similar between the two systems. Silvopastoral systems favour the expression of animal welfare indicators due to the presence of trees in paddocks, which offer diversification of the ecosystem and generate better conditions for the permanence of cows in grazing.

AB  - Two commercial coating systems, each one consisting of both a primer and an antifouling ("System 1" based on Copper Oxide and "System 2" based on Zinc Oxide), have been analyzed in order to investigate their environmental impacts through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and laboratory tests.
   A cradle-to-grave analysis has been performed in order to quantify the environmental footprint of each coating solution and to define which element, material, or process mainly affect the environmental impact of such products. Moreover, it was performed a comparison between the different products to determine the most environmentally sustainable choice.
   In addition to LCA, several incubations of coated metal samples, by means of an innovative incubation system developed by the authors, have also been performed in marine water (Gulf of Naples, Mediterranean Sea, Italy), as critical environment favoring metal corrosion and biofouling generation.
   The life cycle analysis has showed that the production phase presents the highest environmental impact in almost all categories, mainly due to the use of chemical compounds. Moreover, after the laboratory tests, strong biotoxicity and contaminant diffusion, contributing to the marine toxicity potential, have been observed for both the commercial paints.
   As a final remark, there are straightforward indications of a strong need for anti-Microbial-Induced-Corrosion commercial coatings to substitute the toxic compounds with others in order to develop a greener solution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lophantera lactescens Ducke (Malphigiaceae) is an arboreal plant that propagates by seed; once exclusive to the Amazon region, it is now widely distributed in South America. The aim of this work was to study the maturation process in seeds of L. lactescens, in order to determine the point of physiological maturity and the ideal time for harvesting. The field study was conducted at the Centre for Agrarian Sciences of the Federal University of Paraiba (CCA/UFPB), Campus II, in Areia, in the State of Paraiba (PB), where the fruit was harvested every two weeks over two consecutive years. The water content, external coloration, fruit size, fruit dry weight, germination and vigour (seed germination index, and seedling length and dry weight) were evaluated. The experimental design was completely randomised, with data submitted to analysis of variance and polynomial regression, as a function of the harvest time. For the two years of the study, the water content decreased during the maturation process, reaching 11% at 210 days after anthesis. Fruit dry matter increased during the process, with rises in germination and seed vigour, reaching a maximum value between 190 and 210 days after anthesis respectively. A light-brown coloration with wrinkling of the fruit pericarp is a good visual indicator for determining the point of physiological maturity of the seeds in this species. Under the environmental conditions found in Areia PB, the ideal time for harvest and the physiological maturity of the seeds of L. lactescens are reached from 165 to 186 days after anthesis.

AB  - Passiflora edulis Sims is a liana species of high economic interest and is an interestingmodel plant for understanding ozone action on disturbed vegetation. In this work we hypothesized that P. edulis has adaptive responses to oxidative stress that enable it to tolerate ozone damage based on its capacity to grow under a diversity of environmental conditions and to dominate disturbed areas. We exposed seedlings to three levels of ozone in a Free-Air Controlled Exposure (FACE) system (22, 41 and 58 ppb h AOT40 and 13.52, 17.24 and 20.62 mmol m(-2) POD0, over 97 days) for identifying its tolerance mechanisms. Anatomical (leaf blade structure and fluorescence emission of chloroplast metabolites), physiological (leaf gas exchange, growth rate and biomass production) and biochemical (pigments, total sugars, starch, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant metabolites, reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation derivatives) responses were assessed. Ozone caused decreased total number of leaves, hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the mesophyll cells, and accelerated leaf senescence. However, O-3 did not affect carbohydrates content, net photosynthetic rate, or total biomass production, indicating that the carboxylation efficiency and associated physiological processes were not affected. In addition, P. edulis showed higher leaf contents of ascorbic acid, glutathione (as well high ratio between their reduced and total forms), carotenoids, and flavonoids located in the chloroplast outer envelope membrane.

AB  - Urbanisation is among the most severe drivers of the recent biodiversity crisis. It has been shown that stormwater ponds have a high value for the conservation of dragon- and damselflies in urban areas. However, information on the relevance of different types of stormwater ponds is lacking so far. The aim of this study was to compare the Odonata assemblages of three types of urban stormwater ponds (n per type=10): (i) ponds only containing temporary water bodies (TEMP), (ii) ponds with temporary and small perennial water bodies (TEMP/PERE) and (iii) ponds with one large perennial water body (PERE). We observed distinct differences in environmental conditions and Odonata assemblages among the three types of stormwater ponds. In particular, vegetation structure and the partly interrelated microclimate differed considerably between TEMP on the one hand, and TEMP/PERE and PERE on the other hand. Odonate species richness and exuviae density of threatened species differed, too. Due to their early successional stages with low cover of riparian woodland and shallow water bodies, TEMP were characterised by a warmer microclimate than TEMP/PERE and PERE. Odonate species richness and exuviae density of threatened species were highest in TEMP and lowest in PERE. Moreover, indicator species were only identified for TEMP. Our study showed that stormwater ponds with a temporary hydroperiod play an important role for the conservation of odonates in urban areas. This is especially the case for specialised threatened species, such as Libellula depressa and Ischnura pumilio.

AB  - In this study, the concept of phytoplankton functional groups was used to assess phytoplankton community structure in an attempt to better understand their spatial and seasonal variation in extremely alkaline Dali Nur Lake. Samples were collected for analysis during spring, summer and autumn for a period of two years. We identified 13 phytoplankton functional groups (Lo, S1, H1, P, C, MP, X3, Y, X2, W1, J, F, and T) among 37 species out of which 7 groups Lo, H1, P, C, MP, X2, and F were dominant. The biomass of phytoplankton functional groups in the Lake exhibited a strong seasonal variation with the highest biomass value observed in autumn and lowest in spring. Functional groups MP, P, and C were dominant in spring when the temperatures were very low. Groups H1 and X2 were the dominant in summer corresponding to higher temperatures. In autumn groups Lo and X2 were the dominant corresponding to high levels of total phosphorus (TP). Our study revealed that alkalinity, pH, arsenic, chemical oxygen demand, and TP are the most important physical-chemical variables structuring the phytoplankton functional groups in Dali Nur Lake. Functional groups Lo and X2 were mainly influenced by TP while groups MP and P flourished better under high conditions of arsenic. This study reveals the importance of physical-chemical variables in the spatial and seasonal gradient, in structuring phytoplankton functional groups, and consequently in the assessment of environmental status of the lake.

AB  - Eco-city is a new trend of urban development in the future. Based on the theoretical research and practice of eco-city, a discrete filtering method based on evidence theory was proposed to analyze the demand of supporting facilities for the elderly at home to improve the validity of the demand analysis of supporting facilities for the elderly at home. Firstly, the original indicators of the service quality evaluation of community pension institutions are constructed to realize the project inspection and reliability analysis of the data; Secondly, the cost function is designed for the dynamic characteristic model of the demand analysis for supporting facilities in the old-age community based on the likelihood estimation algorithm, it obtains the observation matrix of dynamic characteristics of demand analysis for supporting facilities in old-age community under the condition of discrete filtering, and achieves effective defense against noise interference. Then, a real experimental environment is established to analyze and track the needs of supporting facilities in the old-age community, and the influence of noise in the process of analyzing and locating the needs of supporting facilities in the old-age community is analyzed experimentally. The experimental results show that the algorithm designed in this paper has a higher accuracy than the locating and tracking algorithm for the needs analysis of the supporting facilities of the elderly community using the discrete filtering algorithm alone, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified.

AB  - The objective of this work was to present the tourism potential (PT) and tourism attractiveness (AT) of municipalities located in the impact areas of Polish national parks. Moreover, the classification of the municipalities based on the so-called tourism utilization rate has been elaborated. According to the analysis, the percentage of the municipalities of each type in terms of TP and TA is very similar only in the group consisting of the best municipalities (4.9% TP; 5.8% TA). In the remaining cases, the distribution is disproportionate. Municipalities with a medium tourism potential account for 78.6%, while administrative units with a low TP -16.5%. The inverse situation can be observed in the case of the TA indicator. There are 17,5% of municipalities with medium tourism offer in relation to the most numerous units with small TA (76.7%. of the municipalities). The municipalities take advantage of their natural resources and tourist virtues to various extents. 13.6 % of the analysed administrative units have implemented their tourism potential very well, which confirms that it can be regarded as a mean for the local economic development. Unfortunately, the number of municipalities where the existing conditions for leisure activities and recreation are not used in a satisfactory way is comparable (15.5%). The most numerous group is comprised of local administrative units that use their tourism potential at a medium level (36,9%). At the same time, the fact that a significant share of municipalities benefit well from the available resources (34%) should be considered positive.

AB  - The Capiru Formation consists of a low-grade meta-sedimentary succession of slates, phyllites, quartzites and marbles, disposed in blocks delimited by thrust and strike-slip faults in the Curitiba Terrane, Southern Ribeira Belt, Southern Brazil. The metamorphic and deformation records are heterogeneous, with deformed zones tectonically interbedded by domains with preserved sedimentary features. The present work aims to understand the development of mineral paragenesis based on geochemical and petrographic analysis. We selected samples of metasandstones, slates, phyllites and rhythmic phyllites, with different metamorphic and deformation records to be analysed. We selected samples with different metamorphic records to be analysed. The petrographic characterization of foliations was made through field studies supported by microtectonic analysis. The mineralogical and chemical compositions were determined by X-ray diffractometry and X-ray fluorescence, respectively. The results show a preserved sedimentary bedding (S-0), defined by sedimentary structures with top-and-bottom indicators. The S-1 foliation is related to a thrust tectonics, and it is characterized by a continuous slaty cleavage. The S-1 slaty cleavage is crenulated and cut by a millimetric S-2 cleavage. The mineral assemblage is composed by quartz, sericite, magnetite/goethite and carbonaceous material. The metamorphism was developed under low-temperature conditions (between 250-350 degrees C) and low pressure gradients (2.5-4.5 kbar). The geotectonic environment is considered as a thrust-and-fold-belt system, with structures developed in superior crust levels.

AB  - Extraction, transport and utilization of coal spread out coal dust. Nowadays, Colombia is an important producer of this mineral in South America, being the Santa Marta area one of the largest coal exporting ports in the country. The aim of this work was to assess the pollutants levels and toxicity of shoreline sediments from this place. 16 PAHs and 46 elements were measured in nine locations during dry and rainy seasons. HepG2 cells were exposed to 1% sediment extracts and mRNA expression evaluated for selected genes. PAHs levels were greater during the rainy season. The highest Sigma PAHs (89.9 ng g(-1)) appeared at a site located around 300 m far from the coast line at close proximity to the area where coal is loaded into cargo vessels for international shipments, being naphthalene the most abundant PAH. At Santa Marta Bay port, Sigma PAHs were 62.8 ng g(-1) and 72.8 ng g(-1) for dry and rainy seasons, respectively, with greatest levels for fluoranthene. Based on sediment standards, most stations have poor condition regarding Cr, but moderate contamination on Cu, Pb and Zn. Sediments from the port and coal transport sites, the most polluted by PAHs and metals, induced CYP1A1 and NQO1 during the dry season. Data showed the sediments from this shoreline have bioactive chemicals that determine their toxicological profile. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The abandonment of land is a global problem with environmental and socioeconomic implications. An approach to assess the relationship between land abandonment and a large set of indicators was illustrated in the present study by using data collected in the framework of the European Union DESIRE research project from 808 field sites located in 10 study sites in the Mediterranean region, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. A total of 48 indicators provided information for biophysical conditions and socioeconomic characteristics measured at the plot level. The selected indicators refer to farm characteristics (family status, land tenure, present and previous types of land-use, soil depth, slope gradient, tillage operations) and to site-specific characteristics including annual rainfall, rainfall seasonality and water availability. Classes were designated for each indicator and a sensitivity score was assigned to each class based on existing research or empirically assessing the importance of each indicator to the land abandonment issue. Questionnaires for each process of land degradation were prepared and data were collected at field site level in collaboration with land users. Based on correlation statistics and multivariate analyses more than ten indicators out of 48 resulted as significant in affecting land abandonment in the studied field sites. Among them, the most important were rainfall seasonality, elderly index, land fragmentation, farm size, selected soil properties, and the level of policy implementation. Results contribute to the development of appropriate tools for assessing the effectiveness of land management practices for contrasting land abandonment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chlorination for drinking water forms various disinfection byproducts (DBPs) of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). Chlorination has been attributed to the destruction of activated aromatic sites of the natural organic matter (NOM) predominantly at electron rich sites. Experiments with Istanbul surface waters showed that the magnitude of the decrease in the ultraviolet (UV) absorbance at 272nm (UV272) was an excellent indicator of destruction of these sites by chlorine. The main objective of the present study is to develop the differential UV272 absorbance (Delta UV272) related models for the prediction of the formation of THM, HAA, and their species in raw water samples from Terkos, Buyukcekmece, and Omerli lakes under different chlorination conditions. Significant factors affecting DBP formation in the raw waters were identified through numerical and graphical techniques. The R-2 values of the models varied between 0.94 and 0.97, indicating excellent predictive ability for THM4 and HAA(9) in the raw waters. The models were validated using additional data. The results of this study concluded that addition of Delta UV272 parameter into THM4 and HAA(9) models make the prediction of these DBP compounds more precisely than those of DBP models developed in the past. A better understanding of these modeling systems will help the water treatment plant operators to minimize the DBP formation, providing a healthier and better drinking water quality as well as identifying strategies to improve water treatment and disinfection processes.

AB  - Samples were collected from 10 stations distributed through three sectors in Guanabara Bay during two consecutive years, in order to determine factors that influence the spatial pattern of molluscs and to describe the structure and composition of this community in a eutrophic estuarine system on the Brazilian coast. Although only one species, the gastropod Heleobia australis, comprised 77% of mollusc abundance, 59 species were identified in the bay. In addition to H. australis, three other species were dominant: the gastropod Anachis isabellei and the bivalves Americuna besnardi and Ervilia concentrica. The mollusc communities were significantly influenced by the spatial gradient; the outermost sector has marine conditions, and the other sectors are typically estuarine, leading to differences in the composition and abundance of molluscs. The outermost sector showed the highest diversity, which gradually decreased towards the innermost sector where the dominance of a few opportunistic species is favoured by highly organic mud sediments. Sediment type was strongly correlated with mollusc occurrence in the bay. Guanabara Bay showed two indicator species: the bivalve E. concentrica of the outer sector, and the gastropod H. australis of the intermediate sector. Our results suggest that benthic molluscs in Guanabara Bay show characteristics related to levels of environmental impact. A monitoring programme based on this community is needed to evaluate the effects of human impacts on this community and to monitor changes in its biodiversity in Guanabara Bay.

AB  - Agroecosystems can serve as multifunctional landscapes when treed habitats such as woodlots, hedgerows, riparian buffers, windbreaks, and orchards, are conserved on farms. We investigated the extent, pattern, and multifunctionality of on-farm treed habitats for 16 Vermont farms in the Lamoille watershed of the Lake Champlain Basin. The site was selected because the land use pattern is representative of the region, containing a mixture of agriculture and forest in different habitat types. We used a GIS-based approach to delineate treed habitats on farms and conducted semi-structured interviews with farmers to explore their perception of the functions of treed habitats. Through an evaluation of the relationship between farm characteristics and spatial attributes of treed habitats, we found farm size to be an important variable. Larger farms had more land in treed habitats, while the pattern of these habitats was more complex on smaller farms. Average elevation of the farm, an indicator of biophysical conditions, was a stronger predictor of the extent of treed habitats than farm characteristics. From interviews, we found that farmers benefited from alternative forest products, both for direct consumption and sale, including firewood, timber, maple sugar, edible fruits and nuts, and wood crafts. Most farmers also recognized cultural and ecological functions provided by treed habitats. These results have implications for developing policies to promote the conservation of treed habitats, considering the preferences of the landowner or farmer.

AB  - Subfossil midge remains were identified in surface sediment recovered from 88 lakes in the central Canadian Arctic. These lakes spanned five vegetation zones, with the southern-most lakes located in boreal forest and the northern-most lakes located in mid-Arctic tundra. The lakes in the calibration are characterized by ranges in depth, summer surface-water temperature (SSWT), average July air temperature (AJAT) and pH of 15.5 m, 10.60A degrees C, 8.40A degrees C and 3.69, respectively. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that maximum depth, pH, AJAT, total nitrogen-unfiltered (TN-UF), Cl and Al capture a large and statistically significant fraction of the overall variance in the midge data. Inference models relating midge abundances and AJAT were developed using different approaches including: weighted averaging (WA), weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) and partial least squares (PLS). A chironomid-based inference model, based on a two-component WA-PLS approach, provided robust performance statistics with a high coefficient of determination (r (2) = 0.77) and low root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP = 1.03A degrees C) and low maximum bias. The use of a high-resolution gridded climate data set facilitated the development of the midge-based inference model for AJAT in a region with a paucity of meteorological stations and where previously only the development of a SSWT inference model was possible.

AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms tend to be more common in warm and nutrient-enriched waters and are increasing in many aquatic water bodies due to eutrophication. The aim of this work is to study the accumulation and deputation of anatoxin-a by Mytilus galloprovincialis a widespread distributed mussel living in estuarine and coastal waters and recognized worldwide as a bioindicator (e.g. Mussel Watch programs). Research on the distribution and biological effects of anatoxin-a in M. galloprovincialis is important. Nevertheless, the risk of human intoxication due to the consumption of contaminated bivalves should also be considered. A toxic bloom was simulated in an aquarium with 5 x 10(5) cell ml(-1) of Anabaena sp. (ANA 37), an anatoxin-a producing strain. Mussels were exposed to Anabaena for 15 days and then 15 days of depuration followed. Three or more animals were sampled every 24 h for total toxin quantification and distribution in soft tissues (edible parts). Water samples were also taken every 24 h in order to calculate total dissolved and particulate anatoxin-a concentrations. Anatoxin-a was quantified by HPLC with fluorescence detection. No deaths occurred during accumulation and depuration periods. One day after the beginning of deputation, the toxin could not be detected in the animals. Anatoxin-a is distributed in the digestive tract, muscles and foot and is probably actively detoxified. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Only a few studies of psychosocial determinants of employee health and organizational development have been prospective, involving more than one organization and applying standardized assessment tools. This limits the ability of providing evidence-based guidance as how to carry out healthy organizational transformations. Methods: A total of 6,000 employees responded twice to a validated psychosocial-leadership questionnaire within a 2-year period. The assessment focused on changes over time in the three outcome measures-mental health, efficacy, and leadership, determined to be important indicators of a healthy organization. Changes within and between organization were assessed statistically using regular t tests and general linear modeling. Results: There were major differences between organizations in psychosocial measures, both at the baseline and over time. At the organizational level, changes between study periods in management performance feedback, participatory management, and work tempo were the most consistent predictors of improvements over time in the three outcome measures. Conclusions: Performance feedback and participatory management might be two common predictors of healthy workplaces. Some of the psychosocial determinants of healthy organizations suggested in previous research might not be universally valid. It is suggested that future research should to a larger degree make use of multiple departments and organizations in studies of psychosocial determinants of healthy organizations.

AB  - A regional adaptation analysis was conducted to provide a basis for effective and efficient wheat germplasm exchange between Australia and the WANA region. A set of 38 Australian and CIMMYT/ICARDA genotypes was tested for grain yield in 29 environments in Australia and the WANA region for 3 years commencing in 1994-95 season. Classification analysis of grain yield data identified 9 genotypic groups and 5 environmental groups with similar patterns in yield performance within each group. Genotypes with similar origin and pedigree were similar in yield performance across environments in Australia and the WANA region. Environmental conditions across both regions showed similarity in discriminating genotypes for their yield performance. Genotypes Attila, Spear, Excalibur, and 82Y:1186 were highest yielding in Australia and the WANA region. However, genotypes Nesser, Pfau/Seri//Bow, Hartog, Vulcan, and Sunland showed wide adaptation across both regions. Genotypes Cranbrook, Genaro 81, Seri 82, Kauz, SUN 190A, and Pgo/Seri 82 showed specific adaptation to favourable environments. Genotypes in each group, based on yield performance, showed differing degrees of yield stability. Pfau/Seri//Bow has the potential for release for commercial production in Australia and the WANA region. The genotypes Pfau/Seri//Bow, Hartog, Sunland, and Vulcan could be used in trials in both regions as indicator varieties to evaluate new breeding lines for mutual exchange between the 2 sets of breeding programs.

TI  - Evaluation of hoof wall surface temperature as an index of digital vascular perfusion during the prodromal and acute phases of carbohydrate-induced laminitis in horses
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Objective-To evaluate the use of hoof wall surface temperature (HWST) as an indirect indicator of digital perfusion and to describe HWST patterns during the prodromal and acute phases of carbohydrate-induced laminitis in horses.
   Animals-30 adult horses without fool abnormalities.
   Procedures-Three experiments were performed. In the first, HWST was measured in 2 groups of horses acclimatized to hot (n = 6), or cold (6) environments and exposed to cold (15 C) ambient temperature. In the second experiment, HWST were measured in both forefeet of 6 horses before and after application of a tourniquet to 1 forefoot to induce vascular occlusion. In the third experiment, HWST were recorded in 12 horses before and during the prodromal and acute phases of carbohydrate-induced laminitis.
   Results-Mean HWST of hot-acclimatized cold-challenged horses was significantly less than that of cold-acclimatized cold-challenged horses at all times. Transient episodes of high HWST were observed during prolonged cold-induced vasoconstriction. Hoof wall surface temperature significantly decreased during arterial occlusion and increased during reperfusion. Digital hypothermia was observed during the prodromal phase of carbohydrate-induced laminitis.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Determination of HWST is a valid technique to evaluate digital perfusion under appropriate controlled conditions in horses. Digital hypothermia detected during the prodromal phase of laminitis is consistent with decreased digital vascular perfusion or metabolic activity. If administered to horses during the prodromal phase, agents that enhance digital perfusion may prevent development of laminitis.

AB  - Long-chain C-37 to C-40 alkenones with di-, tri-, and tetra-unsaturation are very abundant in sediment trap material and Holocene to Late Pleistocene core samples from the Earth's largest soda lake, Lake Van (Turkey). Thus, the known distribution range of these typical biomarkers for haptophyte microalgae is extended to highly alkaline environments. The observed unsaturation patterns differ strikingly from those found in open marine haptophytes and sediments by an enhanced relative abundance of the tetra-unsaturated compounds, especially the C-37:4 methyl ketone. Their preponderance is suggested to be a facies marker pattern for lacustrine and marginal marine areas of sedimentation. Using published U-37(K) calibrations, no reliable absolute temperatures were obtained for the Lake Van samples. Accordingly, marine sea surface temperature determinations based on long-chain alkenones should be applied with caution when a contribution of these compounds from coastal or nonmarine sources can not be excluded. The presence of tetrahymanol and gammacer-3-one in the Lake Van materials is attributed to organic matter contributions of ciliates. The relative abundance of long-chain alkenones and of tetrahymanol/ gammacer-3-one is considered to reflect changes in the environmental conditions, in particular in the hydrological setting. We suggest that times of pronounced stagnation are recognised by very high tetrahymanol/gammacer-3-one concentrations together with drastically increased stanol/stenol ratios, and intervals of enhanced convection or of high freshwater input are characterised by high alkenone contributions.

AB  - Anticipating sowing date in spring-sown crops is an agronomic strategy often suggested in Europe to escape water and heat stresses during the most susceptible growth periods occurring in early summer. This strategy was evaluated experimentally in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) by comparing early and conventional sowing dates for a range of cultivars grown in 18 "site x year" environments from southern France between 2010 and 2018. Conventional sowing often resulted in higher grain yields than early sowing, the latter being more favorable to grain size and protein concentration. STICS crop growth model was used to calculate dynamic abiotic (radiation, water, high and low temperatures, nitrogen) stress factors influencing the main crop physiological processes. Ecoclimatic and STICS-based agrophysiological indicators were used in a PLS (Partial Least Squares) regression as explanatory variables of grain yield (r(2) = 0.33). The key indicators were radiation interception from emergence to maturity, severe stomatal water stress during all the reproductive phase and high temperature since the beginning of grain filling. STICS crop model was used to characterize the 157 "cultivar x site x year x sowing date x irrigation" environments, according to water, heat and cold stresses importance in different phenophases. Then 5 profiles of abiotic stresses emerged from a clustering analysis in two steps by hierarchical ascending classification and K-means. STICS-based environmental characterization was used to explain the relative success or failure of early sowing dates and early-maturing cultivars.

AB  - The diversity of alien plant species in the Russian part of the Arctic (RA) is analyzed by generalizing different publications. Alien plant species are found in all regions of the RA, but their share in regional floras is relatively small compared with more southern biomes and is unevenly distributed, from 1-2% in the north of Yakutia and in the continental part of Chukotka to 22-27% on the Kola Peninsula and in the Bolsheze-melskaya tundra. The low species diversity of alien species in the RA is explained by two groups of factors. The first one includes social and economic indicators: relatively late and still focal economic development of the region and generally low human migration activity here. The second one combines natural factors, among which the climate is of paramount importance. It has been shown that plurizonal species with the northern border of their ranges in the boreal zone are mainly introduced into the RA, but the direct donor regions are often not known when alien species are introduced. These species are clearly better adapted to a wide range of conditions, allowing them to survive in the harsh Arctic climate. By the way of invasion into the RA, unin-tentionally introduced species prevail, and transport, migration activity, Arctic tourism, and introduction with contaminated materials are the main pathways. The distribution of alien species is local, and it is mostly associated with settlements and industrial centers.

AB  - Solar energy has been one of the accessible and affordable renewable energy technologies for the last few decades. Photovoltaics and solar thermal collectors are mature technologies to harness solar energy. However, the efficiency of photovoltaics decays at increased operating temperatures, and solar thermal collectors suffer from low exergy. Furthermore, along with several financial, structural, technical and socio-cultural barriers, the limited shadow-free space on building rooftops has significantly affected the adoption of solar energy. Thus, Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) collectors that combine the advantages of photovoltaic cells and solar thermal collector into a single system have been developed. This study gives an extensive review of different PVT systems for residential applications, their performance indicators, progress, limitations and research opportunities. The literature review indicated that PVT systems used air, water, bi-fluids, nanofluids, refrigerants and phase-change material as the cooling medium and are sometimes integrated with heat pumps and seasonal energy storage. The overall efficiency of a PVT system reached up to 81% depending upon the system design and environmental conditions, and there is generally a trade-off between thermal and electrical efficiency. The review also highlights future research prospects in areas such as materials for PVT collector design, long-term reliability experiments, multi-objective design optimisation, techno-exergo-economics and photovoltaic recycling.

AB  - Among the list of all-natural hazards, the unique characteristic of drought is its multiplex nature. Besides, the inherited regional characteristics and seasonal variation of drought make it more complicated. Conventional drought indices are inadequate to integrate seasonal and local elements. Therefore, to integrate seasonal components and regional factors, the present study emphasizes the following features: the existence of multiple drought monitoring indicators, the regional broadcasting of drought-related statistics, and seasonal fluctuations. The seasonally blended regionally integrated drought index (SBRIDI) based on two-stage Bayesian network theory comprehensively captures seasonal and regional variability embedded in individual drought indicators and regionally scattered homogeneous meteorological stations. It extracts information from a widely accepted standardized precipitation index and other multiscalar variants (standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, standardized precipitation temperature index). It offers a better estimate of drought severity and pattern in the whole study region. The application of the SBRIDI is based on six meteorological stations located in the Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan. Among 216 time series datasets, the stage I Bayesian network selects 72 seasonally relevant standardized drought indices datasets, and the stage II Bayesian network selects 12 of the seasonally most prominent meteorological station datasets. Temporal graphical evidence shows that the SBRIDI can assess the drought risk and depicts the spatial extent of drought conditions at the regional level. The SBRIDI can highlight hotspots of drought-prone regions, which could help freshwater management agencies and stakeholders.

KW  - Geoeconomics
KW  - Crisis
AB  - Between 2003 and 2018, Brazil experienced opposing socioeconomic conditions. Until 2013/14, the economy continued to grow, socioeconomic indicators improved, and much of this was driven by investments in the oil and natural gas sector headed by Petrobras. Within these, investments in technological development to make the new exploratory frontier for the pre-salt feasible stood out. In this sector, the geoeconomic performance of the Brazilian government, making Petrobras the protagonist with a new regulatory framework for exploration and reinforcing the Local Content Policy (PCL), in addition to stimulating investments in a large number of complementary sectors, made the state company gain even more prominence on the world market. However, as of 2014, the sum of domestic and international factors brought about a turnaround in this virtuous period. Deeply affected by Operation Lava Jato, by the sharp devaluation of oil in the international market between 2014 and 2016, Petrobras had its direction radically changed, especially in the governments of Michel Temer and Jair Bolsonaro. Since then, dealing with a new management philosophy, it has been reducing its investments and having privatized exploration fields, segments and subsidiaries. In this scenario, stagnant growth and even a reduction in GDP, rising unemployment, currency devaluation, an increase in the concentration of wealth and political instability are latent in the country. Thus, based on the analysis of recent reports and articles, the objective of this paper is to clarify these two moments and show how Petrobras and the oil and natural gas sector are at the center of the recent political and socioeconomic events in Brazilian society.

AB  - The late Miocene provides the chance to assess the changing boundary conditions on a warmer world than present. While the climate variability is well understood for the oceanographic records, the water availability and dynamics in terrestrial environment in the densely populated East Asian remains enigmatic. Little is known about the precipitation response to the Antarctic ice-sheets during this time interval. To understand this critical relationship between low- and high-latitude climates, we use a new indicator based on the carbonate variability in Red Earth on the northern Chinese Loess Plateau to reconstruct water availability throughout the interval (7.5-6.9 Ma). Our high-resolution reconstructions show that the carbonate leaching/reprecipitation cycle is dominantly forced by the astronomical parameter obliquity (40-kyr) that is in accord with the Antarctic ice-volume controlled oceanography records at similar to 7 Ma. Supported by goethite and hematite records in the same site, soil temperatures and precipitations are fully coupled, interpreted as marking the climate pattern of Asian monsoon during the late Miocene. Cyclic correlation between the carbonate variability and the goethite, hematite data, reveal that the obliquity controlled precipitation oscillations were superimposed on a long-term increase of the Asian monsoon, which was synchronous with intensification of climate cooling, the declining of partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and the growing of Antarctic ice-volume. Combined with the atmospheric- and oceanic-adjustments, we suggest that the cross-equatorial pressure gradient has led to the rise of Asian monsoon.

AB  - This research under field experimental conditions was conducted to evaluate the effects of nutrient management on delta N-15, delta C-13 isotopes and soil enzyme activities in higher altitude agricultural soils. Three composite soil samples were collected from each of the organic management (ORG), inorganic management (IM) and control (CON) experimental plots from the fall of September 2017 to August 2018. delta N-15 was significantly higher (8.95 parts per thousand) in ORG soils compared than IM (8.07 parts per thousand) and CON (6.36 parts per thousand). In contrast delta C-13 was higher (-16.49 parts per thousand) in CON soils compared to IM (-19.26 parts per thousand) and ORG (-19.8 parts per thousand). Soils from ORG had significantly higher levels of total N, total C, total S, organic carbon, available N, extractable P, Soil organic carbon stock, exchangeable K and enzyme activities compared to IM and CON. Urease, beta - glucosidase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, invertase, cellulase and dehydrogenase activities were significantly increased the delta N-15 and reduced delta C-13 in agricultural soils. Our results suggested that organic management had improved the delta N-15, plant available nutrients and soil enzyme activities. Stable delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotopes are good indicators to monitor the soil health and C and N biogeochemical cycles in higher altitude agricultural soils.

AB  - The current study purposes to assess the impact of institutional pressures (coercive, mimetic, and normative) on environmental performance of the firm along with the mediation of implementation of environmental management accounting and moderation of environmental proactivity between them. Quantitative data are collected through structured questionnaire from 500 middle-level and top-level managers and owners of manufacturing firms of Pakistan. Data are analyzed through SPSS and AMOS in which structural equation modeling in performed to assess hypotheses. Findings show that coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures are significant derivers of environmental performance. It is further found that coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures significantly enhance the implementation of environmental management accounting, which in turn enhances the environmental performance of the firm. Furthermore, environmental proactivity is found to be a significant moderator between mimetic pressure and environmental performance while no moderation by environmental proactivity is confirmed in relationships of coercive pressure and normative pressure with environmental performance. The current findings are anticipated to assist practitioners in strategy development and execution to improve environmental performance of the firm and policymaking to control environmental impacts of businesses and improve environmental conditions in the country. The current study is the first one to empirically examine the moderating role of environmental proactivity and mediating role of execution of environmental management accounting between institutional pressures and environmental performance in context of Pakistan; so, it will open new areas of discussion and analysis for researchers in the domain of institutional theory.

AB  - The modern technology brought new engineering materials (e.g. nanostructured materials) with advantageous characteristics such as a high capacity to decontaminate water from pollutants (for example metal(loid)s). Among those innovative materials the synthesis of nanostructured materials (NSMs) based on graphene as graphene oxide (GO) functionalized with polyethyleneimine (GO-PEI) had a great success due to their metal removal capacity from water. However, research dedicated to environmental risks related to the application of these materials is still non-existent. To evaluate the impacts of such potential stressors, benthic species can be a good model as they are affected by several environmental constraints. Particularly, the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis has been identified by several authors as a bioindicator that responds quickly to environmental disturbances, with a wide spatial distribution and economic relevance. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the impacts caused in M. galloprovincialis by seawater previously contaminated by Hg and decontaminated using GO-PEI. For this, histopathological and biochemical alterations were examined. This study demonstrated that mussels exposed to the contaminant (Hg), the decontaminant (GO-PEI) and the combination of both (Hg + GO-PEI) presented an increment of histopathological, oxidative stress and metabolic alterations if compared to organisms under remediated seawater and control conditions The present findings highlight the possibility to remediate seawater with nanoparticles for environmental safety purposes.

AB  - The study was conducted to establish the differences in the expression pattern of different cell surface toll-like-receptors (TLRs) between indigenous Osmanabadi and Salem Black goats subjected to summer season induced heat stress. The primary objective of the study is to assess the thermo-tolerance ability of these two breeds based on maintaining the immune status during exposure to heat stress. The results indicated that the expression of TLR1, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, and TLR10 genes in both the breeds showed different expression pattern. The expression pattern of all these genes did not differed between the control (OC) and heat stress (OHS) group in Osmanabadi breed but significantly higher (P<0.05) expression of these genes were reported in heat stress group (SBHS) as compared to control group (SBC) in Salem Black breed. However, the striking difference was established in the expression pattern of TLR2 between these breeds. The TLR expression was significantly higher in heat stress group of Osmanabadi breed. But TLR2 did not express in Salem Back breed. The higher expression of most of the cell surface TLRs in the SBHS group as compared to OHS group indicates the superior resilient capacity of Salem Black goats to maintain immune status even during exposure to adverse environmental condition. Further, these TLRs could serve as indicators to reflect better thermo-tolerance of Salem Black breed over Osmanabadi breed.

AB  - Lactobacillus salivarius is a species of lactic acid bacteria with probiotic potency. Compared to such well-known probiotics as L. rhamnosus and L. casei, the genomic characteristics and health-beneficial effects of L. salivarius are inadequately researched. For this study, a medium with enhanced selectivity for the isolation of L. salivarius was developed by optimizing the carbon source and antibiotics in the medium. Seventy-three L. salivarius strains were isolated from 472 fecal samples from Chinese populations, and their pan-genomic and phylogenetic characterizations were analyzed. Three strains (L. salivarius HN26-4, NT4-8, and FXJCJ7-2) that were clearly categorized in different sub-phylotypes of the phylogenetic tree were randomly selected for further studies. Compared to the other two tested strains, L. salivarius FXJCJ7-2 showed higher tolerance to simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions and more significant anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-treated RAW264.7 murine macrophages. This strain was also more effective in reversing LPS-induced alterations in gut barrier function, colonic histopathology, Treg/Th-17 balance, immunomodulatory indicators, nuclear factor kappa B pathway activation, and the intestinal microenvironment of the mice than the other two tested strains. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that these protective effects may be related to the specific genes of L. salivarius FXJCJ7-2 that were involved in the tolerance to the gastrointestinal environment, short-chain fatty acid production, and host-bacterium interaction.

AB  - Understanding variations in the reproductive cycle of commercial and ecologically important bivalve species is essential to address fisheries management and climate oscillation issues. Spatial and temporal trends in the reproductive cycle of Callista chione were analysed using standard histological procedures and gonadosomatic index (GSI) for two consecutive years at two coastal sites in the Adriatic Sea. Reproductive output and fecundity were analysed quantitatively to gain better insight into the seasonal energy balance with respect to gametogenesis. A seawater temperature difference of similar to 4 degrees C between the two sites likely influenced the onset and duration of spawning. At Cetina (milder temperatures), spawning was prolonged and occurred between spring and July, whereas at Pag there was only one main spawning peak in July. Both histology and GSI showed similar trends, indicating GSI to be a reliable method for analysing the main characteristics of the reproductive cycle. Conversely, the use of the body mass index (BMI) as an indicator of gonad development should be addressed carefully. Intraspecific variation in energy allocation between populations suggested life strategies modified to different habitat conditions. A higher reproductive investment and output in the Pag population directed gonadal resorption to ensure the generation of a new cycle, whereas the higher fecundity at the Cetina site indicated the production of gonads from newly available food. These results suggest successful physiological acclimatization to recent increasing temperatures.

AB  - Lead and mancozeb are two important chemicals used for different human purposes and activities worldwide. Hazard assessment in different areas of the world is carried out with different but phylogenetically similar species, adapted to different climatic conditions, in order to increase relevance. This study evaluated the sensitivity of two monophyletic species, the tropical species Daphnia similis and the temperate species Daphnia magna, to the two chemicals lead and mancozeb. Standard acute and chronic ecotoxicological tests (reproduction and growth), as well as other sublethal measurements such as the intrinsic rate of population increase (r), feeding rate (FR) and O-2 consumption, were recorded along with the analysis of the AChE activity to determine the neurotoxicity of both contaminants. Albeit their similar evolutionary status, D. magna generally presented a lower sensitivity to Pb in comparison to D. similis. Despite the differences in sensitivity, both species presented similar patterns of response under Pb exposure, with diminished reproductive outputs, feeding impairment, reduced O-2 consumption and no effect on AChE activity. Mancozeb decreased the reproduction, rate of population increase and feeding rate, increased the AChE activity in both species and increased O-2 consumption only in D. magna. While D. magna increased O-2 consumption under mancozeb exposure, no effects were observed for D. similis. Thus, species may present different responses and sensitivities to different pollutants, regardless of their phylogeny. Therefore, the use of ecotoxicological assays with native species is crucial for a better ecological risk assessment in contaminated areas.

AB  - Aim: Isolation and characterization of Halothiobacillus sp. from the shrimp aquaculture farm soil and their sulphur oxidation ability and utilization of H2S in in-vitro model.
   Methodology: Starkeys mineral salt medium was used to screen autotrophic sulphur oxidizing bacteria. For the qualitative screening, bacterial isolates were inoculated in mineral salt medium containing bromo phenol blue indicator to monitor change in pH. The isolates were studied further for their sulphate ion production, sulphur oxidase enzyme production and utilization of Na2S. Identification was carried out by conventional biochemical and molecular methods.
   Results: Fifty isolates showed distinct sulphur oxidizing ability on the mineral salt medium. The pH reduction test revealed that out of fifty isolates six could efficiently reduce the pH of the medium to 3.0 from an initial pH of 7 within 96 hr of incubation at 30oC. Maximum sulphate ion (12.65 mg ml-1) and sulphur oxidase enzyme (16.64 mM sulphate hr-1 ml-1) was produced by a bacterial isolate, Halothiobacillus sp. strain rk3. All the six isolates efficiently utilized Na2S in in-vitro conditions. Conventional and molecular identification (16S rRNA sequence analysis) revealed that the sulphur oxidizing bacterial isolates belonged to Halothiobacillus spp. Furthermore, sequencing similarity calculation showed an average nucleotide identity (ANI) values higher than 99% which suggests that the isolates were not genetically different.
   [GRAPHICS]
   Interpretation: The present investigation revealed the presence of Halothiobacillus sp. as natural microflora of farm soils in shrimp aquaculture.

AB  - Plant selection for rain gardens can be complicated, as cyclic flooding and a gradient of moisture level are expected in the depression structure of a rain garden. However, few studies to date have quantified how plant establishment is affected by rain garden moisture dynamics. This study investigated tolerance of 15 candidate perennial species, which experienced flooding cycles consisting of 1-day and 4-day inundation and draining phases. In this study, detection of species suitability using survival and growth measurements coupled with the stress indicator (i.e. chlorophyll fluorescence) provided a valid framework for wider use in plant selection for rain gardens. The methodology is also confident in predicting the possible placing in different plant moisture zones. All species survived the cyclic flooding treatments and grew to their maximum. Photosynthesis and physical growth in only a few candidate species (e.g. Amsonia tabernaemontana var. salicifolia, Gaura lindheimeri, Sanguisorba tenuifolia 'Purpurea' and Thalictrum aquilegifolium) tended to be inhibited by treatments adopting 4-day cyclic flooding, whilst tolerance to 1-day cyclic flooding was clearly demonstrated in most species. Analysis suggests that most species assumed to withstand infrequent to periodic inundation, such as Iris sibirica, Filipendula purpurea and Miscanthus sinensis, are resilient species and are sensible for use in a wider range of rain garden moisture conditions from damp depression bottom to dry margin. Species assumed to be intolerant of inundation such as Gaura lindheimeri may be successful in the rain garden environment, but they are recommended for the dryer zones.

AB  - Automating grapevine growth monitoring, spraying, leaf thinning and harvesting tasks, as well as improving yield estimation and plant phenotyping, requires reliable methods for detecting grape bunches across different vineyard environmental and plant variety conditions, in which illumination, occlusions, colors and contrast are the main challenges to computer vision techniques. This work presents a method that employs visible spectrum cameras for robust grape berries recognition and grape bunch detection that does not require artificial illumination nor is limited to red or purple grape varieties. The proposed approach relies on shape and texture information together with a strategy to separate regions of clustered pixels into grape bunches. The approach employs histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) as shape descriptor and local binary patterns (LBP) to obtain texture information. A review of the existing methods and comparative analysis of different feature vectors (DAISY, DSIFT, HOG, LBP) and support vector classifiers (SVM-RBF, SVDD) is also presented. Datasets from four countries containing 163 images of different grapevine varieties acquired under different vineyard illumination and occlusion levels were employed to assess the approach. Grapes bunches are detected with an average precision of 88.61% and average recall of 80.34%. Single berries are detected with precision rates above 99% and recall rates between 84.0% and 92.5% on average. The proposed approach should facilitate the estimation of yield, crop thinning measurements and the computation of leaf removal indicators, as well as the implementation guidance strategies for precise robotic harvesters.

AB  - Due to its remote and isolated location, Antarctica is home to a unique diversity of species. The harsh conditions have shaped a primarily highly adapted endemic fauna. This includes the notothenioid family Channichthyidae. Their exceptional physiological adaptations have made this family of icefish the focus of many studies. However, studies on their ecology, especially on their parasite fauna, are comparatively rare. Parasites, directly linked to the food chain, can function as biological indicators and provide valuable information on host ecology (e.g., trophic interactions) even in remote habitats with limited accessibility, such as the Southern Ocean. In the present study, channichthyid fish (Champsocephalus gunnari: n = 25, Chaenodraco wilsoni: n = 33, Neopagetopsis ionah: n = 3, Pagetopsis macropterus: n = 4, Pseudochaenichthys georgianus: n = 15) were collected off South Shetland Island, Elephant Island, and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (CCAML statistical subarea 48.1). The parasite fauna consisted of 14 genera and 15 species, belonging to the six taxonomic groups including Digenea (four species), Nematoda (four), Cestoda (two), Acanthocephala (one), Hirudinea (three), and Copepoda (one). The stomach contents were less diverse with only Crustacea (Euphausiacea, Amphipoda) recovered from all examined fishes. Overall, 15 new parasite-host records could be established, and possibly a undescribed genotype or even species might exist among the nematodes.

AB  - Analyses in palynofacies and dinoflagellates from Site U1430 core drilled at the Eastern South Korea Plateau (ESKP) in the East Sea by IODP Expedition 346 were carried out to interpret paleoenvironments. From an analysis of the palynofacies, three units of paleoenvironment are recognized in ascending order: Distal Basin, Distal Shelf, and Shelf-Basin transition. We inferred that these marine environmental changes were caused by not only global sea level changes, but also tectonic activities on the East Sea during the late Miocene. Tuberculodinium vancampoae that is known as a warm water dinoflagellate and an indicator of the Tsushima Warm Current was first present at 8.12 Ma from the U1430. As the Korea Strait was closed during the 15-3.5 Ma period, the presence of T. vancampoae at 8.12 Ma might have been transported by the other gateway such as Fossa Magna Strait. This gateway that was connected to the western Pacific Ocean plays a role to inflow warm water of oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) water to the East Sea. In overall, marine origin amorphous organic matter (AOM) in this study was predominated through the whole section, indicating that the site of the U1430 at ESKP was entirely reduced marine environment. We might assume that suboxic and anoxic conditions occurred alternately under the reduced environments controlled by the influx of OMZ warm water through the Fossa Magna Strait in central Honshu, Japan.

AB  - To date, the tree-ring chronology of peat-preserved pines from Northwest Germany (Fig. 1) spans from 6703 BC to 1166 BC, but still contains two gaps. It was dated with the help of the previously constructed bog-oak chronology of Northwest Germany, the older part of which in turn has been dated using the pine chronology (Fig. 2), now covering from 6628 to 6178 BC additional to the previous span of 6069 BC to 931 AD. Compared to the oaks, chronology construction required large numbers of samples of the short-lived pine trees, many of which remained undated or dated relatively only. The dendrochronological process, which at times delivered a multitude of floating chronology fragments, was complemented by a number of radiocarbon dates. Preceding and following the calendar-dated pine chronology, there are radiocarbon dated floating chronologies. This pine record partly dates back to the beginning of the 9th millennium BC and documents environmental conditions during the early Holocene. It also shows the potential of the chronology to be extended further into the past.
   The Northwest German pine chronology has since been the base for dating i.a. archaeological finds, such as Neolithic wooden bog trackways. Moreover, the peat-preserved pines have proved to be valuable in palaeoenvironmental research, as they grew at sites where they were sensitive to hydrological changes. Particularly the climate-related advances of raised bog are well reflected in the material.

AB  - Objectives: Average adult height of a population is considered a biomarker of the quality of the health environment and economic conditions. The causal relationships between height and income inequality are not well understood. We analyze data from 169 countries for national average heights of men and women and national-level economic factors to test two hypotheses: (1) income inequality has a greater association with average adult height than does absolute income; and (2) neither income nor income inequality has an effect on sexual dimorphism in height.
   Methods: Average height data come from the NCD-RisC health risk factor collaboration. Economic indicators are derived from the World Bank data archive and include gross domestic product (GDP), Gross National Income per capita adjusted for personal purchasing power (GNI_ PPP), and income equality assessed by the Gini coefficient calculated by the Wagstaff method.
   Results: Hypothesis 1 is supported. Greater income equality is most predictive of average height for both sexes. GNI_ PPP explains a significant, but smaller, amount of the variation. National GDP has no association with height. Hypothesis 2 is rejected. With greater average adult height there is greater sexual dimorphism. Conclusions: Findings support a growing literature on the pernicious effects of inequality on growth in height and, by extension, on health. Gradients in height reflect gradients in social disadvantage. Inequality should be considered a pollutant that disempowers people from the resources needed for their own healthy growth and development and for the health and good growth of their children.

AB  - This paper addresses the changes in the morphology and sedimentology of a micro-tidal mixed sand and gravel beach (Playa Granada, southern Spain) forced by wave and water-level variations, and human intervention through nourishment. Monthly and storm event-driven beach surveys, consisting of topographical measurements and sediment sampling in two selected areas, were carried out over a one-year period. Three prevailing sediment fractions (sand, fine gravel and coarse gravel) and two end-member morphological states of the upper beach profile (convex with multiple berms and concave with a single storm berm) were identified. Between them, several transitional profiles were formed, characterized by developing berms that progressively overlapped, generating sediment variability both across the beach profile and with depth. The results indicate that the total run-up (including water-level) reached during an event represents a more accurate threshold for differentiating between erosional and depositional conditions than wave height. They also suggest that mixed sand and gravel beaches recover faster from storm erosion than sandy beaches. The long-term benefit of the artificial nourishment that took place at the end of the survey period was very limited and this is attributed to the too fine sediment used for the nourishment and its placement too high on the beach. Clearly, nourishment interventions must take into account the natural sediment distribution and the profile shape to avoid rapid losses of the nourished sediment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soil internal drainage plays a major role in soil genesis, and it is mostly dependent on topography. However, the existence of sedimentary and meta-sedimentary rock strata with variable dip angle allows for strong differences in internal drainage for identical topographies, which result in a marked differentiation in the properties of overlain soils. This work aimed to investigate the micromorphology of soils formed from different dip angles of rock strata and their relationships to internal drainage, in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Over horizontal strata, a Xanthic Acrudox lacking hematite and with blocky structure has developed. Over strata with 45 degrees dip angle, strong drainage has resulted in intense desilication, forming a Rhodic Acrudox having hematite and with strong fine granular structure. Micromorphological analyses showed that both soils contain relict nodules which are probably being dissolved in the current environment, whereas only the Xanthic Acrudox has nodules in current processes of formation due to slower drainage. The Cr horizon of both soils, but mainly the Xanthic Acrudox, presented a much slower saturated hydraulic conductivity than the respective overlying horizons, which was associated with a pattern of poorly connected fissural pores as seen in thin sections. The Cr horizon of the Rhodic Acrudox showed a matrix impregnated by Mn and Fe oxides in an unusual pattern of microlamination and hypocoatings that appear to be unstable, dissolving in the current, strongly drained environment. The soil color is a reliable indicator of such differential pedogenesis in these conditions.

AB  - To control soil erosion and restore the degraded environment in the Loess Plateau, a large number of measures related to soil and water conservation have been employed that have profoundly affected catchment properties. This study constructed three indicators to characterize changes to the catchment slope, proposed both a method for a regression analysis of adjacent images and a sequence model, and applied multisource remotely sensed images and GIS spatial clustering analysis technologies to extract thematic information and comprehensively analyze the catchment change characteristics. The results indicate that the catchment slope properties changed significantly. At catchment scale, the average values of ARC, DVC and ART were 6.43%, 25.57% and 4.30%, respectively. There were six clustering types of catchment slope property changes. The maximum and minimum of the average similarities of the clustering types were 0.992 and 0.935. Each slope control measures had a distinct effect on catchment slope; the dominating factor of each clustering type was identified as: Type 1: D-VC, Type 2: D-VCLU, Type 3: D-LUVC, Type 4: D-TAVC, Type 5: D-TAC and Type 6: D-MFC. Type 5 and Type 1 covered the largest areas, respectively occupying 37.28% and 31.01%. Catchment slope property changes also had distinct types that depended on their geomorphological conditions. These findings provide a useful basis from which to further study catchment slope hydrological and soil erosion processes.

AB  - Steady engagement, over the last decade or so, with the classical pragmatists has led Philip Kitcher to develop a position he calls "ethical pragmatic naturalism." Ethical pragmatic naturalism has three legs: an analytic history, a metaethical stance, and a normative position. The first two of these extend and expand pragmatist, especially Deweyan, insights in novel and illuminating, if not entirely unproblematic, ways. In particular, we are offered a plausible, naturalistic account of how our species moved from its pre-ethical state to where it is today, as well as a metaethical account that takes progress, rather than truth, to be primary. The normative position, developed on the basis of the analytic history and metaethical stance, attempts to combine a refined version of Adam Smith's theory of "social mirroring" with Deweyan moral experimentalism. I contend that Kitcher's focus here falls too heavily on the cognitive dimensions of the ethical project, overemphasizing efforts of rule-formation, the alleged construction of an internalized "impartial spectator," and an experimentalism construed primarily, if not exclusively, in terms of thought experiments. Consequently, Kitcher's position hews far more closely to the traditional picture he is ciritcal of than it does to the revolutionary Dewey he claims as inspiration. I suggest that Kitcher's position would be strengthened by a more robust construal of experimentalism, grounded in Deweyan habit, that puts greater emphasis on reconstruction of environing conditions as a crucial part of our toolkit for progressive change.

AB  - In marine populations, spatial structure arises over a wide range of scales and forms hierarchical aggregations. Changing spatial structure can alter the demographic and life history trait variation within populations and subject individuals to both novel environmental conditions and interspecific interactions. Thus, changes in the spatial structure of marine populations can be a prelude to further changes in abundance and can affect the resilience and recovery potential of populations following anthropogenic and environmental perturbations. These observations under score the importance of studying the spatial ecology of marine fish populations in order to (1) understand the underlying mechanisms that can lead to rapid alterations in population abundance and community interactions, (2) provide indicators of stock health, and (3) characterize the consequences of changing spatial patterns on population susceptibility to exploitation and environmental variability. Here, we synthesize the interacting factors that influence the formation, maintenance and erosion of spatial structure in marine fish populations and identify the further con sequences of such erosion at the population and community levels. We emphasize human driven changes of population spatial structure for 3 levels of population genetic aggregation that are common in fisheries management scenarios, namely sympatric populations, metapopulations and panmictic populations. Case studies are presented for each level of aggregation. Throughout our review, we both summarize the factors that link spatial and temporal dynamics in marine populations and highlight the management and conservation implications of such linkages.

AB  - The expansive infrastructure, along with the high population density, makes cities highly vulnerable to the severe impacts of natural hazards. In the context of an explosive increase in value of the damage caused by natural disasters, the need for evaluating and visualizing the vulnerability of urban areas becomes a necessity in helping practitioners and stakeholders in their decision-making processes. The paper presented is a piece of exploratory research. The overall aim is to develop a spatial vulnerability approach to address earthquake risk, using a semi-quantitative model. The model uses the analytical framework of a spatial GIS-based multi-criteria analysis. For this approach, we have chosen Bucharest, the capital city of Romania, based on its high vulnerability to earthquakes due to a rapid urban growth and the advanced state of decay of the buildings (most of the building stock were built between 1940 and 1977). The spatial result reveals a circular pattern, pinpointing as hot spots the Bucharest historic centre (located on a meadow and river terrace, and with aged building stock) and peripheral areas (isolated from the emergency centers and defined by precarious social and economic conditions). In a sustainable development perspective, the example of Bucharest shows how spatial patterns shape the "vulnerability profile" of the city, based on which decision makers could develop proper prediction and mitigation strategies and enhance the resilience of cities against the risks resulting from the earthquake hazard.

AB  - The ability of polydimethlysiloxane coated solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers to predict bioavailability has been documented for a number of species and compounds. There are also a variety of established methods for establishing SPME-based bioavailability estimates; however, factors such as time until equilibrium and exposure regimen could affect fiber concentrations and have not yet been thoroughly tested. Exposure time may influence SPME fiber concentrations at equilibrium. Co-exposure of the fibers with different animals or the invertebrate species used could yield different estimates than those acquired using a shaker table system to achieve equilibrium between the sediment and SPME fibers. The current study examined the effects of time and exposure method (shaker table versus co-exposure with test species) on SPME fiber concentrations for two hydrophobic compounds: permethrin and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE). An additional experiment with permethrin determined whether animal densities or fiber number influenced fiber concentrations. There were significant differences between the time required for SPME fibers to reach equilibrium when co-exposed with different species or separately, but fiber concentrations at equilibrium among treatments for both compounds were similar. Furthermore, among the 12 variations in species and fiber densities, there were no significant differences among treatments indicating that neither the route of exposure, animal density, nor fiber volume influenced SPME fiber estimates. This demonstrated that SPME fiber concentrations at equilibrium were not affected by exposure conditions, increasing their versatility in environmental assessments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Doctoral education at the medical university Karolinska Institutet has a long tradition of excellence. One important factor for this is the favorable research environment with many world-leading scientists. Other positive factors are a close connection to university hospitals with good conditions for clinical research, proximity to other universities and the pharmaceutical industry with their own research facilities. However, both supervisors and doctoral students are nowadays confronted with new challenges due to global changes and new demands. International competition is increasing, researchers are working in extensive networks, time constraints are more obvious, and employability after obtaining a PhD degree has come into focus. The international Bologna Accords place high demands on learning outcomes, alignment of the degrees between countries and an increased possibility for mobility of students. The need for efficient quality assurance has therefore become obvious.
   Karolinska Institutet works to ensure quality assurance in doctoral education in different ways. One is defining overall university outcome aims for doctoral education with corresponding quality indicators and outcome measures. Another is to systematically analyze and adjust the whole doctoral education system from the recruitment and selection of doctoral students, to methods of supervision, doctoral courses and programs, the implementation of learning outcomes in courses and individual study plans, and the final thesis defense. A third measure is by regular follow-up with surveys among students, supervisors and alumni (e.g. exit polls). Finally, faculty funding for new doctoral students enables to introduce quality improvements. Recent results will be presented and discussed.

AB  - In the Mediterranean Basin, most cultivated areas were abandoned in the last century and are now in various stages of old-field succession. The aim of this work was to analyse the successional trajectories of these ecosystems, and to assess possible deviations in these pathways due to fire occurrence at high or low recurrence levels. Old-fields abandoned either about 50 or about 100 years ago were selected in SE Spain. Within the 50-year-old abandoned fields, plots were established which had been burned by 1, 2 and 3 fires in the last 25 years. Cover values of vascular species were sampled and then analysed by means of multivariate analysis. Euclidean distances between resulting communities were used as an indicator of the possible deviation from the unburned successional pathway. Our results pointed to the possibility that different successional pathways may exist depending on fire occurrence and recurrence. In the absence of fire, the vegetation is dominated by pioneer species, mainly Pinus. With the passage of time this vegetation will become dominated by later successional tree species (Quercus). However, when early-successional communities are affected by fire, the succession can be diverted. A single fire is enough to change Pinus forests into alternative stable states dominated by Rosmarinus officinalis shrub communities, where the colonisation of species in later successional stages is arrested. This deviation increases in high fire recurrence regimes where the vegetation changes to dwarf shrubs and herbs.

AB  - Although the link between leaf mass loss and assessment of ecosystem nutrient use efficiency and plant nutrient resorption efficiency has received considerable attention in various ecosystems, there has been relatively little effort to assess plant leaf mass loss during senescence, especially for herbaceous species. We conducted experimental studies to assess leaf mass loss during senescence in five dominant herbaceous species and examined the effects of increasing nitrogen (N) and water availability on leaf mass loss of four species in a temperate steppe in northern China. We nondestructively estimated mature leaf mass based on leaf length and width. Leaf mass loss varied substantially among species, ranging from 20-50%. On average across all species, N and water addition increased leaf mass loss by 30% and 19%, respectively. N and water addition interacted to affect leaf mass loss, as water addition had a significant positive effect on leaf mass loss under enriched N conditions but showed no effect under ambient N levels. We conclude that leaf mass loss of herbaceous plants was considerable and can potentially be more pronounced with increasing N and water availability. It is notable that the responses of plant species to N and water addition were variable. We suggest that leaf mass loss during senescence should be given full consideration in assessing nutrient use and resorption efficiency in semi-arid areas.

AB  - The state of human health is closely linked to development. Impaired health lowers productivity. The environmental role on the health refers to the inadequate sanitation, malnutrition or lack of medical treatment. Therefore, improvements in primary health care, particularly in rural areas, better control of diseases with protection of environment and reduction of health risks from the pollution are the essential subjects for better quality of life. The Balkan countries need to analyse these factors by the policy analysis and research, country specific sector work, training and partnership: the common policy issues to establish an information network for the Balkan countries will contribute for research addressing issues to communicable diseases, maternal conditions, microbiological threats, incommunicable diseases, and health policy; the country specific research will cause stimulating analysis to form a consensus among the decision-makers; the health training of the Balkan countries as a common policy will result in a sustainable financing; partnership implies to ensure access to cost-effective services, as well as focusing on efficient spending, quality in service delivery and civil participation. To achieve these challenges to the health, the common policy among the Balkan countries will lead to the focusing on poverty alleviation, preventing uncontrolled expenditures and unsustainable systems, assisting in policy formulation and broad sector reform. The target of the study is to reduce the hazardous health effects as a result of environmental problems. The comparative data are adapted for the health-environment relations to reduce the obstacles to the EU standards.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) online off-gas monitoring is useful to detect changes in biological activity for activated sludge systems especially under limited oxygen conditions like under simultaneous nitrification-denitrification (SND) where respirometric measurements are not applicable. So far, the influence of the bicarbonate system on the liquid-gas transfer of CO2 prevented the wider use of off-gas CO2 for monitoring purposes in wastewater treatment. The objective of the paper is to demonstrate a practical method to correct measured off-gas CO2 as an indicator of biological activity by taking into account pH shifts (resulting in CO2 release or retention) and changes in influent alkalinity. The simple model is based on the physicochemical system of the bicarbonate/CO2 equilibrium and the liquid-gas mass transfer for aerated systems. Standard on-line measurements (pH, temperature, flow rates) and periodical alkalinity titration serve as input data to estimate the influence of the carbonate system on the CO2 off-gas concentrations measured on-line. For a particular plant the CO2 mass transfer coefficients are derived from measurements compared to the theoretical calculation from oxygen mass transfer. The model estimates the biological carbon dioxide production rate (CPR; heterotrophic activity) by the correction of the measured carbon dioxide transfer rate (CTR; C-flux by the off-gas) with the calculated inorganic carbon dioxide transfer rate (r(F)) considering bicarbonate consumption (autotrophic activity).

AB  - We differentiated the sandy coast of South China into three basic types of coastal geomorphology: cape-bay coast, barrier-lagoon coast, and straightened coast. After analysis on regional variations of the dynamic environment along the modern coast of South China and comprehensive comparisons among on-the-spot observational data in different seasons from different foreshore profiles of the sandy coast situated on different geographic coastal sections, the morphodynamic characteristics of the sandy beaches along the coast of South China were explored. The tectonic movements and sea level changes occurring during the regional geologic historical processes lay down a basis for the development of large-scale sandy coastal geomorphology. After the postglacial, sea level was relatively stable. Under recent coastal dynamic conditions, the scouring-silting adjustment made by the actions of supply, migration, and accumulation of the sandy beach sediments made decisive effects on the state of the beach face. Among them, the wave-tide index (K value) is an important indicator that reflects these changes. The K values of sandy beaches along the coasts of South China are generally more than 1. Most of the sandy beaches are predominated by wave-dominated geomorphology, with a rather great beach face gradient. There correlation between the K value and seasonal deformation degree of the sandy beach is positive. The grain size of the beach face sediment is closely related to the K value and also is affected to a smaller extent by the seasonal changes of wind wave and the geographic distribution of the various shorelines.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have captured the interest of many researchers in the chemical, biological, and medical fields since they are thought to be associated with various pathological conditions. Fluorescent probes for the detection of ROS are promising tools with which to enhance our understanding of the physiological roles of ROS, because they provide spatial and temporal information about target biomolecules in in vivo cellular systems. ROS probes, designed to detect specific ROS with a high selectivity, would be desirable, since it is now becoming clear that each ROS has its own unique physiological activity. However, dihydro-compounds such as 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH), which have traditionally been used for detecting ROS, tend to react with a wide variety of ROS and are not completely photostable. Some attractive fluorescent probes that exhibit a high degree of selectivity toward specific ROS have recently been reported, and these selective probes are expected to have great potential for elucidating unknown physiological mechanisms associated with their target ROS. This review focuses on the design, detection mechanism, and performance of fluorescent probes for the detection of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-.), or superoxide anion (O-2(-.)), a field in which remarkable progress has been achieved in the last few years.

AB  - Young bivalve larvae (3 d old) were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of cadmium (2, 10, 20, and 50-mu-g l-1) under static exposure conditions for 28 d, a period that spans most of their larval lifespan. The effects on growth were evaluated in terms of both size and weight parameters. Cd effects on size growth (length and height) were significantly different, but subtle, mostly characterized by a slow gradual decline, but remaining at greater-than-or-equal-to 80 % of control sizes. However the effects of Cd on weight (total dry weight, shell weight, and tissue weight) were much more dramatic. After only 4 d, Cd-exposed larvae weighed < 80 % of the controls (total dry weight), and tissue weights were between 35 and 51 % of controls. With continued exposures, there was some improvement, but then growth stabilized at levels significantly lower than the controls or continued to decline. This response of initial severe effects, readjustment, and restabilization represents an adaptive response mediated by homeostatic mechanisms. However, the mechanisms were unable to ameliorate the toxic effects. Therefore, weight was more sensitive than size as an indicator of adaptive response and stress. The capacity for recovery was evaluated by exposing some larvae to Cd for 14 d and allowing them to depurate for 14 d. Only larvae initially exposed to 2-mu-g l-1 Cd showed significant recovery. The effects on growth are discussed with regard to Cd tissue concentrations and regulatory mechanisms.

AB  - Inappropriate water and fertilizer management can lead to unstable crop yields. Excessive fertilization can potentially cause soil degradation and nitrogen (N) leaching. The aim of this study was to explore the optimal N application rate on two wheat varieties with different nitrogen responding under limited water irrigation at three experimental sites in the Piedmont plain of the Taihang Mountains, China. A two-year field experiment was conducted to explore the effects of five N application rates (N0, N120, N180, N240, and N300) on winter wheat growth, leaf area index, aboveground biomass, grain yield, grain N accumulation, and net return. The results showed that N application rate significantly affected leaf area index, aboveground biomass, grain yield, and harvest index. Variety and variety x N rate interactions had a significant effect on few indicators. Compared with N0, N180 improved leaf area index, aboveground biomass, grain yield, and grain N accumulation. Compared with N240 and N300, N180 increased the harvest index and N harvest index, without significantly reducing grain yield or grain N accumulation, while enhancing a higher N use efficiency. Fertilizers applied in the ranges of 144.7-212.9 and 150.3-247.0 kg ha(-1) resulted in the highest net return for the KN199 and JM585 varieties, respectively. Our study provides a sound theoretical basis for high-efficiency fertilizer utilization in sustainable winter wheat production in the Piedmont plains of the Taihang Mountains of China.

AB  - Due to the extreme environmental conditions in the Persian Gulf, the bioerosion rate in the coral reefs of the region deem to be higher than the other regions, which may disturb the balance between the processes of the reef growth and destruction. The bioerosion rate in Platygyra daedalea and Porites harrisoni in three stations of Larak Island (Hormuz Strait, 56 degrees 39 ' 35.7 '' E & 26 degrees 88 ' 65.17 '' N) was assessed in 2017. This study also examined the effect of skeletal density on the severity of bioerosion rate. For this purpose, five coral pieces of each species were collected from the stations. Each piece was cut in the direction of the longest central axis with a thickness of about 7 mm, and their photographs were taken. The bioeroded area was evaluated by ImageJ 1.44 software, and the freezing method was used to measure the skeletal density. A total of four groups of macrobioeroders were found in both coral species, including bivalves, polychaetes, sponges, and barnacles. Also, increased skeletal density was positively correlated with bioerosion in P. daedalea, but not in P. harrisoni. This indicates that some bioeroders prefer denser corals for various reasons. Evidence from this research suggests that skeletal density was the most important factor affecting the degree of bioerosion rate. However, other environmental factors such as depth may also affect the bioerosion rate to certain degrees.

AB  - Water-limited environments account for half of the earth's land surface, and dryland agriculture acreage is projected to expand due to climate changes. Examining typical dryland yield potentials and yield improvement measures is crucial for developing future dryland crop production systems. This case study u sed crop modeling to analyze dryland maize yield potential (YPd), farmers' yield potential (YPf), and actual farm yields (Y-a) from 1990 to 2015 in three counties in western Kansas (i.e., Thomas, Greeley, and Finney in the U.S. Great Plains region). The calibrated APSIM-Maize model along with actual yields was used to estimate yield gaps attributed to: (a) agronomic factors (YG(1) = YPd - YPf) and (b) socioeconomic constraints (YG(2) = YPf - Y-a). Observed climate conditions during maize-growing seasons showed warming, brightening, and drying trends for all three counties in western Kansas from 1990 to 2015. Our results showed that the current actual farm yields (Y-a) in western Kansas represented only 34%, 32%, and 28% of YPd in Thomas, Greeley, and Finney counties, respectively, indicating significant exploitable yield gaps. Agronomic factors (YG(1)) contributed the greatest to the yield gap in Greeley and Finney counties, whereas socioeconomic constraints (YG(2)) offered the greatest opportunity for improvement in Thomas county. Our analysis suggested that improving agronomic management could be a greater priority for further yield improvement in Greeley county, but selecting an appropriate hybrid was a greater priority in Finney county.

AB  - Emerging market governments are incented to attract global value chain (GVC) activities to fuel economic growth. At the same time, in light of real and perceived workplace-related injustices within emerging markets, GVC lead firms are under pressure to improve social standard compliance within their upstream supply chain. Among the most common approaches to achieve these outcomes is to impose standards of conduct that are vetted by on-site audits. Research has shown, however, that improvement in GVC performance using this approach has been slow and sometimes leads to negative consequences, leading us to our research question: under what conditions do interventions by GVC lead firms yield significant improvements in social standards among upstream supplier workplaces? We hypothesize that a country's institutions not only have direct effects on social upgrading but also indirectly affect the ability of third parties to bring about social compliance. Our findings, based on two longitudinal datasets, suggest that GVC lead firms must account for the unique country-level institutional pressures that either propel or hamper improvement over time in private social standard compliance among upstream suppliers. In addition, governments must develop new policy responses to target the prevailing institutional pressures that dampen social upgrading if they are to attract and retain GVC investment.

AB  - Anaerobic codigestion of olive mill wastewater for renewable energy production constitutes a promising process to overcome management and environmental issues due to their conventional disposal. The present study aims at assessing biogas and biomethane production from olive mill wastewater by performing biochemical methane potential tests. Hence, mixtures containing 0% (blank), 20% and 30% olive mill wastewater, in volume, were experimented on under mesophilic conditions. In addition, life cycle assessment and life cycle costing were performed for sustainability analysis. Particularly, life cycle assessment allowed assessing the potential environmental impact resulting from the tested process, while life cycle costing in conjunction with specific economic indicators allowed performing the economic feasibility analysis. The research highlighted reliable outcomes: higher amounts of biogas (80.22 +/- 24.49 NL.kg(SV)(-1)) and methane (47.68 +/- 17.55 NL.kg(SV)(-1)) were obtained when implementing a higher amount of olive mill wastewater (30%) (v/v) in the batch reactors. According to life cycle assessment, the biogas ecoprofile was better when using 20% (v/v) olive mill wastewater. Similarly, the economic results demonstrated the profitability of the process, with better performances when using 20% (v/v) olive mill wastewater. These findings confirm the advantages from using farm and food industry by-products for the production of renewable energy as well as organic fertilizers, which could be used in situ to enhance farm sustainability.

AB  - This study aims to assess the vulnerability and capacity of Bhubaneswar, India?s first smart-city, to the most recent extremely severe cyclonic (ESC) storm ?Fani? which ravaged the city on May 3, 2019. After 2 weeks of its impact, this study conducted a household survey in the central part of Bhubaneswar city (comprising of different wards), where smart-city projects were implemented and ongoing. Survey questions categorized into Social & Human, Financial, Physical, and Smart-city factors and their corresponding indicators were chosen through literature review and some modified based on local conditions. A total of 22 vulnerability and 40 capacity indicators were used to calculate the vulnerability and capacity index. The result indicates that overall capacity overweighs the overall vulnerability in the central part of the city during the Fani cyclone. Specifically, the city was more vulnerable based on Financial factors, whereas more capable and smartly prepared for the cyclone in the context of Social & Human factors, Physical factors, and Smart-city factors. The study indicates the mitigating impact of the smart-city project in the central Bhubaneswar city area and applauds the step taken by the government for preparation during such an extreme event. The realizations of these results will help the government to further improve its disaster management plan with important infrastructural modification highlighted in this study.

AB  - The insulation systems of equipment, cables, and electrical machines subjected to high voltage are continuously exposed to multiple aging mechanisms of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and environmental type. Normally, a failure in the material under these conditions does not occur immediately, but over time, different degradation processes emerge and evolve, progressively deteriorating the insulation, until breakdown occurs, and consequently, the asset finishes its operation with a catastrophic failure. In this context, partial discharge (PD) measurement can be considered as one of the best indicators when diagnosing the status of much electrical equipment in operation. However, the simultaneous presence of noise sources or multiple PD sources can generate important difficulties in identifying the type or types of sources measured. These practical limitations can be solved if, prior to the identification, a separation process is carried out, which allows classifying the different sources acting over the equipment being monitored. Once the sources separation is executed, the subsequent identification and diagnosis process can be carried out more easily. In this article, we present a novel separation technique based on the temporal and spectral behavior of the PD signals. For this technique, the separation of sources is carried out through three different parameters. Two of them are based on the peakedness of PD signals and electrical noise, and the third parameter is associated with their spectral content. Based on these parameters, a 3-D separation map is established, representing in clusters each source captured by the sensors.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop and test a tilapia on-farm welfare assessment protocol, based on Brazilian semi-intensive production systems. The study included two mains steps: the elaboration of tilapia welfare protocol and its on-field feasibility test. The protocol, including the potential indicators organized into health, environmental, nutritional, and behavioral categories, was tested on three farms. Skin, eyes, gills, jaws, fins, and vertebral spine were individually examined in 139 individual tilapias. Water physicochemical parameters and production system were considered. The overall nutritional status of individuals was assessed through body condition factor, feed conversion ratio, feed crude protein ratio, and feed ingestion behavior. During massive capture, signals of stress, level of crowding, and duration of air exposure were registered. Time required for loss of consciousness was evaluated by clinical reflexes and other behaviors during slaughter. Eye, jaw, and gill scores were different across farms (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.011; 0.015; 0.043, respectively), showing good discrimination power. Critical welfare points were extremely low dissolved oxygen in water, fin and skin lesions, prolonged air exposure during pre-slaughter handling and non-humane slaughter techniques, as decapitation or asphyxia. The protocol presents practical viability and it is an initial step for the development of a tilapia welfare strategy, where the prioritization of critical welfare points, implementation of corrective actions and monitoring of the results is part of a permanent welfare management system.

AB  - In recent decades, methods to realize naturalistic driving studies have been established to investigate the driver behavior under realistic conditions. Compared to the research on passenger cars, the naturalistic behavior of motorcycle riders is still rather unclear from a scientific point of view. However, understanding this behavior can contribute to the development of accident countermeasures. To this end, naturalistic driving methods can be applied to motorcycling. The objective of this study was to present a methodological approach to conduct a naturalistic riding investigation. The methodological considerations were supported by sample results on the rider profile assessment by using g-g diagrams (combination of longitudinal and lateral accelerations). The focus was on observable and measurable vehicle dynamics as a result of the rider input. A three-step approach was adopted, consisting of a pilot study, controlled main study, and naturalistic riding study. The first phase aimed at defining a measurement setup and investigating the general feasibility of using g-g diagrams for rider profile detection. The second phase involved experimental techniques. A heterogenous rider panel was observed in a quasi-controlled setup to better interpret the variations in data patterns resulting from the individual rider behavior opposed to, e.g., road type. The third phase involved the conduct of the naturalistic riding study. Three rider profiles were identified by considering the combinations of lateral and longitudinal accelerations. As a relevant indicator, the qualitatively assessed shape of the g-g diagrams developed rapidly and remained stable over time.

AB  - The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is one of the global problems of humankind and has a significant influence on political, socio-economic and educational processes. It is noted that the social isolation and the social distance of the teachers and students of the institutions of higher education has transformed the ways and habits of their lives due to the long quarantine events. The security measures caused new features of the educational environment. The distance learning has been actualized as a possible way and an important form of the distance education. The institutions of higher education of Ukraine have rapidly developed and formed their own approaches to the educational process in the last two months (pandemic). Therefore, the distance learning, which maintains a balance between the theoretical and the practically oriented training of the future specialists, is technically organized at Ternopil National Economic University. The organization of the education on the modern online platform "Moodle", which is directed at effective the providing active parity education in the distance format, is described. The indicators (the effectiveness, the accessibility, the resource intensity, the promptness, the democracy in communication, the integrative software) of the quality assessment of implementation of the distance learning in the educational process are specified and identified within the platform.
   It was concluded that each Ukrainian student and teacher underwent a reassessment of their own educational values in the conditions of self-isolation: a virtual educational environment can never replace the direct educational contact of a teacher and students in a teaching audience.

AB  - Analyzing vitamin D levels is important for monitoring health conditions because vitamin D deficiency is associated with various diseases such as rickets, osteomalacia, cardiovascular disorders and some cancers. However, vitamin D concentration in the blood is very low with optimal level of 75 nmol/L, making quantitative analysis difficult. The objective of this study was to develop a highly sensitive analysis method for vitamin D using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), which has been used as an indicator of vitamin D metabolites in human biofluids was chemically derivatized using a secosteroid signal enhancing tag (SecoSET) with powerful dienophile and permanent positive charge. The SecoSET-derivatized 25(OH)D provided good linearity (R-2 > 0.99) and sensitivity (limit of quantitation: 11.3 fmol). Chemical derivatization of deuterated 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 (d(6)-25(OH)D3) with SecoSET enabled absolute quantitative analysis using MALDI-MS. The highly sensitive method could be successfully applied into monitoring of quantitative changes of bioactive vitamin D metabolites after treatment with ketoconazole to inhibit 1 alpha-hydroxylase reaction related to vitamin D metabolism in human breast cancer cells. Taken together, we developed a MALDI-MS-based platform that could quantitatively analyze vitamin D metabolites from cell products, blood and other biofluids. This platform may be applied to monitor various diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency such as rickets, osteomalacia and breast cancer.

AB  - Climate change introduces substantial uncertainty to water resources planning and raises the key question: when, or under what conditions, should adaptation occur? A number of recent studies aim to identify policies mapping future observations to actions-in other words, framing climate adaptation as an optimal control problem. This paper uses the control paradigm to review and classify recent dynamic planning studies according to their approaches to uncertainty characterization, policy structure, and solution methods. We propose a set of research gaps and opportunities in this area centered on the challenge of characterizing uncertainty, which prevents the unambiguous application of control methods to this problem. These include exogenous uncertainty in forcing, model structure, and parameters propagated through a chain of climate and hydrologic models; endogenous uncertainty in human-environmental system dynamics across multiple scales; and sampling uncertainty due to the finite length of historical observations and future projections. Recognizing these challenges, several opportunities exist to improve the use of control methods for climate adaptation, namely, how problem context and understanding of climate processes might assist with uncertainty quantification and experimental design, out-of-sample validation and robustness of optimized adaptation policies, and monitoring and data assimilation, including trend detection, Bayesian inference, and indicator variable selection. We conclude with a summary of recommendations for dynamic water resources planning under climate change through the lens of optimal control.

AB  - The number of children born with cerebral palsy (CP) remains stably high. Novel approaches for rehabilitation of such patients are being sought. This study aimed to define the efficiency of the image visualization technologies in play activity for the physical rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy. Sixteen boys with spastic diplegia aged 7-9 participated in the study. They were divided into treatment group (TG) and control group (CG), 8 children each. The TG patients were trained using the virtual reality based Krisaf training simulator twice a week for 40 minutes during 8 months. The child was suspended in the horizontal position and looked at the monitor through the specialised eyeglasses. Under the conditions of the marine environment immersion simulation with reduced gravity children performed motor tasks through play: searched for treasures, competed with dolphins etc. The CG patients attended the physical therapy lessons. Rehabilitation lessons using the virtual reality based Krisaf training simulator for children affected with spastic cerebral palsy led to a significant improvement of motor skills. Various motion tests showed an improvement over baseline, the average indicators increased 1.30-1.48 times. The difference between TG and CG results was statistically significant. In the CG referred to physical therapy the indicators increase was less than 10%, in the TG the increase reached 30-40%. It was concluded that the use of virtual reality based technologies promotes the optimization of neurophysiological processes in the motor analyzer cortical areas and better adaptation to motor loads.

AB  - Toxicity evaluation is necessary to investigate the possible risk of chemical or pollutants newly produced such as nanoparticles in the environments. The assessment should apply a method that is effective to determine the toxic concentration and the exposure time of the pollutants in an animal model. This study described three main stages including determining the median lethal concentrations (LC50) with Probit program and detecting toxic effects of ZnO NPs in morphology and regeneration observed by the changes in morphology of Hydra magnipapillata (H. magnipapillata). We also provide a strategy for culturing hydra in laboratory condition to use the animal for the experiment. The exposure to ZnO NPs led to the abnormality in regeneration such as formation of extraordinary number of tentacles and bifurcated tips in tentacles and the toxic effects in morphology appeared the clubbing tentacle, slender body, and retracting body column and tentacles by the exposure time. The method described here is simple and useful to evaluate the toxic effects of ZnO NPs using morphological characters in H. magnipapillata and could suggest the concentration and the exposure time for further investigations on cellular and molecular responses of the animal after exposure to other nanoparticles.

AB  - Bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum SKI19 was harvested for purification during early stationary phase (optimum bacteriocin production). Purification of bacteriocin SKI19 was achieved by ammonium sulfate precipitation at 60% saturation followed by SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column. The molecular mass of bacteriocin SKI19 determined by Tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis was estimated to 2.5 kDa. Physical and biochemical studies revealed that purified bacteriocin SKI19 was heat-stable even after autoclaving at 121 degrees C for 15 mins and was active over a wide pH range (2.0-10.0). A reduction in antibacterial activity was observed after treatment of the bacteriocin SKI19 with proteolytic enzymes (alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin_ proteinase K, and pronase E), confirming that bacteriocin SKI19 is proteinaceous in nature. When viewed under SEM, cell membranes of the indicator strain appeared to collapse after exposure to bacteriocin SKI19. It was found that bacteriocin SKI19 inhibited not only closely related species, but was also effective against Listeria monocytogenes DMST 17303. Moreover, complete inhibition (L. monocytogenes DMST 17303) or significant inhibition (Escherichia coli DMST 4212, and Staphylococcus aureus DMST 8840) by SKI19 was observed in co-cultivation under anaerobic conditions. The results suggest that bacteriocin SKI19 as well as the direct use of SKI19 as a starter culture might be applied as biocontrol agents to improve the shelf-life of certain food products.

AB  - We have recently demonstrated that riboflavin (Rf) functions as unconventional bioorthogonal photocatalyst for the activation of Pt' prodrugs. In this study, we show how the combination of light and Rf with two Pt-IV prodrugs is a feasible strategy for light-mediated pancreatic cancer cell death induction. In Capan-1 cells, which have high tolerance against photodynamic therapy, Rf-mediated activation of the cisplatin and carboplatin prodrugs cis,cis,trans-[Pt(NH3)(2)(Cl)(2)(O2CCH2CH2CO2H)(2)] (1) and cis,cis,trans-[Pt(NH3)(2)(CBDCA)(O2CCH2CH2CO2H)(2)] (2, where CBDCA= cyclobutane dicarboxylate) resulted in pronounced reduction of the cell viability, including under hypoxia conditions. Such photoactivation mode occurs to a considerable extent intracellularly, as demonstrated for 1 by uptake and cell viability experiments. Pt-195 NMR, DNA binding studies using circular dichroism, mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence microscopy were performed using the Rf-1 catalyst-substrate pair and indicated that cell death is associated with the efficient light-induced formation of cisplatin. Accordingly, Western blot analysis revealed signs of DNA damage and activation of cell death pathways through Rf-mediated photochemical activation. Phosphorylation of H(2)AX as indicator for DNA damage, was detected for Rf-1 in a strictly light-dependent fashion while in case of free cisplatin also in the dark. Photochemical induction of nuclear pH(2)AX foci by Rf-1 was confirmed in fluorescence microscopy again proving efficient light-induced cisplatin release from the prodrug system.

AB  - Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plant growth and development. The cultivation of leguminous plants has generated strong interest because of their growth even on poor soils. Calcareous and saline soils with poor mineral availability are wide-spread in Tunisia. In an attempt to select better forage crops adapted to Tunisian soils, we characterized Fe deficiency responses of three different isolates of Hedysarum carnosum, an endemic Tunisian extremophile species growing in native stands in salt and calcareous soil conditions. H. carnosum is a non-model crop. The three isolates, named according to their habitats Karkar, Thelja, and Douiret, differed in the expression of Fe deficiency symptoms like morphology, leaf chlorosis with compromised leaf chlorophyll content and photosynthetic capacity and leaf metal contents. Across these parameters Thelja was found to be tolerant, while Karkar and Douiret were susceptible to Fe deficiency stress. The three physiological and molecular indicators of the iron deficiency response in roots, Fe reductase activity, growth medium acidification and induction of the IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER1 homolog, indicated that all lines responded to -Fe, however, varied in the strength of the different responses. We conclude that the individual lines have distinct adaptation capacities to react to iron deficiency, presumably involving mechanisms of whole-plant iron homeostasis and internal metal distribution. The Fe deficiency tolerance of Thelja might be linked with adaptation to its natural habitat on calcareous soil.

AB  - The Upper Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta is a zone which is immersed in an ecological, economic, political and social conflict. That is because of the Totoaba Totoaba macdonaldi illegal fishing and the Vaquita Phocoena sinus potential extinction. This issue has driven to ban all the region's fisheries with the exception of the Gulf corvina Cynoscion othonopterus which is the only of the finfish species with operating license. Therefore, the main objetive was to evaluate the fishery's health condition through the Froese sustainability indicators in Upper Gulf of California during 2008, 2013, 2014 and 2015 fishing seasons. The results showed that the Gulf corvina annual production ratio showed fluctuations, highlighting in the 2012-2016 period, when the whole fishing captures with the exception of 2014, surpassed the established quota by the National Institute of Fishery (Instituto Nacional de Pesca). The size-at-maturity were: 2008= L-50,: 502 mm (IC= 490-514 mm), 2013= L-50: 559 mm (IC= 544-576 mm), 2014= L-50: 499 mm (IC= 476-518 mm), and 2015= L-50: 480 mm (IC= 445-510 mm). Based on the sustainability indicators, it is demonstrated that the Gulf corvina fishery is directed towards the organisms of greater length (mega-spawners). Finally it is concluded that Gulf corvina currently shows problems of overexploitation and therefore its exploitation is not sustainable. This suggests the need to make adjustments and updates to current management measures.

AB  - Despite the growing number of studies focusing on urban vulnerability to climate change, adaptive capacity, which is a key component of the IPCC definition of vulnerability, is rarely assessed quantitatively. We examine the capacity of adaptation in the Concepcion Metropolitan Area, Chile. A flexible methodology based on spatial fuzzy modelling was developed to standardise and aggregate, through a stepwise approach, seventeen indicators derived from widely available census statistical data into an adaptive capacity index. The results indicate'that all the municipalities in the CMA increased their level of adaptive capacity between 1992 and 2002. However, the relative differences between municipalities did not change significantly over the studied timeframe. Fuzzy overlay allowed us to standardise and to effectively aggregate indicators with differing ranges and granularities of attribute values into an overall index. It also provided a conceptually sound and reproducible means of exploring the interplay of many indicators that individually influence adaptive capacity. Furthermore, it captured the complex, aggregated and continued nature of the adaptive capacity, favouring to deal with gaps of data and knowledge associated with the concept of adaptive capacity. The resulting maps can help identify municipalities where adaptive capacity is weak and identify which components of adaptive capacity need strengthening. Identification of these capacity conditions can stimulate dialogue amongst policymakers and stakeholders regarding how to manage urban areas and how to prioritise resources for urban development in ways that can also improve adaptive capacity and thus reduce vulnerability to climate change.

AB  - Livestock can affect the soil seed bank through various mechanisms associated with changes in vegetation. We sampled vegetation and seed banks of Patagonian grasslands, in areas with different historical use by grazing (exclosure, moderate use and high use) to evaluate to what extent changes in vegetation are reflected in the seed bank. We also evaluated the effect of historical grazing on horizontal spatial seed distribution by sampling under shrubs and in between plant gaps. We focused the study on functional groups, and on the palatable Poa ligularis, an indicator of grassland status. In general, the proportional changes in composition and abundance of functional groups produced in grazed sectors (relative to each exclosure) were bigger for the seed bank than for the aboveground vegetation. Impacts on seed bank were led by a decrease (moderate use), or total disappearance (high use) of perennial grasses, results clearly reflected by P.ligularis. Although shrubs were represented in vegetation, they were undetected in the seed bank through germination, probably due to the lack of the conditions required for breaking seed dormancy. Intensive grazing produced homogenization in seed spatial distribution. Our work revealed a poor contribution of the seed bank to vegetation regeneration at increasing historical use by grazing. We recommend sampling the seed bank when monitoring the conservation status of grasslands to obtain consistent management guidelines.

AB  - Warfarin sodium (WFS) is a widely used oral anticoagulant drug but has a narrow therapeutic window. Since traditional detection methods applied for therapeutic drug monitoring suffer some shortcomings, including difficulty in obtaining timely reports, high costs and tedious operation, it is necessary to develop a detection system for the rapid monitoring of WFS in biological samples. Here we report a novel electrochemical sensor, which was facilely fabricated by coupling nanoporous gold leaf (NPGL) with molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) to afford ultrasensitive and selective determination of WFS. The morphological characterization via scanning electron microscopy proved the successful modification of the sensor by NPGL followed with MIP layer modification. The influencing parameters including the type of monomer, pH and molar ratio of template to monomer were optimized during electro-polymerization. Using Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-) as a probe acting as an electrical indicator, a linear relationship of the current response versus the concentration of WFS was obtained in the range from 1.0 x 10(-10) to 8.0 x 10(-8) M under the optimal experimental conditions, with a detection limit of 4.1 x 10(-11) M (S/N = 3). In addition, the as-prepared sensor exhibited specific detection of WFS over its structural analogues and interferents, and the established electrochemical approach was validated using the standard method - high performance liquid chromatography. Eventually, rapid and accurate determination of WFS in human blood was carried out after easy sample pretreatment.

AB  - Conditions of low oxygen, as well as strong fluctuations in dissolved oxygen concentrations, can substantially affect marine benthic communities. An early assessment of the status of a community after such an event is of fundamental ecological importance and may help to inform management measures. This paper investigates the response of a foraminiferal assemblage, and its relationship with sediment biogeochemistry, micro-organisms and other fauna, following experimentally induced hypoxia on an intertidal flat in the Scheldt Estuary, The Netherlands. Sediment hypoxia was induced during one experiment in winter and a second in late spring. The foraminiferal assemblages in the upper 0-1 cm of sediment were sampled at two and five months post-hypoxia. Changes in foraminiferal abundance and biovolume were compared to responses of microphytobenthos, bacteria, meiofauna and macrofauna, which have been reported in separate papers. The foraminiferal assemblage comprised three species, Haynesina germanica, Ammonia beccarii and Elphidium excavatum. Their species-specific abundance and estimated biovolume varied with timing of disturbance (winter vs. spring hypoxia) and the duration of recovery (2 vs. 5 months). Although all foraminiferal species were expected to benefit from recolonization of macrofauna, H. germanica was negatively correlated to the abundance of macrofaunal bioturbators during recovery. The abundance of A. beccarii was positively correlated with microalgal biomass. These findings revealed species-specific responses by foraminifera after hypoxia and the concomitant recovery of other biota, further demonstrating the usefulness of foraminifera as ecological indicators.

AB  - This paper considers numerical simulations of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems in hemodynamics for idealized geometries of healthy cerebral arteries modeled by both nonlinear isotropic and anisotropic material constitutive laws. In particular, it focuses on an anisotropic model initially proposed for cerebral arteries to characterize the activation of collagen fibers at finite strains. In the current work, this constitutive model is implemented for the first time in the context of an FSI formulation. In this framework, we investigate the influence of the material model on the numerical results and, in the case of the anisotropic laws, the importance of the collagen fibers on the overall mechanical behavior of the tissue. With this aim, we compare our numerical results by analyzing fluid dynamic indicators, vessel wall displacement, Von Mises stress, and deformations of the collagen fibers. Specifically, for an anisotropic model with collagen fiber recruitment at finite strains, we highlight the progressive activation and deactivation processes of the fibrous component of the tissue throughout the wall thickness during the cardiac cycle. The inclusion of collagen recruitment is found to have a substantial impact on the intramural stress, which will in turn impact the biological response of the intramural cells. Hence, the methodology presented here will be particularly useful for studies of mechanobiological processes in the healthy and diseased vascular wall.

AB  - Within the last decades tremendous progress has been made in analysing, characterising and understanding the processes, functions, and structures of the environment. Numerous indicators have been proposed and operationalised using computing techniques. However, many of the approaches are based on specific case study areas and the transfer of approaches is hampered due to incompatible data formats, data availability limitations, and/or unavailable modelling routines. Information on modelling routines, existing result datasets, and updates of previously derived analyses are missing. Considering the recent technological and methodological developments, environmental modelling providing indicators for decision support is likely to change in the next decade. This research provides a heuristic conceptual basis for driving the next generation of real-time multi-purpose data assembling, evaluating, modelling, and visualisation towards the operationalisation of decisions. Turning field observations into useful (near) real-time decision support information is demonstrated based on a hydrological example of future Integrated Water Resources Management. This paper describes new ways of near real-time indicator processing using Wireless Sensor Networks and standardised web services. Publicly available and standardised environmental information as Open Geospatial Consortium compliant Sensor Observation Services with its data formats Observations & Measurements and Water Markup Language 2.0 automatically feed into Web Processing Services for timely information delivery, discovery and access of the spatially explicit environmental conditions as pull and push based web services accompanied with notification for immediate actions in crisis times.

AB  - Messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation is an important element of gene expression that can be modulated by alterations in translation, such as reductions in initiation or elongation rates. Reducing translation initiation strongly affects mRNA degradation by driving mRNA toward the assembly of a decapping complex, leading to decapping. While mRNA stability decreases as a consequence of translational inhibition, in apparent contradiction several external stresses both inhibit translation initiation and stabilize mRNA. A key difference in these processes is that stresses induce multiple responses, one of which stabilizes mRNAs at the initial and rate-limiting step of general mRNA decay. Because this increase in mRNA stability is directly induced by stress, it is independent of the translational effects of stress, which provide the cell with an opportunity to assess its response to changing environmental conditions. After assessment, the cell can store mRNAs, reinitiate their translation or, alternatively, embark on a program of enhanced mRNA decay en masse. Finally, recent results suggest that mRNA decay is not limited to non-translating messages and can occur when ribosomes are not initiating but are still elongating on mRNA. This review will discuss the models for the mechanisms of these processes and recent developments in understanding the relationship between translation and general mRNA degradation, with a focus on yeast as a model system.

Toxicity of bulk-scale (approximate to 160nm) and nanoscale (21nm) titanium dioxide (TiO2) was tested under dark and light conditions, following ISO 10872. The expression of sod-3, a mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, was quantified as an indicator for oxidative stress induced by the photocatalytically active material. Particle sizes were estimated using dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy. Although both materials agglomerated to a comparable secondary particle size of 300nm to 1500nm and were ingested into the intestine, only nanoscale-TiO2 significantly inhibited reproduction (lowest-observed-effect-concentration [LOEC]: 10mg/L). Light exposure induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by nanoscale-TiO2 and increased toxicity of the nanomaterial from a median effect concentration of more than 100mg/L to 53mg/L. No evidence was found for inner cellular photocatalytic activity of nanoscale-TiO2. Therefore, oxidative damage of the membranes of intestinal cells is suggested as a potential mode of action. Results highlight the importance of primary particle size and environmental parameters on the toxicity of TiO2. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:2288-2296. (c) 2014 SETAC

AB  - The supernatant resulting from the anaerobic digestion of sludge generated by wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is an attractive flow for technologies such as partial nitritation-anammox (CANON), nitrite shortcut (NSC) and struvite crystallization processes (SCP). The high concentration of N and P and its low flow rate facilitate the removal of nutrients under more favorable conditions than in the main water line. Despite their operational and economic benefits, the environmental burdens of these technologies also need to be assessed to prove their feasibility under a more holistic perspective. The potential environmental implications of these technologies were assessed using life cycle assessment, first at pilot plant scale, later integrating them in a modeled full WWTP. Pilot plant results reported a much lower environmental impact for N removal technologies than SCP. Full-scale modeling, however, highlighted that the differences between technologies were not relevant once they are integrated in a WWTP. The impacts associated with the WWTP are slightly reduced in all categories except for eutrophication, where a substantial reduction was achieved using NSC, SCP, and especially when CANON and SCP were combined. This study emphasizes the need for assessing wastewater treatment technologies as part of a WWTP rather than as individual processes and the utility of modeling tools for doing so.

AB  - Honeybee populations around the world are experiencing a decrease in colony numbers probably due to a combination of different causes, such as diseases, poor nutrition and frequent applications of insecticides to control pests. Previous studies about the effect of pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) on Apis mellifera L. report different results. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of field aerial applications of Btk on bee colony performance, specifically on the brood cell percentage evolution, which can be used as an indicator of queen health and brood development breeding rates. To achieve it, the brood cell surface was photographed in every sampling, and data were analyzed using a method based on image treatment software. A total of 480 pictures were examined from two groups of four nucleus hives in two areas, one receiving aerial spraying with Btk and the other without treatment. A mixed factorial design was realized to analyse the data showing no differences in colony performance between the two groups of colonies either before the treatment, during and at the end of the assay. Furthermore, the brood surface ratio of Btk-treated/untreated increased along the experiment. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that Btk aerial applications did not affect the brood development of honeybees under natural conditions. Nevertheless further field studies are required to ascertain a safe use of Btk in forest pest management.

AB  - This study aimed to set out a new methodology for habitat modeling in high-gradient streams. The methodology is based on the mesoscale approach of the MesoHABSIM simulation system and can support the definition and assessment of environmental flow and habitat restoration measures. Data from 40 study sites located within the mountainous areas of the Valle d'Aosta, Piemonte and Liguria regions (Northwest Italy) were used in the analysis. To adapt MesoHABSIM to high-gradient streams, we first modified the data collection strategy to address the challenging conditions of surveys by using GIS and mobile mapping techniques. Secondly, we built habitat suitability models at a regional scale to enable their transferability among different streams with different morphologies. Thirdly, due to the absence of stream gauges in headwaters, we proposed a possible way to simulate flow time series and, therefore, generate habitat time series. The resulting method was evaluated in terms of time expenditure for field data collection and habitat-modeling potentials, and it represents specific improvement of the MesoHABSIM system for habitat modeling in high-gradient streams, where other commonly used methodologies can be unsuitable. Through its application at several study sites, the proposed methodology adapted well to high-gradient streams and allowed the: (1) definition of fish habitat requirements for many streams simultaneously, (2) modeling of habitat variation over a range of discharges, and (3) determination of environmental standards for mountainous watercourses.

AB  - Crystal surfaces provide physical interfaces between the geosphere and biosphere. It follows that the arrangement of atoms at the surfaces of crystals profoundly influences biological components at many levels, from cells through biopolymers to single organic molecules. Many studies have focused on the crystal-molecule interface in water using large, flat single crystals. However, little is known about atomic-scale surface structures of the nanometer- to micrometer-sized crystals of simple metal oxides typically used in batch adsorption experiments under conditions relevant to biogeochemistry and the origins of life. Here, we present atomic-resolution microscopy data with unprecedented detail of the circumferences of nanosized rutile (alpha-TiO2) crystals previously used in studies of the adsorption of protons, cations, and amino acids. The data suggest that one-third of the {110} faces, the largest faces on individual crystals, consist of steps at the atomic scale. The steps have the orientation to provide undercoordinated Ti atoms of the type, and abundance for adsorption of amino acids as inferred from previous surface complexation modeling of batch adsorption data. A remarkably uniform pattern of step proportions emerges: the step proportions are independent of surface roughness and reflect their relative surface energies. Consequently, the external morphology of rutile nanometer- to micrometer-sized crystals imaged at the coarse scale of scanning electron microscope images is not an accurate indicator of the atomic smoothness or of the proportions of the steps present. Overall, our data strongly suggest that amino acids attach at these steps on the {110} surfaces of rutile.

AB  - Silicate minerals can be a source of calcium and alkalinity, enabling CO2 sequestration in the form of carbonates. For this to occur, the mineral needs to be first dissolved in an acidifying process such as the biological process of anaerobic fermentation. In the present study, the main factors which govern the dissolution process of an alkaline silicate mineral (wollastonite, CaSiO3) in an anaerobic fermentation process were determined. Wollastonite dissolution kinetics was measured in a series of chemical batch experiments in order to be able to estimate the required amount of alkaline silicate that can neutralize the acidifying fermentation process. An anaerobic fermentation of glucose with wollastonite as the neutralizing agent was consequently performed in a fed-batch reactor. Results of this experiment were compared with an abiotic (control) fed-batch reactor in which the fermentation products (i.e. organic acids and alcohols) were externally supplied to the system at comparable rates and proportions, in order to provide chemical conditions similar to those during the biotic (fermentation) experiment. This procedure enabled us to determine whether dissolution of wollastonite was solely enhanced by production of organic acids or whether there were other impacts that fermentative bacteria could have on the mineral dissolution rate. The established pH profiles, which were the direct indicator of the dissolution rate, were comparable in both experiments suggesting that the mineral dissolution rate was mostly influenced by the quantity of the organic acids produced.

AB  - Skates and rays are a common component of mixed demersal fisheries, and large quantities may be discarded. Given their biological vulnerability, understanding the fate of these elasmobranchs is of management concern. Estimates of discard survival are needed for modelling the possible benefits of management measures. In this study, the focus is on the Bristol Channel skate fishery, where on-board holding tanks were used to assess the short-term rates of survival of trawl-caught skates (Rajidae). From monitoring the survival rates of 162 fish kept in specially designed on-board holding tanks for periods of up to 72 h, the short-term rate of survival was 55%. Visual inspection of "health" at time zero was a good indicator of survival, because 79% of skates with a poor health score did not survive. Mortality rates for fish of moderate health and good "health" were 16% and 5%, respectively. This information allows one to predict the consequences of fishing practice on discard survival using a larger dataset on fish scored for health before tagging and release. The proportion in poor condition on capture is positively correlated with estimated codend weight, so technical modifications to fishing gear aimed at reducing unwanted by-catch would increase the survival of discarded skates. Combined with information on discarding rates in the study area, the results indicate that discard mortality removes almost as many fish from the skate stock as are landed commercially.

AB  - Correct field drift prediction is a key element in environmental risk assessment of spraying applications. A reduced order drift prediction model based on the diffusion-advection equation is presented. It allows fast assessment of the drift potential of specific ground boom applications under specific environmental wind conditions that obey the logarithmic wind profile. The model was calibrated based on simulations with a validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. Validation of both models against 38 carefully conducted field experiments is successfully performed for distances up to 20 m from the field edge, for spraying on flat pasture land. The reduced order model succeeded in correct drift predictions for different nozzle types, wind velocities, boom heights and spray pressures. It used 4 parameters representing the physical aspects of the drift cloud; the height of the cloud at the field edge, the mass flux crossing the field edge, the settling velocity of the droplets and the turbulence. For the parameter set and range considered, it is demonstrated for the first time that the effect of the droplet diameter distribution of the different nozzle types on the amount of deposition spray drift can be evaluated by a single parameter, i.e., the volume fraction of droplets with a diameter smaller than 191 pm. The reduced order model can be solved more than 4 orders of magnitude faster than the comprehensive CFD model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characterization of ICESat/GLAS waveforms over terrestrial ecosystems: Implications for vegetation mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
LA  - English
AB  - ICESat/GLAS laser altimetry data have become increasingly utilized for vegetation mapping and canopy characterization. Waveform shapes are dependent upon complex relationships between several factors on the illuminated surface including topography, brightness, clouds, satellite pointing, laser energy, footprint size, shape and orientation, and vegetation height and position within the footprint. However, the understanding of these factors is presently unclear. We first examine the simple case introduced into the GLAS waveform by laser retro-reflectors placed at White Sands, New Mexico, as a proxy for vegetation height detection. We observed that the 1/e(2) energy distribution was only an approximation and that strong reflectors contribute to the returned energy beyond the estimated parameters. The precise position of the corner cube reflector within each footprint coupled with laser pointing angle is an important factor on the estimated vegetation height. Next we examine the implications of vegetation structure and surface topography on the waveform shape and derived elevations, compared with data from an airborne lidar system at Freeman Ranch, Texas, which has been targeted by ICESat since 2005. Small-footprint waveforms were combined to synthesize the energy distribution within a GLAS footprint, and they compared well (> 90% correlation) to the GLAS waveforms. The GLAS-estimated canopy heights compared well (mu = 0.21 m) to the airborne lidar estimates during leaf-on conditions. However, GLAS-estimated ground elevations are biased by similar to 1 m compared to airborne lidar in vegetated regions. In this landscape, the GLAS-energy ratio (canopy-to-ground energy) was a good indicator (R-2 = 0.74) of the amount of woody cover within the footprint.

AB  - 1. The specific respiration rate of 13 chironomid taxa and Chaoborus were measured to test the hypothesis of the relation between a species' ability to regulate their oxygen uptake and their distributional patterns among nine study lakes in British Columbia, Canada.
   2. Respiration patterns of individual taxa were modelled using piecewise linear regression with break point and simple hyperbolic functions. Three types of respiration curves were identified: (i) classical oxy-conformers (e.g. littoral Cricotopus) which cannot sustain a sufficient oxygen uptake with decreasing oxygen availability; (ii) oxy-regulators (e.g. profundal Chironomus) which can regulate and maintain a constant respiration until a certain critical point and (iii) oxy-stressors (Micropsectra) which increase their respiration rate with decreasing oxygen availability until a critical point.
   3. Respiration was measured at two different temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C), and over the range of oxygen saturation conditions studied here (0-90%) mean Q(10) values varied from 1.3 to 2.5.
   4. The results show that different chironomid taxa have varying sensitivity to low oxygen concentrations and different respiratory responses to increased temperature. The critical point increased to higher oxygen saturation for six taxa, decreased for one taxon and was unchanged for two taxa.
   5. The results illustrate one of the possible biological mechanisms behind the use of chironomids as temperature and climate indicators in palaeoecological studies by exploring the link between temperature and respiration physiology.

AB  - Shallow ponds associated with peatlands in boreal Alberta contain large quantities of stored carbon in their peaty sediments, and exhibit spatial changes in response to dry or wet conditions. Peatland ponds around Utikuma Lake experienced a partial to nearly complete drawdown in 2002, in response to drought. A fourfold investigation was begun to assess the natural drought and flood cycles, assess the current C stocks along the shore, determine what species were colonizing the newly exposed shorelines, and to place the magnitude of the current drought into historical perspective. Ten vegetation communities were found to have colonized the exposed sediments. Paleostratigraphy shows that the surface communities differ markedly from paleocommunities. Stratigraphy of the wetland sediments demonstrates that only two changes occurred, one a successional switch from a sedge-dominated marsh to a forested bog, the other a much more recent disturbance that caused water levels near the pond to rise. No evidence of constantly changing paleocommunities was found, suggesting that previous droughts have not left a visible paleorecord. The more recent disturbance has likely redistributed peat into the pond basins and subsequently it has broken down to detritial peat, altering its physical structure, and perhaps its rate of decomposition. Continued exposure of the peat is likely to enhance decomposition. In this study both flooding and drought may have impacted the wetland in ways likely to result in higher rates of decomposition and enhanced CO2 emissions under global warming.

AB  - Disinfectant, demand and microbial inactivation rate are essential issues for assessing disinfection performance and proper design of disinfecting systems. In the United Kingdom and Italy, peracetic acid (PAA) has recently become an accepted disinfectant for treating wastewaters prior to reuse in agriculture, and its use is likely to spread worldwide due to its efficacy as well as the benign nature of the by-products produced. In this paper, overall PAA demand during the advanced disinfection of municipal wastewater for agricultural reuse was evaluated under different experimental conditions. Batch tests were carried out using primary and secondary settled effluents sampled at the City of Taranto municipal wastewater treatment plant. PAA dosages ranged from 1.5 to 8.5 mg/L and from 21 to 40 mg/L for the. secondary and primary settled effluents, respectively. Residual PAA was measured after contact times ranging from 1 to 60 min. Results showed that after a strong and almost instantaneous initial disinfectant consumption, the PAA consumption followed first-order kinetics with both effluents. The effluent characteristics affected the values of the parameters in the consumption model. PAA disinfection efficacy was assessed in terms of total coliform and Escherichia coli indicator organism reduction; better results were achieved with the latter. The approximate solution of Hom's model established by Haas and Joffe was used to model inactivation kinetics of both microbial targets.

AB  - Controlling environmental parameters for the early stages of marine invertebrates have received little attention, particularly in field studies. This study involves measurement of abundances and growth rates of the bivalve Ruditapes decussatus Linnaeus 1758 during its planktonic larval and early benthic life stages in a coastal lagoon: Ria Formosa, Portugal. Measured abundances were compared with tidal amplitude, water temperature, salinity, wind velocity and direction, and a food availability indicator (chlorophyll a). Data were obtained on abundance and prodissoconch length of the larvae, measured two to three times per week, and of post-larval stages individuals that had settled in artificial collectors over 10 months. Larval and juvenile cohorts were identified using size-frequency distributions and larval ages estimated by larval shell growth lines. Data were fitted to linear, exponential, and Laird-Gompertz growth models. Larval growth rates best matched a linear model: 3.78 +/- 0.55 per day, r(2) = 0.75, p < 0.001. Early benthonic growth rates best matched a Laird-Gompertz model: 3.97 +/- 0.15 per month, r(2) = 0.98, p < 0.001. It was concluded that there was a significant relationship between planktonic and recruitment abundances. Water temperature (as a coarse factor) and advection (as a fine factor) effects were inferred to be the prime environmental factors affecting early life stages of this species in this coastal lagoon system.

AB  - The sequences of diagenetic changes of polymorphic silica modifications in weathering silcretes from volcanic rocks of Central and Eastern Slovakia was studied by comprehensive methods. It was found that these changes follow a similar way to that described for the diagenesis of biogenic opals, that is from opal (opal-A) through opal-CT-chalcedony-secondary quartz with gradual changes of silica crystallinity.
   In the formation of the different weathering silcrete types direct silica precipitation participated together with processes of alternate dissolution-reprecipitation and recrystallization and gravity transport.
   Direct precipitation of silica from colloidal solutions trough a gel stage is documented by the presence of colloidal fabric and features. ''Pseudo-brecciated'' textures of silcrete is evidence of gravity transport of the (aged) gel fragments. The progressive change in the crystallinity of secondary silica forms is usually a complex process which is connected with changes in the degree of saturation of weathering solution to the individual polymorphic silica phases and with the presence of some others components which may accelerate these changes. The weathering silcretes in the studied volcanic rocks are relict in nature. They originated in conditions characteristic of intensive (hydrolytic) weathering. Silcretes are juxtaposed (superimposed) on iron-rich illuviated kaolinitic clays or secondary Fe-, Mn- and Ti-oxides. They are preserved in the fissures and cavities of weathered rocks as erosion remnants of the paleoweathering crusts. Therefore these silcretes can serve as paleoweathering indicators.

AB  - In the Cordillera de la Costa of the central Andes in northern Chile, Mesozoic arc complexes are cut by a trench-parallel strike-slip fault system: the Atacama fault system. Brittle faulting in the Atacama fault system is superposed on steeply dipping foliations in ductile shear belts. Between 25-degrees-S and 27-degrees-S, the western part of the fault system was active in Early Cretaceous time as an upper amphibolite facies, down-to-the-east, dip-slip ductile shear zone. In the eastern part of the fault system, ductile deformation is of similar Early Cretaceous age but occurred under lower-grade metamorphic conditions at the greenschist/lower amphibolite facies transition. The mylonites in the eastern part of the fault system were formed by sinistral strike-slip displacement.
   The dip-slip and sinistral strike-slip displacements are contemporary with the development of a magmatic arc, and they imply that the tectonic environment in this part of the arc was transtensional. The ductile deformation was partitioned spatially into a dip-slip component associated with the emplacement of magmas and a sinistral strike-slip component.
   Brittle fault zones in the El Salado segment of the Atacama fault system define large-scale sidewall ripout structures. Subhorizontal slickenlines, ripout asymmetry, and S-C-type fabrics in fault gouge indicate that brittle deformation involved sinistral strike-slip displacements. The transition from ductile to brittle sinistral strike-slip displacements may have occurred due to cooling, in mid-Cretaceous time, when the magmatic are was abandoned.

AB  - Due to climate change, with contaminated and less fertile soils, and intense weather phenomena, a turn towards hydroponic vegetable production has been made. Hydroponic cultivation of vegetables is considered to be a clean, safe and environmentally friendly growing technique; however, incidence of microbial contamination i.e. foodborne pathogens, might occur, endangering human health. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different plant growth stages, pH (values 5, 6, 7, 8) and bacterial inoculum levels (3 and 6 log cfu/mL) on hydroponically cultivated lettuce spiked with Salmonella Enteritidis. The results revealed that the pH and inoculum levels affected the internalization and survival of the pathogen in the hydroponic environment and plant tissue. Younger plants were found to be more susceptible to pathogen internalization compared to older ones. Under the current growing conditions (hydroponics, pH and inoculum levels), no leaf internalization was observed at all lettuce growth stages, despite the bacterium presence in the hydroponic solution. Noticeably, bacteria load at the nutrient solution was lower in low pH levels. These results showed that bacterium presence initiates plant response as indicated by the increased phenols, antioxidants and damage index markers (H2O2, MDA) in order for the plant to resist contamination by the invader. Nutrient solution management can result in Taylor-made recipes for plant growth and possible controlling the survival and growth of S. Enteritidis by pH levels.

AB  - As an emerging energy conservation approach, the combination system of LNG regasification and air separation can not only recover the low-grade cold energy of LNG, but also reduce the power consumption of traditional air separation process. This paper proposes four external circulation design schemes for the energy conversion of LNG regasification and nitrogen cooling under different pressure matching conditions to realize the cascade energy utilization of LNG cold energy air separation process. The energy and exergy thermodynamic models are built for the four schemes based on the energy balance and pinch point analysis. The Linde cycle with LNG precooling is used for the model testing, and the related performance indicators of the newly designed systems are compared with the traditional and existing systems. The results indicate that the four schemes proposed in this paper can greatly reduce the energy consumption per unit liquid product, the minimum consumption of which is only 0.189 kW.h.kg(-1). In addition, with the increase of LNG pressure, the exergy loss of each scheme decreases. According to the comparison of different schemes, the external circulation with high-pressure LNG and low-pressure circulating nitrogen has the smallest LNG demand, minimum exergy loss and the largest exergy efficiency of 0.869, and the LNG volume required per unit liquid nitrogen production is 1.739 Nm(3), achieving the best LNG cold energy utilization rate.

AB  - In the perspective of sustainable development, the economic effect of Environmental Enterprises is an important basis to check and measure their operating conditions. The evaluation of the economic effect of Environmental Enterprises is to better promote the reasonable competition among enterprises, seek the reasons and methods to solve the problems, and then promote the economic effect of the whole industry on the overall level. The economic effect of an enterprise should be a comprehensive reflection of various indicators. How to accurately compare the economic effects of Environmental Enterprises based on various indicators is a very important problem. At present, the "scoring method" is mainly used to evaluate the effect of an enterprise. It first determines a number of evaluation indicators of enterprise benefits, and then marks each index according to the completion of these indicators and the corresponding standards formulated by these indicators. Finally, the economic effect of an enterprise is comprehensively evaluated according to the sum of the scores of each index. This method is based on scoring, because it is a man-made standard, with a certain degree of subjectivity, affecting the authenticity of the evaluation of economic results. Hydrology puts forward a method of economic effect comparison of Environmental Enterprises -- comprehensive weighting method. On this basis, sensitivity analysis of economic effect index weight and index weight value is carried out, which provides a new technology for more scientific and reasonable evaluation of shipping enterprise effect in the future.

AB  - The Formicidae are considered crucial components of the entomosarcosaprophagous fauna because they can delay the decomposition process, cause tissue postmortem damage and produce bloodstain patterns that may confuse investigations. Moreover, some studies suggest that the Formicidae can act as environmental and seasonal indicators. However, studies on this group on vertebrate carcasses are scarce, especially in the Iberian Peninsula and the southwest of Europe. Thus, comparative studies at different altitudes in a protected wild mountain area could provide useful information on its composition in such environmental conditions, their role as environmental indicators and their forensic implications. For this reason, the Formicidae sarcosaprophagous community was studied at three different altitudes, between 400 and 1,500 m, in a wild mountainous area in the southeast of Spain using a modified Schoenly trap, with two pitfall traps inside, baited with 5 kg piglets (Sus scrofaL.). This work illustrates an approach to the community of the Formicidae, as a representative of the sarcosaprophagous community in an altitudinal gradient, showing a great variability in its composition. Furthermore, when comparing our results with other studies carried out in the Iberian Peninsula, we are able to suggest certain species with a potential utility as geographic and environmental indicators. Thus,Iberoformica subrufa,Lasius brunneus,Lasius cinereusandCamponotus sylvaticusare species of special interest as they appeared in either one of the sampled areas or in the same region.

AB  - Water security is a major concern for water-scarce cities that face dynamic water challenges due to limited water supply, climate change and increasing water demand. Framing urban water security is challenging due to the complexity and uncertainties of the definitions and assessment frameworks concerning urban water security. Several studies have assessed water security by granting priority indicators equal weight without considering or adapting to the local conditions. This study develops a new urban water security assessment framework with application to the water-scarce city of Madaba, Jordan. The study applies the new assessment framework on the study area and measures urban water security using the integrated urban water security index (IUWSI) and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) as a decision management tool to prioritise and distinguish indicators that affect the four dimensions of urban water security: drinking water, ecosystems, climate change and water-related hazards, and socioeconomic aspects (DECS). The integrated urban water security index (IUWSI) highlights the state of water security and intervention strategies in Madaba. The study reveals that urban water security in Madaba is satisfactory to meet basic needs, with shortcomings in some aspects of the DECS. However, Madaba faces poor security in terms of managing climate- and water-related risks. The IUWSI framework assists with a rational and evidence-based decision-making process, which is important for enhancing water resources management in water-scarce cities.

AB  - In order to obtain bioactive allelochemicals from Neotropical Annonaceae, bioguided chromatographic fractionations with derivatives prepared from Duguetia lanceolata St.-Hil. leaves were performed using the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Mots. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), as bioindicator, which is a primary insect pest of stored cereals in tropical conditions. For this end, four phases (hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and hydroalcohol) were obtained firstly by liquid-liquid partition and tested through a residual contact bioassay (at 1500 mg L-1) in order to verify their bioactivity on adults of the maize weevil. Only the hexanic fraction caused significant mortality (74%) after the tenth day of insect exposure on treated samples of grains corn. Thus, thisfraction was separated into seven new subfractions by means of vacuum column chromatography and solvents of increasing polarities. Subfraction 2 promoted 90% of mortality whereas subfraction 6 promoted 30% of mortality of maize weevils. The aromatic compound 2,4,5-trimethoxystyrene and a mixture of steroids [campesterol (8.44%) + stigmasterol (12.37%) + sitosterol (79.19%)] were isolated from subfraction 2 and promoted promising grain protective activity, in a manner comparable to a diatomaceous-earth based formulation (our positive control). Furthermore, the results reported in the present study demonstrate the potential application of derivatives of D. lanceolata leaves in integrated pest management (IPM) of stored grains, mainly in the framework of maize weevil management.

AB  - Research demonstrates the high operating temperature of crystalline silicon based photovoltaic (PV) module will lead to an obvious decrease in conversion efficiency and lifetime. In this study, the phase change material (PCM) is employed and attached at the back of PV module, which is called PV-PCM system, to absorb excess heat from PV module for PV thermal regulation and electrical efficiency improvement. Besides, the PV-PCM-T system, i.e. integrated with a solar thermal (ST) collector to further utilize the heat stored in PCM, is also investigated for comparison. To evaluate the system's operating performance in practical application, a novel PV-PCM module and PV-PCM-T module are designed, fabricated and tested under real outdoor conditions. The PV temperature, PCM temperature, water temperature, electricity output data are collected and analyzed. Results show that PV temperature difference between PV-only and PV-PCM system could reach to 23 degrees C, thus the electricity output of PV-PCM system increases by 5.18%. Moreover, the total energy output of the PV-PCM-T system is evaluated through introducing three indicators, i.e. energetic sum, exergetic sum and electrical sum, which are calculated as 3,088, 1920 and 2312 kJ/day, increase by 74.3%, 8.32% and 30.4% respectively.

AB  - Major conifer species with a widespread geographic distribution are growing under diverse climatic conditions. For such species, populations in regions with low resource availability, where producing additional cones is costly, presumably have more individuals that produce larger, highly viable cones with a higher resource-use efficiency. Geographic variations in cone characteristics (cone and seed size, seed production and productivity per cone) were examined for 28 Pinus densiflora natural populations (628 trees) across the species' distribution in Japan. The degree of phenotypic differentiation across populations (P-ST) varied among the ten characteristics investigated. The average P-ST value (0.139) was higher than the previously reported neutral genetic variation of the species (F-ST = 0.013). The more northeastern populations produced cones of larger size (in length, width and mass), had higher seed production (number of filled seeds, seed mass per cone) and had higher seed productivity (indicators for seed production per cone development cost). A generalized linear mixed model showed that geographic variation in cone size and seed productivity per cone of populations was correlated negatively with annual solar radiation and mean temperature. The larger cone size and higher seed productivity per cone observed in northeastern populations support the hypothesis of higher resource-use efficiency, and could result from a genetic or plastic response under lower temperature and less radiation.

AB  - As one of the rare terrestrial archive with continuous sedimentation back to almost 1 Ma in Anatolia, the Eskisehir Graben was investigated in outcrops and cores by multi-proxy analysis regarding chronology and paleoclimatology. The present study comprises significant implications for both the impact of climate changes on fluvial systems in the timescales of the Milankovitch band and the controversial age and rate of the crustal extension in western Anatolia. Our findings indicate that LOI950 and delta O-18(carb), which are indicators for the amount of soil carbonate and paleo-temperature respectively are collectively capable of distinguishing between glacial and interglacial periods in the predominantly floodplain deposits of the graben infill. Secondarily, LOI550 and delta C-13(carb) values further help this discrimination via primary production and composition of vegetation cover respectively. Pollen data, albeit highly discontinuous due to poor preservation under subaerial conditions, point out a steppe-like vegetation cover where the forest components expand particularly in the wet interglacial periods. In the other hand, the chronological frame provided by astronomical calibration of certain proxy-records strongly suggest that the Eskisehir Fault Zone initiated as a boundary fault of a half-graben some 900 ka. The rate of vertical movement on its southern branch since the last 70 ka is unexpectedly high (2.3 mm a), a phenomenon that requires urgent risk assessment analysis in the vicinity of the Eskisehir city.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine seasonal variations of two biomarkers of oxidative stress, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and their correlation with lipid-carbohydrate metabolism in the edible bivalve Donax trunculus. The samples were collected during the four seasons in 2014 at two sites in the Gulf of Annaba (northeast of Algeria): El Battah, which is some distance from any source of pollution, is considered a relatively clean site, while Sidi Salem is a site exposed to various sources of industrial, urban and harbour pollution. The results show a significant decrease in LDH activity in Sidi Salem D. trunculus compared with those at El Battah. Moreover, carbohydrate levels increased significantly in Sidi Salem. The MDA rate increased significantly in Sidi Salem relative to El Battah, while the amounts of lipid showed a significant decrease. The lipid and carbohydrate metabolism was negatively correlated with LDH and MDA. This difference between the two sites was observed for all seasons, with more effect in spring and summer. The results obtained showed that under stressful conditions due to anthropogenic factors, some physiological processes of D. trunculus can be affected. Thus, D. trunculus appears to be a suitable sentinel species for the assessment of ecotoxicological risk in the Gulf of Annaba.

AB  - Polyphenisms, where multiple, discrete, environmentally-cued phenotypes can arise from a single genotype, are extreme forms of phenotypic plasticity. Cue acquisition and interpretation are vital for matching phenotypes to varying environments, but can be difficult if cues are unreliable indicators or if multiple cues are present simultaneously. Facultative paedomorphosis, where juvenile traits are retained at sexual maturity, is a density-dependent polyphenism exhibited by many salamanders. Favorable conditions such as low larval densities and stable hydroperiod delay metamorphosis and promote a paedomorphic strategy. We investigated proximate cues affecting facultative paedomorphosis in order to understand how larval newts (Notophthalmus viridescens louisianensis) assess conspecific density. To isolate the effects of density cues from the effects of resources and agonistic behavior, we caged larval newts in mesocosms in a 2 x 2 factorial design that manipulated both background larval newt densities (high or low) and food levels (ambient or supplemented). We found strong effects of both food and density on caged individuals. Under high densities, caged larvae were more likely to become efts, a long-lasting juvenile terrestrial stage, across both food levels, while paedomorphs were more common under low densities. Though food levels increased growth rates, density had strong independent effects on metamorphic timing and phenotype. Competition for food and space are classical density-dependent processes, but density cues themselves may be a mediator of density-dependent effects on polyphenisms and life history responses.

AB  - The presence and magnitude of sediment contamination remaining in a completed dredge area can often dictate the success of an environmental dredging project. The need to better understand and manage this remaining contamination, referred to as postdredging residuals, has increasingly been recognized by practitioners and investigators. Based on recent dredging projects with robust characterization programs, it is now understood that the residual contamination layer in the postdredging sediment comprises a mixture of contaminated sediments that originate from throughout the dredge cut. This mixture of contaminated sediments initially exhibits fluid mud properties that can contribute to sediment transport and contamination risk outside of the dredge area. This article reviews robust dredging residual evaluations recently performed in the United States and Canada, including the Hudson River, Lower Fox River, Ashtabula River, and Esquimalt Harbour, along with other projects. These data better inform the understanding of residuals generation, leading to improved models of dredging residual formation to inform remedy evaluation, selection, design, and implementation. Data from these projects confirm that the magnitude of dredging residuals is largely determined by site conditions, primarily in situ sediment fluidity or liquidity as measured by dry bulk density. While the generation of dredging residuals cannot be avoided, residuals can be successfully and efficiently managed through careful development and implementation of site-specific management plans.

AB  - This study evaluated petroleum contamination in the Yanchang (Shaanxi Yanchang Petroleum (Group) Co., Ltd.) oilfield, located in the loess plateau region of northern Shaanxi, China. Surface soil and sediment samples were collected from the wasteland, farmland, and riverbed in this area to assess the following parameters: total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13). The results showed that TPH and PAH levels in the study area were 907-3447 mg/kg and 103.59-563.50 mu g/kg, respectively, significantly higher than the control samples (TPH 224 mg/kg, PAHs below method quantification limit, MQL). Tests using delta C-13 to detect modified TPH (2238.66 to 6639.42 mg/kg) in the wastelands adjacent to the oil wells revealed more significant contamination than tests using extraction gravimetric analysis. In addition, "chemical fingerprint" indicators, such as low to high molecular weight (LMW/HMW) hydrocarbons, carbon preference index (CPI), and pristine/phytane (Pr/Ph), further confirmed the presence of heavy petroleum contamination and weathering. This has resulted in a nutrient imbalance and unsuitable pH and moisture conditions for microbial metabolic activities. This study evaluates petroleum contamination, which can inform contamination remediation on a case by case basis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the level of organochlorine pesticides use for treatment of tomatoes, eggplants and cucumbers in Kirklareli, Turkey. Eighteen organochlorine pesticides were identified in vegetable samples using microwave or Soxhlet extraction, and results were obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The optimized conditions were 1 mL/min for flow rate in the mobile phase, 1 mu L for injection volume and 70 V for fragmentation potential. The analytical parameters show that the microwave oven extraction procedure provided the best results when compared to the Soxhlet extraction procedure. Samples were prepared for analysis with hexaneaEuro'dichlormethane (1: 1, v/v, 40 mL) using a solid-phase extraction method. The limits of detection and quantitation for the eighteen analytes were between 0.02-0.26 and 0.06-0.87 mu g/L, respectively, and the relative standard deviations of the migration time ranged from 2.4 to 8.9%. The recoveries of surrogate spiked in vegetable samples ranged from 70 to 116%, respectively. The obtained concentrations of pesticides in all vegetables studied were proved in the range of ND-123 mu g/kg. The organochlorine pesticide sum was below the legal limit, except for Endrin and Methoxychlor, which requires a further elucidation of the organochlorine pesticides pollution sources in the region. These studies on accumulation of organochlorine pesticides were necessary for accomplishing a comprehensive ecological risk assessment.

AB  - Galling insects tend to be highly sensitive to changes in their host plants or their environment. Here we analyze the effects of Chaco Serrano forest fragmentation on gall inducing species associated with four native plants species, simultaneously examining area and edge effects as well as the role of host plant availability on such effects. At edge and interior locations in each of nine forest sites in an area gradient in Central Argentina, we estimated herbivory as (1) the proportion of galled plants and (2) the number of galls per plant. Herbivory variations in relation to forest area and edge/interior locations were analyzed with generalized linear models, whereas the influence of plant availability in mediating area and edge effects was assessed by Structural Equation Models. Different responses to fragmentation were observed, depending on the insect species and also on the chosen herbivory indicator. Significant edge and area effects were detected in four and two out of ten performed models, respectively. When significant, edge effects were mostly positive and consistently direct rather than mediated by plant availability; instead, area effects varied from positive and led by plant abundance, to negative and independent of plant availability. Our study provides new evidence of a tendency for galling insects to benefit from edge conditions, while showing less consistent effects regarding forest size. Our results also suggest a very limited role for plant availability as a mechanism mediating fragmentation effects on herbivory by galling insects.

AB  - As hypoxic conditions spread in our oceans, indices that quickly and efficiently assess oxygen content in sediment pore water, and habitat quality are increasingly becoming desirable. Depth to the apparent redox potential discontinuity (aRPD) in sediment is one such index; however, the relationship between aRPD depth and oxygen content is still unclear. We quantified oxygen content in sediment pore water with a dissolved oxygen (DO) probe, utilizing luminescent technology, to determine how DO concentration varies with depth in the sediment, and with position relative to the aRPD (above versus below) on an intertidal mudflat in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Based on generalized linear regression models, we found that depth in the sediment was a poor predictor of pore water DO concentration, while position in the sediment relative to the aRPD was a good predictor. Further, sediment above the aRPD had higher DO content than sediment below. We maintain that aRPD depth is a good measure of relative oxygen content in sediment pore water, as well as habitat quality. However, we recommend caution as the factors that influence aRPD depth are numerous and variable; therefore, the relationship between aRPD depth and DO content should be experimentally confirmed in any system of interest before aRPD depth is used as an indicator.

AB  - This study shows the changes of natural organic matter (NOM) from Lake Hohloh, (Black Forest, Germany) during heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO2 (TiO2/UV). The effect of pH on the adsorption of NOM onto TiO2 in the dark and TiO2/UV degradation of NOM was followed using three-dimensional excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence. At pH values between 4 and 9, the NOM was adsorbed onto TiO2 in the dark with a greater decrease in the fluorescence intensity and in the spectral shapes, especially under acidic pH conditions. However, at pH = 10 there was not adsorption on NOM which led to a negligible changes the fluorescence intensity. A significant high linear correlation was observed between the DOC adsorption onto TiO2 and the maximum fluorescence intensity. Additionally, the NOM adsorption onto TiO2 and its TiO2/UV degradation shifted the fluorescence maxima toward shorter wavelengths in the EEM contour plots, with a decrease in aromaticity. These changes were accompanied by a substantial decrease in the organically bound halogens adsorbable on activated carbon (AOXFP) and the trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP). Thus, the decrease in maximum fluorescence intensity can be used as an indicator of AOXFP and TTHMFP removal efficiency. Therefore, fluorescence spectroscopy is a robust analytical technique for evaluate TiO2/UV removal of NOM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Detailed, chronologically tightly constrained, lake-sediment-based geochemical and pollen records have enabled local changes in soil erosion, woodland cover and composition, and prehistoric farming impact to be reconstructed in considerable detail. The profile opens shortly after 7800 BC when tall canopy trees were well-established and presumably in equilibrium with their environment. A distinct perturbation that involved an increase in pine and birch, a decrease in oak and a minor opening-up of the woodland is regarded as the local expression of the 8.2 ka climate anomaly. Lack of response in the geochemical erosional indicators is interpreted as evidence for drier conditions. A short-lived, over-compensation in climate recovery followed the 82 ka event. Neolithic farming impact is clearly expressed in both the pollen and geochemical data. Both datasets indicate that Neolithic impact was concentrated in the early Neolithic (3715-3440 BC). In the interval 3000-2700 BC there appears to have been a break in farming activity. The pollen data suggest substantially increased farming impact (both arable and pastoral) in the Bronze Age, with maximum farming and woodland clearances taking place in the late Bronze Age (1155-935 BC). These developments are poorly expressed in the geochemical record, possibly due to within-lake changes. (C) 2013 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent studies suggest a marked expansion of glacial ice across much of Gondwana beginning in the earliest Permian. Because expansion of glacial ice results in a lowering of sea level, the imprint of ice expansion should be evident worldwide as significant exposure event, hiatuses, or other evidence for sea level drop at or near the Pennsylvanian-Permian boundary. This literature review investigates the signature of an Early Permian expansion of Gondwanan ice through examination of stratigraphic records from eight carbonate-dominated, palaeotropical regions across Pangaea. Tropical carbonate environments are used because most form in tectonically quiescent regions and are sensitive indicators of eustatic change. Correlation between stratigraphic sections is achieved using the most current biostratigraphic and absolute time constraints available. All studied sections show a sequence boundary or basinward shift in facies at or near the Pennsylvanian-Permian boundary, supporting the hypothesis of a significant expansion of glacial ice and global eustatic lowstand beginning in the Early Permian. By contrast, a series of mid-Sakmarian-Kungurian transgression events in the palaeotropics are interpreted to reflect the asynchronous deglaciation of Gondwana. The stratigraphic framework developed herein will allow for better correlations among stratigraphic records from Gondwana and northern Pangaea, which will ultimately improve the understanding of how carbonate systems respond to global icehouse conditions, such as during the late Palaeozoic.

AB  - Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a membrane-bound, tumor-related enzyme whose expression is often considered a marker for hypoxia, an indicator of poor prognosis in the majority of cancer patients, and is associated with acidification of the tumor microenvironment. Here, we describe for the first time the catalytic properties of native CAIX in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that exhibit hypoxia-inducible CAIX expression. Using O-18 exchange measured by membrane inlet mass spectrometry, we determined catalytic activity in membrane ghosts and intact cells. Exofacial carbonic anhydrase activity increases with exposure to hypoxia, an activity which is suppressed by impermeant sulfonamide CA inhibitors. Inhibition by sulfonamide inhibitors is not sensitive to reoxygenation. CAIX activity in intact cells increases in response to reduced pH. Data from membrane ghosts show that the increase in activity at reduced pH is largely due to an increase in the dehydration reaction. In addition, the kinetic constants of CAIX in membrane ghosts are very similar to our previous measurements for purified, recombinant, truncated forms. Hence, the activity of CAIX is not affected by the proteoglycan extension or membrane environment. These activities were measured at a total concentration for all CO2 species at 25 mM and close to chemical equilibrium, conditions which approximate the physiological extracellular environment. Our data suggest that CAIX is particularly well suited to maintain the extracellular pH at a value that favors the survival fitness of tumor cells.

AB  - The aim of the study was to establish the amount of decaying wood (logs and stumps) in various groups of Hepatica site-type pine forests of different age and management intensity and to analyse the composition of bryophytes in dependence of these factors. The average volume of CWD in old unmanaged forests was 47.5 m(3)/ha, which is rather well comparable with respective estimations from Fermoscandia. Reduced human impact contributes positively to the amount of CWD. Diversity of log diameter classes and decay stages is larger in old forests. Altogether 73 bryophyte species were recorded, 65 species on logs and 55 on stumps. Species richness on stumps was higher in managed forests than in unmanaged ones, At the same time, the species having high indicator value for man-cut stumps are very common species in boreal forests and grow on other substrata as well. Species composition and ecological conditions differed between stumps and logs. Logs are more humid microhabitats than stumps, therefore the occurrence of hepatics is more frequent on them. According to species composition on decaying wood the old unmanaged forests distinguished from others. As the differences of substratum characteristics were notable between old and young forests, the stand age described a considerable part of species variance on logs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a family of transmembrane proteins that, also known as multidrug resistance proteins, transport a wide variety of substrates across biological membranes in an energy-dependent manner. Recently it has been shown that members of this protein family interfere with fluorescent (calcium indicator) dye uptake in taste buds of rat and in cells in the olfactory epithelium of larval Xenopus laevis, including olfactory receptor neurons. It has, however, not been resolved whether this effect only serves to extrude xenobiotics in sensory taste and olfactory cells, or alternatively, whether it is a more general feature of many central nervous system neurons. In the latter case blocking these transporters would improve fluorescent dye uptake in general. Here we show, by means of cell imaging. that also neurons of the olfactory bulb express multidrug resistance transporters, whereby a marked inhomogeneity among cells in the main and accessory olfactory bulb was observed. Blocking these transporters improved the net uptake of fluorescent dyes not only in cell somata of the olfactory bulb, but especially in fine neuronal structures such as individual dendrites or olfactory glomeruli, which consist of a tangle of tiny neuronal processes. We therefore suggest that the expression of multidrug resistance proteins may be common in cells of the central nervous system, and that the application of specific transport inhibitors could generally improve fluorescent dye uptake in brain slices, thereby improving calcium imaging conditions.

AB  - Given that numerous amphibians are suffering population declines, it is becoming increasingly important to examine the relationship between disease and environmental disturbance. Indeed, while many studies relate anthropogenic activity to changes in the parasitism of snails and fishes, little is known of the impact on the parasites of amphibians, particularly from agriculture. For 2 years, the parasite communities of metamorphic northern leopard frogs from 7 agricultural wetlands were compared with those from 2 reference wetlands to study differences in parasite community diversity and abundance of various species under pristine conditions and 3 categories of disturbance: only agricultural landscape, only pesticides, and agricultural landscape with pesticides. Agricultural (and urban) area was negatively related to species richness, and associated with the near absence of adult parasites and species that infect birds or mammals. We suggest that agriculture and urbanization may hinder parasite transmission to frogs by limiting access of other vertebrate hosts of their parasites to wetlands. The only parasite found at all localities was an unidentified echinostome infecting the kidneys. This parasite dominated communities in localities surrounded by the most agricultural land, suggesting generalist parasites may persist in disrupted habitats. Community composition was associated with dissolved organic carbon and conductivity, but few links were found with pesticides. Pollution effects may be masked by a strong impact of land use on parasite transmission.

AB  - Upwelling is a characteristic feature of the Benguela system. Strong upwelling leads to high primary production, which, in turn, supports large biomass of higher trophic levels. To analyse intra-, interannual and decadal variability of fish recruitment, growth, and distribution, different methods to quantify this upwelling have been used. In the present work, an upwelling index, modelled diatom primary production, based on outputs from a numerical model for the Benguela upwelling system, is proposed. Upwelled water brings large amounts of nutrients into the euphotic zone and this supports primary productivity, which can be considered a preconditioner for the zooplankton that clupeoid larvae feed on. Therefore, it is assumed that high upwelling gives the potential for good feeding conditions for these larvae. This fact has motivated the use of the modelled index for upwelling intensity as a proxy for food availability and an investigation of the interannual variability of observed mean individual weight of Cape anchovy (Engraulis capensis) and sardine (Sardinops sagax) recruits. The study shows that the mean Cape anchovy recruit weight has a linear relationship with upwelling activity along the transport route (from the spawning to the nursery areas) and inside the nursery areas, while sardine have an Optimal Environmental Window (OEW) relationship to the upwelling on the transport route. A possible explanation for these observed differences is the prey the larvae feed on and the change in the plankton community as a function of upwelling activity.

AB  - Crop rotation and tillage impact microbial C dynamics, which are important for sequestering C to offset global climate change and to promote sustainable crop production. Little information is available for these processes in tropical/subtropical agroecosystems, which cover vast areas of terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, a study of crop rotation in combination with no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems was conducted on an Oxisol (Typic Haplorthox) in an experiment established in 1976 at Londrina, Brazil. Soil samples were taken at 0-50, 50-100 and 100-200 mm depths in August 1997 and 1998 and evaluated for microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and mineralizable C and N. There were few differences due to crop rotation, however there were significant differences due to tillage. No tillage systems increased total C by 45%, microbial biomass by 83% and MBC:total C ratio by 23% at 0-50 mm depth over CT. C and N mineralization increased 74% with NT compared to CT systems for the 0-200 mm depth. Under NT, the metabolic quotient (CO(2) evolved per unit of MBC) decreased by 32% averaged across soil depths, which suggests CT produced a microbial pool that was more metabolically active than under NT systems. These soil microbial properties were shown to be sensitive indicators of long-term tillage management under tropical conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Acid Neutralising Capacity (ANC), calculated as the difference between base cations and acid anions, is widely used as a measure of freshwater acid status, and an indicator of biological conditions. Unlike pH and alkalinity, ANC is conservative with respect to CO2 degassing and reactions with aluminium or organic species. However, since ANC is calculated as the residual of a large number of individual ion determinations, it is potentially sensitive even to relatively small analytical errors. For the Round Loch of Glenhead, SW Scotland, consistency of ANC estimation has been assessed based on a duplicate set of major ion analyses undertaken at different laboratories over an I I year period. Results indicate that, while the two sets of individual ion determinations correspond well, correlation between calculated ANC values is poor. Consequently, estimated ANC trends exhibit severe discrepancies between datasets; one indicates substantial recovery, the other no apparent trend. These problems with ANC estimation are believed to be general to acidic waters and are of particular concern for long-term monitoring, where ANC changes may be small and difficult to detect (although nonetheless potentially biologically significant). In these situations, it is possible that a more stable measurement of ANC may be obtainable based on titration alkalinity, DOC and aluminium concentrations. Using this method, a small but highly consistent increase in ANC is observed over the study period, although much of this can be attributed to a shift from mineral to organic acidity, rather than an overall reduction in acidity.

AB  - Out of 571 serologically investigated dogs from Bratislava and all regions of Slovakia and Moravia, 26.1 % presented antibodies reacting with leptospiral antigens. The low-(sic) seropositivity in dogs from Bratislava was found in lap dogs - 11.1 %, the highest one in farm dogs - 35.3 % [Tab. I]. The seropositivity of police dogs from different regions of Slovakia and Moravia varied from 24.0 % to 47.6 % [Tab. II]. The age of dogs progressing, their seropositivity rose from 3.1 % in animals younger than one year to 33.3 % in those aged seven years and in older ones [Tab. III]. The predominant serovars causing infections of dogs were L. grippotyphosa [58.9 % of infections] and serovars of both Sejroe [21.0 %] and Icterohaemorrhagiae groups [15.3 %]. The serovars bratislava/jalna, pomond/mozdok and tarassovi were only rarely involved in these infections, canicola and arborea only exceptionally [Tab. IV]. At present, in the Czechoslovak conditions the dogs do not play a significant role as reservoirs of human leptospirosis, and the predominant serovars may only cause irregular and short-time lasting leptospiruria. This is why the reasonableness of actual vaccination of dogs, possibly with the exception of the vaccination against Well's disease, is doubtful. Dog is a good indicator of the distribution of different leptospiral serovars in its environment. It seems reasonable to practice occasionally serological investigations of these animals in order to detect possible changes in infecting leptospiral serovars. Consequently, adequate epizootological measures could be taken [e. g. modification of the composition of a leptospiral vaccine for dogs].

AB  - Two contrasting patterns of Mn distribution emerged from geochemical examination of marine cores in several regions.  Uniformly abundant Mn is contained in sediments from pelagic open oceans, while in hemipelagic regions, Mn is often concentrated in several specific horizons and is associated with CO2.  Mn carbonate layers, designated as "manganese bands" in this paper, occur typically in hemipelagic sediments; carbon isotopic data show that the possible source of the carbonate is organic material supplied to hemipelagic regions from nearby lands.  Ancient analogs of the present-day manganese bands were found to occur in shale and chert within the Paleozoic-Mesozoic Mino terrane of central Japan.  Manganese bands, consisting largely of rhodochrosite, are characterized by higher contents of P, Ba, and some heavy metals and a lower ratio for Zn/Co, compared with the ambient rocks.  This suggests that manganese bands formed under suboxic conditions where organic materials are oxidized to supply CO2 necessary for the carbonate formation.  Some manganese bands, particularly those hosted by chert, are characterized by extremely light carbon isotopes; this may result from methane-derived CO2.  Furthermore, manganiferous schists, such as piemontite-quartz schist in the Sambagawa terrane, can be correlated to the chert with manganese bands in the Mino terrane.  On the basis of the several lines of evidence obtained here, forearc and back arc basins like the Sea of Japan and rifted continental margins with narrow basins such as the Gulf of California are possible tectonic settings that are modern analogs to the Paleozoic-Mesozoic complex in the Japanese Islands.

AB  - There have been efforts to restore and rehabilitate mangrove forests to compensate for their loss or degradation. Approaches for monitoring these efforts are increasingly developed, including assessment of the dynamic changes in restored mangroves using the biophysical tree parameter called Leaf Area Index (LAI). This study aimed to (1) apply a semi-empirical approach to estimate LAI using WorldView-2 imagery, (2) compare the LAI distributions of three different mangrove forest types (natural, mixed, and planted) at the mangrove restoration site in Perancak Estuary, Bali, Indonesia, and (3) evaluate the applicability of LAI as an indicator for monitoring mangrove growth in restoration areas. To achieve these objectives, a high-spatial-resolution WorldView-2 image data (2 m pixel size) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used. A semi-empirical approach was used to correlate field LAI and NDVI values at the corresponding location. The results showed that the best regression function between the two variables was the third-order polynomial (R-2 = 0.98). Overall, the estimated LAI values ranged from 0 to 9.56 (mean = 1.87, sigma = 0.95, max. Accuracy = 97.6%) and differed between the three mangrove forest types. The comparison revealed that high LAI was associated with planted mangrove forest type where Rhizophora sp. dominated. It indicates that LAI is a useful indicator for assessing mangrove bio-physical conditions and, as such, can be used for monitoring mangrove restoration activities and outcomes.

TI  - Uncovering feature interdependencies in high-noise environments with stepwise lookahead decision forests
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - Conventionally, random forests are built from "greedy" decision trees which each consider only one split at a time during their construction. The sub-optimality of greedy implementation has been well-known, yet mainstream adoption of more sophisticated tree building algorithms has been lacking. We examine under what circumstances an implementation of less greedy decision trees actually yields outperformance. To this end, a "stepwise lookahead" variation of the random forest algorithm is presented for its ability to better uncover binary feature interdependencies. In contrast to the greedy approach, the decision trees included in this random forest algorithm, each simultaneously consider three split nodes in tiers of depth two. It is demonstrated on synthetic data and financial price time series that the lookahead version significantly outperforms the greedy one when (a) certain non-linear relationships between feature-pairs are present and (b) if the signal-to-noise ratio is particularly low. A long-short trading strategy for copper futures is then backtested by training both greedy and stepwise lookahead random forests to predict the signs of daily price returns. The resulting superior performance of the lookahead algorithm is at least partially explained by the presence of "XOR-like" relationships between long-term and short-term technical indicators. More generally, across all examined datasets, when no such relationships between features are present, performance across random forests is similar. Given its enhanced ability to understand the feature-interdependencies present in complex systems, this lookahead variation is a useful extension to the toolkit of data scientists, in particular for financial machine learning, where conditions (a) and (b) are typically met.

AB  - With the pursuit of high photoelectric conversion efficiency in the photovoltaic market, passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) modules has become the new market mainstream. The environmental impact of PERC modules requires life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to analyze. The SimaPro software was used to calculate the environmental impacts, such as global warming potential (GWP), human toxicity potential - cancer effects (HTP-CE), human toxicity potential-non-cancer effects (HTP-nCE), freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FEcP), freshwater eutrophication potential (FEuP) and abiotic depletion potential (ADP) of mono-facial and bifacial (dual-glass encapsulation and transparent back-sheet encapsulation) PERC modules prepared using 158.75 mm, 166 mm and 210 mm silicon wafers. The rear side gain of a bifacial module increases its electricity generation in the Use stage, and thereby making bifacial module achieve better environmental performance than mono-facial module. In order to improve the rear side gain of bifacial module, it is usually necessary to select an appropriate ground reflective material in system design. The LCA results show that the waterproof membrane TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin) is a very good choice, and white gravel and grassland can also be considered in landscape design point of view. Whether to choose dual-glass encapsulation or transparent back-sheet encapsulation, has little effect on the overall environmental impact of bifacial modules. In addition, adding recycling in the photovoltaic industry chain can significantly reduce the overall environmental impact of photovoltaic modules, especially in the indicators such as ADP, HTP-CE and FEuP.

AB  - Bearing incipient fault diagnosis is very crucial to the timely condition-based maintenance (CBM), but it is also relatively difficult because of the faint feature and environmental interference. In this article, an adaptive optimized time-varying filtering-based empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD) (AO-TVF-EMD) is put forward to extract more explicit and abundant incipient fault features by optimizing the parameter combination in conventional TVF-EMD. First, a novel integrated indicator termed sparsity-impact measure index (SIMI) constructed from dispersion entropy (DE) and envelope characteristic frequency ratio (ECFR) is designed as the parameter selection criterion. This index fully guarantees the optimal sparsity and impact properties of the obtained modes simultaneously, considering both time- and frequency-domain characteristics. Simulation verified that SIMI can not only sensitively characterize the variation of fault feature but also is robust to the environmental disturbance. Subsequently, we employ the Salp swarm algorithm (SSA) to realize the accurate search of parameter combinations where the minimum SIMI is defined as the fitness function. Moreover, comparative analysis in two runs to failure tests of bearings demonstrate that AO-TVF-EMD is more effective to extract incipient fault features than the maximum weighted Kurtosis (MWK) optimized TVF-EMD, the conventional TVF-EMD with fixed parameter, and some other advanced signal processing methods, which highlights the superiority of the proposed method.

AB  - In this study, a high-gravity (HiGee) process incorporating CO2 and NOx reduction from flue gas in a petrochemical plant coupled with petroleum coke fly ash (PCFA) treatment was established. The performance of HiGee was systematically evaluated from the engineering, environmental, economic, and energy aspects (a total of 15 key performance indicators) to establish the air pollution, energy efficiency, waste utilization nexus. The engineering performance was evaluated that lower energy consumption of 78 kWh/t-CO2 can be achieved at a capture capacity of 600 kg CO2/t-PCFA. A net emission reduction of 327.3 kg-CO2/t-PCFA could be determined based on six environmental impact indicators. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted using operating cost, product sale, carbon credit, and savings in air pollution fees to present a better technological selection compared to existing carbon capture and storage plants. The waste heat recovery from the flue gas via the HiGee process could be measured via moisture condensation and attendant elimination of white smog emissions. Retrofitted heat recovery and energy intensity up to 131.8 kJ/t-PCFA and 0.21 kWh/t-PCFA were assessed. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of the HiGee process based on three daily load scenarios of CO2 capture scale were conducted, suggesting an optimal operating condition of the HiGee for generating profitability.

AB  - Cereals provide over 50% of the total world crop production, their seeds being an important resource for human and animal feed, as well as for the industry. From these, winter barley is an appreciated crops by farmers due its ability to adapt to less favourable environmental conditions and also give high and economically efficient yields.
   The barley grain weights (GW) along with grain size are universally considered to be closely correlated with the level of technological quality indicators required by the malt and beer industry. Grain weight is first trait used to classify the barley seed quality.
   The objective of this paper was to identify genotypic differences between seventeen Romanian winter barley genotypes in grain weight as related with grain yield and GW stability across different management practices.
   Large differences (8.2-20.8%) were found among the tested varieties and advanced lines for GW stability, underlined by the coefficient of variation (CV%).
   Based on regressions, varieties and lines can be grouped in more responsive to environments favourable to higher grain weight (winter two row barley lines DH 267-66 and DH 314-1), or able to maintain grain weight in less favourable environments (winter six row barley Ametist, Onix, Lucian and winter two row barley Gabriela varieties).
   The lack of correlation between GW and CV% and frequency of GW values above 42 g correlated significantly negative with GW average (r = -0.82), indicates that there are possibilities to improve this trait and also to have progress in its stability.

AB  - In recent years, investigating the trend of aquatic plant diversity in response to different disturbance events has received increasing interest. However, there is limited knowledge of the different stages of aquatic vegetation succession over a long period in eutrophic lakes. In this study, we analyzed aquatic plant species richness and its relation to the physical and chemical characteristics of water in Chenghai Lake for the period of 1980-2018. This study shows that the richness and distribution of aquatic vegetation in Chenghai Lake are related to chlorophyll-a concentration, dissolved nutrients, base cations, and micronutrients. The results show that the long-term succession of aquatic plants in this lake classified in different stages: (I) A peak in species richness occurred at an intermediate stage that lasted from 1980 to 1992, and this was caused by more aquatic species being able to coexist since the competition for resources was lower; (II) after 26 years of secondary succession (1992-2018), the diversity and distribution area of aquatic plants gradually declined because pioneer species or human activities may have altered habitat conditions to render habitats less beneficial to pioneer species and more suitable for new aquatic plant species. Thus, species diversity and growth performance of aquatic plants in their communities may be useful indicators of Chenghai Lake's trophic status, especially during the transition period from a mesotrophic lake to a eutrophic one.

AB  - The basis of a successful assessment of the nutritive value of feeds and an animal's supply with dietary energy and nutrients is having sufficient knowledge on key indicators such as feed intake, diet composition, digestibility and the kinetics of gut passage. In horses and other equids, the determination of such indicators is impractical outside controlled conditions, particularly in pasture-based husbandry. Natural wax components such as n-alkanes, alkenes, primary alcohols and fatty acids might be beneficial estimators, but their application is limited in practice. This review provides a concise view into the application of plant wax components, especially alkanes and their external counterparts, in equine nutrition studies. Recent methodological developments and the current state of knowledge are summarized as an interim conclusion. Methodological limitations still hamper an easy application of the method, and some perspectives for future methodological research are discussed. Conclusively, little information is available on feed plant concentrations and variations of primary alcohols, fatty acids and alkenes, and their natural carbon isotope (C-13/C-12) ratios. Moreover, the magnitude and the (in) consistency of faecal recovery of these markers is barely described. Methodological research should continue focusing on an effective application of plant markers. In horses, especially plant marker-based methods for the estimation of diet composition and passage kinetics will require much more consideration.

AB  - Insecticidal crystal (Cry) proteins produced by transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice that enter the soil via root exudation and plant residues may be harmful to non-target soil organisms. We conducted a 3-year field investigation to determine if soil nematode abundance and diversity were affected by exposure to two transgenic Bt rice cultivars, compared to their non-transgenic near isolines. Near isolines were Kemingdao (KMD-Bt) expressing the single Cry1Ab gene and its non-Bt near isoline Xiushui-11 (XSD), as well as Huahui-1 (HH-Bt) expressing the fused Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac gene and its non-Bt near isoline Minghui-63 (MH). Nematode variables including community composition, abundance, trophic groups, and most of the common genera differed significantly between the rice cultivars. However, these nematode variables were similar under transgenic Bt rice and its non-Bt near isoline, although higher Shannon's index value and Pielou's index value were found in soils planted with Bt rice than the non-Bt near isoline. During this 3-year field study, gene modification (single Cry1Ab gene and fused Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac gene) supports a more uniform distribution of nematode species but had no effect on soil nematode abundance and community composition. We conclude that continuous cultivation of KMD-Bt and HH-Bt rice varieties for 3 years is not detrimental to soil nematode communities under field conditions.

The effect of various parameters such as sample volume, pH, concentration, matrix and pre-treatment procedure was studied in order to find out the optimum conditions for their determination in SPE system. The presence of the compounds in Konya urban wastewater treatment plant influent and effluent samples was investigated and the eco-toxicological risk assessment was carried out. The extraction of the samples was performed with SPE system using Oasis HLB cartridges. The concentrations of the target compounds were determined using a liquid chromatograph equipped with MS-MS detector. STL, ATE, MET, PRO, TML were determined in the range of 43.5-468, 278-465, 28.3-92, <d1-18, 58-86 ng/L in influent wastewater samples while STL, ATE, MET, PRO were determined as 30.4-44, 163276, 81.8-136, 3.3-34 ng/L in effluent samples, respectively. TML compound was not detected in effluent samples. The hazard quotient (HQ) for determined P-blocker compounds were calculated according to EU guidelines. PNEC values were derived from the available aquatic toxicity data using three different species (algae, crustaceans and fish) from different tropic levels. The HQ values for MET, PRO, STL and ATE compounds were determined below 0.1 which means insignificant risk to aquatic organisms.

AB  - Turbidity is an important indicator of water environments and water-quality conditions. Ocean colour remote sensing has proved to be an efficient way of monitoring water turbidity because of its wide synoptic coverage and repeated regular sampling. However, operational tasks are still challenging in high-turbidity waters, especially in estuaries and the coastal regions of China. In these areas, the existing algorithms derived from remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) are usually invalid because it is difficult to correctly estimate the reflectance R-rs from satellite data such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A new algorithm that uses Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc) instead of R-rs has been recently introduced and was used to estimate water turbidity in Zhejiang (ZJ) coastal areas from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data. The R-rc algorithm has previously shown a capability to estimate water turbidity. However, its performance still requires careful evaluation. In this article, we compared the new R-rc algorithm with two other existing algorithms. Differences among the three algorithms were assessed by comparing the results from using R-rc data and R-rs reflectance data derived from both GOCI and MODIS imagery data. The capability of the new R-rc algorithm to estimate water turbidity in larger areas and extended seasons in the coastal seas of China was also estimated. The results showed that the new R-rc algorithm is suitable for the coastal waters of China, especially for highly turbid waters.

AB  - The redox cycling of selenium oxyanions, elemental selenium, and selenides within water resources has implications for Se bioavailability and ecotoxicity. Dual stable isotope analysis of Se and O may provide important information for interpreting environmental Se transformations. Stable Se isotope systematics within the Se redox cycle has been well characterized within the literature, however concomitant oxygen isotope composition requires additional investigation. This study reports the O isotope fractionation of selenate (SeO42-) during microbial reduction by the dissimilatory Se-reducing bacterium Sulfurospirillum barnesii SES-3. Microbial reduction experiments were conducted under various conditions in order to investigate the range of O-18 enrichment factors (epsilon(O)) in selenate. The reduction of selenate to selenite coupled to the oxidation of lactate to acetate resulted in an O-18 kinetic isotope effect with epsilon(O) values 1.5-5.8 parts per thousand. Greater O-18 enrichment was observed with increasing pH, but no correlation was found between epsilon(O) and reduction rates, lactate availability, or cell density. epsilon(O) values from biotic reduction by S. barnesii here are significantly less than those observed for abiotic reduction with Fe(II)-rich minerals reported in the literature, and this difference could be explained by a diffusion limitation during enzymatic reduction. Our results expand the isotope systematics of the selenium redox cycle and suggest epsilon(O) has potential usefulness as indicators for in situ selenate reduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The 28 October 2012 M-w 7.8 Haida Gwaii earthquake was a megathrust earthquake along the very obliquely convergent Queen Charlotte margin of British Columbia, Canada. Coseismic deformation is not well constrained by geodesy, with only six Global Positioning System (GPS) sites and two tide gauge stations within 250 km of the rupture area. To better constrain vertical coseismic deformation, we measured the upper growth limits of two sessile intertidal organisms, which are controlled by physical conditions, relative to sea level at 25 sites 5 months after the earthquake. We measured the positions of rockweed (Fucus distichus, 617 observations) and the common acorn barnacle (Balanus balanoides, 686 observations). The study focused on the western side of the islands where rupture models indicated that the greatest amount of vertical displacement, but we also investigated sites well away from the inferred rupture area to provide a control on the upper limit of the organisms unaffected by vertical displacement. We also made 322 measurements of sea level to relate the growth limits to a tidal datum using the TPXO7.2 tidal model, rather than ellipsoid heights determined by GPS. Three methods of examining the data all indicate 0.4-0.6 m subsidence along the western coast of Moresby Island as a result of the 28 October 2012 Haida Gwaii earthquake. Our data are, within the errors, consistent with data from two campaign GPS sites along the west coast of Haida Gwaii and with rupture models that indicate megathrust rupture offshore, but not beneath, the islands.

AB  - No previous scientific surveys have been conducted on inselbergs in the Drakensberg. The aim of this study was to collect specimens, identify, describe and name the vegetation clusters and assess biogeographical connections with other Afromontane regions. A total of 103 releves where sampled from six inselbergs. The plant sampling was carried out according to the Braun-Blanquet method with the plant and environmental data entered in TURBOVEG and exported as a Cornell Condensed format file (CC!) into Juice. Classification was completed using TWINSPAN (Two-way Indicator Species Analysis) (modified), resulting in 4 major communities, 11 communities, 13 sub-communities and 18 variants. Ordination (indirect) was carried out using CANOCO (version 4.5) to investigate the relationship between species. The four major communities identified are Rhodohypoxis rubella (wetland grass and forblands), Scirpus ficinioides - Crassula peploides (sheet rock grass and forblands), Pentaschistis exserta (high-altitude alpine grassland), previously undescribed, and Merxmuellera drakensbergensis - Helichrysum trilineatum (high-altitude alpine fynbos grassland), described in other vegetation and floristic studies. Four habitats were identified, namely wetlands, sheet rock shallow soil, high-altitude alpine grassland and deep soil high-altitude fynbos grasslands. Substrate and moisture availability appeared to be the defining micro-climatic conditions determining the different vegetation clusters whilst altitude is the overriding environmental factor influencing all vegetation.
   Conservation implications: Rising temperatures as a result of carbon dioxide increase is predicted to drastically decrease the number of endemic and near-endemic montane species, whilst altering the composition of vegetation units which comprise the alpine vegetation.

AB  - 3D stereophotogrammetric scanner was used to obtain 3D model of canopy structure of Pleurozium schreberi moss samples in order to determine changes in the surface roughness index caused by the exposition to the simulated precipitation with known nickel concentrations. In mosses, surface roughness index is known to be a significant indicator of the environmental conditions and is strongly correlated with microclimatic state of the vicinity of the plant. Samples were divided to two groups and either 5 mg.l(-1) or 50 mg.l(-1) solutions of pH 5 were applied as a simulated rainfall for the total period of eight weeks, 3D model of the sample surface was obtained every time before and after irrigation. In addition, organic material was analysed for the final nickel content using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Calculated surface roughness indices revealed substantial alteration the pattern of canopy properties changes during irrigation nickel in the simulated precipitation therefore affects the surface of the moss canopy and thus the ecophysiological properties of the moss used. Total accumulated nickel was found to reflect the concentration of the metal in the precipitation with the nickel content in moss being ten times higher in the case of ten times higher content in the solution used for the irrigation (1922 mg.kg(-1) compared to 195 mg.kg(-1) following the application of 50 mg.l(-1) and 5 mg.l(-1) nickel solution, respectively).

AB  - The aim of this study is to report from the analyses of a corroded iron dagger from the Iron Age city at Tall Abu al-Kharaz, Jordan Valley, and to present the conservation procedures. Preliminary condition assessment was carried out by visual examination and stereomicroscope. X-ray radiography was used to reveal surface details under the external deposits and corrosion layers. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was used to identify the mineralogical composition of the corrosion products. Polarized light microscopy (PLM) was used to examine a cross-section taken from the dagger to determine its corrosion profile and internal metallographic microstructure. The dagger's radiograph showed that the edges and tip of the dagger were its weakest and most corroded parts. XRD results showed that goethite (alpha-FeOOH), lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH) and magnetite (Fe3O4) were the main corrosion products. PLM examination showed that the dagger had greatly converted into magnetite. It also showed signs of hammering, carburization and heat treatment during the manufacturing process of the artifact.
   The dagger was treated by immersion in an alkaline solution to extract any chloride ions present in the artifact. It was then treated with tannic acid to produce a coherent film of black ferric tannate. Finally, it was coated with Paraloid B72 to consolidate it and protect it from atmospheric humidity and corrosive ions in the environmentally uncontrolled storage area.

AB  - Agricultural land degradation is a global problem that severely hampers the production of food needed to sustain the growing world population. Mapping of soil degradation by remote sensing is instrumental for understanding the spatial extent and rate of this problem. Methods aimed at detecting soil loss, soil drying, and soil-quality deterioration have been demonstrated in numerous studies utilizing passive and active remote sensors. This review presents a short description of each form of soil degradation, including data regarding known extents and rates, and then reviews the methods with respect to direct and indirect modelling approaches. Two types of obstacles to achieving wide regional detection of soil degradation are revealed. The first concerns the complex and non-unique relationships between remote-sensing indicators and different soil properties, such as roughness, soil moisture (SM), soil salinity, and organic matter content. The second concerns the difficulties involved in acquiring data on subsurface soil properties. In view of these difficulties, we recommend expanding the use of phenomenological models capable of estimating soil-degradation potential according to combinations of environmental conditions, thus enabling remote-sensing efforts to be focused on local areas where the environmental threat is highest. The second avenue for improving the contribution of remote sensing on a wide regional scale involves the application of integrative methods, such as those based on hyperspectral, multisensory, and multitemporal approaches, as well as those that incorporate environmental information (such as topography, soil types, and precipitation).

AB  - Industrialized waterways frequently contain nearshore hotspots of legacy polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination, with uncertain contribution to aquatic food web contamination. We evaluated the utility of estuarine forage fish as biosentinel indicators of local PCB contamination across multiple nearshore sites in San Francisco Bay. Topsmelt (Atherinops affinis) or Mississippi silverside (Menidia audens) contamination was compared between 12 targeted sites near historically polluted locations and 17 probabilistically chosen sites representative of ambient conditions. The average sum of 209 PCB congeners in fish from targeted stations (441 +/- 432 ng g(-1) wet weight, mean +/- SD) was significantly higher than probabilistic stations (138 +/- 94 ng g(-1)). Concentrations in both species were comparable to those of high lipid sport fish in the Bay, strongly correlated with spatial patterns in sediment contamination, and above selected literature thresholds for potential hazard to fish and wildlife. The highest concentrations were from targeted Central Bay locations, including Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard (1347 ng g(-1); topsmelt) and Stege Marsh (1337 ng g(-1); silverside). Targeted sites exhibited increased abundance of lower chlorinated congeners, suggesting local source contributions, including Aroclor 1248. These findings indicate that current spatial patterns in PCB bioaccumulation correlate with historical sediment contamination due to industrial activity. They also demonstrate the utility of naturally occurring forage fish as biosentinels of localized PCB exposure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - When data are collected via anonymous Internet surveys, particularly under conditions of obligatory participation (such as with student samples), data quality can be a concern. However, little guidance exists in the published literature regarding techniques for detecting careless responses. Previously several potential approaches have been suggested for identifying careless respondents via indices computed from the data, yet almost no prior work has examined the relationships among these indicators or the types of data patterns identified by each. In 2 studies, we examined several methods for identifying careless responses, including (a) special items designed to detect careless response, (b) response consistency indices formed from responses to typical survey items, (c) multivariate outlier analysis, (d) response time, and (e) self-reported diligence. Results indicated that there are two distinct patterns of careless response (random and nonrandom) and that different indices are needed to identify these different response patterns. We also found that approximately 10%-12% of undergraduates completing a lengthy survey for course credit were identified as careless responders. In Study 2, we simulated data with known random response patterns to determine the efficacy of several indicators of careless response. We found that the nature of the data strongly influenced the efficacy of the indices to identify careless responses. Recommendations include using identified rather than anonymous responses, incorporating instructed response items before data collection, as well as computing consistency indices and multivariate outlier analysis to ensure high-quality data.

These findings suggest a need for improved knowledge of L. hesperus temperature-dependent reproductive development. We used nonlinear biophysical development rate models to describe the reproductive development of adult L. hesperus held under constant temperatures from 12.8 to 35.0 degrees C. In addition, abdominal coloration was measured as a nondestructive indicator of reproductive maturity. The nonlinear models indicated most stages of ovary, seminal vesicle, and medial accessory gland development were subject to mild high-temperature inhibition, except for the stage of filled seminal vesicles. Development of filled seminal vesicles was subject to minor low-temperature inhibition and severe high-temperature inhibition. Estimated development times reflected extensive interindividual variation, especially at low temperatures. This variation suggests the opportunity to select for more rapid or more consistent reproductive development under the conditions of laboratory culture. Although presence of a dark aqua coloration of the ventral abdominal cuticle was statistically associated with reproductive maturity, especially in female L. hesperus, color-based predictions of reproductive maturity were often inaccurate for bugs reared at temperatures above or below 26.7 degrees C. Therefore, use of abdominal coloration as an indicator of reproductive development in ecological studies seems inappropriate. The results provide mathematical descriptions of L. hesperus temperature-dependent reproductive development which should facilitate improved planning and interpretation of studies involving manipulation of adult reproductive status.

AB  - Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a highly disabling disorder that is part of a broader spectrum of chronic pain and fatigue disorders. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of CFS largely remain unclear, there is increasing evidence that CFS shares important pathophysiological disturbances with mood disorders in terms of disturbances in the stress response and the stress system. From a psychodynamic perspective, self-critical perfectionism and related personality factors are hypothesized to explain in part impairments of the stress response in both depression and CFS. Yet, although there is ample evidence that high levels of self-critical perfectionism are associated with stress generation and increased stress sensitivity in depression, evidence supporting this hypothesis in CFS is currently lacking. This study therefore set out to investigate the relationship between self-critical perfectionism, the active generation of stress, stress sensitivity, and levels of depression in a sample of 57 patients diagnosed with CFS using an ecological momentary assessment approach. Results showed, congruent with theoretical assumptions, that self-critical perfectionism was associated with the generation of daily hassles, which in turn predicted higher levels of depression. Moreover, multilevel analyses showed that self-critical perfectionism was related to increased stress sensitivity in CFS patients over a 14-day period, and that increased stress sensitivity in turn was related to increased levels of depression. The implications of these findings for future research and particularly for the development of psychodynamic treatment approaches of CFS and related conditions are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is delayed or prolonged response to a provocative event or situation of exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature. Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, GAF, is a standard method in the approach to clinical assessment of the patient's overall level of functioning.
   Material and methods: This prospective study was conveyed at the Department of Neurophysiology Clinic for neuropsychiatric diseases at the Health Center in Tuzla in the period between March to December, 2008. The control group consisted of 50 clinically healthy subjects (44 male), aged 49.65 +/- 6.7. The studied group consisted of 50 patients treated for PTSD, aged 50.5 +/- 5.61, the same gender distribution as the control group. Beck's Anxiety Inventory, BAI, Beck's Depression Inventory, BDI, and Beck's Hopelessness Scale are used in the analysis of anxiety, depression and hopelessness.
   Results: The majority of patients of the studied group (30%) had severe depression, 82 % of them had severe anxiety,, while 56 % suffered from severe hopelessness. The level of functionality, measured by GAF was "really significantly'' negatively correlated with the level of anxiety (r=-0,6196), as well as with the level of depression (r=-0,6244) and the level of hopelessness (r=-0,5852).
   Conclusion: The potential significance of the connection between the level of functioning, measuerd by GAF, and the rate of anxiety, depression and hopelessness is at the relatively fast assessment of the improvement or the worsening of the patient's mental condition, after the drug and/or psycotherapy treatment.

AB  - The presence of domestic animals in protected areas has been a growing world concern, including in the Brazilian Amazon. Introduced domestic carnivores can put the conservation of carnivores and other wild mammals at risk in protected areas. These risks can be associated with direct factors, such as the dogs' hunting habit, and indirect factors, such as the domestic carnivores' potential for transmitting infectious agents to wild populations. The objective of this study was to analyze the potential implications of humans and domestic animals staying in fragmented and altered areas such as the Wildlife Protection Areas (WPA) in the Tucuruf Lake Environmental Protection Area (Para, Brazil), created for the full protection of its fauna and flora. This evaluation was made through interviews conducted with riparian inhabitants living in the WPA and surrounding area, involving issues related to the presence of dogs (number of animals per domicile, birth rate, mortality rate, vaccination status, hunting habit) and wild carnivores (occurrence and location) in the study area. The results indicated risks mainly due to the presence of on average three dogs per domicile, as well as the high canine birth rate, their hunting habits, low vaccination rates and evidence of direct and indirect contact with the human, canine and wild carnivore populations. These factors represent risks to the health and conservation of Tucurui EPA wild carnivores since they provide favorable conditions for the transmission of pathogens from domestic fauna to wild fauna, as well as the risks brought about by hunting.

AB  - Geochemical analysis of street dusts was conducted to evaluate the environment of Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Dust samples were collected from different areas (industrial, commercial, and residential) of Dhaka City, and their major, trace and rare earth elements (REE) were determined. Samples from the commercial area had Pb concentrations double those of the industrial and residential areas. Contents of Zn, Cu, Ni, and Cr in the industrial areas were greater than those in the commercial and residential areas. The REE patterns of all dusts in Dhaka are similar and are comparable to the average upper continental crust. The condition of the Dhaka environment was compared to that in Japan and other baseline sediments using Zn-Fe2O3 and Pb-Fe2O3 diagrams. Zn-Fe2O3 trends for the dusts show steep inclination compared to the baseline sediment and the Japanese urban sediment trends. Dhaka lake data show enrichment of Zn over the dusts, suggestive of Zn pollution from poorly controlled industrial sources. In contrast, on the Pb-Fe2O3 diagram, Dhaka dusts have greater Pb contents than lake sediments, probably due to the higher traffic density in the commercial area compared to the residential area including the area around the lake. The results suggest that higher levels of Pb and Zn in street dusts in Dhaka can most likely be attributed to the anthropogenic sources like vehicle emissions to the atmosphere and a rapid development.

AB  - For marine organisms with bipartite life cycles, there is growing recognition that juvenile traits may be dependent on previous larval history. The potential correlation between juvenile and larval stages is important to recognize, as growth rates in juvenile fish have been proposed to be an indicator of habitat quality. We investigated whether juvenile and larval growth are positively or negatively related using the estuarine-dependent fish Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus as a model species. The relationship between juvenile and larval growth was examined using both a laboratory study, in which fish were held in individual containers with constant water temperature and salinity, and replicated field experiments, which spanned a range of environmental conditions. There was no relationship between juvenile and larval growth rates in the laboratory experiment. However, results from the field study suggest that a positive relationship between juvenile and larval growth was associated with high levels of freshwater runoff that displaced juvenile croaker from nursery areas to downstream habitats, in which they had reduced feeding success. Variability in the correlation between juvenile and larval growth for the 27 cohorts examined (fish hatched during the same 1 wk period) was independently explained by change in salinity (a proxy for freshwater runoff) and feeding ability (percentage of fish with empty stomachs). Future research should recognize the role that variable environments play in our ability to detect the relationship of life-history traits between ontogenetic stages.

AB  - The Swedish research programme Urban Water has developed a concept of a multi-criteria basis intended to support decision-making for urban water and wastewater systems. Five criteria groups were established for sustainability assessment of urban water systems: Health and Hygiene, Environment, Economy, Socio-culture, and Technology. Each criterion requires a set of indicators corresponding to quantifiable facts and figures, or qualitative data to comparatively assess the different alternatives in the decision process. The decision support process starts as a baseline study where the existing conditions are addressed. Alternative strategies of the future urban water system are developed and analysed by different tools and methodologies in assessing the five criteria groups. Eventually, the results and conclusions are integrated and synthesised into a basis for decision-making.
   As an example of a decision support basis for chemical safety, a barrier perspective was introduced to find out if and to what extent hazardous substances can be stopped, diverged, or transformed at various points in the wastewater system. A set of barriers was suggested, i.e. behaviour, systems design, process design, optional recipients, and organisational. The barrier approach was applied to two alternative municipal wastewater system designs - a combined wastewater system vs. a source separated system - analysing the fate of phosphorus, cadmium, and triclosan. The study showed that the combined system caused a higher substance flow to the receiving waterbody than the separated system. The combined system also brought more phosphorus and cadmium to the farmland than the separated system, but only half the amount of triclosan.

AB  - This study is designed to evaluate whether oxidative stress and inflammation are involved in severe pre-eclampsia compared to normal pregnancy and non-pregnancy. We have measured plasma and urinary levels of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), a major isoprostane as an indicator of oxidative stress; plasma and urinary 15-keto-dihydro-PGF(2alpha), a major metabolite of cyclooxygenase-catalysed PGF(2alpha) as an indicator of inflammatory response, and plasma -alpha-and -gamma-tocopherol in 18 pre-eclamptic, 19 normal pregnancy and 20 non-pregnant women. Pregnant women had significantly higher levels of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and PGF(2alpha) metabolite as compared to the non-pregnancy Levels of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) in the pre-eclamptic women did not differ from the normal pregnancy but PGF(2alpha) metabolite levels were significantly higher in normal pregnancy. On the other hand, gamma-tocopherol levels were significantly lower in pre-eclampsia than normal pregnancy In contrast, the concentration of alpha-tocopherol was very similar between the groups. a-and gamma-tocopherol levels were significantly lower in pregnancy compared to non-pregnancy. Although no direct evidence of oxidative stress and inflammatory response was observed in severe pre-eclampsia, a reduction of gamma-tocopherol suggests the possible precedence of oxidative stress in this condition. Higher levels of isoprostanes and prostaglandin metabolite in late pregnancy suggest the importance of both free radicals and cyclooxygenase-catalysed oxidation products in normal biological processes of pregnancy.

AB  - Many different approaches have been used for the simulation of drought stress in pot studies. An ideal technique should (i) maintain uniform soil water content within the rooting zone, (ii) allow the rate at which stress develops to be precisely controlled, regardless of differences in plant size or variations in environmental conditions, (iii) permit a range of physiologically distinct stress levels to be imposed and maintained indefinitely, and (iv) provide a means of accurately quantifying the stress level. In the present study, a computer automated null-balance lysimeter was evaluated against these criteria. Separate experiments were conducted with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) growing in 2.5-L pots. Single plant water use was quantified gravimetrically by frequent, automated recording of pot weights, and transpired water was replaced by a computer controlled watering system such that relative soil water content (RSWC) was maintained within a narrow range. In this way, pots were held at four RSWC levels ranging from 20 to 75%. Despite the frequent additions of small amounts of water at the tops of the pots, soil water distribution within the pots was found to be remarkably uniform, suggesting that bulk RSWC was a suitable indicator of the soil water deficit experienced by the roots. Measurements of whole plant water use indicated that the four RSWC levels represented four statistically distinct levels of water stress. It is concluded that null balance lysimetry is a useful approach to simulating drought stress in greenhouse experiments, with specific advantages over other available techniques.

AB  - The relationships between bacteriological and viral indicators of sewage pollution (TC, FC, E coli, FS, Salmonella, somatic coliphages and F-RNA phages) and environmental variables in coastal water and weather were studied at three beaches in San Sebastian, the Basque Country. The microbiological indicators in bathing water presented high counts associated with the following conditions: early morning, overcast skies, low and high tides, groundswell, intense turbidity and the presence of flotsam (P = <0.05). Coliphage density was significantly related (P = <0.05) to cloud cover, groundswell and flotsam. Correlations between microbiological indicators proved high (0.62 less than or equal to r less than or equal to 0.90, P = <0.001). The percentage of Salmonella presented significant (<0.05), albeit low (r < 0.4), correlations with all microbiological parameters. Somatic coliphages also revealed highly significant (0.32 less than or equal to r less than or equal to 0.66) correlations (P = <0.001). Those obtained for F-RNA phages, in contrast, were low (r less than or equal to 0.33). The equations obtained using a multiple regression analysis with a view to predicting microbiological, viral, and Salmonella indicator density demonstrated that environmental variables facilitate the construction of highly significant equations, but that these have low predictive capability (R-2 = <0.50).

AB  - Productive effect was investigated of addition of fat supplements in form of rape-seed lecithin to feed pellets with differentiated protein content (20%, 26% and 32% crude protein) as exerted on carp fry.  The trial was carried out in controlled conditions with no natural food available.  The results have shown that the favorable values of the indicators of growth, feed coversion and protein efficiency ratio with respect to weight gains are depending upon the higher dietary supply of energy in form of feed supplements if low-protein feed pellets are administered.  All the investigated indicators were stimulated by supplementation of lecithin at a rate 6% of the feed weight.  Administration of fat-enriched feed pellets increased the relative daily weight gain on average by 60% and specific growth rate by 45% while the protein level was identical.  Feed conversion ratio decreased by 30% and PER values increased by 43%.  There were no differences in the values of the investigated indicators between the 26% and 32% dietary protein levels when fat-enriched pellets were fed.  Better conversion in the fat-enriched pellets reduced the feed costs on average by 5.60 Kc per kg weight gain.  On the basis of the above results it is possible to recommend for carp fry cultures in ponds the feeding of low-protein pellets (20-25% crude protein) with increased contents of fat (7-8%) and digestible energy (13 700-14 300 kJ(kg).

AB  - This study examines the impact of green technology on CO2 emissions in a sample of 45 countries for 1989-2018. Renewable energy consumption and environmental-related patents are used as indicators of green technology. We consider the production of renewable energy and the development of climate-related innovation as 'two sides of the same coin'. One needs to be complemented by the other for countries to be successful in the fight against climate change. After applying the fixed-effect method with Driscoll and Kraay standard errors, results reveal that renewable energy consumption significantly reduces CO2 emissions in the full sample and all three subsamples (High-income, Upper-middle-income, and Lower-middle income countries). However, environmental-related patents significantly lower CO2 emissions only in very high-income countries. This paper also analyses how CO2 emissions influence the development of green technology and carbon-intensive technology. A negative association is found between renewable energy and CO2 emissions in the high-income and upper-middle-income groups. Environmental-related patents respond positively to carbon emissions only in high-income countries. The results allow us to draw important conclusions for energy policies. Among the necessary measures to be adopted, developing countries should not neglect the promotion of green innovation, which is a critical condition for carbon neutrality achievement.

AB  - The Arctic is one of the regions where the effect of global change is most evident. Associated with warming are changes in snow, sea ice and hydroclimate, all which have significant impacts on environments and society. However, due to short observational records, it is difficult to set the current climate in a long-term context. Arctic driftwood (DW), available throughout the Holocene, is a paleoclimate resource that may shed information on past sea-ice, ocean current and atmospheric conditions because it is transported by sea ice across the Arctic. Moreover, DW tree-ring data can be used to interpret climate in the boreal forests where the trees grew. Here we present a study of 380 DW samples collected on eastern and south-western Svalbard. Combining species identification and dendrochronology, it was found that the DW mainly consisted of Pinus sylvestris, Picea sp. and Larix sp. (87% of all samples), mainly originating from northern Russia. In total, 60% of the DW could be dated and their provenance determined, and four tree-ring width chronologies representing Yenisei and Dvina-Pechora were constructed, facilitating extension and improvement of the existing chronologies representing those regions. Moreover, DW from relict beaches that can be subjected to dendrochronological analyses, provides possibilities to extend pan-Arctic tree-ring data even further back in time. Because there are several processes governing the temporal patterns of wood deposition in the Arctic, using DW as an indicator of sea-ice variations needs further investigation.

AB  - With the Earth system being about to leave Holocene conditions and thus the known safe operating space for humanity, frameworks such as the Planetary Boundaries (PBs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide quantitative metrics to guide sustainability transformations. In order to strive, not only for compliance with the PBs but also for societal well-being, some approaches attempt to combine both PBs and SDGs within a single assessment. We focus on two prominent examples, the "Doughnut" by Kate Raworth and the #SDGinPB project of the 2018 report to the Club of Rome, which are not only aimed at public outreach, but also at guiding policy-making. To meet these objectives, the approaches should possess a certain accuracy in determining the progress in achieving the SDGs and in complying with the PBs. We evaluate, by using a multi-indicator approach for comparison, whether both approaches' limited set of indicators can still represent the SDGs' complexity. This comparative approach estimates the progress in achieving SDGs, especially in the Global North, to be significantly lower. Based on these results and against the approaches' purposes, we discuss their simplifications and at which point the results are no longer reliable. We conclude that global assessments can be an important factor in initiating transformative processes by stimulating public discourse, but that the actual implementation of these would require approaches with greater recognition of local particularities.

AB  - Background Psoriasis is a multifactorial autoimmune disease, which underlies the abnormalities of the apoptotic process. In cases of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, biological treatment is used. This study aimed to determine any changes in the expression of the genes associated with apoptosis in patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with adalimumab and to assess any phenotypic modifications based on changes in dermatological indexes. Methods The study included 20 patients with psoriatic arthritis treated biologically and 20 healthy volunteers. The research material consisted of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from which the total RNA was isolated. Changes in the gene expression were determined using oligonucleotide microarrays and RT-qPCR. The clinical condition was assessed based on selected indicators: PASI, BSA [%], DAS28, and DLQI, which were determined every 3 months. Results There were changes in the expression of genes associated with apoptosis. Significant differences were found for ROCK1, RhoA, and LIMK2 expression profiles in PBMCs. At the initial stage of treatment, a decrease in the PASI and BSA rates was observed. At the later stages, the values of these indicators increased once again. There were correlations between the changes in these genes' expression and the dermatological markers. Conclusion Adalimumab influences the expression of genes related to apoptosis and the values of dermatological indicators of patients. Changes in the expression level of genes associated with apoptosis suggest that ROCK1, RhoA, and LIMK2 may be genes that can potentially be indicators of treatment effectiveness and lack of response to biological treatment.

AB  - Bouldering is a special form of climbing without rope that requires coordinated whole-body movements. While physical performance parameters such as condition have been well studied, the knowledge on neural activity during climbing still remains sparse. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) allows to measure brain activation while performing sportive actions due to its relative robustness against motion artefacts. In the current study, hemodynamic response alterations of 13 advanced climbers were investigated during boulder performance using fNIRS measurements. Simple and moderate climbing routes were compared regarding their level of cortical activation mainly in the sensorimotor area. Our results show that repetitively climbing a set of boulders activates almost all areas of the sensorimotor system including the bilateral premotor and supplementary motor cortex, bilateral primary motor cortex as well as the bilateral gyrus supramarginalis and somatosensory cortex. This result was found in both simple and moderate climbing routes with no effect of task complexity on the level of cortical activity. Correlation analysis (uncorrected for multiple comparisons) revealed a negative association between the level of expertise and the hemodynamic response in the supplementary-motor region, suggesting that gaining expertise in climbing is associated with a decrease in secondary motor areas, which is an indicator of motor automaticity. In summary, the present study provides first proof of concept that fNIRS is capable of assessing hemodynamic response alterations within the human motor system during the execution of complex whole-body climbing movements.

AB  - The morphology of 284 K'ara llamas was determined through biometric measurements and body weight based on sex and age factors. The animals were from breeder organizations in the Checacupe district of the Cusco Region, Peru. The measurements were grouped into cephalic, body and trunk heights, cane perimeter and body weight. The analysis was carried out in a 2x5 factorial arrangement (2 sexes, 5 ages) under a complete randomized design. At head level, head length is the only one that contributes to sexual dimorphism (p<0.05). Head height showed greater value, attributable to the presence of an elongated and upright neck. Body lengths show sexual dimorphism and have different growth and development. Male neck measurements were greater (p< 0.05), except for the length of the neck. At the thorax level, the thoracic perimeter and depth were greater in males (p<0.05). Each morphological measure presents different magnitudes of increments; especially depending on the age category. The body weight shows differences for the sex and age factor (p<0.05), and in the current environmental conditions, the K'ara llamas can reach 100 kg. The body weight presents a great phenotypic heterogeneity, which constitutes an indicator of the diversity in the growth, adaptability and feeding efficiency of the animal. Based on this, it can be affirmed that the K'ara breed presents aptitudes for meat production and as a cargo transport animal, consistent with historical data; and there is a manifest sexual dimorphism and a relatively fast growth rate.

AB  - The human eye is very vulnerable to various environmental pollutants. Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) are widely spread heavy metals. The goal of the existing study is to explore the impact of single or joint exposure to Cd and Pb on the eye indicators. In this study, male New Zealand white rabbits were treated orally for 30 days with Cd (5 mg Cd Cl-2/kg bw) associated or not with Pb (12.5 mg lead acetate/kg bw). Fundus and slit lamp examinations, electroretinography (ERG), intraocular pressure (IOP), Cd and Pb residues, and the histopathological picture of the eye were studied. The results revealed that the oral dosing of Cd or Pb evoked a significant (p < 0.05) decline in a- and b-wave amplitudes, under scotopic conditions, and IOP values. Single Pb or Cd treatment showed a significant (p < 0.001) increase in their residues in the whole eye tissue of the Pb- or Cd-treated group. Eye structures of Cd- or Pb-intoxicated rabbit showed mild degenerated changes of cornea and sclera tissues with the presence of irregular variably sized eosinophilic droplets in the lens. Notably, the simultaneous exposure to Cd and Pb leads to an antagonistic outcome in all of the estimated parameters. These findings concluded that oral exposure to Cd or Pb could significantly disturb the vision but their joint exposure caused an opposing effect on nearly all of these disturbances.

AB  - The potencial of Coffea arabica leaves as bioindicators of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) was evaluated in a free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiment by using near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy for direct analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). A supervised classification model was built and validated from the spectra of coffee leaves grown under elevated and current CO2 levels. PLS-DA allowed correct test set classification of 92% of the elevated-CO2 level leaves and 100% of the current-CO2 level leaves. The spectral bands accounting for the discrimination of the elevated-CO2 leaves were at 1657 and 1698 nm, as indicated by the variable importance in the projection (VIP) score together with the regression coefficients. Seven months after suspension of enriched CO2, returning to current-CO2 levels, new spectral measurements were made and subjected to PLS-DA analysis. The predictive model correctly classified all leaves as grown under current-CO2 levels. The fingerprints suggest that after suspension of elevated-CO2, the spectral changes observed previously disappeared. The recovery could be triggered by two reasons: the relief of the stress stimulus or the perception of a return of favorable conditions. In addition, the results demonstrate that NIR spectroscopy can provide a rapid, nondestructive, and environmentally friendly method for biomonitoring leaves suffering environmental modification. Finally, C. arabica leaves associated with NIR and mathematical models have the potential to become a good biomonitoring system.

AB  - Numerous anthropogenic stressors impact rivers worldwide. Hypoxia, resulting from organic waste releases and eutrophication, occurs very commonly in Mediterranean rivers. Nonetheless, little is known about the effects of deoxygenation on the behavior of Mediterranean freshwater fish. To fill this knowledge gap, we assessed the impact of three different dissolved oxygen levels (normoxia, 48.4%, 16.5% saturation) on kinematics indicators (swimming velocity, acceleration, distance traveled) and shoaling cohesion of adult Iberian barbel, Luciobarbus bocagei, a widespread cyprinid species inhabiting a broad range of lotic and lentic habitats. We conducted flume experiments and video-tracked individual swimming movements of shoals of five fish. Our results reveal significant differences between the treatments regarding kinematics. Swimming velocity, acceleration, and total distance traveled decreased stepwise from the control to each of the two oxygen depletion treatments, whereby the difference between the control and both depletion levels was significant, respectively, but not between the depletion levels themselves. Shoaling cohesion showed dissimilarities between the treatments regarding the maximum distance between fish, as the high depletion treatment differed from each of the other two, indicating that under severe oxygen depletion some individuals move away from the shoal. Overall, our results show how oxygen depletion changes fish behavior, which may entail ecological responses, highlighting the need to maintain an unfragmented river network to ensure movement dispersal among habitats, thus providing conditions for species escapement from hypoxia.

AB  - The research aimed to analyze the distribution of trees species around springs in various environmental factors and the trees-springs interplay possibility in Soloraya region, Indonesia. Investigation was conducted by survey using census method within 10 m radius toward upstream from the point of vegetated springs or previously overgrown by trees. Cluster analysis and discriminant analysis divided 59 springs areas into four (4) groups based on environmental characteristics summarized into two (2) general groups (lowlands and highlands). Only Ficus benjamina was widely distributed shown by high value of relative frequency in entire areas (80%) and high value of indicator species in both lowlands and highlands which was statistically similar. Particular species were obviously dependent on environmental factors (Samanea saman and Innocarpus fagiferus for lowlands, Artocarpus elasticus and Bischofia javanica for highlands). Species dependency on environmental factors was also performed by Canonical Correspondence Analysis showing -0.604, 0538 and -0.647 of correlation coefficients for elevation, average rainfall and average temperature, respectively. This research also found an association between trees condition and water-flow of springs. It was supported by 0.57 of contingency coefficient which was statistically significant. The information obtained was expected to lead restoration/rehabilitation efforts on the spring protection zone. Adding the number of samples and environmental factors were suggested for future research to get more information. Deeper investigation on the role of the trees around springs was also suggested.

AB  - The magnetic properties of deep-sea sediments in the North Pacific vary in sync with glacial-interglacial climatic changes and have thus been considered as a paleoclimate indicator. However, the causes of these variations in magnetic properties, including the concentration, grain size, and mineralogy of magnetic minerals, remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the magnetic properties of deep-sea sediments recovered from the Shatsky Rise in the North Pacific to investigate the cause of the variability associated with glacial-interglacial cycles. Compared to the potential sediment provenances, the interglacial-stage and more than half of the glacial-stage sediments reveal magnetic mineralogical properties (S ratio and L ratio) of the Gobi and Taklimakan deserts, probably indicating dust from the both sources. During glacials, an abrupt decrease in the concentration of magnetic minerals is associated with increases in the average grain size and in the proportion of hematite relative to magnetite. The changes during glacials are mostly a result of dissolutions of magnetite by exposure to ambient ocean environments after deposition. Both magnetic and geochemical proxies validate that poor ventilation of the glacial deep waters in the North Pacific possibly induced iron-reducing conditions. With comprehensive compilation with the S-ratio data in the North Pacific sediments, our result indicates that the poorly ventilated deep waters reached up to water depths of 2,500m during glacials.

AB  - Traffic parameters of the road transport means are influenced beside the loads to be transported, the travel speeds, the constructive and functional characteristics by the air pressure in the tires which has a direct impact on the tire tread wear, rolling resistance, compaction, soil compaction and rolling track wear, and finally on the transport operation costs.
   This paper presents the research on a transport articulated vehicle made up of an agricultural tractor and a semi-trailer, aiming at continuous monitoring of the transported load in order to determine the optimal air pressure in the tires.
   In order to monitor the tire pressure, which is directly influenced by the tire load, an installation was created and placed on the articulated vehicle that continuously measures and monitors, in real time, the transported load, consisting mainly of two force transducers, two force amplifiers, a micro PLC (Programmable logic controller), an operating terminal, and the connection elements between them.
   The records made during experiments are managed using software specifically created for these researches.
   The experiments were performed at different loads of the semi-trailer, the results obtained from the tests allowing us to determine the authenticity of the software created, on the one hand and the value evolution of the measured parameters, on the other hand.
   The determined results allow the operator to make optimal decisions on the air pressure in the tire corresponding to the measured load, also taking into account the nature of the transported load, the type and condition of the rolling track.

AB  - Laboratory-scale component testing in dedicated high-flux solar simulators is a crucial step in the development and scale-up of concentrating solar power plants. Due to different radiative boundary conditions available in high-flux solar simulators and full-scale power plants the temperature and stress profiles inside the investigated receivers differ between these two testing platforms. The main objective of this work is to present a systematic scaling methodology for solar receivers to guarantee that experiments performed in the controlled environment of high-flux solar simulators yield representative results when compared to full-scale tests. In this work the effects of scaling a solar air receiver from the integration into the OMSoP full-scale micro gas-turbine based solar dish system to the KTH high-flux solar simulator are investigated. Therefore, Monte Carlo ray-tracing routines of the solar dish concentrator and the solar simulator are developed and validated against experimental characterization results. The thermo-mechanical analysis of the solar receiver is based around a coupled CFD/FEM-analysis linked with stochastic heat source calculations in combination with ray-tracing routines. A genetic multi-objective optimization is performed to identify suitable receiver configurations for testing in the solar simulator which yield representative results compared to full-scale tests. The scaling quality is evaluated using a set of performance and scaling indicators. Based on the results a suitable receiver configuration is selected for further investigation and experimental evaluation in the KTH high-flux solar simulator.

AB  - Winter chemical road maintenance has a significant negative influence on the environment. The application of chemical de-icing salts affects the trees growing near the road. Sodium and chlorine ions which are washed out into the environment are absorbed by the ambient vegetation; the increased concentration of these ions has a negative influence on the vegetation health. The determination of sodium and chlorine ions content in assimilative organs of conifers is used as a bioindicator of the impacts of winter chemical maintenance. The presented research paper evaluates the influence of the contamination potential on these ions content in needles of the Norway spruce (Picea abies). This species of spruce was chosen because of its abundant occurrence and heightened sensitivity towards salinization. The study was conducted in the north of the Czech Republic in the Liberec Region. To assess the damage potential of the winter chemical road maintenance, samples of the Norway spruce first- and second-year needles were collected and the sodium and chlorine ions concentrations were determined. At the same time, the research assessed the contamination potential of the region and the health condition of the analysed spruce trees. The results of ions concentrations (Na, Cl) were evaluated depending on four factors: the contamination potential, the health of the tree, the distance from the road and the age of the needles. Based on the evaluation of the results, a scale with framework concentration values was designed. This scale can be used for practical assessment of the degree of contamination.

AB  - Drought is one of the most serious climatic and natural disasters inflicting serious impacts on the socio-economy of Morocco, which is characterized both by low-average annual rainfall and high irregularity in the spatial distribution and timing of precipitation across the country. This work aims to develop a comprehensive and integrated method for drought monitoring based on remote sensing techniques. The main input parameters are derived monthly from satellite data at the national scale and are then combined to generate a composite drought index presenting different severity classes of drought. The input parameters are: Standardized Precipitation Index calculated from satellite-based precipitation data since 1981 (CHIRPS), anomalies in the day-night difference of Land Surface Temperature as a proxy for soil moisture, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index anomalies from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and Evapotranspiration anomalies from surface energy balance modeling. All of these satellite-based indices are being used to monitor vegetation condition, rainfall and land surface temperature. The weighted combination of these input parameters into one composite indicator takes into account the importance of the rainfall-based parameter (SPI). The composite drought index maps were generated during the growing seasons going back to 2003. These maps have been compared to both the historical, in situ precipitation data across Morocco and with the historical yield data across different provinces with information being available since 2000. The maps are disseminated monthly to several main stakeholders' groups including the Ministry of Agriculture and Department of Water in Morocco.

AB  - The ability to predict the effects of climatic factors on animals and their adaptability is important for livestock production. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether existing indices are suitable for evaluating heat stress in Santa Ines and Morada Nova sheep, which are locally adapted hair sheep breeds from northeastern Brazil, and if the limits used to classify thermal stress are suitable for these breeds. Therefore, climatic, physiological, and physical parameters, as well as thermographic images, were collected in 26 sheep, 1 1/2 years old, from two genetic groups (Santa Ines 12 males and 4 females; Morada Nov. 7 males and 3 females) for 3 days in both morning (4:00 a.m.) and afternoon (2:00 p.m.) with six repetitions, totalizing 156 repetitions. Statistical analysis included correlations and broken-line regressions. Iberia and Benezra indices were the tolerance tests that best correlated with the assessed parameters. High correlations between environmental indices and rectal or skin surface temperatures was observed, which indicates that these indices can be used for Santa Ines and Morada Nova sheep raised in central Brazil. However, some indicative values of thermal discomfort are different from the existing classification. Therefore, in order to classify appropriately, the model used needs to be carefully studied, because these classifying values can vary according to the species and model. Further research is necessary to establish indicators of thermal stress for sheep breeds raised in the region.

AB  - Salinity is one major abiotic stress that restrict plant growth and crop productivity. In maize (Zea mays L), salt stress causes significant yield loss each year. However, indices of maize response to salt stress are not completely explored and a desired method for maize salt tolerance evaluation is still not established. A Chinese leading maize variety Jingke968 showed various resistance to environmental factors, including salt stress. To compare its salt tolerance to other superior maize varieties, we examined the physiological and growth responses of three important maize hybrids and their related inbred lines under the control and salt stress conditions. By comparing the physiological parameters under control and salt treatment, we demonstrated that different salt tolerance mechanisms may be involved in different genotypes, such as the elevation of superoxide dismutase activity and/or proline content. With Principal Component Analysis of all the growth indicators in both germination and seedling stages, along with the germination rate, superoxide dismutase activity, proline content, malondialdehyde content, relative electrolyte leakage, we were able to show that salt resistance levels of hybrids and their related inbred lines were Jingke968 > Zhengdan958 > X1132 and X1132M > Jing724 > Chang7-2 > Zheng58 > X1132F, respectively, which was consistent with the saline field observation. Our results not only contribute to a better understanding of salt stress response in three important hybrids and their related inbred lines, but also this evaluation system might be applied for an accurate assessment of salt resistance in other germplasms and breeding materials

AB  - Tourism development planning requires consideration of indicators regarding the intensity of tourist activity within destination and measure that should not be exceeded in further improvement of this activity, in order to prevent disturbing the needs of local community and sustainability of local environment. The village Zlakusa is located within the territory of the City of Uzice and it represents an important tourism destination of South-western Serbia. Rural tourism of Zlakusa is characterized by its authenticity and recognition, regarding the pottery and ethno-park called "Terzica avlija". Accordingly, tourist function indicators were used in this research: tourist accommodation density, Defert Baretje's index, Charvat's index and Schneider's index, with the aim of emphasizing the importance of rural potentials of Zlakusa for tourism development within this village, but also within the whole territory of the City of Uzice. Research results showed that tourism is important industry within Zlakusa, with necessity of its further affirmation on tourist market and its adaptation to contemporary needs of modern tourists. Also, research results showed that Zlakusa participates in total tourist arrivals with 18%, as well as in total tourist overnights with 13% and it comprises 1.9% of accommodation capacities of the overall tourism development within the City of Uzice for observed period (2008-2016). Therefore, results of this study actually show that Zlakusa is highly oriented towards tourism industry, which is the main reason of necessity for further improvement of conditions for its development, especially in the case of rural tourism, without threatening the local community and local environment.

AB  - Spring runoff measurements of Arctic watersheds are challenging given the remote location and the often dangerous field conditions. This study combines remote sensing techniques and field measurements to evaluate the applicability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to defining spring breakup of the braided lower Kuparuk River, North Slope, Alaska. A statistical analysis was carried out on a time series (2001-10) of SAR images acquired from the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-2) and the Canadian RADARSAT satellite, as well as on measured runoff. On the basis of field information, the SAR images were separated into pre-breakup, breakup, and post-breakup periods. Three variables were analyzed for their suitability to bracket the river breakup period: image brightness, variance in brightness over the river length, and a sum of rank order change analysis. Variance in brightness was found to be the most reliable indicator. A combined use of that variance and sum of rank order change appeared promising when enough images were available. The temporal resolution of imagery served as the major limitation in constraining the timing of the hydrologic event. Challenges associated with spring runoff monitoring and the sensitive nature of SAR likely resulted in an earlier detection of surficial changes by the remote sensing technique compared to the field runoff observations. Given a sufficient temporal resolution, SAR imagery has the potential to improve the spatiotemporal monitoring of Arctic watersheds for river breakup investigations.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of winter climate variability based on daily mean temperature and precipitation data since 1970 in the Chic-Chocs Mountain range (located in the Gaspe Peninsula, Eastern Quebec, Canada). Mountain environments are particularly sensitive to rapid climate change and are therefore good indicators of recent global warming. The main goal of this study is to demonstrate how joint probability temperature/precipitation distributions can be used to estimate winter condition changes (trends) for six meteorological stations in the study area (the altitudinal range for the stations is from 5 to 574 m). The presence and persistence of snow cover was also estimated. Previous studies have shown a lack of evidence of significant trends in snow-cover characteristics (density, depth and snow water equivalent (SWE)) from the early 1980s to the present, despite an increase in temperature over the same period. A reanalysis of these data sets in addition to the use of a combination of temperature and precipitation data categorized into four modes (warm/wet, warm/dry, cold/wet and cold/dry) was also performed. Despite this new analysis, no clear evidence of climate change could be found in the study area over the last four decades. The results revealed that patterns and trends are quite different from one station to another, but when the environment is taken into account (valley or plateau, coastal versus inland) some apparent patterns emerge.

AB  - The cultivation of the sugar cane in Brazil is a major source of income for agriculture, especially in the Northeast. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate four genotypes of sugar cane using biometric and physiological indicators in a protected environment. The study used a completely randomized design with four treatments (genotype 698B, 712B, 260B and 3B), four replications and one plant as useful plot. The seedlings were transplanted at 45 days to vessels of 18 dm3. At 154 days after transplanting, were analyzed the following variables: Fluorescence of the chlorophyll a, levels of chlorophyll a, b and total, proline contents, quantum yield (phi PS2), photochemistry quenching (qP), non-photochemical quenching (qN), leaf temperature (TFO), main plant height (PH), culm diameter (DC), number of leaves (NL) and leaf area (LA). The evaluations were conducted in the period between 10:30 and 12:00 in the morning. In conditions of field capacity genotypes showed no statistical difference for the parameters of levels of chlorophyll a, b and total, photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, leaf temperature. For the 712B, proline contents differentiated itself statistically from the others, showing higher levels. The genotypes also differ statistically with regard to the main plant height (PH), number of leaves (NL) and leaf area (LA), standing out the 698B 3B in the number of leaves and leaf area, while the 712B and 260B had lower values for these parameters. Genotypes 3B and 698B are the most promising for the improvement program.

AB  - St. augustinegrass [Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walt.) Kuntze] is considered to be one of the most shade-tolerant warm-season turfgrasses, yet information is lacking on intraspecies developmental responses and performance in shade. This greenhouse study was conducted to 1) compare quality, development, and physiological responses of 10 commercial and experimental lines of st. augustinegrass in moderate and heavy [32% and 15% photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), respectively] shade environments' and 2) evaluate physiological and morphological indicators that could be used in rapid screening for shade tolerance among st. augustinegrass progeny from a segregating population. A range of shade tolerance was observed between the entries, as noted by quality and percent green cover after 10 weeks of imposed shade conditions. In moderate shade, most entries maintained acceptable (6 or greater) quality and greater than 50% green cover. However, in heavy shade, only 'Captiva', 'Amerishade', and 'PI 600734' maintained acceptable quality, with only PI 600734 and Captiva maintaining greater than 50% cover. 'TAES 5732-6', an embryo rescue-derived hybrid from 'Floratam', exhibited the least shade tolerance of the group in both shade environments. Neither chlorophyll content nor total nonstructural carbohydrates related well to observed shade quality differences between the entries. A strong correlation existed between shoot elongation rate of a cultivar and its corresponding final percent green cover in moderate shade (R-2 = 0.66) but not in heavy shade (R-2 = 0.19), suggesting that moderate shade may be the better environment for discriminating genetic differences among st. augustinegrass germplasm for shade tolerance.

AB  - Brazil is experiencing a surge in planting of sugar cane crops driven by internal markets and external policy drivers for biofuels. The current expectation is for the expansion of these crops to continue. This creates concern over the extent to which the full implications of large scale land use change are currently being, considered by decision-makers.
   Using the State of Sao Paulo as a case study (as it accounts for the majority of sugar cane grown in Brazil), a comparison was made of the impacts identified in Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) and Preliminary Environmental Reports (PERs), which have to be submitted for approval of most new sugar cane activities, with significant impacts known to be associated with sugar cane activities derived from literature review. The results from a review of 32 EISs and PERs (30% of the population) indicated that whilst some impacts were well covered by the sample (water and soil pollution, and air emissions) energy balance and Green House Gas emissions and food security had very limited consideration, and water resources, residues, labour conditions and social responsibility were only partially covered. Environmental Impact Assessment is constrained by its environmental advocacy role and its application to the project level only. This study highlights its limitations in the context of assessment of land use change which demands more strategic consideration. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pu isotopes and Cs-137 were analyzed using sector field ICP-MS and gamma spectrometry, respectively, in surface sediment and core sediment samples from the Yangtze River estuary. Pu239+240 activity and Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratios (>0.18) shows a generally increasing trend from land to sea and from north to south in the estuary. This spatial distribution pattern indicates that the Pacific Proving Grounds (PPG) source Pu transported by ocean currents was intensively scavenged into the suspended sediment under favorable conditions, and mixed with riverine sediment as the water circulated in the estuary. This process is the main control for the distribution of Pu in the estuary. Moreover, Pu is also an important indicator for monitoring the changes of environmental radioactivity in the estuary as the river basin is currently the site of extensive human activities and the sea level is rising because of global climate changes. For core sediment samples the maximum peak of Pu239+240 activity was observed at a depth of 172 cm. The sedimentation rate was estimated on the basis of the Pu maximum deposition peak in 1963-1964 to be 4.1 cm/a. The contributions of the PPG close-in fallout Pu (44%) and the riverine Pu (45%) in Yangtze River estuary sediments are equally important for the total Pu deposition in the estuary, which challenges the current hypothesis that the riverine Pu input was the major source of Pu budget in this area.

AB  - Spatial patterns and seasonal fluctuations of intertidal peracarids from Tarifa Island, Strait of Gibraltar, were studied over a two-year period (December 2005-December 2007). A total of 25,749 individuals were collected, comprising 46 species. Amphipods were best represented in the total number of species (32) and individuals (89% of numerical abundance) followed by isopods (12 species and 11% abundance) and tanaids (2 species and 1%). The highest number of species was registered in intermediate levels (1-1.5 m) dominated by Corallina elongata, although the highest abundances of peracarids were associated to seaweeds of lower levels (0-1 m) such as Gelidium corneum, Osmundea pinnatifida, Valonia utricularis and a turf of Caufacanthus ustulatus. The most abundant peracarids, Hyale stebbingi, H. schmidti, H. perieri, Stenothoe monoculoides. Caprella penantis, C. grandimana, Dynamene edwardsii and Ischyromene lacazei, were present throughout the whole year during 2006 and 2007. The highest peracarid densities were measured in April-August coinciding with the highest development of seaweeds, just before the maximum values of water temperature measured at the end of summer. Multivariate analyses confirmed a clear zonation of algae and associated peracarids in a vertical gradient, which was maintained stable during the two-year study. Several physical and biological factors may regulate such patterns of peracarid abundance and future experimental studies are necessary to explore the importance of factors such as competition, predation or weather conditions.

AB  - The effects of high crop load (unthinned trees, 22-23 fruits cm(-2) of trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA)), commercial crop load (3-4 fruits cm(-2) of TCSA), and no crop load (all fruitlets removed) on maximum daily trunk shrinkage (ME)S), trunk growth rate (TGR) and stem water potential (Psi(stem)) were studied during the fruit growth period and 20 days following harvest in fully irrigated early maturing peach trees, Prunus persica (L.) Batsch, cv. Flordastar. Even though crop load did not affect plant water status, the MDS and TGR values increased and decreased, respectively, as a result of the crop load effect. In this sense, for the same Psi(stem) value, there was a linear increase in MDS with crop load, with a slope of 6.6 mu m MPa-1 per unit of crop load increment. The effects of environmental conditions on daily MDS values were also dependent on crop load, suggesting that MDS reference values should be obtained by representing the relations between MDS and the climatic variables (daily mean air temperature, daily mean vapour pressure deficit and daily crop reference evapotranspiration) for a given crop load. The constancy of the relation between MDS and psi(stem) across crop load underlined the constancy of the elastic properties of the bark tissues. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enteroviruses and noroviruses are pathogenic viruses excreted by infected individuals. Discharged in wastewaters, some of these viruses can be captured by biofilms. in the present study, we assessed the occurrence and persistence of these viruses in wastewaters and in corresponding biofilms. Natural wastewaters and biofilms were analyzed monthly from January to July using real-time RT-PCR. Enterovirus RNA was detected in wastewater in June while norovirus RNA was detected from January to March. In contrast, biofilm analysis revealed the presence of both enterovirus and norovirus genomes throughout the study period. For instance, enterovirus and norovirus genogroups (GG) I and II were detected in 50, 46 and 37% of the biofilm samples, respectively (n = 24). In a laboratory experiment, persistence of norovirus GGI RNA (quantified using molecular techniques) and F-specific bacteriophages (quantified using both culture and molecular techniques) was assessed in wastewater and corresponding naturally-contaminated biofilms at both 4 and 20 degrees C. The concentrations of viral genomes (norovirus GGI and F-specific RNA phage) were very stable in biofilms. Indeed, no significant decrease was observed during the persistence experiment that lasted 49 days. Furthermore, regardless of our experimental conditions, viral genome and infectious F-specific bacteriophages persisted longer in biofilm than in wastewater. According to our results, wastewater biofilms may contribute to the persistence and dispersal of pathogenic viruses outside of epidemic periods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Populations around the world are vulnerable to natural disasters. Such disasters are occurring with increased frequency as a consequence of socio-economic and land-use developments and due to increased climate variability. This paper describes a methodology for using indicators to compute a Flood Vulnerability Index which is aimed at assessing the conditions which influence flood damage at various spatial scales: river basin, sub-catchment and urban area. The methodology developed distinguishes different characteristics at each identified spatial scale, thus allowing a more in-depth analysis and interpretation of local indicators. This also pinpoints local hotspots of flood vulnerability. The final results are presented by means of a standardised number, ranging from 0 to 1, which symbolises comparatively low or high flood vulnerability between the various spatial scales. The Flood Vulnerability Index can be used by international river basin organisations to identify and develop action plans to deal with floods and flooding or on smaller scales to improve local decision-making processes by selecting measures to reduce vulnerability at local and regional levels. In this work the methodology has been applied to various case studies at different spatial scales. This leads to some interesting observations on how flood vulnerability can be reflected by quantifiable indicators across scales, e. g. the relationship between the flood vulnerability of a sub-catchment with its river basin or the weak relation between the flood vulnerability of an urban area with the sub-catchment or river basin which it belongs to.

AB  - Experimental populations of three marine and estuarine diatoms were exposed to sediments with different levels of pollutants, collected from the Aveiro Lagoon (NW of Portugal). The species selected were Cylindrotheca closterium, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Navicula sp. Previous experiments were designed to determine the influence of the sediment particle size distribution on growth of the species assayed. Percentage of silt-sized sediment affect to growth of the selected species in the experimental conditions: the higher percentage of silt-sized sediment, the lower growth. In any case, percentages of silt-sized sediment less than 10% did not affect growth. In general, C. closterium seems to be slightly more sensitive to the selected sediments than the other two species. Two groups of sediment samples were determined as a function of the general response of the exposed microalgal populations: three of the six samples used were more toxic than the other three. Chemical analysis of the samples was carried out in order to determine the specific cause of differences in toxicity. After a statistical analysis, concentrations of Sn, Zn, Hg, Cu and Cr (among all physico-chemical analyzed parameters), in order of importance, were the most important factors that divided the two groups of samples (more and less toxic samples). Benthic diatoms seem to be sensitive organisms in sediment toxicity tests. Toxicity data from bioassays involving microphytobentos should be taken into account when environmental risks are calculated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Female pseudohermaphroditism is characterized by gonads consistent with chromosomal sex combined with ambiguous, masculinized external genitalia. Recognized in many mammals, this condition results from fetal exposure to androgens that can be embryonic, maternal, or environmental in origin. Female pseudohermaphrodite black and brown bears (Ursus americanus and U. arctos) from Alberta, Canada, and polar bears (U. maritimus) from Svalbard, Norway, have been identified. Recent population surveys in Nunavut, Canada, led to the discovery of 11 additional female pseudohermaphrodite polar bears. Each bear was screened for the presence of sex-determining region-Y (Sry) and amelogenin-Y (AMELY) genes as indicators of Y-chromosome DNA. One bear possessed both genes, implying that trisomy or a chromosomal rearrangement may account for her virilized phenotype. Preliminary data suggested that Sry was also present in the other 10 bears; further testing disproved that result, revealed an important source of error when using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to screen for the Sry gene, and led to the development of new amelogenin primers that provide superior sex information for bears. Ultimately, these extensive screens also supported the conclusion that 10 of 11 morphologically abnormal individuals may possess no genuine male-specific DNA. Therefore, nongenetic mechanisms such as maternal tumors, freemartinism, or endocrinological effects of environmental contaminants may also influence the development of the female pseudohermaphrodite phenotype in Nunavut polar bears.

AB  - The accuracy of an environmental impact assessment study in analyzing the consequences of either continuous or accidental releases in the atmosphere is critical especially when adverse health effects are expected to be found. High accuracy is hard to be achieved in complex areas where land/sea breeze and topography give rise to complex circulation patterns. In these conditions stationary modeling systems such as the Gaussian often fail, providing misleading results which in turn lead to poor mitigation and control strategies. Conversely, advanced modeling systems, able to deal with inhomogeneous and non stationary atmospheric phenomena, can be expected to achieve better accuracy. The present study shows the application of a modeling system, composed by a diagnostic meteorological model and a Lagrangian particle model, to assess the environmental impact of a cement plant located close to a populated urban area in central Italy and characterized by complex topography and atmospheric circulation. 3-D wind and temperature fields, produced by interpolation of ground and vertical remote sensing meteorological data, have been provided to a particle dispersion model to calculate 3-D concentration of NOx, SO2 and CO in a 10 x 10 km(2) domain. Comparison of results with observations confirms that the modeling system is able to achieve high accuracy when high quality data are provided as input. The applied methodology has shown that a modeling system can be used to provide local authorities and plant managers with a valid tool for consequences analysis studies.

AB  - A crucial issue in evolution of severe storm, such as typhoon and even single supercell, is to diagnose and predict the sudden intensifying in storm. This paper describes an attempt to investigate the influence and effect of ambient moisture in the development of storm. It was mainly through a dynamic way to detect the helical enhancement by ambient moisture. It was found that the correlation between the ambient moistness and the intensity of rotating convective cells can be well analyzed by helicity dynamics. The correlation between environmental streamwise vorticity (i. e. helicity) and vertical velocity (storm updraft or downdraft) is a powerful indicator to catch favorable or unfavorable conditions for storm evolution. For this purpose, a three-dimensional nonhydrostatic storm-scale model, Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) was employed in order to numerically simulate a well-documented case of Del City supercell storm in different kinds of environmental moistness. Moreover, such different kinds of ambient moist environment and the resultant different morphologies and evolutions in the storm clearly demonstrated that the abundant moistness in the environment that the storm embedded significantly strengthens the storm intensity. In fact, the storm is embedded in much moist environment and therefore larger instability propagates faster than the one in the drier air. It further produces stronger low-level mesocyclone with a much longer lifetime. The stronger convection and twist in the updraft indicates that helical enhancement effect by moisture lead to stronger tornadic activity in severe storm.

AB  - Diatom-based transfer functions for inferring epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) have been developed from a data set of 33 southeastern Australian water storages. Regular institutional monitoring of these sites has allowed comparison of models developed from TP data covering different time periods. A model based on mean annual TP performs better than models derived from winter maximum TP, spring minimum TP or TP nearest the time of diatom sampling. A mean annual TP model (WA-PLS 2 component) has a jack-knifed diatom-inferred versus measured TP correlation coefficient (r(jack)(2)) of 0.69 and a root-mean-square-error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.246 log(10)mug TP1(-1), while alternative models have RMSEP > 0.27. Deletion of two samples with uncharacteristic species composition and environmental conditions improved performance of the mean annual TP model (r(jack)(2) = 0.74; RMSEP = 0.233 log(10) mug TP 1(-1)). Comparison with other published diatom-TP calibration models indicates that this model performs relatively well, with possible contributing factors including the extensive characterisation of TP ( with an average 15 determinations making up the annual mean) and the dominance of planktonic diatoms in most sites. Downcore application of the model will allow the reconstruction of reservoir nutrient histories since commissioning, and thus provide a basis for understanding and management of reservoirs.

AB  - Rooted cuttings of 40 different clones (genotypes) of Picea abies L. Karst were planted on 7 contrasting test sites (environments) in northern Germany. Various concepts on stability and genotype x environment interactions (GxE) have been discussed using height data at age 17 years. Several parametric and rank-based measures concerning GxE and stability were estimated; and the relationships among them along with the total height were determined. In addition, 5 different rank-based measures that combine both stability and performance of genotypes simultaneously have also been estimated. Although ANOVA tests showed significant GxE, rank-based nonparametric tests using S-(m) statistics showed no significant differences among the clones in their interactive behavior. Overall evaluation of various stability-related parameters indicate that significant GxE interaction detected by F tests is quite small in proportion (1.92%), clones contributed 7% and sites 50% within the total variance. The observed clonal contributions to interaction sum of squares are attributable mostly to changes in environmental conditions associated with site factors. In further selection and breeding with the clonal material at hand, GxE interaction appears to be of minor importance in Norway spruce, as it is also supported by the non-significance of rank-based tests. Any one of the 5 indices that combine stability and performance appears to be a better indicator than any other single stability-related parameter in detecting genotypes with both high stability and high performance.

AB  - Experimental and theoretical studies show that displacements along fault planes cause regular distortions in the initial stress field near the fault. One would naturally expect these distortions to influence source mechanisms of small earthquakes and the number of seismic events. We attempt to reveal this effect and to show its possible use for recognizing displacements along large faults.
   Some variants of a three-dimensional stress field conditioned by the displacement along the fault planes were obtained on the basis of a theoretical two-dimensional stress field near the fault and the third superimposed principal stress. The variants were used to plot theoretical prognostic schemes for secondary shear fractures in the active fault zone. The schemes enable the prediction of location, dimensions, and configuration of areas with shear fractures of different types (thrusts, strike-slip and normal faults), orientation of their planes and zones of high shear stress.
   The areal distribution of seismotectonic deformation types and the number of seismic events for two 3-year periods were studied in the source zone of the 1978 Alai earthquake. The results were compared with the theoretical prognostic patterns of secondary shear fractures in the active fault zone. This investigation discovered that the deformations might have resulted from aseismic shear movement (creep) along one of the two regional large Pamir-Alai faults. Thus, it is shown to be possible to reveal the active part of the fault, as well as its length and the direction of the displacement along the fault, by data on weak seismicity alone.

   Even though management talent is not, or should not be, a gender-related question, the smaller representation that women have in the executive governing bodies of companies is a well-known fact. Achieving adequate gender diversity on corporate boards does not only constitute a challenge on a level of ethics, policy and corporate social responsibility, it can also be an objective of efficiency, the veracity of which should be examined.
   Starting from this point of view, the aim of this work is to analyze if an increase in the feminine presence in the Boards of Management of companies leads to an improvement of its economic profitability (measured by the Rentability over Assets -RoA-). Specifically, for this research, we have opted for a sectoral analysis of credit cooperatives, which have been expressly elected for being non-listed financial entities, as well as being very homogeneous in their business model, both for its territorial nature and for the retail banking model implemented. Aditionally these entities incorporate the cooperative principles as a differentiating element of its corporate culture.
   The intention is nor to analyze the possible barriers that currently exist for the promotion of women to managerial positions, since they have already been included in several studies that analyze this issue, including the case of Spain (Ribas and Sajardo, 2005; Mateos et. al., 2010; Esteban, 2013). On the contrary, we want to know to which extent gender diversity affects the performance of credit unions both as companies and as financial institutions.
   Methodological approach
   The methodology that has been applied is based on the Generalized Method of Moments (MGM), used for the estimation of a dynamic linear equation with a panel composed of 78 entities during the period 2000-2014. This has been using the best source of public data of the sector; the Spanish Association of Credit Unions (UNACC).
   The dependent variable in the model is the economic profitability or rentability over assets (RoA), being the independent variables two measures of gender (proportion of female counselors and gender diversity on boards) and several main indicators of the economic and financial structure of the entities (efficiency, financial profitability, leverage, financial gap and solvency). Firstly, to run the analysis, the independent variables have been included on an individual basis, and then the impact of those related to gender through their interaction with the remaining independent variables, differentiating in both cases the effect according to the economic cycle.
   Results/Implications/Limitations
   The results obtained show the low female presence in the councils of the credit unions, since, on average, the proportion of female counselors reaches only 7.7% of the total membership, all of which explains the low value of the average Arithmetic of the Blau index (0,12), since these are not diversified Councils. Therefore, these results confirm that Spanish credit cooperatives have a gender gap even greater than the listed companies, both from Spain (13% in 2014) and from Europe (21% in 2015), according to the Spencer Stuart Board of Directors' Index (2015) and the European Commission (2016), respectively, which may be explained by the lack of regulation on mandatory gender quotas in their Boards.
   The results also indicate that the existence of a greater proportion of women on the boards of these entities contributed positively to improving their rentability over assets (RoA) through increased rentability over equity (RoE) and financial leverage. However, during the period of economic crisis (from 2008 to 2014) for each percentage point that the proportion of women in the council increased, the rentability over assets (RoA) was reduced by 2.39%, the rest of the variables remaining constant.
   The analysis of the research hypotheses allows us to observe, firstly, that the gender diversity in the Boards of Directors of the credit cooperatives analyzed is an important element to be taken into account in explaining the evolution of their rentability over assets (RoA), as well as through other economic-financial magnitudes, such as financial profitability, leverage or efficiency (H1 hypothesis). Secondly, the results obtained show that the effect of gender on the rentability over assets (RoA) has been subordinated to the existing economic cycle, since a negative impact is shown directly from 2008 onwards. Indirectly, through financial profitability and efficiency, the role of women has gone from being positive to zero or negative after the beginning of the crisis, depending on the proportion of women or gender diversity, respectively, as well as through the financial gap, therefore the negative effect (H2 hypothesis) becomes more intense.
   Conclusions/Findings
   As a main conclusion, it is possible to emphasize that the economic crisis has conditioned both the direct impact of the analyzed variables and the indirect one of gender in profitability. Thus, when we analyze the direct effect of women on the rentability over assets (RoA), we can see that the relationship between women and men is null or negative depending on the economic cycle, while the impact is both positive and negative, depending on the indirect approach used.
   This study has tried to fill a gap in the literature that analyzes the effect of gender on business profitability, such as the analysis in a sector of unlisted companies and for a broad period of time, which allows to contemplate different scenarios according to the economic cycle. In order to do this, a dynamic linear equation has been estimated by working with a panel of 78 Spanish cooperative credit institutions during the period 2000-2014 using the MGM. By doing this, it has been possible to measure both the direct impact of the proportion of women counselors and gender heterogeneity in the rentability over assets (RoA), as well as the consequences of the interaction with other variables, differentiating in both cases, whether this effect has been conditioned to the financial crisis in Spain (2008-2014).
   A further improvement of this research could be a qualitative aspect of a more difficult measurement that can be approached with a different methodology, analyzing the capacity of influence on the decisions that each woman can have on the rest of the members of the board in relation with deliberations and decision-making. This problem statement would mean focusing in the analysis of female leadership that can help understand the results obtained in this work, since the numerical increase in the number of women in boards cannot provide differentiation if they do not exercise the appropriate leadership in boards, that are generally composed of an average of 10 to 12 members.
   This study has been conditioned by a series of limitations, among which, fundamentally, are the non-possession and inclusion of data and valuations on certain characteristics that can be conditioned to the effect of gender on business performance, such as the characteristics of governance and the type of tasks performed by women on the boards.
   From another point of view, due to the fact that credit unions have a social purpose, it should be of interest to analyze other aspects of governance that allow studying not only the impact of women on the economic profitability of this entities, but also the possible effect that they may have in their social profitability, all of which stands as future lines of research.

AB  - The aim of the article is investigation of prospects of Industrial Internet of Things development, analyzing problems and approaches to provide its information safety for economic agents, as well as determining approaches to the economic substantiation of investments in this direction of activity.
   Results of the research. Modern development of information technology (IT) significantly enhances the effective business activity, creates innovation competitive advantages for companies. In this context, the spread of "smart" production systems becomes especially popular. These systems manage things without human intervention and form the basis of concepts of Internet of Things and Industrial Internet of Things.
   As the current direction of IT at the enterprise, Industrial Internet of Things enables operation processes developing and creates new options for the working environment as well as entirely new categories of jobs with their significant productivity increasing. In particular, it is confirmed by the economic results of implementation of largescale information systems for production management at modern enterprises by using system solutions of ERPclass. As a result of such projects' implementation, the overall efficiency of the company may be increased by 20% or more.
   Starting using technology based on the Industrial Internet of Things, companies need to plan every step to increase efficiency and to stimulate the creation of product-service hybrid solutions, focused on the result. For example, attempts to change the situation for improving assets' efficiency can become the basis for the creation of new services.
   To encourage the spread of Industrial Internet of Things, enterprises need technical resources like IT infrastructure and labour resources like professionals with specific technical skills. Availability of necessary resources depends on firms' investments in the infrastructure for collecting, storing and analysing data, as well as in staff. In addition, the development of IT causes companies to increase investment in information security provision due to rising number of information security violations and increased severity of their consequences.
   In terms of information security management, the company must ensure that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its assets, information, data and IT services always meet the requirements agreed with the business. In this regard, the company's ability to ensure information security is a key source of value, and the need to embed security into product design becomes important.
   Today the quality and efficiency of enterprise's information system affect the final financial results through the quality of business processes. Companies that finance information security by residual principle can lose their competitive advantages. In addition, each firm has to solve the problem of how to consider expenditures in information security - as costs or investments and which approaches should be applied to their optimization. Typically, if the company has a long- term development strategy related to IT, it considers the information security expenses as investments and seeks to make them promising, resorting to assess their economic efficiency and optimize the structure of investments. The criterion of economically expedient limits of investment in Industrial Internet of Things information security at the enterprise can be defined as a degree of protection of interests of all persons and objects who are dependent on information and communications systems that provide information.
   Conclusions and directions of further researches. Modern development of IT provides companies with innovation competitive advantages and exacerbates the problems of information security provision for economic agents and cybercrime growth. The impact of information risks is realized through vulnerability of information systems that support different types of economic activities of industrial enterprises and through the companies' losses due to leaks of confidential information, failures in information networks and systems. To prevent losses from cybercrime, companies should increase their investment in information security, guided by the criterion of economic expedient limits of investment, which provides sufficient protection from unauthorized access.
   Given the urgency of IT systems development and ensuring their information security for the industrial enterprises, further scientific researches should be devoted to the justification for the use the Balanced Scorecard as a system of company's strategic management. The Balanced Scorecard should be based on the measurement and evaluation of enterprise's efficiency with the help of the set of optimally matched indicators that reflect all aspects of the company.

AB  - Background: Management types and their intensity may vary according to indicators such as: (1) practices complexity, (2) degree of techniques specialization, (3) occurrence and types of social regulations, (4) artificial selection intensity, (5) energy invested, (6) tools types, and (7) amounts of resources obtained. Management types of edible plants were characterized and analyzed in Nahuatl communities of the Tehuacan Valley. We expected that both natural and human pressures generate risk on plant resources availability, influencing human responses of management directed to decrease risk. We particularly hypothesized that magnitude of risk would be a direct function of human pressures favored by cultural and economic value and ecological factors such as scarcity (restricted distribution and abundance). Management practices may decrease risk of plant resources, more effectively when they are more intense; however, absence or insufficiency of management practices on endangered plants may favor loss of their populations. Understanding current management motives and their consequences on the purpose of ensuring availability of plant resources might allow us to understand similar processes occurring in the past. This issue is particularly important to be studied in the Tehuacan Valley, where archaeologists documented possible scenarios motivating origins of plant management by agriculture during prehistory.
   Methods: Through ethnobotanical collecting, 55 semi-structured and free listing interviews we inventoried edible plant species used in five villages of Coyomeapan, Mexico. We identified: (1) native plant species whose products are obtained exclusively through simple gathering, (2) native species involving simple gathering and other management types, and (3) non-native species managed by agricultural management. We conducted in depth studies on the 33 native species managed through gathering and other types of practices. We carried out a total of 660 sessions of detailed interviews to 20 households randomly selected. We showed to people voucher specimens and photos of the sample of species chosen and documented their cultural and economic values. Spatial availability of these plant species was evaluated through vegetation sampling. Values for each cultural, economic, and ecological indicator were codified and averaged or summed and weighed according to frequency of interviewees' responses or ecological conditions per plant species. With the standardized values of these indicators we performed a PCA and scores of the first principal component were considered as a risk index, which summarizes information of thirteen indicators of human use, demand and scarcity of each plant species. Similarly, eleven indicators of energy invested, complexity, tools and management strategies were used for performing PCA and scores of the first principal component were considered as management intensity index for each plant species. A linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the relation between risk and management intensity indexes. Amounts of variation of management data explained by ecological, cultural and economic information, as well as their risk level were analyzed through canonical correspondence analyses (CCA).
   Results: A total of 122 edible plant species were recorded, nearly 30% of them were introduced domesticated plants, 51 were wild species obtained exclusively by simple gathering and 33 were native species obtained by simple gathering and other management practices, these latter were the ones more deeply studied. People recognized variants in 21 of these latter 33 species, the variants receiving differential use, management, artificial selection and incipient domestication. The lowest values of management intensity corresponded to species under simple gathering and tolerance, mostly annual abundant plants, occasionally consumed by few people. The highest management intensity values were recorded in species with economic importance, mostly perennial with recognized variants whose management requires using tools, and which are protected by collective regulations. The regression analysis indicated significant value R-2 = 0.433 (P < 0.001) between risk and management indexes. CCA explained 65.5% of variation of management intensity, mainly by socio-cultural factors (32.6%), whereas ecological data explained 21.3% and the intersection of all factors 11.6%. Variation of management intensity is 67.6% explained by risk variables. Length-span of life cycle, reproductive system type, distribution, number of parts used, number of management and use forms and type of regulations were statistically significant.
   Conclusion: People manage plant resources according to the role these play in households' subsistence, the quantity available and the quality of their useful products; particularly important is the balance between resources availability and demand. Management responses to risk are also influenced by the ease to propagate or manipulate individual plants and time requiring the construction of manipulation strategies and techniques.

TI  - Modern Methods of Monitoring and Controlling Combustion of Solid Fuels in Order to Reduce Its Environmental Impact
T2  - ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA
LA  - Polish
KW  - FLAMES
AB  - Polish power industry, faces the challenge of efficient management of the combustion process in power units, built largely 50 years ago. The concept of the effectiveness of such a process should be understood not only in terms of technical and economic parameters, but also environmental, due to the directives of the European Commission, continually tightening emissions limits. For example, solid fuel power units with a capacity above 500 MWth, had to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions to 500 mg/Nm(3) since 2008, which after the year 2016 is expected to be only 200 mg/Nm(3).
   In power generation, mainly based on the combustion of coal, lignite, and co-combustion with biomass, much attention is drawn to the primary methods. It is estimated that innovative technologies based on primary methods will meet the rigours of the directives at half the costs of the catalytic reduction methods. In addition, new investments are burdened with additional costs as well as difficulties and delays in obtaining permits. Thus, in the face of this situation, relatively cheap reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is an important issue,
   The complexity, nonlinearity of the combustion process, delays and disturbances as well as security issues makes that the nature of most discussed and implemented solutions is usually of modernization. The basic measures available to the engineer of low-emission combustion systems are limited to: reducing the combustion temperature, air re-distribution, fuel staging (combustion aerodynamics and reburning), and the reducing properties of the rich flame. Assistive technologies like process control optimization may be complementary to these technological improvements.
   Controlling the combustion process is a very complex issue. The difficulty of operation of such process consists in the mutual interference effects of chemical, physical (mainly energy and mechanical) on one hand and risks existing if its course becomes unpredictable. In addition, there are restrictions on the control due to the unavailability of certain process signals (input or output) and incomplete knowledge about them. Current availability of high-speed measuring and computing devices allows to extract the hidden relationships between the elements of such complex process and the use them in control. The paper presents the technologies being developed in the Department of Electronics Lublin University of Technology. They use optical diagnostic methods, modem methods of control and artificial intelligence methods.
   Among optical methods, those based on image processing become particularly important. They are shown in the first part of this article. Apparent motionlessness of a flame is the result of dynamic balance between the local flame propagation speed and the speed of the incoming fuel-oxidizer mixture. Change the flame front location in space, perceived as a change in the shape of a flame, is the result of disruption of this balance. This allows to assume that the flame shape can be an indicator of the status of a combustion process taking place in certain conditions. It was shown that even on the basis of simple geometrical indicators, such as the flame surface area and contour length of the flame area, one can determine the changes of important parameters such as change in the flame of air-fuel ratio. They can be determined in real time at a speed of 50 images per second.
   The second part of the article is devoted to the diagnosis of an individual burner with the use of optical methods and artificial intelligence. Research is aimed to develop a system allowing a parametric evaluation of the quality of pulverized coal burner operation. It is based on an analysis of local variability of the brightness of the flame. Due to the highly nonlinear nature of dependency and lack of an analytical model, parameter neural networks were used to estimate the selected parameter. For example, the neuronal estimator error of nitric oxide emissions on the basis of optical measurements does not exceed 10% and its average value is about 3%. Opto-neural system for estimation of combustion process parameters was used in the control system stabilizing emissions of nitrogen oxides from a single burner. Studies have shown that using such system can significantly reduce the disturbance response time, which reduce the total amount of pollutants emitted.
   The third part describes the combustion chamber identification with three different types of low-emission burners. The achieved models were used for Model Predictive Controller design, which allows to implement appropriate borders for input, output and control signals. Achieved models and controllers were verified regarding to normative limitations of NOx emission. Performed activities allowed for conclusions formulation in reference to pollution control policy.

AB  - Introduction Cotton is the most produced natural fibre in the world, with an annual output of 23 million t of lint in the period 2000-2013. Africa produced in average 6% of that output, and despite being a relatively minor contributor to global cotton supply chains, it has been estimated that a large percentage of the continent's population depends on cotton cultivation for their livelihood. Most published cotton LCAs focused on the main global producers (India, China, USA), a few consider African cotton, and none to date Malian cotton. This work presents an LCA of the Malian cotton sector, consisting of an agricultural phase and ginning operations, in contrast with other African and global cotton LCAs. Material and methods The goal of the study is to assess the absolute and relative environmental impacts of Malian cotton, per agricultural production system type, including the processing of seed cotton in ginning plants to produce cotton fibre bales (cradle to processing plant gate). Inventories were built for the two initial phases in the production cycle of cotton fibre, namely, the agricultural phase and the ginning phase. The main agricultural production system types were identified, according to distinctive differences in yields and technical processes?such as phytosanitary strategies?as well as the main processes performed in ginning plants. Operational data, representing the period 2002-2010, were provided by the Malian Company for the Development of Textiles (CMDT). It included yields and input and their uncertainty data. Direct field emissions of the agricultural phase were estimated following the AGRIBALYSE methodology, adapted when necessary to tropical conditions (e.g. a modified version of the Indigo-N model set was used to estimate N losses). Impact assessment was based on the European-sanctioned ILCD 2011 Midpoint+ v1.0.9, May 2016 method. Sensitivity was explored with scenarios and uncertainty data was propagated with Monte Carlo. Results and discussion The agricultural phase of cotton production in Mali differs from that of the largest producing countries, in that it is non-irrigated and non-mechanised and that non-Bt varieties are used. Instead, Malian cotton is rainfed?thus produced during the rainy season, from April/May to October/November?in rotation with maize or sorghum, manual work is prevalent up to the harvest, ploughs are towed by animals, and local varieties are grown (mainly STAM 59A and NTA 90-5). Malian yields were in the order of 400 kg lint/ha in the period 2001-2018, corresponding to similar to 1 t seed cotton/ha. The dominant production system, conventional agriculture, was sub-classified into three sub-types based on the phytosanitary strategy followed: calendar (81%), threshold control (15%) and targeted (4%). An average conventional system type was also constructed, as a production-weighted average of calendar, targeted and threshold. An existing marginal production of organic (0.5 parts per thousand) cotton was also modelled. Organic cotton products (seed cotton, lint and cottonseed) feature lower impacts than conventional both per t and per ha (except for the toxicity, climate change and eutrophication impact categories), despite comparatively lower yields, due to lower input intensity. A single score-based contribution analysis confirms that, for conventional cotton, pesticide application is the main contributor to impacts, followed by mineral fertilisers. For organic cotton, the main drivers of impacts are natural pesticides and organic fertilisation.
   The overwhelming contribution of pesticides is largely due to the provision of organophosphorus compounds, specifically the insecticide profenofos. Moreover, the ginning phase contributed very little to the overall impacts (up to 3%). When data uncertainty is considered, the impacts per t of lint are always lower for organic cotton. Conclusions Impacts were generally larger for conventional than from organic cotton. The main hotspots are related to pesticide use, and therefore, efforts should focus on that factor, despite pesticide inputs being already relatively lower than elsewhere. Climate change indicators for Malian cotton products were compared with literature values, having similar orders of magnitude. Malian cotton production features lower yields than the main global producers do, which is mainly due to low soil fertility and, to a lesser extent, to its dependence on rainwater. A shift towards organic cotton would be desirable only if the yield gap can be overcome.

AB  - The release of enteric pathogenic bacteria in aquatic environments poses the problem of the fate of these bacteria under the effects of environmental factors (solar radiation, salt concentration, temperature, nutrient level, pH, competition). Frequently, these bacterial cells, potentially pathogenic, enter into a non-culturable state on routine bacteriological plating media. However, the use of direct detection methods (DAPI stained cells) allows the visualization of these Viable but Non Culturable cells (VNC). But, beyond the characterization of the viability of the cells (electron transport activity, metabolic activity, membrane integrity, structure and/or quantity of DNA), what happens with the virulence of these cells? This problem was experimentally investigated according to the bacterial model Salmonella Typhimurium. The virulence of this strain, which is the agent of the murine typhoid, was evaluated on a mouse model. Experimentally, the effects of some environmental factors on the survival and on the maintenance of virulence of Salmonella Typhimurium were measured in microcosms exposed to UV radiation (four germicidal lamps 8 mW s(-1) cm(-2), wave length: 254 nm), salt concentration (Sea Salt Sigma, 37), nutrient starvation. The microcosms were simultaneously submitted to these three factors, with variable exposure times. For each of those times, the viability of the nonculturable cells (which became nonculturable because of the exposure to the three factors) was measured through different physiological states notable in the cells, after using different fluorescent dyes. The stained cells were observed by epifluorescence microscopy and analysed by image cytometry. So, the cellular populations are characterised by enumeration of respiring bacteria (CTC, [39]), metabolising bacteria (YEK, [22] modified), bacteria owning an undamaged cytoplasmic membrane (LD, Live/Dead BacLight Viability Kit. Molecular Probes Inc.); we also determined the quantity and/or structure of DNA of the cells (fluorescence level of DAPI stained cells).
   After exposure to the three factors for one hour (13.56 J cm(-2)), while the plate count cell density rapidly decreased from #10(7) cells mL(-1) to < 0.1 cell mL(-1), physiological states of these viable but non-culturable cells are similar to those of nonexposed cells. On the other hand, after exposure for three hours, only 10 % of the cells deposit a CTC formazan-crystal and 20 % are substrate responsive cells (enlarged cells in presence of Yeast Extract and Cephalexin: YEC). Half of the cellular population presents an undamaged cytoplasmic membrane and the level of fluorecence of DAPI stained cells is close to 85 %, which shows that the DNA of these cells is weakly damaged. After exposure to the three experimental factors for 24 hours (315 J cm(-2)), weak replies to the physiological tests used in this study to characterize the viability of the non-culturable cellular population are observed (CTC: 4 %; YEC: 2 %; LD: 11.8 %) while the fluorescence level of DAPI stained cells remains firm at 80 %. At the same time, the virulence expression of VNC cells of Salmonella Typhimurium, evaluated by intraperitoneal injection to the mouse (route which excludes uncontrolled parameters, unlike the per os route) does not seem to be correlated with the cellular viability such as it has been evaluated in this study. A 30 min exposure (6.73 J cm(-2)) to the three environmental factors, leading to the non-culturability of almost the entire exposed cell population (0.08 culturable cell mL(-1)) whereas the level of viability of those culturable cells is closed to the one of non-exposed cells. The injection of 1000 of those cells (<0.001 culturable cells in 100 mu L inoculated) into the mouse (a group of ten mice) does not cause any mortality four weeks post-inoculation, whereas the injection of the same dose of nonexposed cells leads to the death of all mice in the group one week post-inoculation. According to our preliminary experiments on Salmonella Typhimurium, the loss of the state of culturability and the loss of virulence towards mice by intraperitoneal route, because of the exposure to associated effects of UV irradiation (254 nm), salinity (37) and nutrient starvation, seem to be concomitant.

AB  - Bronze Age research in the eastern Baltic was actually initiated with the very first archaeological settlement excavations at Asva and Iru in Estonia and KlarAukalns in Latvia in the 1930s. Before the discovery of these hill fort sites the material culture remains were so minimal that researchers even expressed doubt concerning the existence of a proper Bronze Age or any remarkable settlement activity in this region. The quantity and quality of finds from these hill forts resulted in completely new insights into a fairly unknown cultural past of the eastern Baltic region. Quite soon the Estonian prehistorian Harry Moora reached the conclusion that the cultural life in the Early Metal Ages was against all expectations a very active and developed one, and vividly benefitting from intercultural contacts. Interestingly, Moora also stated that the rich archaeological material from these newly discovered sites indicated that the scarceness of grave and hoard finds (containing metals) need not necessarily correspond to the social and cultural reality of the past and that local deposition processes and customs should be considered. Consequently, there was no reason to believe that eastern Baltic societies suffered metal-poor or low-level economic conditions and cultural developments (see Chapter 1).
   Unfortunately, this was just a promising start of Bronze Age research that, as the entire methodology and working practice in eastern Baltic archaeology, could not be developed further. This was mainly due to the political conditions and circumstances throughout the post-World War II period and the times of the Iron Curtain. After the continuation of excavations at Asva on the Island of Saaremaa in the late 1940s and mid-1960s and other archaeological campaigns in the newly discovered site of Ridala (with palisade structures; excavated 1961-1963) in western Estonia preliminary results only and a few minor articles have been published. In his dissertation in 1970 Vello Laugas gave a detailed overview of the current state of research into the Bronze and Early Iron Ages in Estonia, also introducing the main results from earlier and his own archaeological investigations at Asva (years 1965-1966). The comprehensive account of facts leading to his chronological system and periodisation, particularly his interpretation and discussion of socio-economic processes and developments, were all grounded on archaeological objects, types and groups from Bronze Ages settlement sites. Because of remaining unpublished and the general isolation of Estonian archaeology in Soviet time Lougas' work could never be received or reviewed by any international research platform. The Bronze Age research of other Baltic Sea regions was simply denied access to the archaeological progress of the Baltic countries, also during the next decades. Laugas had a sort of autonomous position in the field of Bronze and Iron Age research in the Soviet republic of Estonia. Being practically the only academic authority specialising in and permitted to study and investigate the heritage from these prehistoric time periods, he also had to cover a large scope of other duties in salvation and heritage management. Accordingly, there was not much room and spirit left for theoretically reflective research, not to mention the danger of being steadily confronted with political ideological doctrines in Soviet archaeology and history sciences. When reflecting his (not always fully reproducible) applied methods in archaeological work and the missing data and documentations of significant archaeological sites and contexts, this background of political and economic circumstances needs to be reconsidered (Chapter 6). This concerns in particular the meteorite crater area of Kaali on Saaremaa and the archaeological excavations and the reporting under his direction (in 1976-1979), which have left some confusion and many open questions behind.
   In the late 1980s Valter Lang initiated a proper landscape and settlement archaeology in Estonia with emphasis on palaeogeography and palaeoecology, mainly in the course of studies and fieldworks in coastal areas of north Estonia (including Iru hill fort). His micro-regional and diachronic perspective on the dynamics in the interplay of humans and the environment in this region and on the introduction and development of agriculture also used to consider multidisciplinary studies of grave monuments and funerary customs. The research into stone cist graves as sources of osteoarchaeology and forensic research also helped to formulate new subject matters of social archaeology. Thus, compared to the Island of Saaremaa primarily represented by settlements in the period of study, the north Estonian research area offered a completely different but very convenient situation for developing new theories and models explaining these social and economic processes that are of significance for studies of the Asva settlement phenomenon. The archaeological evidence of land use for animal husbandry and field cultivation made researchers aware of socio-political implications of both the territorial organisation including land ownership and the technological systems behind agriculture. The emergence of a stratified agrarian society with control and ownership over the fertile lands (limestone rendzinas) and the population growth at the end of the Bronze Age as witnessed by the stone cist graves inferred to a drastically increasing social competition. According to Lang's studies, this eventually resulted in more diverse and complex relationships in society and between settlements during the Late Bronze Age. Asva and Iru, for instance, are now perceived as central places and integral in a functionalist perception of a system of interdependent open (single farms) and enclosed (complex) settlements. It is the exclusive occurrence of bronze casting workshops in settlements of hill fort type, a general eastern Baltic phenomenon, that makes the metalwork production perceived as a subject of social power-and-control institutions over supply and trade of metal (and the technology). With"the Late Bronze Age and the metalwork activity in the eastern Baltic the social and economic processes mentioned are viewed in close interaction and connection with the Nordic Bronze Age cultural sphere, with regions such as eastern Sweden and Gotland of southern Scandinavia. These processes, with Asva as a key site, are now viewed from a macro-historical center periphery perspective, situated in a Bronze Age world-system framework (Chapters 3 and 4).
   The recent studies performed by Lembi LOugas, Heidi Luik und Liina Maldre produced large amounts of new data and information on breeding strategies, the exploitation of animals and consumption patterns as well as on different social and technological aspects of craft production. Thus, the current Bronze Age research considers the Asva-type sites as key phenomena in the socio-economic developments in eastern Baltic's prehistory. This study is about completing the material culture studies and comparative analyses initiated by the aforementioned researchers (Lang et al.). In the course of the study, the archaeological groups of metalworking ceramics (moulds) and pottery emerged as illustrious 'materialised' sources of the social life and the economic activities, which allowed contributing to the discussion of the dynamics in the cultural development throughout the Bronze Age in the eastern Baltic region.
   It was the topic of metalwork production and the archaeological evidence in the Estonian Bronze Age settlement sites that offered great potential for developing and discussing the much debated problems of Bronze Age research (Chapter 7). This is first of all due to the peculiar and paradoxical scarcity of archaeologically recorded metal finds in the Bronze Age eastern Baltic, particularly in Estonia. This metal-scarce situation has traditionally been viewed in research from a metal-centred perspective and that of the metal-rich Nordic Bronze Age culture in southern Scandinavia, with countless bronze depositions in graves and hoards as obvious manifestations of social and religious acts. In the eastern Baltic only the Late Bronze Age saw a slight increase in archaeological finds related to metalwork, but hoards and graves containing bronzes remained seldom. Settlement sites of hill fort type emerged at that time, with about 25 of them revealing evidence of local bronze casting production. Since their discovery there has been no doubt about the adoption and utilisation of metalworking technology in this region; however, its impact on society and economy has been perceived fairly differently in research. While emphasis has generally been put on the social significance behind the introduction and the organisation of metalworking production (with socio-political implications of power and control), the technology aspect has been either neglected, underestimated or any advancements and skilled practice in bronze casting have been regarded as minimal However, in a kind of axiomatic way, and always ruled by the applied Nordic perspective, there has been a sort of pessimistic ('metal poor') view of the entire eastern region, namely that Bronze Age societies suffered from sporadic and poor metal supplies. In turn, the eastern Baltic has been perceived either as an economically retarded region or as socio-politically and culturally dependent on the Nordic Bronze Age sphere.
   This is where the ordering and analysing of the archaeological metalwork remains of the Estonian Bronze Age sites led to critically question this paradigmatic approach of overemphasising the socio-economic significance of metals in the study area. This also concerned the neglection of culturally regionally different depositional customs possibly distorting our image of past realities and bronze circulation. In any case, the study of a production place such as Asva leaves no doubt that metals were imported, processed and distributed (and utilised) in regular and fairly large amounts. It also became clear that the current state of research (and knowledge) does not allow yet drawing hasty conclusions about the level of technological and skilled practices in eastern Baltic metalwork. This also concerns the relationship between the bronzeworker and his environment and raises questions such as how cultural, social or religious aspects of the Bronze Age life might have affected any choices and selection of materials and resources in metal production. Thus, the material culture studies performed actually provide us with the insights necessary to assess the social significance and function of bronzes in past societies. Technological innovations as results of intercultural contact are another research issue that emerged from this material-immanent analysis and that is in need of being developed further.
   Part of Chapter 7 is dedicated to the question concerning the striking preference of casting rings (ingots?) in the eastern Baltic production places and in neighbouring regions. Because the dominance of ring-shaped clay moulds is highly visible in the casting debris it is assumed that these ring moulds might reflect an intended standardisation and commoditisation in the production and distribution of bronzes. It is furthermore assumed that the bronze rings served as multi-functional semiproducts that were commoditized valuables facilitating the exchange of agricultural products and livestock. However, as ring ingots they were of particular use and value for the metalworker, i.e. the person who was able to distinguish different material qualities in the processes of technical complexity such as alloying and melting that implied the manipulation of the metal's properties (malleability, colour, hardness, etc.). The ring object allowed easy fragmentation, division and portioning for the crucible melt, it simply fulfilled the requirements in the production process and in the distribution and exchange In practicing ring casting the settlements of Asva type seem indeed to represent a stage in the metallurgy cycle of re-melting and converting scrap bronzes and primary metals to 'ingots' in accordance with the custom and usage in the interregional metal exchange. The actual amounts of objects produced, the intensity and duration of bronze casting as well as the applied skill and expertise in metalwork technology are subject matters of further material studies.
   It has been acknowledged that in view of the economic foundations required for the import, exchange and production of metals, bronzework indeed points to a privileged or even elitist social craft activity, but not necessarily with the postulated implications of social power and control. In view of the social organisation of bronze casting the settlements of Asva and Ridala are remarkable examples of how production activities (not only metalwork) were subject to several social and economic units (households) within the settlement areas. In accordance with the various, apparently simultaneously existing production places, it appears that the major part of the community was actively involved in the complex and consuming processes of bronze casting (e.g. fabrication of moulds). It seems likely that there existed a multi-tiered organisation between the contributing craft persons, those with advanced skills and technological practice able to handle the demanding and complex melting and casting conditions such as air supply, heating procedure, determination of the melting point, etc. However, in consequence the social pattern behind metalwork craft in the Asva milieu appears to have been sort of 'democratised' and bronze casting still a matter of seasonally practised community specialisation. Asva is indeed a key site in the Bronze Age context (and beyond) when it comes to discussions of the social meaning of craft specialisation in theory and archaeological praxis, particularly because of many indications of standardisation in style, design and technique of objects, semi-products and implements related to craft and production. This concerns not only the finds related to metalwork production but also those of the bone and antler industry in the Asva milieu (see also Chapter 11).
   The Asva pottery makes up another big subject matter in the analysis of the archaeological settlement material (Chapter 8), where several morphological, technical and functional utilitarian criteria create a picture of the emergence of various coarse and fine ceramic ware and pottery types. The burnished and profiled bowls, some with handles, are distinctive of the Asva-type ceramics and enrich the range of eastern Baltic pottery groups. They also speak of an advanced technology of ceramic processing. Remarkably, the external influences highly visible in the bowls and their manufacture, design and use seem to have only affected the pottery that represents the sphere of eating and drinking customs, which quantitatively makes up only a minor part in the Asva-type pottery. The jars, food containers and/or cooking pots as the most numerous and homogeneous group (coarse ware pottery) are way less advanced in design and stylistic individuality, and also the creative effort invested in their manufacture seems somewhat restricted. The coarse ware pots, discernible by the shape of the neck and rim parts and particularly by the applied techniques of surface treatment (smoothed, striated or textile imprints) seem to be modest in terms of quality (ware, temper), but apparently sufficient for their usage. The coarse pots, constantly decorated with horizontal rows of pits pressed in neck or shoulder parts of the vessels, display a tradition of the Bronze an Early Iron Age pottery of the northeastern European forest zone and appear to have been resistant to any innovations or implementation of stylistic features. This speaks in favour of a behaviour in style and technique following strict conventions and rules, all manifesting a local pottery tradition where the jars were allowed only very restricted concessions to outside influences (rusticated surfaces, knobs, cordon applications).
   As it is likely that the fine as well as the coarse ware pottery in the settlements of Asva type was locally produced, presumably by both native potters and new arrivals in the community, the causes of this dichotomy have been discussed. First, it has been assumed that the fine ware bowls, showing distinct traits of a central European Urnfield culture milieu, that of the Late Bronze Age Lusatian tradition, might signify or express aspects of both personal use and social identity behind these dishes. The specific use of the Asva-type bowls and their possible (ritual?) contexts of utilisation have also been discussed, but it remains a subject matter to be cleared with further chemical analysis of organic residues (e.g. lipids). However, the dichotomy and exclusive application and combination of decorative elements (pit stamps or striation on jars and imprints of twisted bronze rings and burnish on bowls) were rooted in a cultural traditional disposition. These rules and conventions in regard to style and technique of ceramic work and function were perceived and communicated in the given Bronze Age society, and therefore keenly respected by the potters. That is why it has been assumed that both the persistence and the openness for innovation or implementation of foreign elements highly visible in these two ceramic groups of the Asva-type sites are the results of a collective and dualistic habitus, a phenomenon that has been described in socio-anthropological literature. Accordingly, the coarse pots and large bowls could be understood as complementary representatives of two realms: that of the inner, the domestic, and that of the outer, the public. The jars as multi-purpose vessels used for storage and preparation of food on the one hand, and the hanging and the cup-like bowls used to prepare and serve special liquids or ingredients on the other, seem to represent different spheres of closed and private household activities against 'exclusive' table and drinking manners (as open and communicative acts).
   Furthermore, the interconnection and coexistence of old and new elements in style and technique of the Asva-type pottery illustrate not only the integration of the coastal regions of western Estonia in a large interregional contact network, but also the complex ways and mechanisms in the transmission and diffusion of cultural stimuli and innovations eventually manifested in local ceramic groups (or style/culture provinces). The foreign characteristics and features on the bowls in the Asva pottery seem to be distributed in diverse and eclectic ways, with stylistic influences deriving from various geographical regions such as western and central Poland, southern and eastern Sweden and Gotland. In sum, these different, rather sporadic and changing directions of cultural influences and contacts give the Asva-type bowls an odd impression of a creolisation in style and technique. Their exclusive occurrence in the Estonian Late Bronze Age sites (Asva, Ridala, Kaali and Iru) only, while missing in Latvian and Lithuanian hill forts, and their sudden disappearance from the record with the decline of this very settlement type make them appear as evidence and symbols of social gestures.
   In the final conclusion the changes in society, economy and settlement in eastern Baltic Bronze Age have been discussed opposing the theories of the current re earch with the author's own material culture studies (Chapter 13). Places such as Asva, occurring in the Late Bronze Age on the archaeological map, do not only represent a new settlement type of permanent stationarity and centrality. Characteristic is the agrarian and maritime-based subsistence economy, complemented by various branches of secondary product processing and exclusive crafts (e.g. metalworking production). It has been asked whether the archaeologically studied settlements and the various production activities correspond to the postulates of sociopolitical relations determined by power and control based primarily on agriculture and metalwork. The Island of Saaremaa seems to reveal a slightly different, complex picture in comparison with hill forts of the eastern Baltic mainland: with Asva and complementary all-season activities, with hunting and fishing practices not only widening the range of subsistence practices. Particularly seal hunting and seasonality give reason to reassess the society relations and the settlement organisation behind this complex subsistence and craft production pattern. Both seasonality (i.e. climate and environmental aspects) and community specialisation (seal hunting strategies) need to be considered when applying theoretical concepts of hierarchisation and multi-tiered social organisation to the eastern Baltic Bronze Age cultural milieu, that is when implying chiefdom-like structures, elites or craft professionals.
   In dealing with the causes and factors of the societal change an attempt at an alternative explaination of the emergence of the Asva-type settlements against the neglected background of the role of seal hunting in Bronze Age settlement economy has been made. Accordingly, the maritime character of the studied sites on Saaremaa has been viewed from the perspective of seal exploitation as one of most eminent (marine) resources. The large percentage of seal bones among the rich osteological find material is undoubtedly a clear indicator of the extensive use and exploitation of seal products (blubber, leather). In any case, the subsistence of the Asva and Ridala hill forts was apparently not based on mixed farming and processing of secondary agrarian products alone like in the hill forts of the mainland. It seems also likely that seal populations and hunting grounds in southeastern Saaremaa (and the Gulf of Riga) have determined the location selection of the Bronze Age sites, particularly in a geographical landscape with limited, rather sporadic distribution of fertile soils (alvar or loo) for field cultivation and grazing cattle. Furthermore it has been hypothesised that settlements such as Asva and Ridala might have emerged from the fusion of conglomeratic, regionally dispersed single farms or households that might have constituted seasonal hunting sites. The merging and culmination of various economic and crafting activities and skills, the sort of communal and 'democratised' participation in exclusive crafts such as metalwork plus the versatile interregional cultural contacts and influences visible in the material culture are aspects and phenomena that could be understand from the perspective of community specialisation. Thus, the marine 'subsistence and the seasonal hunting trips to far regions in the Baltic following coastal routes could be the main determinant of the changing development in society and economy of Bronze Age Saaremaa. Not only the form of settlement organisation and the nature and complexity of social relations in community but also the character and the practice of a maritime settlement economy of Asva and its participation in the communication network of the Bronze Age Baltic Sea appear in a new light.
   This study provides a presentation, order and analysis of archaeological findings and contexts that are treated as representative, 'materialised' sources of social and economic activities and that are considered as significant for the understanding of the major cultural processes taking place in the local settlement milieu throughout the Late Bronze Age. With this material immanent approach applied to archaeological remains of an outstanding quality and informative value and in connection with current and forthcoming insights from archaeozoological and -botanical research we possibly will be able to reconstruct the basic conditions, actions and choices of Bronze Age communities when adapting to their environment. This all leads to discussing the possible causes and factors behind these societal changes primarily visible in the archaeological settlement milieu. However, in regard to the social patterns behind settlement economy and craft as well as the territorial use and perception of the surrounding landscape, many questions on the entire Estonian Bronze Age settlement phenomenon still remain to be answered.
   In any case, the Asva site has the potential of taking a key position in future Bronze Age research. The reason is the quality and spectrum of the archaeological material and the data and information available. Considering the excellent conditions of preservation of bone material, for instance, the current interdisciplinary methods of research provide a large set of applications and solutions in approaching the above-mentioned problems and subject matters of research. Some of the formulated questions and hypotheses in connection with the Bronze Age technologies and economic strategies are already subjects of current or applied research projects involving various archaeological subdisciplines (e.g. materials science, experiments, archaeobiology) and building up international research platforms. As the ongoing archaeological excavations at Asva (since 2012), in collaboration with Valter Lang and Lembi Lougas, reveal, a new stage of Bronze Age research in Estonia has already begun.

AB  - Iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO) are key enzymes that influence tissue-specific thyroid hormone levels during thyroid-mediated amphibian metamorphosis. Within the larger context of evaluating chemicals for thyroid system disrupting potential, chemical activity toward DIOs is being evaluated using high-throughput in vitro screening assays as part of U.S. EPA's ToxCast program. However, existing data gaps preclude any inferences between in vitro chemical inhibition of DIOs and in vivo outcomes relevant to ecological risk assessment. This study aimed to generate targeted data in a laboratory model species (Xenopus laevis) using a model DIO inhibitor, iopanoic acid (IOP), to characterize linkages between in vitro potency, in vivo biochemical responses, and adverse organismal outcomes. In vitro potency of IOP toward DIOs was evaluated using previously developed in vitro screening assays, which showed concentration-dependent inhibition of human DIO1 (IC50: 97 mu M) and DIO2 (IC50: 231 mu M) but did not inhibit human or X. laevis DIO3 under the assay conditions. In vivo exposure of larval X. laevis to 0, 2.6, 5.3, and 10.5 mu M IOP caused thyroid-related biochemical profiles in the thyroid gland and plasma consistent with hyperthyroxinemia but resulted in delayed metamorphosis and significantly reduced growth in the highest 2 exposure concentrations. Independent evaluations of dio gene expression ontogeny, together with existing literature, supported interpretation of IOP-mediated effects resulting in a proposed adverse outcome pathway for DIO2 inhibition leading to altered amphibian metamorphosis. This study highlights the types of mechanistic data needed to move toward predicting in vivo outcomes of regulatory concern from in vitro bioactivity data.

AB  - Prediction of bio-resilience in water resources such as rivers is important for better management of land-use systems and water resources. This study has proposed the use of artificial intelligent (AI) models for assessing the relationship among the biological conditions in Jajrood River. For this purpose, the qualitative monthly data of the river related to 2008-2018 were applied. Different resilience indicators for preparation of scenarios were determined using the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) method. Appropriate time-series scenarios (5scenarios) were modelled via Gene Expression Programming (GEP) plus Support Vector Machine (SVM), the bio-indicators were predicted. In order to reduce the error, the wavelet hybrids (W-GEP and W-SVM) were also used for modelling. Validation of the models was performed using Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). In all the models investigated, Scenario 3 and Scenario 4 had the highest and lowest accuracies as 0.98 and 0.33 in validation, respectively. The third scenario combined with NO3(-), BODt-1, BOD, PO3(-), and Q provided the best results. Then, the values of 0.98, 0.94, 0.82, and 0.78 were obtained for its validation by WSVM, WGEP, SVM, and GEP models, respectively. These findings suggested the superiority of hybrid models and SVM over classical models and GEP in water quality assessment respectively. Examination of the scenarios revealed that NO3- and DO had the highest and the lowest impact on Shannon index of Cyanophyceae algae over time, as a bio-indicator of water quality in the river, respectively.

Biomass ash is a waste obtained from thermal treatment of guishe (a by-product of natural fiber), and clay is collected from local soils. Several trials were performed to assess the influence of the addition of clay and guishe-ash on seeds germination, seedling growth, and production yield. The decrease in the values of these variables was considered an indicator of toxicity. The obtained results showed that based clay/ash materials positively affect germination (average similar to 90% and six materials allow obtaining 90%) and seedlings growth (an increase of similar to 20% in height and more than 50% in fresh air corpuscular weight). However, applying these materials on the production stage induces minor positive effects on fruit diameter, locule number, pericarp thickness, and the number of seeds per fruit. Also, adverse effects (first harvest yield, number of fruits, fresh mass of ripe fruits, lycopene content) were observed. To valorize biomass ash, its combination with other materials such as clay could be an alternative to improve tomato production.
   Novelty statement The concern to attend the growing demand for food has promoted the use of different kinds of materials as enhancers of plant growth and crop productivity. Among the materials that have been applied in crops are the wastes of biomass thermochemical processes, such as biochar and ashes. This work highlights the importance of evaluating the effect of applying a residue (guishe-ash) to a crop before promoting its use.

AB  - Olea europaea L. is a crop typical of the Mediterranean area that has an important role in economy, society, and culture of this region. Climate change is expected to have significant impact on this crop, which is typically adapted to certain pedo-climatic characteristics of restricted geographic areas. In this scenario, the aim of this study was to evaluate the time-course response of pollen viability to different combinations of temperature and humidity. The study was performed comparing flowering time and pollen functionality of O. europaea from twelve cultivars growing at the same site belonging to the Campania olive collection in Italy. Pollen was incubated at 12 degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 36 degrees C in combination with 50% RH or 100% RH treatments for 5 days. The results highlighted that a drastic loss of pollen viability occurs when pollen is subjected to a combination of high humidity and high temperature, whereas 50% RH had less impact on pollen thermotolerance, because most cultivars preserved a high pollen viability over time. In the ongoing climate change scenario, it is critical to assess the effect of increasing temperatures on sensitive reproductive traits such as pollen viability to predict possible reduction in crop yield. Moreover, the results highlighted that the effect of temperature increase on pollen thermotolerance should be evaluated in combination with other environmental factors such as humidity conditions. The screening of olive cultivars based on pollen thermotolerance is critical in the ongoing climate change scenario, especially considering that the economic value of this species relies on successful fertilization and embryo development, and also that production cycle of Olea europaea can be longer than a hundred years.

AB  - The issue tending toward alternative water resources tremendously becomes important for supplying the increasing water demand all over the world. It may be a good option to evaluate industrial effluents for agricultural irrigation. However, industrial effluent must be cleansed from the factors such as salt, toxic compounds, and microbial load that possibly cause negative effects on soil during agricultural irrigation. In this study, microbiological qualities and toxicity conditions of water sources such as membrane bioreactor (MBR) influent, MBR effluent, and mixture of MBR effluent and reverse osmosis (RO) permeate (MBR:RO = 2:1) were analyzed and evaluated according to irrigation standards. Total aerobic heterotrophic bacteria (TAHB), total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), fecal streptococci (FS), and Clostridium spp. were screened and enumerated as indicator microbial groups for the microbial quality of water samples. Analyses of indicator microorganisms showed that loads of different bacterial groups decreased by 5.2 and 6.66 log units at maximum levels in MBR and MBR + RO system at the end of treatment. Also, evaluation of the toxicity effects of MBR effluent and MBR + RO permeate waters on Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna was investigated. None of the samples showed any acute toxic effect on D. magna after 48 h and V. fischeri in 5 min and 15 min. From the outputs of this study, it can be said that industrial effluents treated by advanced filtration technologies may provide a significant source of water for agricultural irrigation. This option can have positive impacts on both environmental and economic factors.

AB  - The physical properties of lipids, such as viscosity, are homeostatically maintained in cells and are intimately involved in physiological roles. Measurement of the physical properties of plasma membranes has been achieved primarily through chemical or genetically encoded fluorescent probes. However, since most probes target plasma membranes, physical properties of lipids in intracellular organelles, including lipid droplets (LDs) are yet to be analyzed. Here, we present a novel Raman microscopy-based approach for quantifying the physical properties of intracellular lipids under deuterium-labeled fatty acid treatment conditions. Focusing on the fact that Raman spectra of carbon-deuterium vibration are altered depending on the surrounding lipid species, we quantitatively represented the physical properties of lipids as the gauche/trans conformational ratio of the introduced labeled fatty acids, which can be used as an indicator of viscosity. Intracellular Raman imaging revealed that the gauche/trans ratio of cytosolic regions was robustly preserved against perturbations attempting to alter the lipid composition. This was likely due to LDs functioning as a buffer against excess gauche/trans ratio, beyond its traditional role as an energy storage organelle. Our novel approach enables the observation of the physical properties of organelle lipids, which is difficult to perform with conventional probes, and is useful for quantitative assessment of the subcellular lipid environment.
   Uematsu and Shimizu use Raman spectroscopy to quantify changes in the physical properties of lipid droplets (LDs) and in non-LD cell regions associated with alterations in saturated and unsaturated fatty acid availability in culture medium. Their results suggest that Raman spectroscopy can yield a quantitative measurement of changes in lipid conformation and can quantify trans / gauche ratios in lipid chains.

AB  - Searching for the associations between the gene polymorphism and the reproductive traits is essential in defining the genetic native breed specificity, which distinguishes them from the other breeds. The aim of our study was to determine the associations between mutations in the PRL, PRLR, PTGS2, FUT1 genes and sexual and periparturient activity in native Pulawska gilts. The analysis included 72 animals which gave birth to the first litter. Evaluation of the productive value of gilts accounted for indicators of sexual and periparturient activity as well as reproductive traits. The biological material for molecular analyses was obtained from the hair roots of the gilts. The genotype was verified by PCR RELP analysis. The primers and PCR conditions were determined on the basis of available literature data. Statistically significant differences (P <= 0.05) were found at the PRL locus: gilts of AA genotypes (Ins/Ins) at the PRL locus were characterised by longest farrowing duration compared to gilts of AB genotype (P <= 0.05). The analysis of PRLR gene showed that gilts of TT genotype revealed a tendency for later occurrence of estrus signs (first and second estrus) and for the markedly longest farrowings (P <= 0.05). With regard to PTGS2 and FUT1 loci, no significant differences were found in the parameters of sexual and periparturient activity of the gilts. However, gilts of FUT1 GG genotype gave birth to and reared the largest first litters (P <= 0.05). The results of the studies expand the knowledge about the genetic structure and productivity of Pulawska gilts.

AB  - With the depletion of traditional energy resources, the share of heavy-oil production has been increasing recently. According to some estimates, their reserves account for 80% of the world's oil resources. Costs for extraction of heavy oil and natural bitumen are 3-4 times higher than the costs of extracting light oil, which is due not only to higher density and viscosity indicators but also to insufficient development of equipment and technologies for the extraction, transportation, and processing of such oils. Currently, a single pipeline system is used to pump both light and heavy oil. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the features of the heavy-oil pumping mode. This paper presents mathematical models of heavy-oil flow in oil-field pipelines. The rheological properties of several heavy-oil samples were determined by experiments. The dependencies obtained were used as input data for a simulation model using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. The modeling condition investigates the range of shear rates up to 300 s(-1). At the same time, results up to 30 s(-1) are considered in the developed computational models. The methodology of the research is, thus, based on a CFD approach with experimental confirmation of the results obtained. The proposed rheological flow model for heavy oil reflects the dynamics of the internal structural transformation during petroleum transportation. The validity of the model is confirmed by a comparison between the theoretical and the obtained experimental results. The results of the conducted research can be considered during the selection of heavy-oil treatment techniques for its efficient transportation.

AB  - The consistency of the Minus-One Element Technique (MOET) soil test kit results were evaluated/compared against the Nutrient Omission Plot Technique (NOPT) from 2017 to 2018 and against laboratory analysis for soil NPK levels in 2019. A MOET pot setup for -N, -P, -K and -S were established inside NOPT field setups according to the same targeted nutrients for a homogeneous exposure of the test plants to field environmental conditions. The field experiment was laid-out in split-plot RCBD replicated four times with varietal maturity as main plot and omitted nutrient as sub-plots. In 2019, soil samples from 12 different sites were used for a MOET test and were subjected to laboratory analysis for soil NPK content for comparison. Agronomic parameters from the MOET test setups were also collected to evaluate a potential substitute for the MOET kit's prescribed procedure of using biomass for nutrient deficiency assessment. Even though biomass is the best indicator of growth, measuring it at the farmers' level is often difficult due to lack of weighing devices hence, a need for a substitute parameter. Results of the 30-45 d biomass between MOET and NOPT setups showed strong linear correlations per nutrient and by cropping seasons (i.e. DS or WS) indicating capability of the MOET to substitute NOPT for soil nutrient assessment. Laboratory results on the other hand were not totally consistent with the MOET test kit results particularly for nutrients P and K resulting to only 89% overall consistency. While consistency of using other agronomic parameters from a MOET test for deficiency analysis showed that leaf count can be a potential alternative to biomass of the test plants as the former does not require sensitive weighing devices for measurement.

AB  - In many aquatic species, the negative effect of temperature variations has a significant impact on physiological performance since beyond Tp (upper pejus) and Tc (critical temperatures), according to the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT), transition to hypoxemia and mitochondrial metabolism triggers the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, climate change may have different spatial impact, and as a result, areas with more favorable climatic conditions (refugia) can be identified. The aim of the present study, based on cellular stress responses, is the demarcation of these areas and the preservation of commercially important marine species. Under this prism, individuals of the species Callinectes sapidus (blue crab), Sepia officinalis (common cuttlefish), Holothuria tubulosa (sea cucumber) and Venus verrucosa (clam) from Thermaikos, Pagasitikos and Vistonikos gulf were collected seasonally. The results showed an increase in the levels of several stress indicators exhibiting the triggering of Heat Shock Response, MAPK activation, apoptotic phenomena and increased ubiquitilination during the summer sampling in relation to the spring and autumn samplings concerning blue crab and clam, while no changes were observed for common cuttlefish and sea cucumber. It seems that these cellular responses consist a cytoprotective mechanism against environmental thermal stress. Regarding collection sites, for all examined species, higher cellular stress levels were observed in Pagasitikos, and lower in Vistonikos gulf. This analysis of biochemical and molecular markers is expected to provide a clearer picture for the definition of "refugia" for the above species.

AB  - The article studies the variability of a data group formed from indicators of the agricultural sector of the economy of Kazakhstan, using one of the methods of reducing dimensionality as a factor analysis. The data of 1993-2018, i.e. for 26 years. The analysis included: a) indicators of GDP - the agrarian sector of the economy as a whole and by crop and livestock industries; b) indicators of productivity and gross harvest by type of crop. Statistical processing of the source data was performed using the STATISTICA _10 software package. The results of statistical processing of primary data - GDP indicators: a) fluctuations in GDP data, estimated by the coefficient of variation, were in the range of 65-67%; b) according to the values of pair correlation coefficients (0,97 ... 0,99), it can be argued that the considered GDP indicators are interdependent variables with a close correlation. It was found that almost 90% of the variance of the variables, estimated by their total dispersion, is a consequence of the influence of the three identified factors. The first factor explaining the variability of the main part of the variables, in our opinion, can be taken as the "specific gravity" of the influence of natural and climatic conditions. Close correlation relationships have been established (correlation coefficients from -0,72 to -0,96) between the first factor and all variables of the "productivity" group. The influence of the first factor is also noticeable in relation to GDP indicators, this can be judged by the values of the correlation coefficients: -0,85; -0,85; -0,85. Other identified factors show the level of influence of other objective reasons that are not yet amenable to logical explanation.

AB  - Backsheet cracking has been a major issue observed in the field; however, standardized qualification tests, such as IEC61215, are inadequate to reliably identify such failures of PV modules due to the lack of the critical weathering factors applied sequentially or in combination, such as those found in the service environments. To address this problem, we investigated the effects of various environmental variables on the degradation and failure behaviors of the polyamide-based backsheet in PV modules retrieved from five different locations, encompassing a variety of climates, including humid subtropical, hot-summer Mediterranean, tropical savanna climate and hot arid. The correlations between the degradation indicators and the weathering variables were further demonstrated by principle components analysis (PCA). We found strong relationships between: carbonyl formation and reflected solar radiation; hydroxyl formation and module temperature; yellowness and NO2 concentration, while no simple correlation could be found between a specific weathering factor and cracking. By introducing additional stress factors to the aged polyamide-based backsheet films with the novel "fragmentation test", we successfully reproduced the field cracking behaviour. This study has demonstrated that different degradation modes of PV components respond differently to the environmental stresses encountered in service. Thereby, any accelerated laboratory test based on a single set condition or lacking key environmental variables would be inadequate to assess the long-term performance of PV modules and components. A new reliability-based methodology is proposed to quantitatively link laboratory testing with field results for the service life prediction of PV materials.

AB  - The influence of the fertilization level and soil type on the energy efficiency of the biogas production from maize, sorghum and reed canary grass silages were studied in this work. The plant material used to prepare silages was obtained from the experimental field with light, medium and good soil. High yields of biogas were obtained from maize silage with the lowest fertilization level of 80 kg N ha(-1) from 194.5 up to 315.33 m(3) t(-1) green mass (g.m.) depending on soil quality. The highest biogas yields of sorghum and reed canary grass were lower (about 120 m(3) t(-1) g.m.) than that for maize. Depending on the soil type, the Energy Return on Energy Investment index (ERoEI) and the Net Energy Value (NEV) values for maize ranged from 5.05 and 189 000 MJ ha(-1) (light soil), obtained at the level of 120 kg N ha(-1) to 9.76 obtained at the level of 80 kg N ha(-1) and 433 000 MJ ha(-1) at the level of 120 kg N ha(-1) (good soil). For sorghum (light soil) values of about 5.2 and 200 000 MJ ha(-1) were appropriately obtained at the level of 160 kg N ha(-1). In the case of reed canary grass the highest ERoEI and NEV values obtained at the level of 80 kg N ha(-1) amounted to 3.8 and 74 000 MJ ha(-1) (light soil), respectively. The investigations indicate that in general, the production technologies of crops where the low levels of nitrogen fertilization were applied proved to have the highest energy efficiency.

AB  - A new tablet form of biologically active food supplement for the multifactorial support of the central nervous system has been developed. It is named Supplement The supplement production technology prevents ingredients oxidative processes due to insignificant moisture content and exclusion of the active oxygen exposure. The biologically active complex facilitates memory retention and information retrieval, accelerates thinking process, and boosts the level of the overall energy potential by improving the central nervous system activity. A balanced combination of active substances (schisandra chinensis, ginkgo biloba) and sedative herbal components (valeriana, motherwort) allows achieving "fine tuning" effect when the above mentioned components act in the best way. These ingredients improve nerve tissue trophism, brain vessels tone, venous outflow and prevent hypertension. Essential and dispensable amino acids in the complex, such as tryptophan, glycine, tyrosine and glutamic acid, make it possible to control neuromediators synthesis and the molecular basis of memory, optimize carbohydrate-fat metabolism, accelerate the process of impulse transmission along the nerve fiber, while avoiding overexcitement. Most of the amino acids in the food supplement have antidepressant effect. Paraaminobenzoic acid reduces mental and physical fatigue and prevents hypoxia in the central nervous system. Another complex ingredient, Inositol, is one of the main nutrient components of the nerve tissue which contributes to its structure restoration. Group B vitamins help replenish energy and ensure its maximum use by the nerve tissue. The paper provides regulated indicators of the nutritional value of a specialized medical product that determine its functional properties. Efficacy was confirmed by clinical trials on a group of patients with angioneurosis. The authors demonstrated hygienic security of the developed product, its shelf life and storage conditions. They also conducted its production testing.

AB  - Increasing urbanisation is altering the physiology of wild animals and the mechanisms involved are largely unknown. We hypothesised that altering the physiology of urban organisms is due to the effect of extra light at night on the circadian clock by modulating the expression of pineal machinery and clock genes. Two experiments were performed. In Experiment 1, immediately after being procured from their respective sites (urban and rural sites), birds were released individually in LLdim light conditions. Circadian rhythm period, activity duration, and total activity count were calculated and did not differ between urban and rural birds. In Experiment 2, birds (from urban and rural habitats) were sampled at six time points at regular 4-h intervals, beginning 1 h after sunrise. We measured daily variations in plasma melatonin levels. We also analysed the expression levels of Aanat, Mel1A and Mel1B as an indicator of melatonin biosynthesis and action machinery. Clock and clock-controlled genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per2, Per3, Cry1 and Npas2) were studied in the hypothalamus, the pineal gland, and retina to investigate the effects of urban habitats on the circadian clock. Our results show that there is a lower expression of Aanat in the pineal gland and relatively low plasma melatonin levels in urban birds. Further, clock genes are also differentially expressed in all three central tissues of urban birds. We propose that alterations in the melatonin biosynthesis machinery and the expression of clock genes could result in miscalculations in the internal timing of the organism, with environmental timings leading to altered physiology in urban wild animals.

AB  - The early Silurian Qusaiba Shales are proven source rocks of the many Paleozoic petroleum systems of Saudi Arabia. In this study, a new, simple and cost-effective method for semi-quantitative analysis and graphical representation of palynological assemblage composition (PZC Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Cryptospore ternary diagram) and a new visual thermal alteration index (IPA-TAI Integrated Palynomorph-Amorphous organic matter Thermal Alteration Index) integrating amorphous organic matter and palynomorph color, were developed based on the palynological/palynofacies analysis of some selected wells penetrating the early Silurian Qusaiba Shales throughout Saudi Arabia. The methods were tested against independent paleoenvironmental and thermal maturity indicators mainly based on geochemical parameters, confirming their validity as effective alternative methods for optical kerogen analysis and interpretation. The thermal maturity values estimated for core samples in the Qusaiba Shales from 13 wells in Saudi Arabia showed a strong correlation with Vitrinite Reflectance Equivalent (VRE%) maturity values determined from graptolite reflectance and pyrolysis Tmax measurements in the entire range of maturities (immature to overmature stages), proving that the present visual thermal alteration index can be successfully employed as a time efficient and reliable method for estimating thermal maturity in the Qusaiba Shales of Saudi Arabia. The present results show that the Qusaiba Shales were deposited in mostly mid- to outer shelf, and occasionally nearshore marine environments under prevailing dysoxic and anoxic water conditions, resulting in accumulation and preservation of organic matter.

AB  - Sexual signals serve as an honest indicator of individual quality, reflecting either developmental and/or maintenance costs. A possible underlying physiological mechanism is oxidative stress, which could mediate energy trade-offs between sexual signals and other quality traits. In ectotherms, thermal performance acts as a key indicator of individual quality and influence signal intensity. We investigated how oxidative state is reflected in visual signals of lizards from different thermal habitats. According to our hypothesis, efficient thermoregulation requires different strategies in different thermal environments. In a habitat with predictable temperature changes, animals are less exposed to suboptimal temperature ranges and selection will, therefore, be stronger on the maximum oxidative damage at optimal body temperature. Contrarily, in a habitat with rather stochastic thermal shifts, individuals are often constricted by suboptimal thermal conditions, and oxidative damage can be limiting on a wide temperature range. We used Iberolacerta cyreni and Psammodromus algirus inhabiting stochastic and predictable thermal environments respectively. We examined two aspects of oxidative stress: the level of reactive oxygen metabolites at the preferred temperature (maximal ROM) and the temperature range in which animals produce at least 80% of the maximum level of reactive oxygen metabolites (effective ROM range). In I. cyreni, we found that duller coloration was related to a wider effective ROM range, while expression of coloration in P. algirus was negatively correlated with the maximal ROM. Our results suggest that different thermal constraints affect different aspects of oxidative damage which can indicate individual quality and are, therefore, represented in sexual ornaments.

AB  - The influence of biological and physicochemical soil properties on the variations in soil organic and inorganic carbon (OC and IC) contents at the soil surface was studied. Three-dimensional plots of variations in OC, IC and the correlated properties were obtained. Soils of the study area were classified as Aridisols and Entisols used as a rangeland. Soil samples were collected from 38 representative points with a wide range of physicochemical soil properties; in addition, three important microbiological indicators-dehydrogenase enzyme activity (DHA), soil basal respiration, and bacterial population-were analyzed. Variation partitioning analysis was carried out to assess the determining factors influencing soil OC and IC variations in soil surface. Additionally, the principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to explore the patterns of determinant soil variables. Variation partitioning demonstrated that the physicochemical soil properties were the determining variables in explaining the variations of both OC and IC. A remarkable portion of the variations remained unexplained by any of the two explanatory sets according to this analysis. Soil OC was not significantly related to the biological soil properties. Soil OC was inversely related to IC, clay, and sodium contents in the soil profiles. Soil type-specific vertical trends were observed for soil OC and IC. Soil conditions and pedogenic processes were deduced to have a major role in OC and IC spatial variations according to the results of soil type-specific trends of variation. The results of this study can be useful for better soil management and OC and IC prediction, or spatial distribution patterns modeling.

AB  - Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis is one of the most powerful and widely used techniques to study the effect of stresses on the photosynthetic process. From the first utilization, the F-v/F-m ratio has been largely used as a sensitive indicator of plant photosynthetic performance. Decreases of this index are indicative of the reduction of photosystem II (PSII) efficiency, namely photoinhibition. In the last 20 years, application of chlorophyll fluorescence has been largely improved, and many other informative parameters have been established to detect PSII photochemical efficiency and the partitioning of light energy to alternative dissipative mechanisms (qE, energy-dependent quenching; qZ, zeaxanthin-dependent quenching and qI, photoinhibitory quenching; qH, sustained photoprotective antenna quenching; qM, quenching dependent to chloroplast movement; qT, light harvesting complexes II-I state-transition) such as the recently developed "photoprotective power" of non-photochemical quenching (pNPQ). This review reports a brief description of the main chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and a wide analysis of the current bibliography on the use of different parameters which are useful to detect events of PSII photoinhibition. In addition, in view of the inherent differences in morpho-anatomical, physiological and biochemical features between C3 and C4 metabolism, possible differences in terms of photoinhibition between C3 and C4 plant species under stress conditions are proposed. The attempt is to highlight the limits of their comparison in terms of susceptibility to photoinhibition and to propose direction of future research which, assisted by chlorophyll fluorescence, should improve the knowledge of the different sensitivity of C3 and C4 to abiotic stressors.

As such, evacuation planning is an essential part of the natural hazard preparedness, especially in hazard-prone areas. Numerous research efforts have been directed towards improving the efficiency of the evacuation process. However, only a limited number of studies have specifically aimed to identify factors, influencing the driving ability of individuals under emergency evacuation and the occurrence of crashes along the evacuation routes. Furthermore, previous research efforts have focused on a relatively narrow range of factors (primarily driver and traffic flow characteristics). This study aims to fill the existing gap in the state-of-the-art by investigating the effects of a wide range of different factors (including driver characteristics, evacuation route characteristics, driving conditions, and traffic characteristics) on the major driving performance indicators under emergency evacuation. The considered driving performance indicators include travel time, lane deviation, crash occurrence, collision speed, average acceleration pedal pressure, and average braking pedal pressure. A set of statistical models is developed to identify the most significant factors that influence the major driving performance indicators. These models are tested using the data collected from the driving simulator and participants with various socio-demographic characteristics. The results indicate that age, gender, visual disorders, number of lanes, and space headway may substantially impact the driving ability of individuals throughout the emergency evacuation process. Findings from this research can be incorporated within the existing transportation planning models to facilitate the natural hazard preparedness, ensure safety of evacuees, including vulnerable populations, and reduce or even prevent the occurrence of crashes along the evacuation routes.

AB  - Eco-industrial Parks (EIP) have become a central element in China's industrial strategy to combine industrial development while minimizing environmental impacts and improving resource efficiency. National standard system has been developed as a main tool for assessing EIPs. This paper provides a review of the development of China's EIP standard system. The focus of the analysis is the new national demonstration EIP standard (HJ/T274-2015), including a review of calculation methods for some key indicators. The analysis also provides a comparison with previous standards to identify the main changes and improvements in the assessment of EIPs. Comparison findings illustrate that the new standard provides a more consistent indicator system by providing a consolidated standard system, and offering more comprehensive and quantitative indicators. Moreover, the new standard aims to better manage environmental issues by supplementing more comprehensive environmental indicators. The standard also strengthens the emphasis of the industrial symbiosis dimension in the evaluation of EIPs. By offering optional indicators and giving distinct targets based on contextual conditions for a number of indicators, the flexibility and rationality of the EIP assessments are also enhanced. Although many positive changes have been identified, there are still some shortcomings exist in the new EIP standard. The paper proposes a number of recommendations based on analyzing shortcomings, for instance further improving of the industrial symbiosis indicators, offering social benefit evaluation indicators, and strengthening the reduction action evaluation. China's experience of setting EIP standards and indicators may provide lessons for other countries' attempts to develop industrial estate indicators. In order to observe and effectively promote industrial estates at the global range, several remaining research questions that need further exploration are put forward in this study.

AB  - The era of free market and the more dynamic environment condition forces many companies to establish the proper strategy. Implementation of a correct strategy can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the use of the company resources. The system of measuring performance is one of models used to monitor the success of implementing objective strategy which has been determined by the leader of the company, including SME (small-medium enterprise). However, a lot of SME do not have clear vision and strategy. It is because the SME orientation only focuses on more dominant operational performance. Therefore, smart system can be used to arrange a parameter of performance measurement. AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) is used to determine the priority from each criterion from KPI (Key Performance Indicator). Knowing the proper need, the company can determine the priority to select if the company has limited fund and resources. Moreover, the assessment system used in this research uses OMAX (Objective Matrix) method for each KPI. To assess, the measurement uses the concept of traffic light system using 3 colors: green (achieving a target), yellow (close with the target), and red (far from target). Nevertheless, this KPI needs to get attention in the next period. The research observes 3 SMEs located in Krebet tourism village. They are SME Ragil Handicraft, SME Sanggar Punokawan and SME Yuan art. The result shows that there are 31 keys performance indicators (KPI) used to measure the performance of SME. The assessment result of OMAX shows that there are still a lot of KPIs with red color. Thus, they need to be repaired. Knowing the performance of SME still far from target (red), the sources of the problem can be identified, so that the reparation target done by SME is more appropriate.

AB  - Carbon dioxide has been found to produce various negative consequences for a number of aquatic species and is projected to rise in the future for many aquatic ecosystems. Crayfish act as indicators of water quality and function as keystone species in aquatic food webs; however, there is a paucity of research on how crayfish may respond to elevated CO2. This study quantified how shelter-seeking behavior in freshwater crayfish (e.g., family Cambaridae), a behavior critical for survival and fitness, may change following exposure to elevated pCO(2). Red Swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii, Girard, 1852) were exposed to one of three potential levels of dissolved CO2 that could be found in freshwater basins currently or under future climate change conditions: Control (< 100 mu atm), Low (6853 +/- 1206 mu atm), and High (19,086 +/- 2043 mu atm) for 8 days, and were then transferred to a treatment aquarium with the same CO2 levels as the respective initial exposure. The treatment aquarium contained a shelter and was divided into three equal sections based on proximity to that shelter. Crayfish proximity to the shelter (defined by the tank sections) in the treatment aquarium was monitored every 5 s for a 2-min trial. Crayfish spent differing amounts of time in differing zones of the experiment and had different levels of activity, depending on their pCO(2) exposure; crayfish acclimated to High pCO(2) increased their time spent hiding and decreased their overall activity when compared to the Low pCO(2) and Control treatments. Augmented shelter-seeking behavior may affect crayfish social hierarchies, feeding, mating, and mortality, which could generate cascading effects on the ecology of many freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Bauxite residues are a by-product of alumina manufacture from bauxite ore and are commonly disposed of in purpose-built bauxite residue disposal areas (BRDAs). Revegetation is viewed as the most effective way to landscape and rehabilitate closed BRDAS and physicochemical assessment remains the primary indicator of rehabilitation success. Little is known about the ability of keystone mesofaunal species to colonise and establish in these environments yet the long-term success of rehabilitation is dependent on residues becoming suitable habitats for such groups. Using six different residue treatments (untreated, leached, organic application, organic amended, and two revegetated field treatments) together with OECD test soil, this study assessed the characteristics of residues with plant germination and seedling development using the Rhizotest (TM) approach with Lepidium sativum, Sinapis alba, and Sorghum bicolor. Avoidance tests with soil mesofauna Eisenia foetida together with growth and reproduction tests for Folsomia candida were conducted to determine possibility of inhibition in residue soils. Unamended residue is inhibitory to plant growth and mesofaunal establishment. Amendment improves the physicochemical properties of the residue, and data revealed that both gypsum and organic addition is required to promote conditions favourable to plant growth and mesofauna establishment. Earthworms avoid residues with elevated Na content but will choose substrate with high soluble Ca content. F. candida preferentially moves to residues from field treatments, and both mortality and reproduction rates are comparable or superior to OECD soil. On the basis of these assays, we propose that bauxite residue can be transformed to a soil-like medium capable of supporting keystone species.

AB  - The presence of monoamines and their cofactors (the pterins and vitamin B-6 (pyridoxal phosphate (PLPPLPPLP))) in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSCSF) can be used as indicators of the biosynthesis and turnover of dopamine and serotonin in the brain. In addition, abnormalities in the CSCSF levels of these molecules are associated with various neurological diseases, including genetic diseases leading to dopamine and serotonin deficiency. Here, we provide a set of quantitative high-performance liquid-chromatography (HPLCPLCPLC) approaches to determine CSCSF levels of monoamines and their cofactors. This protocol describes step-by-step procedures for CSCSF sample preparation for the analysis of different molecules, HPLCPLCPLC calibration and analysis, and data quantification and interpretation. Unlike plasma/tissue/blood samples, CSCSF requires minimal sample preparation: in this protocol, only the analysis of PLPPLPPLP requires mixing with trichloroacetic acid to release the protein-bound vitamin, centrifugation, and mixing of the supernatant with phosphate buffer and sodium cyanide for derivatization in alkaline conditions. Monoamines are analyzed by HPLCPLCPLC with coulometric electrochemical detection (ED), pterins are analyzed by HPLCPLCPLC with coupled coulometric electrochemical and fluorescence detection, and PLPPLPPLP is analyzed by HPLCPLCPLC with fluorescence detection. The quantification of all compounds is achieved by external calibration procedures, and internal quality control and standards are analyzed in each run. We anticipate that investigation of dopamine and serotonin disturbances will be facilitated by measurements of these compounds in human CSCSF and other biological samples. The estimated time for the different procedures primarily depends on the electrochemical detector stabilization. Overnight stabilization of this detector is advised, and, after that step, preanalytical equilibration rarely exceeds 3 h.

AB  - Maternal effects and larval experience are considered the most important sources of variability in offspring phenotypes in marine invertebrates. Maternal provisioning during oogenesis is the first of a series of processes that will ultimately affect offspring phenotype and population dynamics. The keystone species of several European estuarine environments, Carcinus maenas, was used as a model to analyse the effect of female size and reproductive season on the fatty acid (FA) profile of newly extruded (stage 1) and ready-to-hatch (stage 3) embryos, as proxies for maternal investment and quality of newly hatched larvae, respectively. A total of 60 ovigerous females of two different sizes (carapace width [CW]: small CW <40 mm; large CW >= 40 mm) from Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) were sampled during three different reproductive periods: early reproductive season (ERS, late March/early April) 2012, ERS-2013 and late reproductive season (LRS; July) 2013. Maternal size was not a reliable indicator of maternal provision or larval quality at hatching. The inter-annual comparison (ERS-2012 vs. ERS-2013) revealed that the FA profile of stage 3 embryos was likely shaped by environmental conditions in the coastal lagoon during incubation. The seasonal comparison (ERS-2013 vs. LRS-2013) showed that embryos in the LRS had higher quality lipid content than embryos in the ERS, suggesting an increase of energetic reserves destined for reproduction in females in the LRS. Studies on maternal investment that overlook temporal variability should be interpreted with caution, especially in species inhabiting highly dynamic environments such as coastal lagoons and estuaries.

AB  - Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common pediatric conditions worldwide. Peak age of occurrence for AOM has been identified within the first postnatal year and it remains frequent until approximately six postnatal years. Morphological differences between adults and infants in the cartilaginous Eustachian tube (CET) and associated structures may be responsible for development of this disease yet few have investigated normal growth trajectories. We tested hypotheses on coincidence of skeletal growth changes and known ages of peak AOM occurrence. Growth was divided into five dental eruption stages ranging from edentulous neonates (Stage 1) to adults with erupted third maxillary molars (Stage 5). A total of 32 three-dimensional landmarks were used and Generalized Procrustes Analysis was performed. Next, we performed principal components analysis and calculated univariate measures. It was found that growth change in Stage 1 was the most rapid and comprised the largest amount of overall growth in upper respiratory tract proportions (where time is represented by the natural logarithmic transformation of centroid size). The analysis of univariate measures showed that Stage 1 humans did indeed possess the relatively shortest and most horizontally oriented CET's with the greatest amount of growth change occurring at the transition to Stage 2 (eruption of deciduous dentition at five postnatal months, commencing peak AOM incidence) and ceasing by Stage 3 (approximately six postnatal years). Skeletal indicators appear related to peak ages of AOM incidence and may contribute to understanding of a nearly ubiquitous human disease. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Although sufficient and equitable access to urban green represents a key aspect for adequate living conditions and a healthy environment in urban areas, national studies investigating the provision of urban green on household and individual level are scarce. We present a study investigating access to urban green space and environmental inequalities in German major cities by merging geo-coded household data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and Census Population Data with land use data from the European Urban Atlas (EUA). The results indicate that 92.8% of the German population has access to green space within a 500 m around the place of residence. On average an individual in German major cities lives in a distance of 183 m to the nearest green space and has access to 4.4 ha urban green within a 500 m buffer and the average green space provision per capita amounts to 8.1 m(2). We also identify strong disparities in green space provision on city level ranging from 2.5 m(2) per capita (city of Schwerin) to 36.3 m(2) (city of Bergisch Gladbach) within 500 m buffer around the place of residence. We further identify inequalities in green space provision across German major cities by applying the Gini coefficient. Statistical analysis of the socio-economic background of households and individuals shows differences in urban green provision related to income, age, education and children in household. The findings provide helpful information for policy and planning to ensure an adequate green space provision and to eliminate environmental inequalities in Germany.

AB  - Environmental variables influence Faecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) in surface water. Understanding that influence is important, because presence of FIB, which are an indication of faecal contamination, means that harmful pathogens could be present that could also be influenced by environmental variables. Although some recent studies have focused on this topic, most of this work has been conducted in developed countries. Similar studies in developing countries and in a (sub) tropical climate are lacking. In this study we assess the influence of environmental variables on fluctuations in FIB concentrations of the Betna River in southwest Bangladesh that floods almost every year. Monthly water samples from five locations along Betna River were tested for FIB (E. coli and enterococci) in 2014-2015. A linear regression model was developed to assess the effect of the environmental variables on FIB concentrations. The study revealed increased FIB concentrations during wet weather conditions. Precipitation and water temperature were positively correlated with FIB concentrations. Water temperature was positively correlated, because the warm May to September period coincides with frequent precipitation. Precipitation increases manure release from land to surface water. The regression model explains nearly half of the variability in FIB concentrations (R-2 of 0.46 for E. coli and 0.48 for enterococci). This study indicates that increased precipitation combined with higher water temperature, as is expected in this region with climate change, likely increases FIB concentrations. Waterborne pathogens are expected to respond similarly to these environmental changes, indicating that disease outbreaks could well become more frequent and severe.

AB  - Salt is a major environmental stress to plant growth and productivity in tomato. Sensing salt stress is important to evaluate the degree of damage and the change in physiological condition in tomato plants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the salt stress in leaves and fruits in tomato using the chlorophyll a fluorescence OJIP transients (OJIP transients). Tomato plants were grown under various levels of salt stress (25, 50, 75, and 100 mM NaCI), following whichwe measured leaf stress indicators and OJIP transients in leaves and green fruits. In leaf stress indicators, the water potential decreased with increasing levels of salt stress, whereas the chlorophyll content (SPAD value) and the electrolyte leakage were not affected, except in 100 mM NaCl. The overall OJIP curves and each OJIP step in leaves decreased with increasing levels of salt stress, but were unaffected at the lowest level of salt stress (25 mM NaCI). Therefore, the OJIP curves were more sensitive indicators of salt stress in leaves than SPAD and electrolyte leakage. Conversely, in fruit, the OJIP curve was only significantly different in 100 mM NaCl compared with the control, and energy fluxes described by energy pipeline models were higher in 100 mM NaCI than in the control. These results indicate that, in severe salt stress such as 100 mM NaCI of fruit, JIP parameters and energy fluxes can show photosynthetic changes due to the increase in energy absorption efficiency of photosystem II against severe salt stress. Therefore, we conclude that OJIP transient analysis can be used as a non-destructive, simple, and rapid technique for sensing salt stress in tomato. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Our study focuses on the ephemeral stream deposits of Wadi Selloum to identify phases of morphodynamic stability (pedogenesis) and activity (flooding) in the direct vicinity of the rock shelter of Ifri n'Ammar (NE Morocco). As one of the oldest settlement sites of anatomically modern humans (AMH) in North Africa, Ifri n'Ammar documents periodical occupations since similar to 170 ka. Since the discontinuous settlement record may reflect climate forcing with subsequent landscape changes, we aim at reconstructing the palaeoenvironmental variability recorded in the ephemeral stream deposits. In addition to the use of micromorphological, seditnentological, geochemical and mineralogical methods, the geochronological framework of ephemeral stream deposits was established by the application of different luminescence dating techniques. The deposition ages between 102 +/- 8 ka and 13 +/- 0.2 ka span different morphodynamically stable and active phases. Periods of enhanced aggradation occurred around similar to 100 ka, similar to 75 ka, similar to 55 ka, after the LGM, and during the Holocene, whilst sedimentation ended after similar to 13 ka. The Wadi Selloum might be characterised by enhanced flooding during humid phases. Pedogenesis may be used as environmental indicator for more humid climate conditions during MIS 3 (palaeo-Calcisol), the early Holocene (Calcisol) and the late Holocene (Fluvisol). This study thus provides first insights into the palaeoenvironmental changes around the rock shelter of Ifri n'Ammar during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hoverflies are often used as bio-indicators for ecosystem conservation, but only few studies have actually investigated the key factors explaining their richness in woodlands.
   In a fragmented landscape in southwest France, we investigated the joint effects of woodland area, structural heterogeneity, connectivity and history on the species richness of forest-specialist hoverflies, and whether there was a time lag in the response of hoverflies to habitat changes, and tested the effect of spatiotemporal changes.
   Current species richness was sampled in 48 woodlands using 99 Malaise traps. Structural variables were derived from a rapid habitat assessment protocol. Old maps and aerial photographs were used to extract past and present spatial patterns of the woodlands since 1850. Relationships between species richness and explanatory variables were explored using generalized linear models.
   We show that current habitat area, connectivity, historical continuity and the average density of tree-microhabitats explained 35 % of variation in species richness. Species richness was affected differently by changes in patch area between 1979 and 2010, depending on woodland connectivity. In isolated woodlands, extinction debt and colonization credit were revealed, showing that even several decades are not sufficient for hoverflies to adapt to landscape-scale habitat conditions.
   These findings emphasise the importance of maintaining connectedness between woodlands, which facilitates the dispersion in a changing landscape. Our results also highlight the benefits of using a change-oriented approach to explain the current distribution patterns of species, especially when several spatial processes act jointly.

AB  - We assessed early rearing conditions on aging-related changes in mouse behavior. Two isolated-housing groups, running wheel (IHRW) and empty cage (IHEC), were compared against two enriched environments, static (EEST) and dynamic (EEDY), both of which included toys and other mice. For EEDY, the location of toys and sources of food and water changed daily, but remained constant for EEST. All mice, randomly assigned to one of the four groups at similar to 4 weeks of age, remained in their respective environments for 25 weeks followed by single housing in empty cages. Beginning at similar to 40 weeks of age, all mice were tested at monthly intervals in a plus-shaped maze in which we measured the number of arm entries and the probability of entering a perpendicular arm. Despite making significantly more arm entries than any other group, IHEC mice also were less likely to turn into the left or right arm, a sign of motor inflexibility. Both EEDY and EEST mice showed enhanced turning relative to IHRW and IHEC groups, but only EEDY mice maintained their turning performance for up to similar to 100 weeks of age. EEDY and EEST mice also were unique in showing an increase in expression of the major glutamate transporter (GLT1) in striatum, but a decrease in motor cortex, suggesting a need for further assessment of environmental manipulations on long-term changes in forebrain glutamate transmission. Our behavioral results indicate that early exposure to continually changing environments, rather than socialization or exercise alone, results in life-long changes in patterns of motor exploration.

AB  - In this contribution, we attempt to derive a tool allowing the prediction of the stretch ratio at failure in rubber components subjected to thermal ageing. To achieve this goal, the main idea is to combine the fracture mechanics approach and the intrinsic defect concept. Using an accelerated ageing procedure for an Ethylene-Propylene-Diene Monomer (EPDM), it is first shown that the average molar mass of the elastically active chains (i.e. between crosslinks) can be used as the main indicator of the macromolecular network degradation. By introducing the time-temperature equivalence principle, a shift factor obeying to an Arrhenius law is derived, and master curves are built as well for the average molar mass as for the ultimate mechanical properties. Fracture mechanics tests are also achieved and the square root dependence of the fracture energy with the average molar mass is pointed out. Moreover, it is shown that the mechanical response could be approximated by the phantom network theory, which allows to relate the strain energy density function to the average molar mass. Assuming that the fracture of a smooth specimen is the consequence of a virtual intrinsic defect whose the size can be easily estimated, the stretch ratio at break can be therefore computed for any thermal ageing condition. The estimated values are found in a very nice agreement with EPDM experimental data, making this approach a useful tool when designing rubber components for moderate to high temperature environments.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes are highly susceptible to accidental oil spills. Oil can cover root tissues, inhibiting gas exchange and increasing root oxygen stress. This is similar to flooding; both conditions reduce the availability of oxygen to a plant. Therefore, it was hypothesized that tolerance to both flooding and oil are related in plants, as both impede gas exchange between roots and their environment. We investigated effects of oil on respiration and photosynthesis in nine marsh species ranging from flooding sensitive (hypothesized oil sensitive) to flooding tolerant (hypothesized oil tolerant). Plants were subjected to 6 L m(-2) light motor oil in greenhouse experiments for six weeks. Oil exposure caused root oxygen deficiency in all but the most flooding tolerant species. Alcohol dehydrogenase activities increased in roots of flooding sensitive species and moderately flooding tolerant plants under oil exposure, indicating oxygen stress. In contrast, flooding tolerant plants showed no sign of oxygen deficiency under oil treatment. Additionally, decreases in photosynthetic rates were measured in some species following oil exposure. Photosynthesis was reduced by non-stomatal limitations, suggesting toxic effects of oil. It was concluded that tolerance to oil relates to flooding tolerance when measured in terms of biochemical enzyme activity. Root alcohol dehydrogenase activity was a sensitive indicator of oil susceptibility, whereas leaf-level photosynthesis was less sensitive to oil. Relating flooding and oil tolerance based on physiological measures could help future efforts to protect marsh plants prior to an oil spill as well as manage coastal marshes following an oil spill.

AB  - This study provides a retrospective analysis of the relationship between physical oceanography, biology and recruitment of three Eastern Bering Sea flatfish stocks: flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon), northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra), and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) during the period 1978-2005. Stock assessment model estimates of recruitment and spawning stock size indicate that temporal patterns in productivity are consistent with decadal scale (or shorter) patterns in climate variability, which may influence marine survival during the early life history phases. Density-dependence (through spawning stock size) was statistically significant in a Ricker stock-recruit model of flatfish recruitment that included environmental terms. Wind-driven advection of northern rock sole and flathead sole larvae to favorable nursery grounds was found to coincide with years of above-average recruitment. Ocean forcing of Bristol Bay surface waters during springtime was mostly on-shelf (eastward) during the 1980s and again in the early 2000s, but was off-shelf (westerly) during the 1990s, corresponding with periods of good and poor recruitment, respectively. Finally, the Arctic Oscillation was found to be an important indicator of arrowtooth flounder productivity. Model results were applied to IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) future springtime wind scenarios to predict the future impact of climate on northern rock sole productivity and indicated that a moderate future increase in recruitment might be expected because the climate trends favor on-shelf transport but that density-dependence will dampen this effect such that northern rock sole abundance will not be substantially affected by climate change.

AB  - Many of the world's fish stocks are depleted as a result of overexploitation, pollution and habitat loss. The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) sets a target for fisheries to maintain or restore stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2015. We assessed the global stock status and found that 68% were at or above the MSY level in 2008 and that the 2015 target is unlikely to be met. We compiled data for eight indicators to evaluate the sustainability of fisheries and the gap to meet the WSSD target. These indicators show that the overall condition of global fisheries is declining, long-term benefits are being compromised, and pressures on fisheries are increasing despite fisheries policy and management actions being taken by coastal States. We develop a bio-economic model to estimate the costs and benefits of restoring overfished stocks. Our results show that the global fishing capacity needs to be cut by 3643% from the 2008 level, resulting in the loss of employment of 1215 million fishers and costing US$96358 billion for buybacks. On the other hand, meeting the WSSD goal will increase annual fishery production by 16.5 million tonnes, annual rent by US$32 billion and improve biodiversity and functioning of marine ecosystems. However, progress towards rebuilding has been hindered by an unwillingness or inability to accept the short-term socio-economic consequences associated with rebuilding fisheries. Thus, there is a pressing need for integration of rebuilding plans into national political and economic decision-making.

AB  - This research encompasses soil CO2 emission studies from forest and pasture couplets located in northwestern Spain, where two mature oak forest ecosystems partially cleared for pasture 5 or 50 years ago were selected to monitor soil C effluxes during 2 years. The CO2 exchanges in the soil-atmosphere interphase of forest and pasture plots were seasonally determined using portable infrared gas analysers. At the same time, soil samples from both forest and pasture ecosystems were used to carry out long-term incubations under laboratory conditions. Solid-state C-13-NMR with cross-polarization/magic angle spinning was applied to determine the deforestation effects on soil organic matter (SOM) composition. Pasture implantation caused a notable decline of the labile C pool and a decrease in the total soil C, with an increase in both the SOM humification and the relative concentration of phenolic and carboxyl C. After only 5 years, the deforestation caused a general decrease in the soil CO2 emissions with reduced seasonal fluctuations, these effects being even more intense 50 years after clearing. The correlation observed in oak forests between the CO2 measured in situ and the soil temperature, is masked in pasture ecosystems by the high summer soil dryness. After the partial disappearance of soil C stocks caused by deforestation, a new long-term C input/output equilibrium seems to be established, probably due to the joint adaptation of both SOM and microbial communities in the old pasture soil; however, the entire soil C retention capacity remains still degraded as compared with the original uncleared forest ecosystem.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
LA  - English

KW  - Raccoon Creek
AB  - Acid mine drainage is a serious environmental problem throughout mining regions of the US and around the world. In Appalachia, reuse of steel slag from steel production as a source of alkalinity for treatment of acid mine drainage has become a common practice. In these systems, dubbed steel slag leach beds, relatively clean surface water is percolated through a bed of steel slag to add large amounts of alkalinity to the water before mixing it with acidic, metalliferous mine water. These beds do not operate consistently and their failure mechanisms are poorly understood. Using the experience of Raccoon Creek watershed in southern Ohio, the alkalinity distribution of the discharge of six steel slag leach beds is compared. Two of these beds are still functional, one has been abandoned and three are operating poorly. The difference in alkalinity distribution between these beds suggests that a carbonate-dominated alkalinity system is an indicator of a poorly performing steel slag leach bed, while a more even distribution between hydroxide, carbonate and bicarbonate may point to more ideal operating conditions. In eight laboratory column experiments, this evidence was then expanded upon by testing different mixed media substrates (differing mixes of steel slag, wood chips and river gravel) to see which provided the most ideal alkalinity distributions. The columns that had steel slag mixed either with wood chips or wood chips and river gravel outperformed the column with slag only in terms of alkalinity distribution, perhaps due to microbial processes or increased hydraulic conductivity without significant added calcium or carbon that could drive calcium carbonate precipitation within the beds and causing them to fail.

AB  - Blood chemistry parameters are valid and useful indicators to determine the nutritional status and health of farmed fish. These parameters allow establishing normal health, detecting physiological disorders and providing information for diagnosis and prognosis of diseases caused by nutritional and environmental factors. Objective: to analyze the growth and changes in biochemical parameters in plasma of juvenile tambaqui (Piaractus brachypomus) fed two protein levels. Methods: fish were fed diets with 24 and 34% of digestible protein. Experiments were conducted in laboratory tanks, dam cages, and earthen ponds to evaluate weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), as well as serum variables such as glucose, total protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, and urea. Fish were sampled at the beginning and end of the experiments for determining body weight and to draw blood samples. In experiments 2 and 3 fish were monthly sampled for four months (three animals per replicate). Results: no differences were found between treatments (p>0.05) for GP and SGR. The PER values in laboratory tanks and cages showed inverse linear correlation with respect to protein level (p<0.05). Serum levels were similar between treatments (p>0.05), except cholesterol and urea in the laboratory. The observed initial values differed from those obtained during the course of the experiments (p<0.05), except for protein in experiments 2 and 3, and glucose in experiment 3. Conclusions: due to the fact that this study was conducted in laboratory and field under normal handling conditions, using animals of different sizes and sampling a large number of individuals, allows establishing blood parameters that can be suggested as reference values for this species.

AB  - Both the net primary productivity (NPP) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are commonly used as indicators to characterize vegetation vigor, and NDVI has been used as a surrogate estimator of NPP in some cases. To evaluate the reliability of such surrogation, here we examined the quantitative difference between NPP and NDVI in their outcomes of vegetation vigor assessment at a landscape scale. Using Landsat ETM+ data and a process model, the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator, NPP distribution was mapped at a resolution of 90 m, and total NDVI during the growing season was calculated in Heihe River Basin, Northwest China in 2002. The results from a comparison between the NPP and NDVI classification maps show that there existed a substantial difference in terms of both area and spatial distribution between the assessment outcomes of these two indicators, despite that they are strongly correlated. The degree of difference can be influenced by assessment schemes, as well as the type of vegetation and ecozone. Overall, NDVI is not a good surrogate of NPP as the indicators of vegetation vigor assessment in the study area. Nonetheless, NDVI could serve as a fairish surrogate indicator under the condition that the target region has low vegetation cover and the assessment has relatively coarse classification schemes (i.e., the class number is small). It is suggested that the use of NPP and NDVI should be carefully selected in landscape assessment. Their differences need to be further evaluated across geographic areas and biomes.

AB  - The extent of carbon (C) stored in soils depends on a number of factors including soil characteristics, climatic and other environmental conditions, and management practices. Such information, however, is lacking for silvopastoral systems in Spain. This study quantified the amounts of soil C stored at various depths (0-25, 25-50, 50-75, and 75-100 cm) under a Dehesa cork oak (Quercus suber L.) silvopasture at varying distances (2, 5, and 15 m) to trees. Soil C in the whole soil and three soil fractions (<53, 53-250, and 250-2000 mu m) was determined. Results showed soil depth to be a significant factor in soil C stocks in all soil particle sizes. Distance to tree was a significant factor determining soil C stocks in the whole soil and the 250-2000 mu m soil fraction. To 1 m depth, mean total C storage at 2, 5, and 15m from cork oak was 50.2, 37, and 26.5 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Taking into account proportions of land surface area containing these C stocks at varying distances to trees to 1 m depth, with a tree density of 35 stems ha(-1), estimated landscape soil C is 29.9 Mg ha(-1). Greater soil C stocks directly underneath the tree canopy suggest that maintaining or increasing tree cover, where lost from disease or management, may increase long term storage of soil C in Mediterranean silvopastoral systems. The results also demonstrate the use of soil aggregate characteristics as better indicators of soil C sequestration potential and thus a tool for environmental monitoring.

AB  - A bacterium capable of producing a deep blue pigment was isolated from the environment and identified as Pantoea agglomerans. The pigment production characteristics of the bacterium under various conditions were studied. The optimal agar plate ingredients for pigment production by the bacterium were first studied. the optimal ingredients were 5 g/liter glucose, 10 g/liter tryptic soy broth, and 40 g/liter glycerol at pH 6.4. Bacterial cells grew on the agar plate during the incubation, while the pigment spread into the agar plate, meaning that it is water soluble. Pigment production was affected by the initial cell density. Namely, at higher initial cell densities ranging from 10(6.3) to 10(8.2) CFU/cm(2) on the agar plate, faster pigment production was observed, but no blue pigment was produced at a very high initial density of 10(9.1) CFU/cm(2). Thus, the cell population of 10(8.2) CFU/cm(2) was used for subsequent study. Although the bacterium was capable of growing at temperatures above and below 10 degrees C, it could produce the pigment only at temperatures of >= 10 degrees C. Moreover, the pigment production was faster at higher temperatures in the range of 10 to 20 degrees C. Pigment production at various temperature patterns was well described by a new logistic model. These results suggested that the bacterium could be used in the development of a microbial temperature indicator for the low-temperature-storage management of foods and clinical materials. To our knowledge, there is no other P. agglomerans strain capable of producing a blue pigment and the pigment is a new one of microbial origin.

AB  - Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) is an endoparasitoid of fruit flies reared for augmentative biological control of several species of Anastrepha in Mexico. During the production of D. longicaudata different sizes of parasitoids are produced depending on the host size. Here, we investigated whether host size influences the biological and behavioral parameters of the wasp that emerged under laboratory conditions. Three different sizes of host (small, medium, and large) were used for the experiments. Host size significantly affected the number of parasitoids emerged as greater number of parasitoids emerged from medium size hosts compared to small and large hosts. The ratio of females to males did not differ among the groups. Host body size influenced life expectancy of parasitoid females and males deprived of food, and parasitoids that emerged from large hosts lived longer. In contrast, host body size did not significantly influence the life expectancy of parasitoid females and males provided with food ad libitum. Host body size also affected gross and net fecundity of emerged parasitoids; females that emerged from medium and large host larvae were more fecund. Host size did not affect most of the behavioral parameters evaluated, except the time of landing on source. Females that emerged from large host larvae spent less time before landing on a host source than females from the smaller hosts. Host body size did not affect the different trajectory indices evaluated, except the mean walking speed of D. longicaudata. Females developed in large hosts showed an increase walking speed compared to females from medium and small hosts.

AB  - As more than 50% of the human population are situated in cities of the world, urbanization has become an important contributor to global warming due to remarkable urban heat island (UHI) effect. UHI effect has been linked to the regional climate, environment, and socio-economic development. In this study, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery, respectively acquired in 1989 and 2001, were utilized to assess urban area thermal characteristics in Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian province in south-eastern China. As a key indicator for the assessment of urban environments, sub-pixel impervious surface area (ISA) was mapped to quantitatively determine urban land-use extents and urban surface thermal patterns. In order to accurately estimate urban surface types, high-resolution imagery was utilized to generate the proportion of impervious surface areas. Urban thermal characteristics was further analysed by investigating the relationships between the land surface temperature (LST), percent impervious surface area, and two indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). The results show that correlations between NDVI and LST are rather weak, but there is a strong positive correlation between percent ISA, NDBI and LST. This suggests that percent ISA, combined with LST, and NDBI, can quantitatively describe the spatial distribution and temporal variation of urban thermal patterns and associated land-use/land-cover (LULC) conditions.

AB  - Honey bee workers normally produce brood food at an age of 5 to 15 days. However, natural events like swarming or brood diseases may lead to the occurrence of over-aged nurses. Here we investigated the physiological consequences of prolonged nursing for both the nurses and the brood they rear, and tried to separate the effects of chronological age and of task affiliation on some important physiological parameters. Brood was reared in groups of colonies with either a normal age structure or with moderately over-aged workers.The haemolymph concentrations of total protein and vitellogenin, the development of mandibular and hypopharyngeal glands, and the activity of alpha-glucosidase in the hypopharyngeal glands of nurses from these groups of colonies were compared. Moreover, we used the fertility of young workers reared by normal- and overaged nurses as a bioindicator for the quality of the brood care they had received. It showed that parameters linked to the production of brood food proteins remained stable in over-aged nurses, whereas the development of mandibular glands regressed. Workers reared by over-aged nurses had more ovarioles and showed stronger ovary development under queenless conditions. Our results indicate that while over-aged nurses remain capable of producing brood food, they are not functionally equivalent to young nurses. The partial degeneration of the mandibular glands normally occurring at the end of the nursing period cannot be prevented by prolonged nursing. The distinct phenotype of workers reared by old nurses raises the question of possible age-related specialisations among nurses in colonies with a normal age structure.

AB  - Given the huge number of sequences of otherwise uncharacterized protein sequences, computer-aided prediction of posuranslational modifications (PTMs) and translocation signals from amino acid sequence becomes a necessity. We have contributed to this multi-faceted, worldwide effort with the development of predictors for GPI lipid anchor sites, for N-terminal N-myristoylation sites, for famesyl and geranylgeranyl anchor attachment as well as for the PTS I peroxisomal signal. Although the substrate protein sequence signals for various PTMs or translocation systems vary dramatically. we found that their principal architecture is similar for all the cases studied. Typically, a small stretch of the amino acid residues is buried in the catalytic cleft of the protein-modifing enzyme (or the binding site of the transporter). This piece most intensely interacts with the enzyme and its sequence variability is most restricted. This stretch is surrounded by linker segments that connect the part bound by the enzyme with the rest of the substrate protein. These residues are, as a trend, small with a flexible backbone and polar. Due to the mechanistic requirements of binding to the enzyme, we suggest that most PTM sites are necessarily embedded into intrinsically disordered regions (except for cases of autocatalytic PTMs, PTMs executed in the unfolded state or non-enzymatic PTMs) and this issue requires consideration in structural studies of proteins with complex architecture. Surprisingly, some proteins carry sequence signals for posttransiational modification or translocation that remain hidden in the normal biological context but can become fully functional in certain conditions.

AB  - Scattered paddock trees are widespread throughout rural Australia but their effect on soil conditions has received only limited research attention. This study investigated the influence of 3 Eucalyptus species on surface soil properties on different parent materials at both stocked and unstocked sites on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales. Mineral soil samples to a depth of 5 cm were collected at intervals up to twice the canopy radius away from tree trunks and litter samples were collected at corresponding points. Mineral soils were analysed for pH ( CaCl2), organic carbon ( C), and extractable phosphorus ( P) concentration, while for the litter samples, P, sulfur, cations, and ash alkalinity were determined. Stocking with sheep and cattle increased surface soil acidity and C and P concentrations at each location. However, soils under E. melliodora and E. viminalis showed higher pH and increased C and P concentrations close to the tree stem irrespective of grazing. Soils under E. caliginosa, while having similar patterns of C and P, showed variable acidity patterns with instances of lower pH close to the tree stem. Spatial patterns in soil acidity were associated with the ash alkalinity of litter, indicating litter as a source of alkalinity addition to the soil surface, although different patterns of soil pH could not be fully explained by litter ash alkalinity alone. The close correlation of litter Ca content with ash alkalinity suggests that this element might be a suitable indicator of the acid amelioration capacity of different tree species.

AB  - The objective of this paper was to determine whether CO2 exchange rates could be used as an indicator for determining the state of development and species or functional composition of biological soil crusts in different successional stages. We quantified the CO2 exchange rates, i.e., CO2 assimilation and respiration, in samples from different microhabitats at two different sites in the Negev desert. In the successional pathway of the crust communities, the pioneers in colonising the soil surface are the cyanobacteria; green algae, mosses and lichens then follow. Physical influences such as soil structure and types, radiation intensity, and topographic traits such as slope directions that affect water availability and soil moisture, influence the successional pathways and the soil crust community. When physical conditions are the same, disturbances are key factors for a specific successional stage. We found a substantial gradient of CO2 exchange at the Nizzana site for both respiration and photosynthesis. Samples from the sand dunes at the Nizzana site showed a pronounced activity gradient with high rates for assimilation (around 70 mu mol CO2 m(-2) min(-1)) as well as respiration (60-70 pmol CO2 m(-2) min(-1)) at the base of dunes, decreasing towards the top. The soil crust samples of the Negev desert show comparable values. Hence, as ecotypes containing such biological soil crusts with dominant photosynthetically active organisms are a widespread phenomenon in desert, boreal and arctic systems, their contribution to the global cycling of trace gases and elements can be significant for global budgets.

AB  - Photobacterium phosphoreum is a marine bacterium which is used extensively as a bioluminescent indicator of pollutants, where the presence of toxicants diminishes light output. To evaluate the utility of cell immobilisation in continuous toxicity testing, the sensitivity of P. phosphoreum to five gelling agents was evaluated relative to the retention of bioluminescence in 3% NaCl-glycerol suspensions. Following storage at 4 degrees C, the control cultures retained light output for up to 2 weeks before significant decline; alginate-glycerol suspensions were stable for up to 4 weeks and bioluminescence was detectable for up to 6 weeks. Cells stored in agar were no more stable than the control, whereas cells gelled in agarose and low-melting point agarose showed a significant decline in bioluminescence within 2 weeks of storage. Bioluminescence was totally retained in alginate-glycerol suspensions stored at -80 degrees C for up to 12 weeks. P. phosphoreum was successfully immobilised in strontium alginate and showed a dose-related response to four of the five heavy metal ions, SDS and pentachlorophenol tested when responses were followed over a time-course. A flow-through system for Sr-alginate immobilised cells was developed and conditions for operation were optimised. When cells were exposed to a pulse of 4-nitrophenol or salicylate then the nutrient feed continued, bioluminescence declined in response (pulse of 4-6 min) to these pollutants then recovered to a new stable rate of decline which was faster than the pre-exposure rate. These results demonstrate the potential of using immobilised P. phosphoreum in a continuous flow-through system for real-time environmental monitoring of water quality.

AB  - Feroplug is a new temperature indicator developed by the authers and co-workers. The device makes use of the characteristics of ferrite transformation in duplex stainless steels, and has the following advantages over conventional methods of temperature measurement:
   (1) It is a piece of stainless steel, with no delicate parts, and can be used in very hostile environments;
   (2) It does not require any cables such as those in the case of thermocouples;
   (3) It is very much cheaper than thermocouples.
   This invention has been patented in the USA, UK and Europe with financial and legal support provided by the British Technology Group, UK. Patent application in Japan is still pending.
   The invention is particularly useful for life assessment purposes in power and petrochemical plants. The underlying physical principle of the Feroplug is based on the transformation of ferrite, which is ferromagnetic at room temperature, into other phases such as carbide and sigma which are non-feromagnetic at room temperature. The amount of transformation depends on the temperature and duration of exposure. If the amount of transformation and time of exposure is known, the temperature of exposure can be deduced. Thus, the Feroplug makes use of the change in the amount of ferrite, which can be easily detected by room temperature magnetic measurement, to indicate the temperature of exposure. A model has been developed which can describe the ferrite transformation behaviour of Feroplug materials under non-isothermal conditions. The agreement between experimental data and the model is good at temperatures above 550 degrees C.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter observations are sensitive to hydrologic conditions and vegetation characteristics of land cover. This study conducted a high spatial-resolution investigation (30-m) on the response of dual-polarization C-band (5.6 cm wavelength) SAR backscatter coefficients (sigma degrees) to temporal changes of surface water depth (d(w)) and spatial variations of vegetation characteristics in the south Florida Everglades wetlands. We investigated (1) linear relationships between s. and dw values, and (2) the effects of vegetation density and morphology on sigma degrees-d(w) relationships. We developed a new method to classify pixels with significant linear relationships of multi-temporal sigma degrees and d(w) (R-2 > 0.5 and p-value <0.04), which were termed "Reliable Scatterer" (RS). RS included positive, negative, and a combination of both positive and negative relationships (corresponding to RS+, RS-, RS +/-, respectively). Our analysis revealed spatially varying vegetation densities and morphologies had a significant impact on RS types, where we found RS+ type pixels for woody vegetation, RS +/- for a mix of medium- and high-density herbaceous vegetation using C-band VV (C-VV) data, and RS for sparse herbaceous vegetation using C-VH data. Overall, our study indicates that C-band dual-polarization backscatter is sensitive to water-depth variations for some vegetation types, and this sensitivity has the potential to serve as a reliable indicator for monitoring water depth in wetland environments.

AB  - Water quality monitoring is a fundamental tool in the management of freshwater resources. The purpose of monitoring is to provide meaningful quality data for local action planning and catchment-wide decision making. The assessment of water quality is crucial to guarantee the efficient operation of the Water Treatment Plants (WTPs), promoting health conditions and contributing for a more sustainable urban water cycle. In accordance, the objective of this study was to evaluate key target chemical and microbiological water quality parameters, some of them already monitored within Portuguese/EU legal framework and others still not regulated, but with environmental and human heath relevance. A local monitoring database model, using a 6-year period (from 2014 to 2019) of water quality data, regarding water samples collected on representative sampling locations covering the freshwater abstraction sites, conventional WTPs and distribution network was assessed. This work provides new knowledge regarding occurrence and seasonal behaviour for both microbiological and chemical water quality parameters, essential to understand/manage the water supply system. Additionally, relationships between the target variables were also assessed. Particularly, strong correlations were identified between TOC and THMs formation at distribution network (r = 0.69; p <= 0.001); nitrates were the water quality parameter that revealed the best correlation between surface water source and treated water (r = 0.81; p <= 0.001), suggesting that treatment yield/performance is dependent on surface water load. The local and continuous monitoring of water systems are crucial to implement new approaches to guarantee the best quality of drinking water throughout the supply system.

AB  - Searles Lake, California, was a saline -alkaline lake that deposited >25 non-clastic minerals that record the history of lake chemistry and regional climate. Here, the mineralogy and petrography from the late Pleistocene/ Holocene (32-6 ka) portion of a new Searles Lake sediment core, SLAPP-SRLS17, is combined with thermodynamic models to determine the geochemical and paleoclimate conditions required to produce the observed mineral phases, sequences, and abundances. The models reveal that the primary precipitates formed by open system (i.e., fractional crystallization), whereas the early diagenetic salts formed by salinity-driven closed system back-reactions (i.e., equilibrium crystallization). For core SLAPP-SRLS17, the defining evaporite sequence trona -> burkeite -> halite indicates brine temperatures within a 20-29 degrees C range, implying thermally insulating lake depths >10 m during salt deposition. Evaporite phases reflect lake water pCO(2) consistent with contemporaneous atmospheric values of similar to 190-270 ppmv. However, anomalous layers of nahcolite and thenardite indicate pulses of pCO(2) > 700-800 ppm, likely due to variable CO2 injection along faults.
   Core sedimentology indicates that Searles Lake was continuously perennial between 32 ka and 6 ka such that evaporite units reflect periods of net evaporation but never complete desiccation. Model simulations indicate that cycles of partial evaporation and dilution strongly influence long-term brine evolution by amassing certain species, particularly Cl-, that only occur in late-stage soluble salts. A model incorporating longterm brine dynamics corrects previous mass balance anomalies and shows that the late Pleistocene/Holocene (32-6 ka) salts are partially inherited from the solutes introduced into earlier lakes going back at least 150 ka.

AB  - In order to solve the problem of traffic accidents caused by fatigue driving, the research of EEG signals is particularly important, which can timely and accurately determine the fatigue state and take corresponding measures. Effective fatigue improvement measures are an important research topic in the current scientific field. The purpose of this article is to use EEG signals to analyze fatigue driving and prevent the dangers and injuries caused by fatigue driving. We designed the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal acquisition model to collect the EEG signal of the experimenter, and then removed the noise through the algorithm of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and independent component analysis (ICA). On the basis of in-depth analysis and full understanding, we learned about the EEG signal of the driver at different driving times and different landscape roads, and provided some references for the study of music in relieving driving fatigue. The results of the study show that in the presence of music, the driver can keep the EEG signal active for more than 2 h, while in the absence of music, the driver's EEG signal is active for about 1.5 h. Under different road conditions, the driver's EEG signal activity is not consistent. The beta wave and (alpha + theta)/beta ratio of the driver in mountainous roads and grassland road landscape environments are highly correlated with driving time, and beta wave is negatively correlated with driving time, and (alpha + theta)/beta is positively correlated with driving time. In addition, the accumulation of changes in the two indicators is also strongly correlated with driving time.

AB  - In recent years, the northwestern part of the North Pacific areas of Costa Rica has undergone rapid socioeconomic development. This situation, combined with the scarce available information about the water quality of the Gulf of Papagayo, became the starting point to carry out a study to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of physicochemical and biological parameters of surface waters. Seven samplings were collected during the dry season and the rainy season from October 2016 to February 2018. Water quality parameters such as: temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a of six analytes: nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, phosphate, silicate and biological oxygen demand were measured. The results showed that phosphate and ammonium levels were lower during the rainy season (<6 mu g P-PO4-3 L-1-9.53 mu g P-PO4-3 L-1 and <11 mu g N-NH4+ L-1-9.57 mu g N-NH4+ L-1) than during the dry season (<6 mu g P-PO4-3 L-1-13.64 mu g P-PO4-3 L-1 and <11 mu g N-NH4+ L-1-14.43 mu g N-NH4+ L-1), which may be related to low rainfall (0, 00-26, 16 mm) during the sampling period. The dry season showed enrichment of ammonium, phosphate, and chlorophyll a due to the influence of the coastal upwelling for the intensification of the Papagayo winds from December to March. The physical, chemical, and biological indicators demonstrated that the Gulf waters had adequate quality. Nonetheless, there are specific areas such as Culebra Bay with conditions that could show deterioration of water quality.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of toothpaste containing natural tea tree essential oil (TTO) and ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP), on microflora and selected indicators of oral health in patients using removable acrylic partial dentures. Fifty patients with varying conditions of hygiene were divided into two groups. The study group received the toothpaste with TTO and EEP, while the control group received the same toothpaste but without TTO and EEP. At the first visit, oral hygiene and hygiene of the prostheses were carried out. Control visits took place 7 and 28 days later and compared to baseline. Indexes like API (Approximal Plaque Index), mSBI (modified Sulcus Bleeding Index), OHI-s (simplified Oral Hygiene Index), and DPI (Denture Plaque Index) were assessed in three subsequent stages, and swabs were collected from floor of the mouth area to assess the microbiota. After 7 and 28 days of using the toothpaste with TTO and EEP, a statistically significant decrease of the examined indicator values were observed in the study group as compared to the values upon the initial visit. The number of isolated strains of microorganisms in the study group was decreased or maintained at the same level, whereas in the control group an increase in the number of isolated strains was observed. The observed stabilization of oral microbiota in patients from the study group confirms the beneficial activity of toothpaste containing EEP and TTO compared to the control group.

AB  - The adaptation measures of agricultural crops to current climate change are also reflected at the level of land-use planning for species with resistance to rainfall shortages and periods of prolonged droughts. The present paper aimed at the spatial modeling of land favorability for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) within Bihor county, which is located in Northwest Romania. This was performed by using GIS spatial analysis techniques, particularly the technique of rating agricultural plots by using as a modeling basis the synthetic climate indicators, soil indices, as well as topographic characteristics, which are considered relevant for the studied species. As a result of the modeling process, agricultural plots that are favorable for the alfalfa culture were identified. A comparative analysis of the profit was also carried out both for the green and dry masses of eight types of alfalfa, which are suitable for the national environmental conditions. Land favorability modeling for alfalfa cultivation will be carried out by using GIS spatial analysis techniques, which allow the use of large databases while maintaining the necessary degree of detail, and they make possible the correlations between factors and production estimated per hectare, which are correlations that are characteristic for the environmental factors. Thus, for the studied territory, the best green alfalfa production was identified as being obtained from the Carinca and Daniela varieties, whereas the Mihaela and Teodora varieties were noticed to provide the best dry alfalfa production.

AB  - In view of the harm of residual film retention to soil environment in Xinjiang which even affected the germination of seeds and hindered the growth of crop roots in severe cases, in this paper, a 4SGMS-220 plough layer residual film recovery machine with a ground preparation device is designed. The main part of the machine is composed of a filming mechanism, a conveying mechanism, a soil crushing roller, and a film collecting box. The machine can achieve simultaneous film lifting, film stripping, collecting membrane and suppression operations. In this paper, primary focus is placed on the design of the filming mechanism, while the movement trajectory of the comb teeth and the filming condition are analysed in detail. In order to obtain the optimal combination of equipment and operating parameters, the equipment traveling speed, the filming device rotational speed, and the comb teeth depth are used as the influencing factors. Furthermore, the residual film recovery rate and impurity rates are employed as test indicators for three-factor three-level response surface experiment and optimization via Design-Expert software. The results indicate that optimal operation is achieved for the machine travel speed of 4.1 km/h, the filming device speed of 106 min(-1), and the comb tooth soil penetration depth of 139.2 mm. The residual film recovery rate is equal to 74.32%, while the residual film impurity rate is equal to 7.11%. The difference between the test results and the predicted values is relatively small. Thus, it can be concluded that the optimized model is reliable.

AB  - Little is known about the influence of conversion of wetlands to farmlands on concentrations and distribution of elements other than those most commonly studied, partly because of the lack of stratification inwetland soils. In this study, in the Sanjiang Plain in northeastern China, we determined the concentrations of 63 elements along soil profiles at three depths: 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, and below the depth to which farmers would plow, at 40-60 cm, under four land uses: natural wetland, drained wetland, wetland converted to soybean field and subsequently to rice paddy field. Based on our previous work, we expected that changes in organic matter content would be an important factor affecting element concentrations, but that changes in land uses also led to decoupling of the influence of organic matter on elements. This would lead to other factors, such as changes in redox conditions, changes in hydrology and mixing of soils due to plowing, becoming more important factors affecting element distributions. Our study confirmed these expectations. Changes in organic matter content directly or indirectly affected many elements, explaining 67% of variation. Arsenic, cobalt, iron and nickel concentrations were dramatically higher and sulfur concentrations lower when wetland was converted to paddy field. Co and Ni were identified as potential chemical indicators of wetland conversion. Our research is the first to use multi-element fingerprinting to study effects of conversion of wetlands to croplands in China and showed that this relatively simple approach highlights the complexity of the many interacting factors in reclamation of wetland soils for agricultural uses.

AB  - Statement of the problem. New challenges of our time significantly affect the methodology of urban planning The development of new principles of city life, regulating the biosphere compatibility of cities and the development of human capital, should be considered an urgent scientific task that requires identifying the patterns of functioning of urban elements of planning structures (residential areas).
   Results. The paper develops the methodological foundations of urban planning, design and evaluation of design options for residential planning units of the city (quarter, neighborhood, residential area) on the principles of the paradigm of biosphere compatibility of cities and settlements that develop people. A conceptual model of the functional and planning organization of the territory-the hierarchy of city functions - is proposed. An algorithm for evaluating variants of residential area planning projects based on the index of urban function provision has been developed. For each of the functions of the city, the necessary and sufficient composition of indicators for evaluating design decisions is identified. The article discusses the prospect of quantifying the social well-being of the population of residential areas of a biosphere-compatible city as an alternative condition for the formation of a comfortable urban environment.
   Conclusion. The numerical evaluation of the design solution and a comparative analysis of the level of favorability of a residential neighborhood using the principles of the biosphere compatibility paradigm show what changes are required in the composition of urban planning solutions not only to achieve the quality of the material environment of life, but also human development in all respects.

AB  - The Rollrock Section in the Sverdrup Basin of Arctic Canada is one of the northernmost outcrops where the Jurassic-Cretaceous transition is accessible. The over 500 m thick sedimentary succession exposes the Oxfordian to Valanginian Ringnes and Deer Bay formations. Macrofauna from 15 discrete horizons includes ammonites, Buchia bivalves and belemnites. These fossils improve the biostratigraphy of the Tithonian and Berriasian in the Sverdrup Basin, provide correlation to the remainder of the Boreal Realm and set reliable calibration points. The occurrence of Buchia rugosa in the Ringnes Formation moves the upper formation boundary from the top of the Kimmeridgian into the lower Tithonian. Dorsoplanites maximus and D. sachsi document the middle Tithonian Dorsoplanites maximus Zone in Arctic Canada for the first time. The late Tithonian to early Berriasian Buchia terebratuloides is considered to be the best approximate indicator of the Jurassic-Cretaceous transition in the Rollrock Section. The middle early Berriasian Praetollia maynci and the late early Berriasian Borealites fedorovi tie the respective horizons to the successive Chetaites sibiricus and Hectoroceras kochi zones. Two species of the belemnite Arctoteuthis, collected from an interval with common glendonites, suggest a Valanginian age for the upper Deer Bay Formation. The dearth of Late Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous macrofossils in the Sverdrup Basin is inferred to be predominantly a function of diagenetic carbonate loss. Abundant dropstones and glendonites in the middle Tithonian to middle Valanginian interval suggest cold climatic conditions, and make the Rollrock Section a prime candidate for studying the Arctic environmental perturbations of this time.

AB  - Tsetse eradication continues to be a top priority for African governments including that of Senegal, which embarked on a project to eliminateGlossina palpalis gambiensisfrom the Niayes area, following an area-wide integrated pest management approach with an SIT component. A successful SIT programme requires competitive sterile males of high biological quality. This may be hampered by handling processes including irradiation and the release mechanisms, necessitating continued improvement of these processes, to maintain the quality of flies. A new prototype of an automated chilled adult release system (Bruno Spreader Innovation, (BSI (TM))) for tsetse flies was tested for its accuracy (in counting) and release rate consistency. Also, its impact on the quality of the released sterile males was evaluated on performance indicators, including flight propensity, mating competitiveness, premating and mating duration, insemination rate of mated females and survival of male flies. The BSI(TM)release system accurately counted and homogenously released flies at the lowest motor speed set (0.6 rpm), at a consistent rate of 60 +/- 9.58 males/min. Also, the release process, chilling (6 +/- 1 degrees C) and passing of flies through the machine) had no significant negative impact on the male flight propensity, mating competitiveness, premating and mating durations and the insemination rates. Only the survival of flies was negatively affected whether under feeding or starvation. The positive results of this study show that the BSI (TM) release system is promising for use in future tsetse SIT programmes. However, the negative impact of the release process on survival of flies needs to be addressed in future studies and results of this study confirmed under operational field conditions in West Africa.

AB  - The present study applies a composite index, after compensating livelihood vulnerability index and climatic vulnerability index, where the core part lies with the foundation of IPCC's model. The encompassing subject of appraisal is the multidimensional poverty and vulnerability conditions of snake charmers in two eastern states of India (Bihar and Odisha), due to external shocks and stressors coming from the stringent environment laws and the effect of globalization. Here, three major dimensions (i.e. exposure, adaptive capacity and sensitivity), eight major components (i.e. socio-demographic profile, livelihood strategies, social network, food, health, water, impact of laws, and impact of globalization), and 82 sub-components or indicators have been integrated in accordance with the requirement of the study, for addressing the survival vulnerability of this marginal group. Based on the survey of 208 (Bihar) and 226 (Odisha) household data, a customized index is computed and varied dimension-wise and major component-wise vulnerabilities are compared spatially. The results have established almost similar scenarios of survival vulnerability of snake charmers across the states. Whereas in the two respective states the dimension of exposure is higher than rest dimensions like adaptive capacity and sensitivity, and this dimension indirectly affects the other two, which creates the ultimate vulnerability and not only reduces the resiliencies for adaptation but also enhance the magnitude of sensitivity. This pragmatic SuVI would be useful for assessing the vulnerability of any marginal group and also for reframing crisis-oriented policy and program, precisely for breaking the 'chain' of the vicious circle of misery from snake charmers' lives.

AB  - Soil erosion, especially water erosion, is one of the most widespread types of soil degradation, not only worldwide, but also within the Czech Republic, where it endangers more than a half of the agricultural land. In addition to farming, the landscape structure has a significant impact on soil erosion in the conditions under study, where, especially in the post-war period, the collectivisation of large-scale arable land was accompanied by the abolition of the associated landscape elements. The agricultural production area of South Moravia is one of the most endangered areas in the Czech Republic, therefore, it was selected for our research, whose main objective was to verify the sensitivity of the selected physical, chemical and biochemical characteristics to identify the changes in the soil properties in the erosion processes at the identified erosion areas. The testing was carried out within a period of 5 years in 60 locations with Chernozems with cultivated corn. To assess the quality of the soil properties, indicators of soil quality from the physical, chemical and biological - biochemical groups were selected. The results of the analyses and the subsequent statistical evaluation showed that the chemical characteristics, especially those related to the quantity and quality of the organic matter, were the most sensitive to the changes in the soil properties. From the biochemical indicators, some enzymes, particularly dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase, reacted sensitively. The physical characteristics were not significantly affected by the erosion processes.

AB  - Crop yields usually respond to crop rotation, but they may interact with tillage system and year (as an integration of variables, mainly in terms of temperature and precipitation). The objective of this study was to evaluate the determinants of the irrigated durum wheat yield under long-term tillage system x crop rotation (2000-2008). Tillage factor considered two levels: moldboard plow plus disk harrow (CT) and no-till (NT) and crop rotations factor had three levels: wheat-fallow-canola (W-F-C), wheat-maize (W-M) and wheat-fallow (W-F). Last year, we evaluate a maize crop as a physical soil quality indicator. The tillage system x crop rotation interaction was not significant, and the lowest durum wheat yield and biomass were observed in the W-M rotation experimental year (reduction of 18.7%). Tillage system x year interaction was significant for wheat yield. Partial least squares analysis indicated that precipitation was high between sowing and 3rd leaf was determinant for yield, and a negative correlation between these variables was observed. Despite the above, no differences were observed in the maize yield directly attributable to physical soil properties. Our study shows that rainfall distribution appears to cause of the tillage system x year interaction for durum wheat yield. When the precipitation was higher (160 mm) between sowing and 3rd leaf, yield decreased in NT by 37% compared to CT possible due to a hypoxia condition and/or low plant-available soil nitrogen, with a negative effect over tillering, affecting in the long-term spike number per square meter.

AB  - We examine the fundamental tenets of the theory of geochemical barriers and their role in landscapes associated with an intensification of migration processes caused by an enhancement in anthropogenic activity, including in the sphere of industrial production. Observational evidence indicates that the flow of multiple elements in the form of substances, which is produced by the aluminum smelters of Khakassia and enters the landscapes through the atmosphere, contains the associations of hydrous migrating pollutants. According to their accumulation weight, they can be subdivided into the following groups: main pollutants-F, Al, Na and Ni whose content in the melt water exceeds the background level by factors of 10 to100, associated pollutants-Mn, Sr, Ca and Mg (exceeding the background levels by a factor of 10), and secondary pollutants-Si, Zn, Ba, K, Fe, V and Pb (exceeding the background level by factors of 1.8 to 7.0). For all the indicators analyzed, including toxicity, fluorine has been identified as the priority pollutant, and special emphasis was placed on it in the analysis of the migration mechanisms. The following geochemical barriers play an important role in the accumulation and migration processes of pollutants: biogeochemical (organogenic and humus-organogenic, and sorption), and physicochemical (sedimentation, evaporation, and multifunctional: solonetz). It has been found that in conditions of technogenesis, soil-geochemical barriers do not conform fully to a classical understanding of the function of the barrier, i. e. the transition of elements to an inactive or slightly active form, as they can accumulate not only in a slightly active, but also in an active form. It allowed us to expand the concept of geochemical barriers and define them as active barriers or starter barriers.

AB  - Inappropriate processing and disposal of electronic waste contributes to the contamination of aquatic systems by various types of pollutants such as the rare-earth elements (REE) in which lanthanum (La) is included. Knowledge on the toxicity of these elements in marine organisms is still scarce when compared to other metals such as mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As). Therefore, this study aims to assess the toxicity of La on the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, considered a good bioindicator of aquatic pollution, through the analysis of metabolic, oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and histopathological markers. Organisms were exposed to different concentrations of La for a period of 28 days (0, 0.1, 1, 10 mg/L) under controlled temperature (18 degrees C +/- 1.0) and salinity (30 +/- 1) conditions. La concentrations in mussels increased in higher exposure concentrations. La exposure demonstrated a biochemical response in mussels, evidenced by lowered metabolism and accumulation of energy reserves, activation of the antioxidant defences SOD and GPx as well as the biotransformation enzymes GSTs, especially at intermediate concentrations. Despite oxidative stress being shown by a decrease in GSH/GSSG, oxidative damage was avoided as evidenced by lower LPO and PC levels. Inhibition of the enzyme AChE demonstrated the neurotoxicity of La in this species. Histopathological indices were significantly different from the control group, indicating impacts in gonads, gills and digestive glands of mussels due to La. These results show that La can be considered a risk for marine organisms and thus its discharge into the environment should be monitored.

AB  - This article attempts to investigate the measure effect of rubble roadbed engineering in permafrost regions of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. As a case study, Chaidaer-Muli Railway is used to evaluate the measure effect of rubble roadbed engineering in permafrost regions. The AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method is thus employed to establish the evaluation indicator system. The evaluation factor is selected by analyzing the mutual relation between the permafrost environment and roadbed engineering. Thus, a hierarchical structure model is established based on the selected evaluation indices. Each factor is weighted to determine the status in the evaluation system, and grading standards are built for providing a basis for the evaluation. Then, the fuzzy mathematical method is introduced to evaluate the measure effect of rubble roadbed engineering in permafrost regions along the Chadaer-Muli Railway. Results show that most of the permafrost roadbed is in a preferable condition (b) along the Chaidaer-Muli Railway due to rubble engineering measures. This proportion reaches to 86.1%. The proportion in good (a), general (c) and poor states (d) are 0.0%, 7.5% and 6.4%, respectively, in all the evaluation sections along the Chaidaer-Muli Railway. Ground-temperature monitoring results are generally consistent with AHP-FUZZY evaluation results. This means that the AHP-FUZZY method can be applied to evaluate the effect of rubble roadbed engineering measures in permafrost regions. The effect evaluation of engineering measures will provide timely and effective feedback information for further engineering design. The series of engineering measures will more effectively protect permafrost stability.

AB  - Urbanization presents numerous challenges to aquatic species. For fish, typical threats include altered flow dynamics, poor water quality, and degraded food webs. These threats can be detrimental to fish and whether urban environments can support healthy populations is unclear. Tryon Creek is one of the largest urban watersheds in Portland, Oregon where developed land accounts for 55.6% of total land use. We used demographic, life history, disease, and genetic indices to assess the overall health of the Coastal Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) population in Tryon Creek. Results of these population indicators were within ranges for streams with Coastal Cutthroat Trout populations not influenced by urbanization and considered healthy. Coastal Cutthroat Trout in Tryon Creek exhibited a mean condition factor of 1.07 (95% CI 0.95-1.19, range 0.94-1.24), four size-classes, an estimated density of 0.01-0.03 individuals/m(2), and migratory behavior. The population did not exhibit excessive deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic diversity in Tryon Creek (H-e = 0.76; allelic richness = 6.6) was comparable to that observed in non-urbanized streams in the Mt. Hood National Forest (H-e = 0.72; allelic richness = 5.6). Moreover, allele frequencies appeared stable, and no genetic divergence was detected among generations (F (ST) similar to 0.00; non-significant allele frequency heterogeneity tests). The population tested negative for 12 different pathogens and results for Renibacterium salmoninarum were inconclusive. The characteristics of Coastal Cutthroat Trout in Tryon Creek were similar to populations not influenced by urbanization which suggests an urban stream can support a healthy fish population.

AB  - Species-level indicators based on the Montreal Process criteria and indicators framework are used to report Australia's progress towards sustainable forest management, in national and international reporting of Australia's forest biodiversity status and trends. This paper reviews the historical development of these indicators and related databases. A recent major development has been the establishment of a comprehensive suite of national inventory databases on Australia's native forest-dwelling vertebrate fauna and vascular flora for reporting in the Australia's State of the Forests Report series. Although these databases are incomplete, nearly 17 000 species records of vascular plants and over 2000 vertebrate species records have been assembled. Of the 2212 records of forest-dwelling vertebrate species, half (1101 species) are forest-dependent species that require a forest habitat for at least part of their lifecycle. Based on the frequency of habitat-use records, eucalypt open forest and eucalypt woodland forest are the most important habitat types for both forest-dwelling and forest-dependent vertebrate species. Monitoring of species varies nationally and across states and territories, with the most comprehensive approach undertaken in south-west Western Australia. Improved application of these databases to the reporting of species indicators will require improved collection of species records, inclusion of habitat data in records, and analysis of these records as time series with changing forest cover and condition. These databases also have application for informing forest-related indicators for the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

AB  - Larch plantations play an important role in timber production and ecological benefits in China. However, our ability to quantitatively predict the growth at regional level is limited. The 3-PG model based on physiological principles is widely used to predict the stand growth of different types and to simulate the effects of forest management, climate change and site characteristics. This paper presents an assessment of the ability of the 3-PG model to simulate height, diameter at breast height (DBH), stocking, stand density and biomass partitioning in 81 plots of Changbai larch (Larix olgensis) plantations across Jilin Province, northeastern China. The results showed that 3-PG model can adequately estimate stand density, DBH, biomass partitioning, with determination coefficients (R-2) between observed data and simulated data always higher than 0.93. The mean relative errors (MRE) of all indicators were below 15%. Except stocking, relative root mean square errors (RRMSE) of other indicators were below 20%. To improve the accuracy, we propose to modify the parameter values of fertility rating (FR) and age at canopy cover (fullCanAge) obtained by default so as to adjust growth rates of Larix olgensis plantations to the changeable weather condition in Jilin Province. Sensitivity analysis showed that FR and fullCanAge are the key parameters of the model. The results provided strong evidence that 3-PG can be applied over a wide geographical range using one set of parameters for Larix olgensis. The model can also be applied to estimate the impact of climate change on stands growing across a wide range of ages and stand characteristics.

AB  - Widespread agricultural losses attributed to drought, often combined with high temperatures, frequently occur in the field, namely in Mediterranean climate areas, where the existing scenarios for climate change indicate an increase in the frequency of heat waves and severe drought events in summer. Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is the most cultivated fruit species in the world and the most valuable one and is a traditional Mediterranean species. Currently, viticulture must adjust to impending climate changes that are already pushing vine-growers toward the use of ancient and resilient varieties. Portugal is very rich in grapevine biodiversity, however, currently, 90% of the total producing area is planted with only 16 varieties. There is a pressing need to understand the existing genetic diversity and the physiological potential of the varieties/genotypes available to be able to respond to climate changes. With the above scenario in mind, an assembly of 65 differentially expresses genes (DEGs) previously identified as responsive to abiotic stresses in two well studied genotypes, 'Touriga Nacional' and 'Trincadeira,' was designed to scan the gene expression of leaf samples from 10 traditional Portuguese varieties growing in two regions with distinct environmental conditions. Forty-five of those DEGs proved to be associated to "abiotic stress" and were chosen to build a custom qPCR array to identify uncharacterized genotypes as sensitive or tolerant to abiotic stress. According to the experimental set-up behind the array design these DEGs can also be used as indicators of the main abiotic stress that the plant is subjected and responding to (drought, heat, or excess light).

AB  - Length of the secondary forest fallow period has often played an important role in affecting the soil fertility status for first year cultivation of crops in shifting cultivation system. However, information regarding the soils after the first year cultivation is limited. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of different shifting cultivation fallow period on the dynamics of soil health status during the first and second year. Results suggest that increase in the fallow period significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the bulk density (BD), while increasing the soil organic carbon (SOC), soil nutrients, MBC and enzyme activities. While the SOC decreases between 6.1 and 31.3% due to cultivation compared to the soil condition before burning during the first year, MBC decreases between 33.61 and 60.9%. The SOC was recovered at the end of second year, while the MBC increases sharply during the second year. Enzyme activities in general decreased after burning and increased gradually during the second year. PCA results indicated that length of fallow period > 10 year maintains one cluster where fallow period including 10 and below maintains another cluster during the first and second year. Results therefore suggest that MBC, MBC:SOC and soil enzyme activities played as an indicator of soil health and maintaining secondary forest fallow period > 10 years was better in conserving soil health for first and second year under shifting cultivation.

AB  - Retrospective descriptive secondary analyses of data from relationships of indoor, outdoor, and personal air (RIOPA) study homes (in Houston, Texas; Los Angeles County, California; and, Elizabeth, New Jersey May 1999-February 2001) were conducted. Data included air exchange rates, associations between indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity, and calculated apparent temperature and humidex. Analyses examined if study homes provided optimum thermal comfort for residents during both heating and cooling seasons when compared to current American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standards 62/62.1 and 55. Results suggested outdoor temperature, humidex, and apparent temperature during the cooling season potentially served as indicators of indoor personal exposure to parameters of thermal comfort. Outdoor temperatures, humidex, and apparent temperature during the cooling season had statistically significant predictive abilities in predicting indoor temperature. During the heating season, only humidex in Texas and combined data across study states were statistically significant, but with weaker to moderate predicative ability. The high degree of correlation between outdoor and indoor environmental variables provided support for the validity of epidemiologic studies of weather relying on temporal comparisons. Results indicated most RIOPA study residents experienced thermal comfort; however, many values indicated how several residents may have experienced some discomfort depending on clothing and indoor activities. With climate change, increases in temperature are expected, with more days of extreme heat and humidity and, potentially harsher, longer winters. Homes being built or modernized should be created with the appropriate guidelines to provide comfort for residents daily and in extreme weather events.

AB  - Background: The complexity of natural disasters is a fundamental aspect for coordination and integration activities from the public sectors' perspective. Tasks that are formally independent demonstrate a convergent and integrated character. Therefore, there is a justified need to synergic cooperation of public and private sector, NGOs, UN agencies, IFRC agencies, military and societies actions in the affected region. The main goal of the study was to identify similarities and differences in Japanese and American approaches to humanitarian logistics in the public sectors' perspective. Moreover, the second goal was to prepare an extended humanitarian logistics convergence procedure for national authorities.
   Methods: Critical analysis has been carried out in two highly developed countries of the global economy. Author indicates determinants which are conditioned by three different types of humanitarian logistics convergence.
   Results: The article describes the processes of concurrence at Japanese and American level in relation to humanitarian logistics. The characteristic of convergence factors has been followed by theoretical considerations concerning analyzed problem. Author indicates determinants with highest level of convergence as well as with the biggest differentiation. As a result, an extended procedure for national authorities that covers both outstanding approaches has been presented.
   Conclusions: Neutralizing, minimizing and eliminating of natural disasters' negative effects are not an easy task. The article highlights the importance of public sectors' activities which are fundamental aspects of humanitarian logistics actions. Their coordination and integration play a key role in efficiency. Hence, all authorities interested in the analyzed concept may follow the presented procedure. Nevertheless, there is a necessity to conduct an indicator analysis associated with natural disasters occurrence, economic growth, logistics ratios, risk indexes as well as other determinants that cover convergence.

AB  - Underground structures have a major influence on groundwater temperature and have a major contribution on the anthropogenic heat fluxes into urban aquifers. Groundwater temperature is crucial for resource management as it can provide operational sustainability indicators for groundwater quality and geothermal energy. Here, a three dimensional heat transport modeling approach was conducted to quantify the thermally affected zone (TAZ, i.e. increase in temperature of more than +0.5 degrees C) caused by two common underground structures: (1) an impervious structure and (2) a draining structure. These design techniques consist in (1) ballasting the underground structure in order to resist hydrostatic pressure, or (2) draining the groundwater under the structure in order to remove the hydrostatic pressure. The volume of the TAZ caused by these underground structures was shown to range from 14 to 20 times the volume of the underground structure. Additionally, the cumulative impact of underground structures was assessed under average thermal conditions at the scale of the greater Lyon area (France). The heat island effect caused by underground structures was highlighted in the business center of the city. Increase in temperature of more than +4.5 degrees C were locally put in evidence. The annual heat flow from underground structures to the urban aquifer was computed deterministically and represents 4.5 GW.h. Considering these impacts, the TAZ of deep underground structures should be taken into account in the geothermal potential mapping. Finally, the amount of heat energy provided should be used as an indicator of heating potential in these areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Satellite thermal remote sensing potentially provides a new way to monitor local climate change due to urbanization, especially changes in surface temperatures that result in the surface urban heat island (SUHI). However, this technique is restricted to clear-sky conditions. Because of this limitation, satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) records are frequently interrupted, sometimes even becoming temporally sparse and, accordingly, climatically less representative. Given this challenge, we propose a strategy that incorporates an annual temperature cycle (ATC) model to perform temporal upscaling of the SUHI from a climatic perspective. Using two mega-cities (Beijing and Shanghai) as case studies, our major findings include: (1) urbanization tends to enlarge the amplitude of annual daytime LST series for both cities; (2) urbanization in Beijing narrows the diurnal LST range on annual average but broadens it in Shanghai; (3) within an annual cycle, the daytime SUHI intensity (SUHII) reaches its maximum one month later than the daytime LST maximum for Beijing, whereas this time difference is negligible for Shanghai; and (4) compared with the observation-based and moving-window-based temporal aggregations, the ATC-based temporal aggregation allows to produce a clear-sky SUHI climatology that is more representative and becomes potentially valuable for prediction or application purposes. From a climatic perspective, the temporal upscaling of the SUHI, therefore, provides insights into the impacts on local thermal environments that are induced by urbanization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The microclimate within western cotton (Gossypium spp.) seems favorable for the western tarnished plant bug (Lygus hesperus Knight) (Hemiptera: Miridae), provided adequate soil moisture is available. Diminishing water supplies and increasing costs in the West will likely change irrigation practices and induce at least periodically unfavorable conditions for L. hesperus. Knowledge of L. hesperus thermal ecology has been limited to constant temperatures for which relevance to variable temperature environments is unknown. Eggs of L. hesperus were reared under low (mean = 15 degrees C), medium (mean = 22 degrees C), or high (mean = 29 degrees C) constant (+/-<0.5 degrees C) or diurnally fluctuating (+/- 8 degrees C) temperatures. Developmental time and survival were similar between constant and variable regimes at the medium temperature. In contrast, variable low temperatures hastened egg development and increased survival, whereas variable high temperatures delayed development and reduced survival compared with constant regimes. Within the studied temperature range, the relationship between temperature and egg developmental rate was linear for constant temperatures, but a quadratic term was needed to describe this relationship under variable temperatures. Under medium variable temperatures, egg hatch was disproportionately high during the warmest period of the day (1300-1900 h) compared with the constant regime. Differences between regimes were less pronounced at high temperatures, except for the conspicuous absence of hatch between 1300 and 1900 h in the variable regime when temperatures were always >32 degrees C. These results indicate the limited utility of constant temperature data for understanding L. hesperus thermal ecology and provide baseline information to better plan and interpret applied studies of L. hesperus thermal ecology.

AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to describe the profile and alcoholic status of a population with alcohol use disorders (AUD) requesting help from a psychiatric hospital to stop drinking, as well as their clinical outcome and care consumption over the 2 years following the request.
   Methods: The visits were conducted at baseline (M0) and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months (M6, M12, M18, M24). Demographic, clinical and psychometric data [Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), AUDIT questionnaire, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale], and information regarding the use of psychiatric care and therapeutics were collected.
   Results: The 330 subjects included were mostly male, aged 45.2 +/- 10.2 years with an employment rate of 55.4 %, living alone (69.1 %), with a psychiatric comorbidity (60.9 %), especially depressive, and with few somatic complications. Their global functioning was poor (GAF score 49.14 +/- 15.6), and less than 10 % were addicted to another substance. The abstinence rate at 24 months was 41.4 %, but only 23 % (20) abstained continuously between M0 and M24, and 66.7 % (58) intermittently. The likelihood of abstinence at M24 was greater for females aged over 60 years. The BDI score decreased significantly between M0 and M24. In all, 56.2 % of the participants were re-hospitalized after weaning, but were not integrated in long-term medical care.
   Conclusions: Abstinence after alcohol withdrawal fluctuated over time indicating the need for long-term support. The treatment of AUD should not target total, continuous abstinence. Prognostic profiles combining socio-demographic, clinical and biological indicators must be established.

AB  - The Southern African Development Community's (SADC) water and energy sectors are under increasing pressure due to population growth and agricultural and industrial development. Climate change is also negatively impacting on the region's water and energy resources. As the majority of SADC's population lives in poverty, regional development and integration are underpinned by water and energy security as the watercourses in the region are transboundary in nature. This paper reviews the region's water and energy resources and recommends policies based on the water-energy nexus approach. This is achieved by reviewing literature on water and energy resources as well as policy issues. Water resources governance provides a strong case to create a water-energy nexus platform to support regional planning and integration as SADC countries share similar climatic and hydrological conditions. However, there has been a gap between water and energy sector planning in terms of policy alignment and technical convergence. These challenges hinder national policies on delivering economic and social development goals, as well as constraining the regional goal of greater integration. Regional objectives on sustainable energy and access to clean water for all can only be achieved through the recognition of the water-energy nexus, championed in an integrated and sustainable manner. A coordinated regional water-energy nexus approach stimulates economic growth, alleviates poverty and reduces high unemployment rates. The shared nature of water and energy resources requires far more transboundary water-energy nexus studies to be done in the context of regional integration and policy formulation.

AB  - Aims: To produce a phytosociological synthesis of acidophilous beech forests in Slovakia and to assess their main environmental gradients. Location: Slovakia. Methods: Cluster analysis (Beta flexible linkage method and Bray-Curtis distance as a dissimilarity measure) was used to find the main vegetation types, whereas detrended correspondence analysis and analysis of variance, corrected with the modified permutation test, were applied to determine the major environmental drivers in species composition. In order to perform a more representative selection of acidophilous beech forests, a preliminary data set of 2261 recent and historical phytosociological releves with a cover of Fagus sylvatica more than 25% in the tree layer was classified. The final data set consisting of 255 releves was repeatedly subjected to numerical classification. Results: Five associations, which matched to alliances Luzulo-Fagion sylvaticae and Fagion sylvaticae from the class Carpino-Fagetea, were accepted. They corresponded to the associations Poo chaixii-Fagetum sylvaticae Somsak 1979, Calamagrostio arundinaceae-Fagetum sylaticae Sykora 1971, Luzulo luzuloidis-Fagetum sylvaticae Meusel 1937, Melampyro pratensis-Fagetum sylvaticae Oberdorfer 1957 and Galio odorati-Fagetum sylvaticae Sougnez et Thill 1959 (subassociation festucetosurn drymejae Hubl et Holzner 1977). The principal environmental gradients responsible for floristic variability of the distinguished vegetation units were altitude, Ellenberg indicator values for soil reaction, mean annual precipitation and temperature. Conclusions: Our study provides the first complex syntaxonomic revision of acidophilous beech forests in Slovakia using unsupervised numerical classification and in accordance with application of ICPN nomenclatural rules. The proposed syntaxonomic scheme contains the associations distributed under similar habitat conditions throughout the Central Europe, but also the associations reflecting the local floristic and environmental patterns.

AB  - Soil chemical and microbial parameters are commonly used as soil quality indicators to evaluate sustainable land management in agroecosystems. The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of organic and conventional management strategies on biological, chemical and yield parameters in vineyards (Vitis vinifera cv. Sultani seedless). Organic plots received a mixture of barley, vetch and broad bean (25+35+75kg seed ha(-1)) as green manure, and farmyard manure (15t ha(-1)) every year. Inorganic fertilizers (NPK) and pesticides were used in the conventional managed vineyards. Conventional and mulch tillage methods were used in conventional and organic plots, respectively. Microbiological and chemical soil properties were determined in the soil samples which were taken four times in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. In addition, the yield and some quality parameters of vineyards were also determined. Soil microbial biomass, and dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase and alkaline phosphatase activity were significantly higher in organic management than in conventional management. Higher C-mic/C-org and lower qCO(2) values were found with the organic management. The response of the chemical indicators (C-org, N-t and available nutrient content) of the soils to different management systems appeared after a longer time than with the biological indicators. In the transition zone between continental and Mediterranean climates of West Turkey, soil quality of organically managed vineyards improved after 2 years of the transition period prescribed for organic certification. However, soil quality improvements in organic plots did not result in higher yield.

AB  - Increasing industrial developments increased the environmental pollution problems in many cities of the world. Air quality modelling and indexes are used to introduce the information on local air quality indicators in polluted regions. Estimation and monitoring of air quality in the city centres are important due to environmental health and comfort of human-related topics. Air quality approximation is a complicate subject that artificial intelligent techniques are successfully used for modelling the complicated and nonlinear approximation problems. In present study, artificial neural network and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy logic method developed to approximate the impact of certain environmental conditions on air quality and sulphur dioxide pollution level and used with this study in Konya city centre. Data of sulphur dioxide concentrations were collected from 15 selected points of Konya city for prediction of air quality. Using air quality standards, air quality was discussed by considering the sulphur dioxide concentration as independent variables with meteorological parameters. Different meteorological parameters were used for investigation of pollution relation. One of the important modelling tools, adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system model, was used to assess performance by a number of checking data collected from different sampling stations in Konya. The outcomes of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system model was evaluated by fuzzy quality charts and compared to the results obtained from Turkey and Environmental Protection Agency air quality standards. From the present results, fuzzy rule-based adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system model is a valuable tool prediction and assessment of air quality and tends to propagate accurate results.

AB  - In most high-latitude wetlands, carbon accumulation as peat represents a balance between plant net primary productivity and heterotrophic decomposition. We hypothesized that this assessment of ecosystem metabolism is incomplete as it does not include information on energy inputs from microalgae, which form complex biofilms with heterotrophic micro-organisms on the peat surface. To investigate the potential for algae (and associated exudates) to support heterotrophic metabolism under ambient and elevated nutrient levels, we conducted a factorial enrichment of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and carbon (glucose) in mesocosms with and without the presence of algae (using light-transparent and dark treatments, respectively) in an Alaskan fen. We measured respiration rates and changes in bacterial biomass to characterize the response of heterotrophic bacteria to our experimental treatments. During incubation assays, algae released up to 38% of their net productivity as exudates and there was a positive relationship between algal production and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon inside mesocosms. Elevated algal productivity in the presence of nutrient enrichment stimulated heterotrophic bacterial respiration and biomass. These responses did not occur with nutrient enrichment in the dark (without algae). The response of bacteria to algae was similar in magnitude to bacterial responses to glucose enrichment.Synthesis. We conclude that bacteria in this boreal fen were primarily limited by labile carbon, and this constraint was alleviated in the presence of elevated algal production. Consequently, algae may facilitate hotspots of microbial activity in northern peatlands, especially in conditions of greater nutrient availability associated with more variable hydrology expected for this region with ongoing climate change.

AB  - Blackfly larvae are known as indicators of physical and chemical conditions in rivers, and the adults may be harmful for humans and cattle. In order to obtain more insight into the environmental variables governing the distribution of various blackfly species, a survey was conducted in 2000-2004 in the Nemunas River (Lithuania) and in its four major tributaries. The total density of blackfly larvae, the density of each species, hydrochemical parameters (concentrations of dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen and phosphorus, pH, concentration of suspended matter and permanganatic oxidation of organic matter) and hydrophysical parameters (current velocity, discharge and water temperature) were recorded. The total density of blackfly larvae was significantly positively correlated with the concentration of suspended matter at the respective study sites. The concentration of suspended matter and the permanganatic oxidation of organic matter were positively associated with the densities of Simulium maculatum, Simulium reptans and Simulium erythrocephalum and negatively with the densities of Simulium equinum and the Simulium ornatum group. Water temperature had a positive influence on the density of S. erythrocephalum and a negative influence on the density of S. equinum larvae. The density of Simulium lineatum was positively associated with the concentration of total nitrogen, and the density of Simulium morsitans was positively associated with the current velocity. Redundancy analysis have proven these associations. The analysis of the relationships between the densities of seven blackfly species and nine environmental variables in large and medium-sized rivers in Lithuania revealed that parameters related to organic pollution had an influence on the densities of most of investigated species.

AB  - Kraft pulp mills use activated sludge systems to remove organic matter from effluents. Process streams may appear as toxic spills in treatment plant effluents, such as black liquor, which is toxic to microorganisms of the activated sludge. The present study evaluates the effects of black liquor shocks in activated sludge systems. Four black liquor shocks from 883 to 3,225mg chemical oxygen demand-COD L-1 were applied during 24hours in a continuously operating lab-scale activated sludge system. Removal efficiencies of COD, color and specific compounds were determined. Moreover, specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR), sludge volumetric index (SVI) and indicator microorganisms were evaluated. Results show that the addition of black liquor caused an increase in COD removal (76-67%) immediately post shock; followed two days later by a decrease (-19-50%). On the other hand, SOUR ranged between 0.152 and 0.336 mgO(2) g(-1) volatile suspended solids-VSS center dot min(-1) during shocks, but the initial value was reestablished at hour 24. When the COD concentration of the shock was higher than 1,014mg/L, the abundance of stalked ciliates and rotifers dropped. Finally, no changes in SVI were observed, with values remaining in the range 65.8-40.2mL g(-1) total suspended solids-TSS during the entire operating process. Based on the results, the principal conclusion is that the activated sludge system with the biomass adapted to the kraft pulp effluent could resist a black liquor shock with 3,225 mgCOD L-1 of concentration during 24h, under this study's conditions.

TI  - CEH-GEAR: 1km resolution daily and monthly areal rainfall estimates for the UK for hydrological and other applications
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
LA  - English
KW  - SCALE
KW  - DEPOSITION
AB  - The Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - Gridded Estimates of Areal Rainfall (CEH-GEAR) data set was developed to provide reliable 1 km gridded estimates of daily and monthly rainfall for Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (NI) (together with approximately 3500 km(2) of catchment in the Republic of Ireland) from 1890 onwards. The data set was primarily required to support hydrological modelling.
   The rainfall estimates are derived from the Met Office collated historical weather observations for the UK which include a national database of rain gauge observations. The natural neighbour interpolation methodology, including a normalisation step based on average annual rainfall (AAR), was used to generate the daily and monthly rainfall grids. To derive the monthly estimates, rainfall totals from monthly and daily (when complete month available) rain gauges were used in order to obtain maximum information from the rain gauge network. The daily grids were adjusted so that the monthly grids are fully consistent with the daily grids.
   The CEH-GEAR data set was developed according to the guidance provided by the British Standards Institution. The CEH-GEAR data set contains 1 km grids of daily and monthly rainfall estimates for GB and NI for the period 1890-2012. For each day and month, CEH-GEAR includes a secondary grid of distance to the nearest operational rain gauge. This may be used as an indicator of the quality of the estimates. When this distance is greater than 100 km, the estimates are not calculated due to high uncertainty.
   CEH-GEAR is available from doi:10.5285/5dc179dc-f692-49ba-9326-a6893a503f6e and is free of charge for commercial and non-commercial use subject to licensing terms and conditions.

AB  - This paper outlines an experimental analysis of ground-borne vibration levels generated by high speed rail lines on various earthwork profiles (at-grade, embankment, cutting and overpass). It also serves to provide access to a dataset of experimental measurements, freely available for download by other researchers working in the area of railway vibration (e.g. for further investigation and/or the validation of vibration prediction models).
   First, the work outlines experimental investigations undertaken on the Belgian high speed rail network to investigate the vibration propagation characteristics of three different embankment conditions. The sites consist of a 5.5 m high embankment, an at-grade section and a 7.2 m deep cutting. The soil material properties of each site are determined using a 'Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves' technique and verified using refraction analysis. It is shown that all sites have relatively similar material properties thus enabling a generalised comparison.
   Vibration levels are measured in three directions, up to 100 m from the track due to three different train types (Eurostar, TGV and Thalys) and then analysed statistically. It is found that contrary to commonly accepted theory, vertical vibrations are not always the most dominant, and that horizontal vibrations should also be considered, particularly at larger offsets. It is also found that the embankment earthworks profile produced the lowest vibration levels and the cutting produced the highest. Furthermore, a low (positive) correlation between train speed and vibration levels was found. A selection of the results can be downloaded from www.davidpconnolly.com. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pelagic marine carbonates provide important records of past environmental change. We carried out detailed low-temperature magnetic measurements on biogenic magnetite-bearing sediments from the Southern Ocean (Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Holes 738B, 738C, 689D, and 690C) and on samples containing whole magnetotactic bacteria cells. We document a range of low-temperature magnetic properties, including reversible humped low-temperature cycling (LTC) curves. Different degrees of magnetite oxidation are considered to be responsible for the observed variable shapes of LTC curves. A dipole spring mechanism in magnetosome chains is introduced to explain reversible LTC curves. This dipole spring mechanism is proposed to result from the uniaxial anisotropy that originates from the chain arrangement of biogenic magnetite, similar to published results for uniaxial stable single domain (SD) particles. The dipole spring mechanism reversibly restores the remanence during warming in LTC measurements. This supports a previous idea that remanence of magnetosome chains is completely reversible during LTC experiments. We suggest that this magnetic fingerprint is a diagnostic indicator for intact magnetosome chains, although the presence of isolated uniaxial stable SD particles and magnetically interacting particles can complicate this test. Magnetic measurements through the Eocene section of ODP Hole 738B reveal an interval with distinct magnetic properties that we interpret to originate from less oxidized biogenic magnetite and enrichment of a biogenic hard component. Co-occurrence of these two magnetic fingerprints during the late Eocene in the Southern Ocean indicates less oxic conditions, probably due to increased oceanic primary productivity and organic carbon burial.

AB  - Heavy metal contamination, low pH and high substrate heterogeneity are multiple stress factors that often occur at the post-mining sites and make difficult the biological reclamation. Efficient tools for detection of the status of reclaimed vegetation at post-mining sites are needed. We tested the potential of visible to near infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy to detect multiple stresses in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) at acidic substrates rich in As. The needle chemical traits (chlorophyll a + b - Cab; carotenoids - Car; Car/Cab; relative water content - RWC; soluble phenolics; lignin contents) were tested for sensitivity to different soil conditions of post mining sites. For Scots pine growing on degraded substrates, at least three non-specific stress indicators (RWC, photosynthetic pigments and phenolics) are required to achieve good site separability corresponding to the stress load. We constructed and validated empirical models of selected needle chemical traits using VNIR spectroscopy: calibration of Cab (R-2 = 0.97, RMSE = 0.17 mg g(-1)), RWC (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 1.41 mg g(-1)), Car (R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 0.08 mg g(-1)), phenolics (R-2 = 0.64, RMSE = 23.01 mg g(-1)) and lignin (R-2 = 0.45, RMSE = 3.32 mg g(-1)). The reflectance data yielded comparable site separability with the separability calculated from the laboratory data. The presented approach has potential for large scale monitoring of Scots pine status, thus, assessment of reclamation quality in post-mining regions using air- born or satellite hyperspectral data.

AB  - Streams running through terrestrial-aquatic palm ecotones (Morichals) are widely distributed in the Orinoco basin and the Brazilian Cerrado; however, little is known about how these ecosystems respond to human actions. We investigated the effects of land use changes on water chemistry and benthic chlorophyll in five low-order streams in the Orinoco lowlands, Venezuela. Current land use and land use changes from 1977 to 2007 were analyzed for the ecotone and catchment areas above each sampling site. At monthly intervals over a 16-month period, discharge was measured and samples were collected at each stream for water chemistry and benthic chlorophyll. Multivariate techniques were used to analyze spatial and temporal variation in streams and their relationship with land use. Changes in land use over 30 years were characterized by loss of savanna vegetation and increase in agricultural and urban areas. Multivariate analyses indicated that spatial and temporal variations observed in the streams were related to current ecotonal forest and to rates of change in catchment land use between 1977 and 2007. Impacts of land use change on stream variables depended primarily on the rate of savanna loss, increase in fallow land and the rate of increase of urban area. Streams draining catchments with a lower proportion of ecotonal forest, greater rates of savanna loss and increase in fallow land showed higher chlorophyll and nitrate concentrations. Higher phosphorus and suspended solids concentrations, runoff and conductivity were observed in streams with higher rates of increase in urban lands in their catchments. Our results suggest that ecotonal vegetation and the magnitude of land use change have implications for stream condition.

AB  - As corals grow, they incorporate chemical indicators of seawater conditions into their aragonite skeleton after they have traversed an outer living tissue layer. Long-lived, massive coral skeletons can record decade-and century-long time series of seawater status. One such environmental clue is luminescence intensity which can correspond to river flow patterns and has been attributed to humic acid incorporation. Seawater humic acid levels are linked to river flow as rainfall extracts them from catchment soils to then flow into rivers and coastal seas. However, discrepancies exist when validating coral luminescence records against river flow data with intense luminescence sometimes occurring in the absence of increased flows. This contributes to uncertainty when reconstructing pre-instrumental river flows and rainfall from coral luminescence. Here we demonstrate that a major portion of coral core luminescence time series can be explained using a single-compartment, pharmacokinetic model that incorporates river flow measurements as the equivalent of drug dose. The model was robust for luminescence series in corals from near-shore reefs regularly influenced by river flow. The model implies that after floods, a proportion of subsequent luminescence peaks can be derived from the initial flood. This explains why some luminescence peaks after floods often do not correspond to additional significant river flows. This provides the first mechanism-based explanation for temporal changes in coral skeleton luminescence that incorporates a mathematical link between two independent time series making this proxy even more robust for reconstructing river flow and rainfall.

AB  - The current study aims to examine the hypothesis that the determination of the emergence rate is a possible indicator of the plant potential to tolerate soil salinity under field conditions. This hypothesis is analysed using specific experiments on salt-sensitive (chickpea and broad bean) and salt-tolerant (durum wheat and barley) species.
   For each of the four crops, two varieties that displayed a clear difference in yield production under a saline environment were subjected to two types of analysis. The first type of analysis was used to classify the salt-tolerance of different varieties using two criteria as follows: (1) the relationship between yield and soil salinity; (2) the water use efficiency. The second type of analysis determined the emergence rate as a function of the irrigation-water salinity.
   The criteria that were used in the current study for classifying the varietal salt-tolerance of each crop provided similar conclusions. However, the hypothesis that the emergence rate was associated with the varietal potential for salt-tolerance was not confirmed by the results of this analysis. On the contrary, the results demonstrated that some varieties combined poor emergence with a high crop salt-tolerance. These varieties included ILC 3279 of the chickpea and Cham-1 of the durum wheat.
   The current study does not support the hypothesis that postulated the existence of a correlation between the emergence rate and the potential of a variety to tolerate the soil salinity. Finally, practical applications of these conclusions are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reductions in the availability of energetically valuable prey associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may force seabirds to switch to low-energy prey or smaller prey, with consequent effects on their fitness. Impacts of ENSO on seabird diet have been documented in several regions but remain unexplored in the warm eastern tropical Pacific. Analysis of 5 yr of data on the blue-footed booby Sula nebouxii, a seabird specialized on small pelagic fish, revealed that both sexes switch diet and capture fewer types of prey when warm El Nino conditions prevail during the breeding season. Moreover, ENSO-related alternations in the relative abundances of anchovies and herrings, the main prey of these boobies and important commercial fishes in the region, were associated with boobies feeding on more and larger anchovies and fewer and smaller herrings during warm El Nino events, and vice versa during cold La Nina episodes. Females consumed herrings more frequently than males across the 5 yr and consistently fed on larger anchovies and herrings than males, with these differences likely due to this booby's reversed sexual size-dimorphism. We conclude that diet composition and prey size of boobies may be sensitive to variation in relative availabilities of different prey species associated with the ENSO, making these birds robust indicators of environmental fluctuations in the warm eastern tropical Pacific. Inter-annual variations in the availability of herrings, probably the most energetically valuable prey for these boobies, may explain the large ENSO-related variations in booby reproduction documented previously.

AB  - Presymptomatic testing (PST) is available for a range of late-onset disorders. Health practitioners generally follow guidelines regarding appropriate number of counseling sessions, involvement of multidisciplinary teams, topics for pretest discussion, and follow-up sessions; however, more understanding is needed about what helps consultands effectively and the impact of amount and quality of genetic counseling on the psychosocial sequelae of PST for late-onset disorders. We conducted a thematic analysis of three review articles on quality of the genetic counseling process, aiming at (1) exploring current evidence; (2) identifying quality assessment indicators; and (3) making recommendations for genetic counseling practice in late-onset disorders. We undertook a systematic search of 6 relevant databases: 38 articles were identified and 3 fitted our inclusion criteria; after quality appraisal, all were included in the review. The number of sessions, time spent, consultation environment, follow-up, and multidisciplinarity were identified as variables for quality assessment. Research on counseling in the context of genetic testing in familial cancer tends to be related to outcomes and indicators for quality assessment, while research concerning other late-onset diseases is mainly focused on the psychological impact of the test results. The quality and content of the overall process in noncancer late-onset diseases is insufficiently articulated. Despite the fact that PST for Huntington disease and other degenerative conditions has been offered for more than 20 years, good methodological approaches to assess quality of genetic counseling in that context remain elusive. This restricts improvement of the protocols for genetic services and, in general, healthcare for the at-risk population.

AB  - Mesotrione is a carotenoid biosynthesis-inhibiting herbicide labeled for pre-emergence and postemergence weed control in corn production. Understanding the factors that influence the dissipation of mesotrione in soil and in the plant-available water (PAW) is important for the environmental fate assessment and optimal weed management practices. The present research investigated the role of soil properties and microbial activities on the interrelated sorption and degradation processes of mesotrione in four soils by direct measurements of PAW. We found that mesotrione bound to the soils time dependently, with approximately 14 d to reach equilibrium. The 24-h batch-slurry equilibrium experiments provided the sorption partition coefficient ranging from 0.26 to 3.53 L kg(-1), depending on soil organic carbon and pH. The dissipation of mesotrione in the soil-bound phase was primarily attributed to desorption to the PAW. Degradation in the PAW was rapid and primarily dependent on microbial actions, with half-degradation time (DT50) <3 d in all four soils tested. The rapid degradation in the PAW became rate limited by sorption as more available molecules were depleted in the soil pore water, resulting in a more slowed overall process for the total soil-water system (DT50 <26 d). The dissipation of mesotrione in the PAW was due to microbial metabolism and time-dependent sorption to the soils. A coupled kinetics model calibrated with the data from the laboratory centrifugation technique provided an effective approach to investigate the interrelated processes of sorption and degradation in realistic soil moisture conditions.

AB  - The central tenet of biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) theory, that species richness increases function, could motivate restoration practitioners to incorporate a greater number of species into their projects. But it is not yet clear how well BEF theory predicts outcomes of restoration, because it has been developed through tests involving short-run and tightly controlled (e. g., weeded) experiments. Thus, we resampled our 1997 BEF experiment in a restored salt marsh to test for long-term effects of species richness (plantings with 1, 3, and 6 species per 2 3 2 m plot), with multiple ecosystem functions as response variables. Over 11 years, 1- and 6-species assemblages converged on intermediate richness (mean 3.9 species/0.25-m 2 plot), and composition changed nonrandomly throughout the site. While three species became rare, the two most productive species became co-dominant. The two dominants controlled and increased shoot biomass, which appeared to decrease species richness. Diversity-function relationships became less positive over 11 years and differed significantly with (a) the species-richness metric (planted vs. measured), and (b) the indicator of function (shoot biomass, height, and canopy layering). The loss of positive relationships between species richness and function in our restored site began soon after we stopped weeding and continued with increasing dominance by productive species. Where species-rich plantings are unlikely to ensure long-term restoration of functions, as in our salt marsh, we recommend dual efforts to establish (1) dominant species that provide high levels of target functions, and (2) subordinate species, which might provide additional functions under current or future conditions.

AB  - Leaf fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is an important indicator of plant responses to various sources of stress, which range from poor nutritional and harsh environmental conditions to herbivory and parasitism. Mistletoes are important hemiparasites, which represent a source of stress for their host plants but, in spite of being common in all major biogeographical regions of the world, no study has measured the response of their hosts in terms of leaf FA. We addressed the effect of mistletoes on host plant foliar FA by comparing parasitized and non-parasitized individuals of four host species in two sites in southeastern Brazil, Serra do Cipo and Serra do Rola Moca. In the four host species, parasitized individuals presented significantly higher levels of leaf FA than unattacked plants. The specialist mistletoe Phoradendron cf. amplexicaule induced higher levels of FA on its host Erythroxylum suberosum (Erythroxylaceae) than the generalist mistletoe Struthanthus flexicaulis did on either Mimosa calodendron (Fabaceae), Lychnophora pinaster (Asteraceae) or Stachytarpheta glabra (Verbenaceae). We hypothesized that specialized parasites could be more damaging to their hosts than generalist mistletoes, which could explain the higher FA levels observed. Significant differences in FA levels among parasitized individuals within species were found, which were significantly correlated with intensity of infection (number of mistletoes per host individual). The results indicate that mistletoes represent an important factor of stress for their host plants, and that FA can be an excellent instrument for evaluating the effects of infections by parasitic plants.

AB  - Nutrient loading has been implicated as a major cause of ecological changes in Everglades Wetlands. The main objective of this study was to assess changes in microbial indicators in response to nutrient loading across the Everglades landscape. Soil chemical, physical, and microbial properties were measured for nutrient-impacted and oligotrophic sites within Water Conservation Area (WCA)-1, WCA-2a, WCA-3a, and Taylor Slough of Everglades National Park. Impacts of nutrient loading were most evident by the development of gradients in floc and soil total P from peripheral to interior areas of all wetlands following the paths of surface water flow. Floc was more responsive to nutrient loading than the underlying soil. The sensitive indicators of eutrophication were floc and soil total P, microbial biomass P, and mineralized P. Total P averaged 185 and 140% greater for nutrient-impacted than oligotrophic areas for floc and soil (0-3 cm), respectively. Microbial biomass P averaged 97 and 52% higher at nutrient-impacted than oligotrophic areas for floc and soil, respectively. Mineralized P was the most sensitive indicator of eutrophication, being 689 and 135% higher at nutrient-impacted than oligotrophic areas for floc and soil, respectively. Microbial indicators in WCA-3a and Taylor Slough were more responsive to nutrient loading than in WCA-1 and WCA-2a, which received higher P loads. Delineation of nutrient-impacted and oligotrophic areas in Everglades wetlands may serve as a baseline to assess future impacts of eutrophication. The consistent pattern in the response of microbial processes to nutrient loading across the range of conditions in different Everglades wetlands demonstrates their suitability as sensitive indicators of eutrophication.

AB  - Many researches on consumer behaviors employing different models and tools in the field of agricultural and food products marketing have been developed and applied. Nevertheless, decision-making particularities of the consumers have not been explained to the full sense. This paper focuses on the consumer preferences by analyzing the correlation between socio-economic, demographic profiles and the criteria applied in fresh fruit and vegetable purchasing decisions. The research was carried out in Antalya province of Turkey by using the data of 2007. Data gathered by means of questionnaires, applied to some 300 consumers by face-to-face interviews, have been assessed by chi-square analysis. Pearson chi-square test results show that correlation between the gender, education and income variables and the sensitivity to the particularities of some of the products is meaningful on 5% significance level statistically. The research results indicate that appreciation degree of the products' taste, smell and presentation and that of the market environment differ between men and women in fresh fruit and vegetable purchasing behaviors, whereas, sensitivity to the price of the product, food content, seasonality and organic production differ among the consumers according to their education and income levels. Furthermore, findings of the research gave important hints as to the impact of the gender distribution of the population and that of the rise in income and education levels of the consumers on the production and marketing conditions of fresh fruit and vegetables. It seems likely that in the forthcoming years, improvements in the education and income indicators in Turkey leading to awareness rising on healthy and quality choices in consumption will absolutely bring about a rise in the demand for organic fresh fruit and vegetables.

AB  - The aim of this paper will be analysis of some problems about health and sickness insurance. Therefore we describe the important problems: advantages and limitations of the use sickness function as compared with other methods, subdivide sickness functions into duration of sickness, some problems of health care. The first part will intend to provide a orientation on the present situation and the objectives of health insurance in the Slovak republic. List the main conceptions used in sickness and health insurance: the fundamental qualifying condition for the allocation and payment of benefits, retention of claims for a specified period of time based on a protection period, basic indicators for health care.
   In part two - a basic probabilistic multistate structure is defined, which provides the possibility of a systematic modeling for sickness insurance (disability annuities and lump sum). There are some specific applications of the actuarial theory in the solution of problems relating to critical illness. Some of the many approaches that can be used for calculations in this paper are multiple-state and decrement models. Their advantage is that they make use of stochastic approach for the transitions between the states. This brings with it a more faithful modeling of the real world than does the deterministic model.
   In the various chapters of this paper attention is directed not only towards the analysis of the existing theory, but also in particular to extending these models so that they can be used more widely in actuarial work in life, sickness and health insurance. Of course, natural developments lead to recurrent premiums, mathematical reserves, expense loadings and profit testing.

AB  - Serpentinites have the lowest silica activity of common crustal rocks. At the serpentinization front, where olivine, serpentine, and brucite are present, silica activities (relative to quartz) are of the order of 10(-2.5) to 10(-5), depending on the temperature. Here we argue that this low silica activity is the critical property that produces the unusual geochemical environments characteristic of serpentinization. The formation of magnetite is driven by the extraction of silica from the Fe3Si2O5(OH)(4) component of serpentine, producing extremely reducing conditions as evinced by the rare iron alloys that partially serpentinized peridotites contain. The incongruent dissolution of diopside to form Ca2+, serpentine, and silica becomes increasingly favored at lower T, producing the alkalic fluids characteristic of serpentinites. The interaction of these fluids with adjacent rocks produces rodingites, and we argue that desilication is also part of the rodingite-forming process. The low silica activity also explains the occurrence of low-silica minerals such as hydrogrossular, andradite, jadeite, diaspore, and corundum in serpentinites or rocks adjacent to serpentinites. The tendency for silica activity to decrease with decreasing temperature means that the presence of certain minerals in serpentinites can be used as indicators of the temperature of serpentinization. These include, with decreasing temperature, diopside, andradite and diaspore. Because the assemblage serpentine + brucite marks the lowest silica activity reached in most serpentinites, the presence and distribution of brucite, which commonly is a cryptic phase in serpentinites, is critical to interpreting the processes that lead to the hydration of any given serpentinite.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition of the intestine with unknown etiology involving multiple immune, genetic and environmental factors. We were interested in examining the effect of a total extract from Ziziphora clinopoides, an Iranian folk herbal medicine, in the prevention and control of experimental mouse IBD. Z. clinopoides was administered (75, 150, 300 mg/kg) through drinking water to mice, which dispensed a toxic dose of acetic acid intrarectally. Prednisolone was used as the standard drug for comparison. Biochemical, macroscopic and microscopic examinations of the colon were performed. Biochemical evaluation of the inflamed colon was carried out using assays of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) as indicators of free radical activity and cellular lipid peroxidation.
   Results indicated that the activity of MPO and lipid peroxidation products (TBARS) increased in acetic acid-treated groups, while recovered by pretreatment of animals with Z. clinopoides (75-300 mg/kg) and prednisolone. All doses of Z. clinopoides and prednisolone-treated groups showed significant lower score values of macroscopic and microscopic characters when compared to the acetic acid-treated group. The beneficial effect of Z. clinopoides (300 mg/kg) was comparable to that of prednisolone.
   It is concluded that Z. clinopoides inhibits acetic acid toxic reactions in the mouse bowel through inhibition of cellular oxidative stress. Proper clinical investigation should be carried out to confirm the same activity in human.

KW  - cattle fattening

KW  - economic and financial indicators
AB  - The economical possibility of using legumes in pastures for cattle fattening was assessed in the Institute of Animal Science (ICA) in the grazing of a) natural pasture with Leucaena leucocephala in 30 and 100% of the area and ground sugarcane-urea at 1% (three treatments), and b) star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) with leucaena in 100 % of the area and the inclusion or not of rumen activator supplement (two treatments). The cost components were determined for each system considering the fixed and variable costs involved in the fattening and the economic indicators (cost/kg of liveweight, cost/$ invested, and the ratio benefit/cost) were calculated evaluating them statistically through simple classification models. The percent distribution of the direct expenses was analyzed, compared to the total expenses. The financial analysis included the calculation of the gross margin/ha and the economic profitability. The American dollar (USD) was used as monetary pattern. The beneficial effect of the use of leucaena on the feeding costs was proved by not surpassing 16 % of the variables expenses in any of the systems and by the favorable performance of the economic indicators (P < 0.01), although lower for the system supplemented with rumen activator. The study of the financial indicators corroborated the economic possibilities of this legume, mainly in 100% of the area, with economic profitability higher than 50 %, and disputed the viability of the use of the activator supplement in these conditions. The results indicate the economic feasibility of the use of Leucaena leucocephala in 100 % of the grazing area in traditional growing-fattening systems with natural grasses or sugarcane-urea for the obtainment of liveweight gains between 600 and 800 g/d.

AB  - The invertebrate fauna of 21 high altitude lakes on the southern side of the Alps (Italy and Switzerland) were sampled once in the 1990 s. A total of 193 taxa was identified in 48 samples: 66 taxa were exclusive to the littoral zone, 17 to the outlets and 23 to the inlets. Chironomids prevailed in all environments with few exceptions. Inlets and littoral zones proved to be the richest habitats in number of taxa, while the littoral zones were richest in number of individuals. In all, 17,778 individuals were found in the Pennine-Lepontine Alps and 1966 in the Rhaetian ones. The number of taxa was 108 and 122, respectively. 69 taxa were exclusive to the former and 83 to the latter. Four groups of lakes have been distinguished by DCCA analysis applied to the littoral chironomid community. Water temperature, altitude, hydrochemistry, and lake area were the abiotic variables mostly related to chironomid distribution. Many stenothermal species, typical of oligotrophic waters and high mountain streams were found, such as Zavrelimyia punctatissima, Diamesa latitarsis gr., Orthocladius frigidus, Prosimulium latimucro, Dictyogenus fontium, Baetis alpinus and Crenobia alpina. Only a few taxa such as D. fontium, Halesus radiatus, Plectrocnemia conspersa, Heterotris-socladius marcidus, Ablabesmyia sp., and Procladius sp. appeared to be tolerant to acidic conditions. These findings, as well as the rarity of molluscs, indicated that these environments are slightly acidic or at risk of acidification. Further studies on macroinvertebrates are required if they are to be used as possible indicators of local and global changes (e. g. acid deposition) in remote regions.

AB  - Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and spectral reflectance at leaf level were measured at both predawn and noon, under different temperatures and natural light conditions from autumn to winter. Predawn F-v/F-m of both mango (Mangifera indica L.), a tropical fruit tree, and Podocarpus nagi Zoll. et Moritz., a subtropical conifer, decreased with decreasing temperature, with the former to a greater extent than the latter. Yet, predawn F-v/F-m of Taiwan alder (Alnus formosana Makino), a broadleaf tree widely distributed from the lowlands to 3000m above sea level in Taiwan, was less influenced by temperature. Nevertheless, taking all three species into consideration, predawn F-v/F-m showed a strong correlation with predawn photochemical reflectance index [(PRIp), PRI=(R-531-R-570)/(R-531+R-570), where R= reflectance]. For the data obtained at noon, Delta F/Fm' showed a significant but weak correlation with PRI (PRIn). However, stronger correlation between Delta F/Fm' and Delta PRI (PRIp-PRIn) was found. In addition, while a non-significant or weak correlation between non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and PRIn was observed in species sensitive to low temperature, their NPQ was significantly correlated with Delta PRI. We conclude that PRIp can serve as an indicator of the seasonal variation of potential PSII efficiency; and Delta PRI reflects the actual photodissipation as well as actual PSII efficiency during illumination. For the three species in this study, the PRI provides a more consistent measure of the variation in predawn fluorescence values than for steady-state values measured under normal seasonally varying daylight illumination.

AB  - Understanding the process controls on episodic fluxes of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) is becoming increasingly important for the sustainable management and accurate modelling of water quality in both recreational and shellfish harvesting waters. Both environments exhibit transitory non-compliance with microbiological standards after rainfall episodes despite significant expenditures on control of sewage derived pollutant loadings in recent years.
   This paper demonstrates the role of wave propagation in the entrainment of FIOs from river channel beds as a contributor to episodes of poor microbial water quality. Previously reported data is reviewed in the light of relationships between wave and mean water travel velocities. High flows and rapid changes in river flow, driven by releases of bacterially pure reservoir water, resulted in elevated FIO concentrations and transient peaks in concentration. The new interpretation of these data suggest three modes of entrainment: (i) immediate wave-front disturbance, (ii) wave propagation lift and post-wave transport at mean flow velocity, and (iii) stochastic erosional mechanisms that maintain elevated bacterial concentrations under steady high flow conditions. This is a significant advance on the previously proposed mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms provides an aid to managing streams intended for recreational use and emphasises the need to control the timing of high flow generation prior to use of the water body for e.g. canoeing events. In addition the processes highlighted have relevance for the protection of shellfish nurseries, drinking water supply intakes and episodes of poor bathing water quality, and associated health risks.

AB  - Field studies were carried out to determine and compare the impact of organic loads due to the biodeposition of a mussel farm on the water quality and sediment in a coastal area of the Tyrrhenian Sea (Western Mediterranean). A total of five environmental and five microbial parameters were examined from March, 1997 to February, 1998 on a monthly basis at three stations: the first was located under the mussel farm, the second located at about 40 m away from the mussel farm, while the third designed as a control was at about 1-km. No clear changes in the physical characteristics of the water masses were observed, comparing the three sampling sites and the water column generally showed homogeneous conditions (in terms of temperature and salinity). Changes in density of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, Escherichia coli and Enterococci in the water column are apparently independent from changes in environmental parameters. At all stations a constant significant correlation between temperature and presumptive Vibrio parahaemolyticus was reported suggesting that this abiotic factor exerted a major control on this bacterial group and its distribution in the water column is not related to the biodeposition of the mussel farm. The major impact identified was on the sediment where variations in bacterial abundance was observed. In the Mussel station sediment enrichment of organic compounds, and the consequent modification of the characteristics of the benthic environment, determined an increase in aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, and particularly of vibrios density (on average about 60%), suggesting that these bacteria are good indicators of organic enrichment.

AB  - Past research in the paleoenvironmental subdiscipline of dendro-chemistry has concluded that N concentration variation in tree rings cannot provide information on past conditions of environmental availability of N. The objective of this study was to test wood extraction pretreatments to remove wood entractives and sap, both of which may obscure the environmental signal of N availability in tree rings. Three increment cores were collected from each of six trees (three ponderosa pines and three Douglas-firs). Within each tree, the first core was left untreated (referred to as CONTROL), the second core was extracted for several hours in organic solvents and distilled water (referred to as EXTRACT), and the third core also was extracted but for a total time of 3 d (referred to as 3-DAY). A semimicro Kjeldahl method was used to determine total N on decadal groups of rings. Average N concentration of EXTRACT cores was significantly less than that of CONTROL, and the coefficient of variation of EXTRACT cores also was significantly less than that of CONTROL. Most CONTROL cores showed substantial temporal variation in N concentration related to heartwood and sapwood and/or recently formed rings. In contrast, most EXTRACT cores showed no substantial change in N concentration related to heartwood and sapwood and/or recently formed rings. The 3-DAY cores confirmed, but did not improve upon, results obtained with extraction using the shorter time duration. Thus, pretreating wood by extraction appears to substantially reduce the variation in N concentration of tree rings, which is a necessary first step toward interpreting ring N as an indicator of past environmental N availability.

AB  - It is well known that anomalously high levels of soil gases such as radon, carbon dioxide and helium can be measured over faults or fractures. This type of measurement is a useful tool to determine the structure of many types of geological environment, including volcanic edifices. It is important that other controlling factors are considered, principally changes in the meteorological conditions, since they can have a strong influence on the concentrations measured. In the case of volcanoes, additional information can be obtained on mass gas movement and magmatic resurgence. A temporal variation in the concentration of soil gases has been observed as a precursor to both earthquakes and volcanic activity. However, few long-term studies have been carried out. In the case of volcanoes, measurements are taken at a distance from the active crater, making it a much less hazardous form of monitoring than the direct sampling of fumaroles. Recently Popocatepetl has commenced a nem active phase with several explosive events producing ash falls at large distances from the volcano. Measurements of SO2 and CO2 flux have shown a large variation. For a better understanding of the processes occurring within the volcano, as well as its structure, further data of different types is required. This study mill include an extensive program of soil gas measurements, including radon, carbon dioxide, methane and helium. A comparison will be made with seismic and groundwater and ash geochemical data. One goal will be an improved understanding of the mechanism whereby seismic events influence the concentration of soil gases, which is not currently well understood. Here the preliminary results are presented.

AB  - . In this study we present a new method for predicting the occurrences of species using data from deciduous forests in South Sweden. Complete species lists of vascular plants were compiled from 101 stands and from representative sample plots inside the stands. Soil samples from each stand were collected for determination of pH and nitrogen mineralization. Presence-absence data for species were fitted to the values of four environmental variables - soil moisture, soil reaction (pH), soil nitrogen and light - by means of Linear (Multiple) Logistic Regression (LLR), and Gaussian (Multiple) Logistic Regression (GLR). First, these values were estimated by calculating the weighted averages of Ellenberg indicator values. Second, the estimates for reaction and nitrogen were substituted by the real measurements of pH and mineralized NH4+, keeping the Ellenberg estimates for light and moisture. The models were validated by an independent test data set. In general, the models had high predictive abilities. GLR fitted the species occurrences better to the environmental variables than LLR, but had a lower accuracy of prediction of species occurrence in the stands. The use of soil measurements instead of Ellenberg indicator values did not improve the predictive abilities of the models. The environmental conditions in the stand test set were successfully estimated by using species data from the plots. When using the species lists of the stands instead of plot data, a slightly better predictive ability was obtained. The collection of plot data, however, is easier and less time-consuming. The accuracy of prediction differed considerably between species.

AB  - Most maturity indices can be used during catagenesis and metagenesis but there are only a few indicators to show the degree of organic maturation within the diagenesis zone. A previous study has already demonstrated that the oxygen index (OI) measured by Rock-Eval analysis provides reliable information about the early evolution stages of coals and type III kerogens. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the conditions of OI application in both natural and artificial evolution. The results of experiments presented here revealed that the accuracy of OI in estimating the evolution level depended on the amount and chemical composition of the organic matter. Natural series of low-rank coals showed OI to be a valuable rank parameter not only during diagenesis but in early catagenesis also. OI appeared to be a sensitive indicator during both simulated diagenesis and the entire oil window for gas-prone coal having a substantial humic contribution to its precursor material. In contrast, the OI of oil-prone coal and coal with mixed oil and gas potential proved to be a valuable rank parameter only up to the beginning of the oil window. Though it could be utilized successfully for describing depth profiles in organic-rich intervals of early maturity in wells, its use in determining natural maturity was restricted by the organic-richness of rocks, as well as by the effect of the mineral matrix. Providing humic material is present, OI can be used to follow the artificial thermal maturation of type II kerogen in the absence of mineral matrix. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Secondary sexual characters are assumed to be costly to produce or maintain. A test of this assumption was performed using the sexually exaggerated outermost tail feathers of male barn swallows Hirundo rustica, a trait currently subject of a directional female mate preference. A possible cost of sexual signalling in male barn swallows arises from increased flight cost during foraging in this aerially insectivorous species. A longer tail may impose a greater drag during Eight and thereby affect foraging ability. This was tested by determining the relationship between experimentally modified male tail lengths and number and size of prey delivered to offspring in Spain, where sexual size dimorphism in tail length is small, compared to Denmark, where dimorphism is large. Food boluses contained significantly fewer small insects in Spain than in Denmark. Males with elongated tails captured more and smaller insects while males with shortened tails captured fewer and larger prey items at both sites. Males with naturally long tails were less affected by experimental treatment in terms of effects on the number and the size of prey delivered to their offspring, a finding consistent with a long tail being a condition-dependent viability indicator. The effect of a given degree of tail manipulation on prey size and number of prey per bolus was larger in Spain than in Denmark. These results demonstrate that (1) tail length in male barn swallows affects foraging, and (2) larger sexual size dimorphism occurs where the foraging cost of an increment in ornament size is smallest.

AB  - Observations made on a rearing population of Diprion pini L. bred since more than 30 generations in photoperiodic and thermic conditions favourable to without-diapause development, show that during the first reared generations sex-ratio evolued rapidly in favour of males while diapause rate highly increased, reaching more than 90% of individuals.  Then diapause rates decreased gradually, after what, stay devinitively to a low level, while males remain much more numerous than females.  These observations suggest a high consanguinity in rearing populations and that the increasing diapause rates, that are not without analogy with diapause variations during outbreaks of natural populations, may be linked with this consanguinity.  Initial diapause rate recovery will result in the selection realised by the reproduction of the without diapause individuals only at every generation.  The hypothesis is further advanced that the increase in males may result in a sex determinism well-known for some Hymenoptera and at least for a Diprionidae that involve the production of diploid males favoured by consanguinity.  This phenomenon may be at the origin of observed diapause rate variations.  Several factors such as insect weight, wing setae number and, in particular, the presence of heterozygote males in natural populations corroborate the existence of diploid males for D. pini.  The existence of gynandromorphs in nature as in laboratory populations may also constitute an indicator of the consanguinity.  Consanguine crossings realised between brother-sister insects through several generations reproduce the phenomena seen in rearing quite faithfully, as much for diapause as sex-ratio.

AB  - Free-living nematodes are one of the most diverse metazoan taxa in terrestrial ecosystems and are critical to the global soil carbon (C) cycling through their role in organic matter decomposition. They are highly dependent on water availability for movement, feeding, and reproduction. Projected changes in precipitation across temporal and spatial scales will affect free-living nematodes and their contribution to C cycling with unforeseen consequences. We experimentally reduced and increased growing season precipitation for 2 years in 120 field plots at arid, semiarid, and mesic grasslands and assessed precipitation controls on nematode genus diversity, community structure, and C footprint. Increasing annual precipitation reduced nematode diversity and evenness over time at all sites, but the mechanism behind these temporal responses differed for dry and moist grasslands. In arid and semiarid sites, there was a loss of drought-adapted rare taxa with increasing precipitation, whereas in mesic conditions increases in the population of predaceous taxa with increasing precipitation may have caused the observed reductions in dominant colonizer taxa and yielded the negative precipitation-diversity relationship. The effects of temporal changes in precipitation on all aspects of the nematode C footprint (respiration, production, and biomass C) were all dependent on the site (significant spatial x temporal precipitation interaction) and consistent with diversity responses at mesic, but not at arid and semiarid, grasslands. These results suggest that free-living nematode biodiversity and their C footprint will respond to climate change-driven shifts in water availability and that more frequent extreme wet years may accelerate decomposition and C turnover in semiarid and arid grasslands.

AB  - Permafrost-affected soils in the northern circumpolar region store more than 1,000 Pg soil organic carbon (OC), and are strongly vulnerable to climatic warming. However, the extent to which changing soil environmental conditions with permafrost thaw affects different compounds of soil organic matter (OM) is poorly understood. Here, we assessed the fate of lignin and non-cellulosic carbohydrates in density fractionated soils (light fraction, LF vs. heavy fraction, HF) from three permafrost regions with decreasing continentality, expanding from east to west of northern Siberia (Cherskiy, Logata, Tazovskiy, respectively). In soils at the Tazovskiy site with thicker active layers, the LF showed smaller OC-normalized contents of lignin-derived phenols and plant-derived sugars and a decrease of these compounds with soil depth, while a constant or even increasing trend was observed in soils with shallower active layers (Cherskiy and Logata). Also in the HF, soils at the Tazovskiy site had smaller contents of OC-normalized lignin-derived phenols and plant-derived sugars along with more pronounced indicators of oxidative lignin decomposition and production of microbial-derived sugars. Active layer deepening, thus, likely favors the decomposition of lignin and plant-derived sugars, that is, lignocelluloses, by increasing water drainage and aeration. Our study suggests that climate-induced degradation of permafrost soils may promote carbon losses from lignin and associated polysaccharides by abolishing context-specific preservation mechanisms. However, relations of OC-based lignin-derived phenols and sugars in the HF with mineralogical properties suggest that future OM transformation and carbon losses will be modulated in addition by reactive soil minerals.

AB  - Purpose The study assessed welfare of migrant and non-migrant labourers on cocoa farms in Ghana, using multidimensional poverty index (MPI) with four dimensions (education, health, dietary diversity, living standards) and 21 indicators. Specifically, we examined and compared non-monetary welfare of migrant and non-migrant labourers on cocoa farms in Ghana by adopting MPI approach. Also, we explored the factors affecting labourers' welfare. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 400 labourers was used. Qualitative and quantitative data were used. Quantile regression was used to investigate factors affecting labourers' deprivation in the different domains of non-monetary welfare. Findings Labourers on cocoa farms are generally deprived in all the welfare indicators. Apart from having low education, labourers were underfed and lived under poor conditions. Though both migrants and non-migrants were multidimensionally poor, welfare of the later was higher than the former. Welfare of migrants and non-migrants on cocoa farms are influenced by similar factors: secondary occupation, income, credit accessibility, nature of contract and distance to social amenities. Research limitations/implications For migrants, permanent status improves welfare. To improve labourers' welfare for enhanced productivity, cocoa farmers should provide permanent/long-term contracts for labourers and government should provide social amenities in cocoa-producing communities. Originality/value Most previous welfare studies focused on farmers, with little attention paid to welfare of labourers on cocoa farms. We examined and compared the factors that affect migrant and non-migrant labourers' welfare on cocoa farms in Ghana. Moreover, we adopted the MPI (non-monetary) approach to assess labourers' welfare, instead of the expenditure and income approaches prevalent in literature.

AB  - The physiological and metabolic diversity of a yeast culture is the sum of individual cell phenotypes. As well as environmental conditions, genetics, and numbers of cell divisions, a major factor influencing cell characteristics is cell age. A postcytokinesis bud scar on the mother cell, a benchmark in the replicative life span, is a quantifiable indicator of cell age, characterized by significant amounts of chitin. We developed a binding process for visualizing the bud scars of Saccharomyces pastorianus var. carlsbergensis using a protein linker containing a polyhistidine tag, a superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), and a chitin-binding domain (His6-SUMO-sfGFP-ChBD). The binding did not affect yeast viability; thus, our method provides the basis for non-invasive cell age determination using flow cytometry. The His6-SUMO-sfGFP-ChBD protein was synthesized in Escherichia coli, purified using two-stage chromatography, and checked for monodispersity and purity. Linker-cell binding and the characteristics of the bound complex were determined using flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Flow cytometry showed that protein binding increased to 60 455 +/- 2706 fluorescence units per cell. The specific coupling of the linker to yeast cells was additionally verified by CLSM and adsorption isotherms using yeast cells, E. coli cells, and chitin resin. We found a relationship between the median bud scar number, the median of the fluorescence units, and the chitin content of yeast cells. A fast measurement of yeast population dynamics by flow cytometry is possible, using this protein binding technique. Rapid qualitative determination of yeast cell age distribution can therefore be performed.

This study aims to explore the short-term association between drought and outpatient visits for respiratory diseases (RDs) in four northwest cities, China. In this study, we obtained daily outpatient visits for RDs, meteorological factors, and air pollutant data in four cities (Lanzhou from 2014 to 2016, Wuwei from 2016 to 2018, Tianshui and Zhangye from 2015 to 2018) of northwest China. We used the daily Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) as an indicator of drought and estimated the effects of drought on outpatient visits with RDs by using a generalized additive model (GAM) in each city, controlling for daily temperature, time trends, and other confounding factors. The city-specific estimates were pooled by random-effects meta-analysis. There were 1,134,577 RDs cases in the hospitals across the four cities. We found that a 1-unit decrease in daily exposure to SPI-1 was positively associated with daily outpatient visits for RDs, with estimated RR of 1.0230 (95% CIs: 1.0096, 1.0366). Compared to non-drought periods, the RR of daily outpatient visits for RDs for exposure to all drought conditions was 1.0431 (95% CIs: 1.0309, 1.0555). In subgroup analysis, the estimated effects of drought on outpatient visits for RDs appeared larger for males than females though not statistically different, and the estimated effects in children and adolescents were the greatest among different age groups. Drought likely increases the risk of respiratory diseases, particularly among children and adolescents. We highlight that public health adaptations to drought such as drought monitoring, mitigation measures, and adaptation strategies are necessary.

AB  - This preliminary study investigated the provision of shade on heat stress indicators of South African Mutton Merino (SAMM) and Dormer lambs shortly after birth, during the autumn 2017 and 2018 lambing seasons. Newborn lambs were assessed to determine whether welfare, as assessed by respiratory response and rectal temperature as heat stress indicators, survival and early growth benefitted from the provision of shade. Groups consisting of 4-17 pregnant SAMM and Dormer ewes were randomly allocated to 5-10 paddocks with natural shade from trees and 5-9 paddocks that were directly in the sun with no shade available. The lambs were recorded within 24 h of birth at noon. Climate data were obtained from a nearby weather station. The lambs were also weighed at 12 (SD = 2) days of age at tail-docking. Tree shade had a moderating effect on temperature, resulting in lower maximum daytime and higher minimum night-time temperatures. There was an interaction between a temperature-humidity index (THI) and the treatments (access to shade or no access to shade) for respiration and rectal temperature (P < 0.01). Both traits were relatively unaffected by the THI at values below 77. Unshaded lambs exhibited a pronounced upwards trend following a THI-threshold of 77-78. Tailing weight tended to be higher while lamb survival of live-born lambs to tail-docking was lower in lambs born in shaded paddocks but these trends did not persist to weaning. Shade is needed to enhance animal welfare by alleviating the effect of high THI-values on hot days in an autumn lambing season.

AB  - Microbial l-asparaginases have received significant attention due to their potential for applications in cancer treatment and for preparation of acrylamide-free baked and fried food. Eleven fungal-type strains were obtained from Iranian Biological Resource and screened for production of l-asparaginase using dye-based plate assay on modified Czapek Dox medium. The efficiency of three different dye indicators including phenol red, bromothymol blue and cresol red was evaluated. Production mode was also evaluated by the agar well diffusion method. A comparative study was carried out to evaluate l-asparaginase production in submerged condition by enzymatic assay using Nessler's reagent. Optimization of the enzyme production by the selected superior strain was performed using one factor at a time method for temperature, inoculum and different carbon and nitrogen sources. Five-type strains showed positive l-asparaginase activity in preliminary screening. Phenol red and bromothymol blue showed better differentiable zone of hydrolysis and consistent results in comparison with cresol red. The results also indicated that l-asparaginase production mode is extracellular. l-asparaginase production by Fereydounia khargensis IBRC-M 30116(T) which showed the highest zone of color change was then optimized. The optimum enzyme activity of 61.3 U. mL(-1) was obtained with 9% inoculum, at a temperature of 30 degrees C and at the presence of ammonium chloride as nitrogen source and with glycerol as the carbon sources. The study revealed that, apart from bacteria, yeast and yeast-like microorganisms could be considered as novel and appropriate sources for production of the high yield of l-asparaginase.

AB  - Sponges, the most primitive multicellular animals, contain a large number of unique microbial communities. Sponge-associated microorganisms, particularly actinomyces, have the potential to produce diverse active natural products. However, a large number of silent secondary metabolic gene clusters have failed to be revived under laboratory culture conditions. In this study, iterative atmospheric room-temperature plasma. (ARTP) mutagenesis coupled with multi-omics conjoint analysis was adopted to activate the inactive wild Streptomyces strain. The desirable exposure time employed in this study was 75 s to obtain the appropriate lethality rate (94%) and mutation positive rate (40.94%). After three iterations of ARTP mutagenesis, the proportion of mutants exhibiting antibacterial activities significantly increased by 75%. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that the differential gene expression levels of encoding type I lasso peptide aborycin had a significant upward trend in active mutants compared with wild-type strains, which was confirmed by LC-MS results with a relative molecular mass of 1082.43 ([M + 2H](2+) at m/z = 2164.86). Moreover, metabolome comparative analysis of the mutant and wild-type strains showed that four spectra or mass peaks presented obvious differences in terms of the total ion count or extracting ion current profiles with each peak corresponding to a specific compound exhibiting moderate antibacterial activity against Gram-positive indicators. Taken together, our data suggest that the ARTP treatment method coupled with multi-omics profiling analysis could be used to estimate the valid active molecules of metabolites from microbial crudes without requiring a time-consuming isolation process.

AB  - In this research, a conventional waste-to-energy plant is redesigned to enhance power generation while mitigating CO2 emissions. Accordingly, 65% of CO2 emitted is injected into the gasifier after being separated in the membrane separator to trigger the gasification via a mixture of air/CO2. The redesigned system is evaluated and compared to the traditional waste-to-energy plant with respect to thermodynamics and exergoeconomic standpoints. Afterward, the waste-to-energy plant is optimised by tri-objective grey wolf optimisation to optimise conflicting objective functions; subsequently, four Pareto frontiers are presented to provide a trade-off between the objective functions. The outcomes reveal higher first and second law efficiencies for the proposed waste-to energy plant compared to the conventional waste-to-energy system up to 6% and 3%, respectively. The optimisation results indicate that levelised CO2 emissions of the proposed waste-to-energy plant are 35% lower than the conventional waste-to-energy system while net power output can be 22% higher if the proposed system operates on the conditions achieved by the TOPSIS scheme. The second law efficiency, levelised emissions, total specific cost/cost rate at the final optimum solution are 17%, 1.7 t/MWh, 31.2 US$/GJ, and 445.6 US$/h. Meanwhile, the payback period of the proposed system is lower than the conventional waste-to-energy system in almost all economic scenarios.

AB  - Social cognition, social skill, and social motivation have been extensively researched and characterized as atypical in autistic people, with the assumption that each mechanistically contributes to the broader social interaction difficulties that diagnostically define the condition. Despite this assumption, research has not directly assessed whether or how these three social domains contribute to actual real-world social interaction outcomes for autistic people. The current study administered standardized measures of social cognition, social skill, and social motivation to 67 autistic and 58 non-autistic (NA) adults and assessed whether performance on these measures, both individually and relationally between dyadic partners, predicted outcomes for autistic and NA adults interacting with unfamiliar autistic and NA partners in a 5 minute unstructured "get to know you" conversation. Consistent with previous research, autistic adults scored lower than NA adults on the three social domains and were evaluated less favorably by their conversation partners. However, links between autistic adults' performance on the three social domains and their social interaction outcomes were minimal and, contrary to prediction, only the social abilities of NA adults predicted some interaction outcomes within mixed diagnostic dyads. Collectively, results suggest that reduced performance by autistic adults on standardized measures of social cognition, social skill, and social motivation do not correspond in clear and predictable ways with their real-world social interaction outcomes. They also highlight the need for the development and validation of more ecological assessments of autistic social abilities and the consideration of relational dynamics, not just individual characteristics, when assessing social disability in autism.

AB  - The results of complex geotechnical studies aimed at creating a temporary soil dam for the reconstruction of the main gas pipeline are conducted. Based on the study of the properties of the three types of soils that are in the vicinity, the technical-economical efficiency and prediction of the compaction of the recommended soil are substantiated. The choice of soil laid in the dam should be carried out on the basis of the study of the properties of soils and feasibility study. Technical-economical assessment is impossible without knowledge of the characteristics of the soil, which were obtained in laboratory conditions. Three series of experiments were performed for this: determination of soil density; determination of the angle of repose; determination of soil filtration coefficient. The parameters were investigated in the course of the experiments, on which the quality of the soil dam depends to the greatest extent: density; angle of repose during dumping; filtration properties (filtration coefficient). Based on an analysis of the current situation, proceeding on environmental requirements and considerations of economic feasibility, it was proposed to fill in a temporary embankment to allow the piles to be loaded by driving, and to make it out of medium-sized sand composing the surface thickness in a given area. On the assumption of the technological requirements of the reconstruction, the dam should be 5 m high and 36 m high on the top and 51 m high on the bottom. Based on experimental-analytical researches, a motivated choice of soil is substantiated, which made it possible to obtain an economic effect confirmed by the act.

AB  - The decrease in fruit quality between harvest and consumption is an important area in agriculture. Edible coatings are harmless compounds used for covering the crops after harvest to reduce the metabolism intensity. gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a good candidate because it is a natural substance produced by plants at stress conditions. Pomegranate (Punica granatumL.) is a perishable fruit because it has a high content of water and nutritional compounds and also relatively soft texture. In this study the effect of GABA on extending the pomegranate shelf life at 4 +/- 1 degrees C was studied. The treatments included control (distilled water), GABA (5, 10 and 15 mM) and the storage periods (45 and 90 days) with four replications. The results showed that GABA treatments had some positive effects on improving peel (skin) and aril (edible part of seeds) firmness, antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds content, scent and taste, freshness of texture and aril color indicators and they reduced ion leakage, chilling injury signs and malondialdehyde formation. However, GABA did not have a positive effect on weight loss. Total acidity in control and treated samples was reduced until 45 days but increased at day 90. GABA had the ability to maintain the fruit pH stable. Total soluble solids and vitamin C content were not affected by storage and GABA, and the effects on anthocyanin content were varied among treatments. Totally, the results suggested that postharvest application of GABA has the potential to extend the storage life of pomegranate fruits by maintaining some fruit qualities.

AB  - The riboflavin content of eleocytes is involved in immune responses in earthworms and serves as a sensitive bioindicator of soil condition, such as metal ions pollution. Previous studies have shown that the transition metals Ni and Cu robustly decrease riboflavin content of eleocytes when earthworms were exposed to transition metals-polluted soil. However, there is no previous study of earthworm responses to environmental stressors associated with the transition metal Fe. Therefore, this study aimed to uncover the effect of Fe exposure on the riboflavin content of eleocytes from Eisenia fetida (E. fetida) exposed to 1 mM FeCl3 for 4 days using agar gels as exposure media, and riboflavin exposure as a positive control. In this study, we found that two cell types exist in the coelomic fluid of E. fetida. One cell type is the amoebocytes (about 70%), and the other is riboflavin-storing eleocytes (about 20%). Interestingly, eleocytes can spontaneously emit green autofluorescence, and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and percentages of this cell population were decreased when exposed to FeCl3 in vitro. These findings were also confirmed by in vivo experiments. However, the riboflavin content of celomic fluid supernatants and total coelomocyte numbers were unaffected. These results indicate that Fe3+ can potentially quench the fluorescence of riboflavin in eleocytes. Therefore, by detecting the number and MFI of eleocytes, we provide a novel link between Fe3+ and the green autofluorescent cells of earthworms, which can be used as a novel tool for detecting the iron pollution in soil and the environment.

AB  - Hydrological alteration prevents unpolluted rivers from reaching acceptable ecological conditions. In Europe, 40% of rivers are degraded due to hydrological alteration but the indices currently used in ecological monitoring cannot quantify the degree of hydrological alteration or discriminate between pollution and hydrological alteration. In this article, we demonstrate the development, calculation and validation of the Hellenic Flow Index (ELF), a new macroinvertebrate-based multi-metric index to assess, quantify and classify hydrological alteration in Greek streams and rivers. 1351 samples collected throughout Greece were partitioned in reference and test datasets and were pre-classified in varying levels of pollution and hydrological alteration. Optimal flow ranges for benthic macroinvertebrates were calculated and flow sensitivity metrics were developed. We tested the predictive accuracy of 607 versions of the ELF index, that is, 607 combinations of seven hydrologically sensitive macroinvertebrate metrics. The developed index is a combination of two ELF versions that had the highest predictive accuracy on two validation datasets. The index developed can assess, quantify and classify hydrological alteration and is also capable of discriminating between pollution and hydrological alteration. The ELF's overall predictive accuracy was 75% and the index was equally accurate in discriminating between clean, polluted and hydrologically altered sites. Within the regular ecological monitoring, water agencies, managers and decision makers can now use a tool that will quickly flag watercourses that specifically need hydrological restoration instead of pollution mitigation measures and thus apply targeted actions towards the ecological restoration of rivers.

AB  - Urbanisation is seen as one of the most important drivers for species extinction. The aim of our study was to compare vascular plant species richness of 35 artificial urban stormwater ponds (STOPON) designed to control water flow, with 35 control ponds (CONTROL) in the surrounding landscape. For both plot types, we gathered a variety of environmental parameters to determine the drivers of plant species richness. Based on the results, we discuss the relevance of STOPON for biodiversity conservation in urban areas and give recommendations for biodiversity-friendly construction and pond management.
   Our study showed that the environmental conditions clearly varied between STOPON and CONTROL. STOPON were especially larger than CONTROL; as a consequence, the aquatic, semi-aquatic and terrestrial zones had a greater extent at STOPON. Accordingly, the overall and mean number of aquatic, salt-tolerating aquatic and threatened plant species was higher at STOPON than at CONTROL. However, species density of all three plant indicator groups did not differ among the two plot types.
   The greater plant species richness of STOPON was driven by a higher habitat heterogeneity which was especially explained by (i) the genuine effect of habitat area on habitat heterogeneity, (ii) the existence of three similarly large habitat zones (terrestrial, semi-aquatic, aquatic) and (iii) the regular management, which represses shading plants, creates open soil and activates the soil seed bank. Due to the high species richness of threatened plant species STOPON play an important role in biodiversity conservation in urban areas.

AB  - Many biodiversity conservation projects struggle to demonstrate the impact of their actions. Existing project management guidelines inadequately address the issue of planning projects in a project portfolio (a programme) and how to aggregate data across portfolios, so monitoring systems are often weak. Based on a literature review and personal experience, I define Five Steps to Conservation Impact: 1. Planning - develop a shared vision and measurable goals and objectives (with project goals and objectives linked to higher-level programme goals and objectives); 2. Common indicators - identify indicators common to projects and the programmes they contribute towards to allow aggregation of results; 3. Monitoring - collect data to measure indicators (wherever possible using harmonised monitoring protocols to enhance data sharing); 4. Interpretation - present data in a format of use to programme managers and other decision makers (presenting trends in ways that demonstrate outliers, through maps and dashboards); 5. Action - use data to evaluate progress and make adaptive management decisions. These steps differ from other project management guidelines by linking common goals with common indicators and measuring aggregated conservation impact. Enabling conditions for success include: senior managers are willing to establish a results-based management culture; attribution is considered an aspiration not a hindrance; capacity and tools are in place. If organisations design projects with goals, objectives and indicators that are shared across the portfolio, and counterfactuals are identified wherever possible, then monitoring impact is feasible. Making impact monitoring the norm, however, will require a culture change within the conservation community. (C) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

AB  - The growing threat of global climate change has led to a profusion of studies examining the effects of warming on biota. Despite the potential importance of natural variability such as diurnal temperature fluctuations, most experimental studies on warming are conducted under stable temperatures. Here, we investigated whether the responses of an aquatic invertebrate grazer (Lymnaea stagnalis) to an increased average temperature differ when the thermal regime is either constant or fluctuates diurnally. Using thermal response curves for several life-history and immune defense traits, we first identified the optimum and near-critically high temperatures that Lymnaea potentially experience during summer heat waves. We then exposed individuals that originated from three different populations to these two temperatures under constant or fluctuating thermal conditions. After 7 days, we assessed growth, reproduction, and two immune parameters (phenoloxidase-like activity and antibacterial activity of hemolymph) from each individual. Exposure to the near-critically high temperature led to increased growth rates and decreased antibacterial activity of hemolymph compared to the optimum temperature, whilst temperature fluctuations had no effect on these traits. The results indicate that the temperature level per se, rather than the variability in temperature was the main driver altering trait responses in our study species. Forecasting responses in temperature-related responses remains challenging, due to system-specific properties that can include intraspecific variation. However, our study indicates that experiments examining the effects of warming using constant temperatures can give similar predictions as studies with fluctuating thermal dynamics, and may thus be useful indicators of responses in nature.

AB  - Rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) are a common mass stranding species in Florida. These large stranding events typically include a small number of sick or injured individuals and a much larger number of healthy individuals, making rapid triage essential. Little data exist on rehabilitation outcomes, and historically, successful outcomes are limited. Furthermore, very little data exist on the feeding habits and dietary needs of this species. This study compared morphology and body mass index (BMI) in two rough-toothed dolphin mass stranding events in Florida: August 2004 (n = 36) and March 2005 (n = 32). The two groups were significantly different in morphologic measurements, with age and gender-adjusted intake BMI significantly (p < .01) different (2004 = 0.34 +/- 0.02; 2005 = 0.41 +/- 0.02) between groups. Ten animals from 2005 had weights tracked throughout the rehabilitation process and demonstrated an initial drop in BMI followed by an increase and a plateau prior to release. When comparing initial BMI by stranding outcome, individuals that were rehabilitated and released had a significantly (p = .03) higher BMI than individuals who were euthanized. However, there was no difference between dolphins that died of natural causes (p = .56) and animals successfully rehabilitated. Analysis of BMI can be a useful marker in triage during a stranding, when resources are limited to identify individuals most likely to survive, as well as in determining the appropriate body condition for release. The data reported here can provide guidance on evaluating the nutritive status on this uncommon species that would otherwise be difficult to obtain among wild populations.

AB  - Rapid ecohydrological changes in semi-arid landscapes are increasingly threatening humanity's life-support systems and eroding many of the ecosystem services (ESs) upon which humans occupying such regions depend. Knowing which services and ecohydrological changes to be most concerned about is indispensable to maintaining the general health of such ecosystems and for developing effective ecosystem management practices. In the semi-arid regions of southwestern Zimbabwe where a large population of rural households depend on ESs extracted from the Colophospermum mopane tree, such understanding may be critical in reversing potential ES losses that may have catastrophic effects on the lives of many. We surveyed a total of 127 rural households who occupy the semi-arid landscapes of the Colophospermum mopane belt in southern Zimbabwe. We assessed the ecohydrological conditions characterising ecosystems where they obtain ES provisioning goods using a number of ecohydrological variables commonly cited in the literature on ecohydrology. Building on principal component analysis (PCA), we employed a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method to create unique clusters of households that depicted different levels of risks or threats associated with their ES provisioning harvesting practices. Multiple regression analysis was further performed to identify significant ecohydrological cluster-defining variables. Our results showed that spatial differences in ecohydrological parameters resulted in four distinct ES resource thresholds depicting four categories of risks that households face in extracting such resources in nearby landscapes. We concluded by proposing a number of landscape restoration or management practices targeted at reversing potential ES losses and subsequently safeguarding the livelihoods of many who depend on ESs.

AB  - The main prey of the Atlantic mackerel undertake diel vertical migrations, however diel and vertical patterns in the feeding by mackerel remains poorly known thus limiting our understanding and quantification of ecosystem trophodynamics and potentially influencing stock assessment and ecosystem based management. By intensive monitoring of adult Atlantic mackerel and its prey during summer in the Irminger Sea, it was found that the diel feeding cycle is of high quantitative importance. Fresh stomach content analysis indicated a marked diel pattern with copepods as the main prey between 16 and 24 (solar time), and euphausiids/myctophids between 22 and 08. Compared with the zooplankton distribution and composition, there were no indications of feeding below the mixed layer. Mackerel selected for the largest and most energy rich prey, namely copepods with prosome lengths > 2 mm, and then switched from copepods to euphausiids/myctophids around midnight, despite that the copepods were also aggregated during night. Stomach fullness increased significantly with length and condition, suggesting that individuals that were larger were more effective feeders. The stomach content by weight primarily consisted of copepods (65%, exclusively Calanus finmarchus), euphausiids (18%), and to a lesser extent teleosts (5%, mainly myctophids), hyperiids (4%) and cephalopods (2%). The results are likely widely applicable in the main feeding season and areas (the oceanic parts of the Nordic Seas during summer), because of similarities in the diet of the adult mackerel and in the prey's diel vertical migration. In conclusion, it is imperative to account for the diel dynamics when quantifying the mackerel diet and its impact on prey populations.

AB  - The decarbonisation agenda in maritime transport requires that asset owners and operators adopt greener technologies within their existing and new vessels. The primary drivers within this agenda relate to improved environmental metrics, efficient energy performance, and improved asset management. However, the integration of new technologies always presents technical and financial risks. Here, utilising energy and environmental monitoring from real vessels, the authors propose an energy system optimisation architecture, hybrid fusion energy management system (HyFES), that optimises the key performance indicators of energy performance, reduction of diesel engine nitrogen oxide (NOx), and particulate matter (PM), and prognostic state of health assessment of energy storage technologies. Using state of the art machine-learning techniques, the authors are able to determine the on-board lithium-ion and lead acid batteries' state of health with accuracy > 8 and 4%, respectively. Dependent on the mode of operation, optimisation of energy performance indicates fuel saving of between 70 and 80% for the vessel operator. Future research will focus on the integration of more assets into the optimisation architecture and increased vessel journey use cases.

AB  - Spatiotemporal variability in ozone dry deposition is often overlooked despite its implications for interpreting and modeling tropospheric ozone concentrations accurately. Understanding the influences of stomatal versus nonstomatal deposition processes on ozone deposition velocity is important for attributing observed changes in the ozone depositional sink and associated damage to ecosystems. Here, we aim to identify the stomatal versus nonstomatal deposition processes driving observed variability in ozone deposition velocity over the northeastern United States during June-September. We use ozone eddy covariance measurements from Harvard Forest in Massachusetts, which span a decade, and from Kane Experimental Forest in Pennsylvania and Sand Flats State Forest in New York, which span one growing season each, along with observation-driven modeling. Using a cumulative precipitation indicator of soil wetness, we infer that high soil uptake during dry years and low soil uptake during wet years may contribute to the twofold interannual variability in ozone deposition velocity at Harvard Forest. We link stomatal deposition and humidity to variability in ozone deposition velocity on daily timescales. The humidity dependence may reflect higher uptake by leaf cuticles under humid conditions, noted in previous work. Previous work also suggests that uptake by leaf cuticles may be enhanced after rain, but we find that increases in ozone deposition velocity on rainy days are instead mostly associated with increases in stomatal conductance. Our analysis highlights a need for constraints on subseasonal variability in ozone dry deposition to soil and fast in-canopy chemistry during ecosystem stress.

AB  - The release of large numbers of juvenile pheasants into open-topped release pens in woodlands is a common part of game management in the UK. Previous research has shown this practice modifies the soil conditions and ground flora community of these release pens. However, it is not currently known if and how these changes to soil and ground flora reverse once the pens are no longer used. We compared the soil chemistry, ground flora structure and community composition of disused release pen sites in ancient semi-natural woodlands with paired control sites. Some of the changes seen within release pens in active use persisted in disused pens; soil fertility and cover of species that prefer fertile soils were higher in disused pens, whereas winter green perennials, richness of species of ancient semi-natural woodland and overall species richness were lower. Total species richness and richness of ancient semi-natural woodland plants showed signs of recovery in pens that had been disused for longer than ten years, but this recovery only occurred in pens where <= 1000 pheasants/ha had been released. Pheasant release pens are sometimes relocated within woodland to reduce disease incidence but, as the flora within disused pens does not recover quickly, this practice may cause cumulative habitat damage. We recommend that release pen relocation should be minimised and suggest other management strategies that could reduce the need to relocate pens and increase the floral recovery in disused pens, such as reducing the density of pheasants released.

AB  - Ubiquitous and ever increasing use of mobile phones led to the growing concern about the effects of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) emitted by cell phones on biological systems. The aim of this study is to explore whether long-term RFR exposure at different frequencies affects DNA damage and oxidant-antioxidant parameters in the blood and brain tissue of rats. 28 male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four equal groups (n = 7). They were identified as Group 1: sham-control, Group 2: 900 MHz, Group 3: 1800 MHz, and Group 4: 2100 MHz. Experimental groups of rats were exposed to RFR 2 h/day for 6 months. The sham-control group of rats was subjected to the same experimental condition but generator was turned off. Specific absorption rates (SARs) at brain with 1 g average were calculated as 0.0845 W/kg, 0.04563 W/kg, and 0.03957, at 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 2100 MHz, respectively. Additionally, malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), total antioxidant status (TAS), and total oxidant status (TOS) analyses were conducted in the brain tissue samples. Results of the study showed that DNA damage and oxidative stress indicators were found higher in the RFR exposure groups than in the sham-control group. In conclusion, 900-, 1800-, and 2100-MHz RFR emitted from mobile phones may cause oxidative damage, induce increase in lipid peroxidation, and increase oxidative DNA damage formation in the frontal lobe of the rat brain tissues. Furthermore, 2100-MHz RFR may cause formation of DNA single-strand breaks.

AB  - In this paper, we study the relationship between environmental uncertainty and performance in the rice supply chain in the Ayeyarwaddy Region, Myanmar. Efficiency is one of the important performance indicators in both supply chain and agribusiness. In this regard, the objectives of the study are to identify the different sources of uncertainty perceived by the different actors in the supply chain, to measure the rice supply chain efficiency, and to study the impact of the environmental uncertainty on the supply chain efficiency. The data of 215 respondents is collected from the Ayeyarwaddy Region by using a purposive and stratified random sampling method, and we analyze this data via descriptive statistics, an exploratory factor analysis, data envelopment analysis (DEA), and Tobit regression analysis. The scores for the technical, pure, and scale efficiency show a very low performance of the rice supply chain in the Ayeyarwaddy Region resulting from the fact that most of the rice businesses are too small and need to expand their operating size. We found that this global rice supply chain performance is significantly impacted by the planning and control uncertainty and the climate uncertainty. Therefore, mitigation initiatives must be developed such as financial insurance mechanisms and extension services should be widespread. Both aim to improve the impact of the climate adverse conditions and to increase the efficiency of resource utilization in the supply chain. Moreover, the actors should organize themselves in cooperatives such that the scale of operations can be increased and information is captured and shared between different parties in the supply chain. This is crucial to operational control and planning because a higher quality of information input will increase the quality of managerial decision making.

AB  - Morgan has argued that attitudes to the medicalisation of sports are historically conditioned. While the history of doping offers contested versions of when the sports world turned againstconservative forces, Morgan has argued that these attitudes are out of step with prevailingnorms and that the World Anti Doping Agency's policy needs to be modified to better reflectthis. As an advocate of critical democracies in sports, he argues that anti-doping policy mustacknowledge and reflect these shifts in order to secure their legitimacy. In response, wecritically present the World Anti-Doping Agency's policy that incorporates the Prohibited Listof Substances and Methods for athletes. We evaluate the validity of the therapy-enhancementdistinction in relation to its role in both justifying and sustaining the operation of theProhibited List. In particular, we focus on the case of thyroxine, which has been the subjectof controversy in athletic doping. While thyroxine is not currently banned, critics haveclaimed that its use in the absence of a relevant pathology is tantamount to doping. Wechallenge Morgan's claim that a conventionalist defence of the therapy-enhancementdistinction is the best available, and his conclusion that this properly supports a morepermissive stance towards performance-enhancing drug use. Furthermore, we reject hisconventionalist support for democratic line drawing in relation to doping and in particular thestatus of thyroxine with regard to the prohibited list. We offer a modified defence of the statusquo, a qualified, naturalist account of health and disease, where athletes may be prescribeddrugs that are genuine responses to medical necessity that do not, or do not typically, threatenthe goods of athletic excellence.

AB  - Nowadays, city planning with the core of smart growth has attracted more and more attention all over the world. In order to cope with the rapid development of world urbanization, America first adopted the "smart growth" strategy and proposesed ten principles of smart growth to curb the spread of cities, thus building a sustainable development city with economic prosperity, social justice and environment sustainability. This article combines four important indicators of geographical, environmental, social and economic conditions to establish an indicator system for evaluating the sustainability of the city based on the ten principles and 3E index.
   This article selects two places San Diego, USA and Adelaide, Australia to be the research object. According to the index system model, we evaluate the current growth plan. We use the entropy evaluation method to calculate the weight of each indicator of the city. The factors weight of San Diego were 0.308; 0.271; 0.172; 0.249 in economy, society, environment and geography, respectively. The factors weight of Adelaide are 0.310; 0.288; 0.230; 0.172 in economy, society, environment and geography, respectively. The entropy evaluation method and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation are used to assess whether the city meets the requirement of smart growth. The result shows that, the coordination coefficient of the two cities gradually reduced after 2016 which are going to toward the unsustainable development. Based on the smart growth evaluation index system and optimized urban plan combined with the time series, we predict the data from 2016 to 2050 and evaluate the future development of the two cities through the entropy method. As a result, the two cities-San Diego and Adelaide are sustainable development cities which conform to the principles of smart growth.

AB  - Ongoing climate change affects growth and increases biotic and abiotic threats to Germany's forests. We analysed how these risks develop through the mid-century under a variety of climate change scenarios using the process-based forest model 4C. This model allows the calculation of indicators for fire danger, late frost risk for beech and oak, drought stress and nun moth risk. 4C was driven by a set of 4 simulations of future climate generated with the statistical model STARS and with 10 simulations of future climate based on EURO-CORDEX model simulations for the RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 pathways. A set of about 70000 forest stands (Norway spruce, Scots pine, beech, oak, birch), based on the national forest inventory describing 98.4% of the forest in Germany, was used together with data from a digital soil map. The changes and the range of changes were analysed by comparing results of a recent time period (1971-2005) and a scenario time period (2011-2045). All indicators showed higher risks for the scenario time period compared to the recent time period, except the late frost risk indicators, if averaged over all climate scenarios. The late frost risk for beech and oaks decreased for the main forest sites. Under recent climate conditions, the highest risk with regard to all five indicators was found to be in the Southwest Uplands and the northern part of Germany. The highest climate-induced uncertainty regarding the indicators for 2011-2045 is projected for the East Central Uplands and Northeast German Plain.

AB  - Purpose: The increased demand for probiotics because of their health purposes provides the context for this study, which involves the molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) obtained from the vaginal microbiota of healthy fertile women. The isolates were subjected for examination to prove their probiotic potential. In particular, the isolates were subjected to various tests, including acid/bile tolerance, antimicrobial activity, antibiotic susceptibility, Gram staining, and catalase enzyme activity assessment.
   Methods: Several methods were utilized for the molecular identification of the isolates, including ARDRA, (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting, and the PCR sequencing of 16S-rDNA amplified fragments. Disc diffusion and well diffusion methods were used to assess antibiotic susceptibility and antibacterial activity of isolates. Tolerance to acid and bile was performed at pH 2.5 and 0.3% bile oxgall.
   Results: A total of 45 isolates of 88 separate organisms was selected. All of the isolates demonstrated an antibacterial effect on the exploited indicator microorganisms. All selected strains also maintained their viability at low-pH and high-bile salt conditions and exhibited abroad variation in their survival. Only the Enterococcus avium strain showed resistance to all 9 tested antibiotics. Based on the molecular identification and clustering, the 45 isolated bacteria were classified into three major groups of LAB: Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.
   Conclusion: LAB are microorganisms that have a particularly important function in maintaining the health of the vaginal and gastrointestinal tract and in protecting it from infection by other pathogenic organisms.
   The isolates found to be a promising probiotic candidate by showed desirable characteristics. Therefore, strain DL3 can be used as natural food preservative with some more potential investigations.

AB  - Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model SimRoot to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (Hordeum vulgare) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.

AB  - The increasing worldwide consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products such as ibuprofen (IBU) is leading to the widespread and persistent occurrence of these chemicals and their transformation products in soils and waters. Although at low concentrations, the continuous discharge of these micropollutants and the incomplete removal by the actual wastewater treatments can provoke accumulation in the environment with risks for the trophic chain. Non-target organisms as duckweed can be used for the environniental monitoring of pharmaceutical emerging contaminants. In this work, plants of Lama gibba L were exposed to high (020 and 1 mg L-1) and environmentally relevant (0.02 mg L-1) concentrations of IBU to investigate their removal and metabolization capacity. The main oxidized IBU metabolites in humans (hydroxy-IBU and carboxy-IBU) Were determined in tht intact plants and in the growth solutions, together with non-destructiVe physiological parameters and phytotoxic indicators. The IBU uptake increased with the increasing of IBU concentration in the medium, but the relative accumulation of the pharmaceutical and generation of hydroxy-IBU was higher in presence of the lower IBU treatments. Carboxy-IBU was not found in the plant tissue and solutions. The changes observed in growth and photosynthetic performances were not able to induce phyto-toxic effects. Apart from a mean physical-chemical degradation of 82%, the IBU removal by plants was highly efficient (89-92.5%) in all the conditions tested, highlighting the role of L gibba in the biodegradation of emerging contaminants.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is invaluable for maintaining agricultural production, but its use, and particularly inefficient use, can lead to environmental losses. This paper reviews N use efficiency (NUE) and N surplus indicators for dairy production systems to assess their utility for optimising N use outcomes and minimising environmental N losses. Using case-study examples, we also assess realistic goals for these indicators and discuss key issues associated with their use. Published whole-farm NUE and whole-farm N surplus values ranged within 10-65% and 40-700kg N ha(-1) year(-1) respectively. In a study of five catchments across New Zealand, whole-farm NUE was more strongly affected by catchment differences in soil and climatic conditions than by differences in management. In contrast, whole-farm N surplus differed both between- and within-catchments and was a good indicator of N losses to water. Realistic goals for both NUE and N surplus thus depend on the agro-climatic context of the dairy system and on its economic and environmental goals. Crop and animal NUE values can be valuable indicators for optimising fertiliser and feed use and minimising N losses. However, global or national whole-farm NUE values appear of limited value if the ultimate goal for setting targets is to reduce the environmental impact of N use; whole-farm level targets based on N surplus would be a more useful indicator for this purpose. Our review also reinforces the importance of standardising the variables that should be used to estimate NUE and N surplus values, to ensure equitable comparisons between different systems. Finally, NUE and N surplus targets should also be set in the context of other agro-environmental considerations.

AB  - The gene for fatty acid binding proteins (I-FABP) in golden pompano Trachinotus ovatus larvae was cloned and analyzed from hatch to 18 days-post hatch (DPH). The I-FABP gene (GenBank accession: MF034871) of golden pompano is composed of 815 bp with an open reading frame of 399 bp, encoded in one amino acid with a molecular weight of 15.24 kDa. The predicted amino acid sequence of I-FABP genes from golden pompano showed high similarity and identity with Japanese sea bass Lateolabrax japonicus (97% and 87.9%, AOW69620.1). The highest tissue expression of I-FABP genes was found in the intestine, followed by the eye on 18 DPH. During the ontogenetic development, the expression of I-FABP genes remained at a low level during the first five days, and reached the highest level on 12 and 18 DPH. The expression of I-FABP genes was not significantly affected by environmental temperature on 12 DPH, but was significantly affected by the temperature on 18 DPH. Nutrition enhancement with algae containing high fatty acids significantly affected the expression of I-FABP genes. The highest expression was observed in the non-enriched treatment, but the lowest expression was in the Nannochloropsis feeding treatment. Results of the present study indicate that the expression of the I-FABP gene varies with environmental temperature and nutritional conditions during the ontogenetic development of golden pompano larvae. The expression of I-FABP genes may be potentially used as an indicator for assessing nutrient supply and functional development of the digestive system in fish larvae.

AB  - Numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities are the hallmarks of cancer. Whereas the structural chromosome aberrations got more substantial attention for cancer risk assessment in a healthy population, the role of aneuploidy is much less understood in this respect. We analysed the frequency of numerical (and structural) aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 2145 healthy individuals between 1989 and 2010, taking into account different biological-and exposure-conditions. We also studied to what extent chromosome gains or losses may predict the probability of cancer. The average frequency of all aneuploid cells was 1.78 +/- 0.06% in the entire study population, which increased linearly with age. Gender and smoking did not influence the values, however, occupational exposures did. The highest frequency of aneuploidy was found in chemical industry-workers (1.89 +/- 0.05%) compared with the lowest value of medical radiation workers (1.44 +/- 0.10%), respectively. No correlation was found between numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations. Cancer incidence followed for 1-23 years after the chromosome analysis showed a 1.26-fold relative risk (confidence interval: 1.02-1.58; P = 0.04) for those with higher frequency of aneuploid cells (1.82% vs. 1.44% in controls). Hypodiploidy had higher impact on the cancer risk than hyperdiploidy (1.72% vs. 0.10%). Our findings on the frequency of numerical aberrations in a healthy cohort represent the largest cytogenetic database from one laboratory with an unchanged mechanistic scoring method during a 30-year period, and provide basic information not only for genotoxicological studies but also confirm the association between numerical aberrations and cancer risk.

AB  - Endophytic plant growth-promoting bacteria (endophytes) were isolated from a variety of (pseudo)metallophytes growing in an abandoned Zn/Pb mine and then characterized according to their plant growth-promoting traits (i.e. ACC deaminase activity, IAA production, siderophore production, phosphate solubilising capacity, metal and salt tolerance and phenotypic characterization). Initially, under growth chamber conditions, an endophyte-assisted aided phytostabilization study was carried outwith Festuca rubra plants (native vs. commercial variety) inoculated with a Pseudomonas sp. isolate and cow slurry as organic amendment. The effect of treatments on soil physicochemical and microbial indicators of soil quality, as well as plant physiological parameters and metal concentrations, was assessed. We performed a complementary interpretation of our data through their grouping within a set of ecosystem services. Although the application of cow slurry had the most pronounced effects on soil quality indicators and ecosystem services, the growth of native F. rubra plants reduced soil bioavailability of Cd and Zn by 19 and 22%, respectively, and enhanced several soil microbial parameters. On the other hand, endophyte (Pseudomonas sp.) inoculation improved the physiological status of F. rubra plants by increasing the content of carotenoids, chlorophylls and Fv/Fm by 69, 65 and 37%, respectively, while also increasing the values of several soil microbial parameters. Finally, a consortium of five endophyte isolates was used for an endophyte-assisted aided phytostabilization field experiment, where lower metal concentrations in native excluder plants were found. Nonetheless, the field inoculation of the endophyte consortium had no effect on the biomass of native plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effective restoration of wetland habitats requires understanding the establishment requirements, growth responses, and expansion dynamics of targeted plant species. This is particularly true when restoring areas that have been previously managed for other activities, such as agriculture, which can have legacy effects on the local environment. We investigated environmental factors (specifically hydrology and soil physicochemical conditions) that may influence the establishment, growth and expansion of Schoenoplectus californicus in a tidal freshwater marsh restoration site in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, USA. This study site was previously leveed, drained, and utilized for agricultural production. A 1997 levee breach restored tidal connectivity and wetland vegetation has re-established in portions of the area. Our approach coupled an intensively-sampled transect study in S. californicus-dominated marshes with a spatially-extensive survey of S. californicus lateral expansion rates and elevation. Lateral expansion of S. californicus marsh edge was significantly less in lower elevation areas (0.61 +/- A 0.04 m NAVD88), whereas the marsh edge at higher elevations (0.84 +/- A 0.03 m NAVD88) exhibited greater expansion, often at rates greater than 1.0 m year(-1). These elevation means correspond to percentages of time that the marsh surface was flooded of 100 and 94 %, respectively. Although marsh edge expansion was influenced by elevation and the resultant hydrology, other factors, such as physical exposure of marsh shorelines and compacted agricultural soils also appear to be important. However, once established, S. californicus appears to be able to ameliorate high soil bulk densities over time as the advancing marsh platform develops.

AB  - Aims: The presence of viable but nonculturable (VBNC) bacterial pathogens which often fail to be detected by cultivation and can regain the cultivability if the living conditions improve were reported. The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence of VBNC Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. in the biosolids during anaerobic digestion and its reactivation during the cake storage.
   Methods and Results: The occurrence of VBNC Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. during mesophilic, temperature-phased, thermophilic anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and the subsequent storage were studied by RT-qPCR and most probable number (MPN) method. The VBNC incidence of Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. during thermophilic digestion was four orders of magnitude higher than those of mesophilic digestion. Accordingly, higher resuscitation ratio of VBNC pathogens was also achieved in thermophilic digested sludge. As a result, the culturable Salmonella typhimurium contents in thermophilic digested sludge after cake storage were two orders of magnitude higher than mesophilic digestion. Both quantitive PCR and reverse transcription quantitative PCR assay results showed the two bacterial counting numbers remained stable throughout the cake storage.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that the increase in the culturable Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. after centrifugal dewatering was attributed to the resuscitation from the VBNC state to the culturable state.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Thermophilic anaerobic digestion mainly induced Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. into VBNC state rather than killed them, suggesting that the biological safety of sewage sludge by temperature-phased anaerobic digestion should be carefully assessed.

AB  - In order to study genetic architecture of physiological criteria of drought tolerance in wheat using different diallel techniques, an experiment was conducted on six bread wheat genotypes as parents and their 15 hybrids in a randomized complete block design with three replicates under rainfed conditions at the Research Farm of the Campus of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran during 2010-2011 cropping season. The results of analysis of variance showed significant differences between the genotypes for relative water content (RWC), relative chlorophyll content (RCC), chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), total chlorophyll (Chl T) and proline concentration (PC). RWC, Chl T and PC exhibited significant differences for general combining ability, indicating the involvement of additive gene action in their inheritance. Moreover, as specific combining ability was not significant for all studied traits, hence these traits are predominantly controlled by additive gene action. Parent number one was the best general combiner for improvement of RWC, RCC and Chl b, while the best general combiner for improvement of Chl a, Chl T and PC was parent number five. Also, the best specific combination for improvement of RWC, RCC, Chl a, Chl b, Chl T and PC were the crosses 2x4, 1x2, 3x6, 1x6, 1x6 and 1x4, respectively indicating that parents of these crosses are genetically varied. Hayman and Morley-Jones analysis of variance revealed that the inheritance of RWC, Chl a, Chl b, and Chl T was mainly controlled by additive gene effects, while PC was controlled by both additive as well as dominance type of gene action.

AB  - A reconstruction of paleoenvironmental changes and monsoon variability during the - mid late Holocene was carried out using phytolith analysis on a sediment core collected near the Landfall Island, Bay of Bengal. The sediment core was age dated using radiocarbon method and the dates range in age from 6078 (-22.8 parts per thousand delta C-13) to 1658 yrs BP (-23.3 parts per thousand delta C-13). A down sediment core variation in phytolith assemblages was investigated and classified based on their shape, size and morphology, further the climate index (Ic), phytolith index (Iph) and cold/warm ratios were calculated to understand the paleoenvironmental implications. The phytolith assemblages suggest that the mid - Holocene similar to 6500 to 5000 yrs BP experienced intense southwest monsoon (SWM), followed by a weakened monsoon from similar to 5000 yrs BP to present. Within this tapering weakened monsoon period; an extremely destabilized monsoon prevailed around 4400 yrs BP (-24.3 parts per thousand delta C-13). The fluctuations in the SWM intensity continued between 3600 yrs BP and 2400 yrs BP with an amelioration in its intensity around 3400 yrs BP. Further, the monsoon conditions from 2400 yrs BP continued to be feeble until 800 yrs BP. These inferences drawn on monsoonal variations based on phytolith data have been well corroborated with the sediment texture, organic matter (OM), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and various other climate models reported from this region using different proxies.

AB  - A large number of beaches in Venezuela are visited throughout the year, and there is a legal system in place whereby these beaches are monitored and classified as suitable or not for bathing. However, the presence of parasites in the sand on the beaches is not evaluated as part of this classification The presence of only one pathogenic parasite on a beach indicates fecal contamination either by humans, animals or the accumulation of trash, in addition to geographical and environmental characteristics which could influence the development of the parasites. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of parasites pathogenic to humans as indicators of fecal contamination on a beach in Puerto Cabello. A total of 110 sand samples were collected over one year at different geographic locations selected to cover the entire bay area. Samples were registered as collected during the pre or post-holiday seasons, and the relative moisture of the sand, geographic location and season were also noted. Parasites were collected by washing with 0.85% saline solution, and tested using the Rugai method modified by Willis. Overall, 25% of samples showed positive for the parasites as follows: Strongyloides spp.: rhabditoid (8.33%) and filarioid (2.08%) larvae, Ancylostoma spp.: eggs (2.08%) and rhabditoid larvae (12.49%), Toxocara spp.: eggs (4.17%) and Isospora belli: oocysts (2.08%), indicating extensive fecal contamination from both human and animal sources. We hope that investigations such as this will lead to the establishment of hygiene standards and programs for monitoring the levels of parasitic contamination on sandy beaches.

AB  - This review of applied geochemical methods for monitoring CO2 leakage focuses on shallow freshwater aquifers overlying CO2 storage areas. Geochemical tracer tools form a set of geochemical techniques, each of which is examined in this review and classified according to its sensitivity in CO2 detection. The purpose of any monitoring programme is to be able to provide sufficient information to enable site remediation in the case of unforeseen events and also to enable a satisfactory site closure strategy. Therefore, CO2 monitoring tools must be able to detect a precursor signal or an early warning signal of leakage associated with potentially minute geochemical modifications (i.e. associated with small amounts of CO2).
   We have classified the monitoring/tracing tools into two groups: (A) direct indicators of the CO2 itself, and (B) indirect indicators (i.e. reaction products) of the presence of CO2 that take into account displacement of the chemical equilibria under the conditions imposed by CO2 dissolution. Included in these tools are isotopic monitoring tools that are very sensitive to physico-chemical changes and can therefore provide early CO2 detection. These tools include carbon and oxygen isotope systematics that are conventionally used with respect to CO2 in the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) context. Finally, the review offers new perspectives on sensitive indirect detection methods using isotopes that are `non-traditional' in the sense that they have not yet been applied to the field of CO2 geological storage. The complementarity of these geochemical methods provides a powerful monitoring strategy. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The progressive salinization of arable lands at a rate of 3 ha min(-1) worldwide is a major concern for agricultural crop production. The future of crop improvement to resist or tolerate environmental stresses requires selecting halophytes that will produce high yield and profit. A halophyte, Sulla carnosa (Hedysarum carnosum Desf.), collected from southern and central Tunisia is considered a salt-resistance species. A group of five populations represented by 150 genotypes (30 genotypes per population) were tested under greenhouse conditions with salt treatments 0 mM (control) and 300 mM (stressed). Fifteen agronomic traits related to vegetative and reproductive growth were evaluated for their responses to salinity stress. Analysis of the population effect and genotypes within population's effect shows that both population and genotype factors have a significant effect for almost all measured traits. The highest diversity in traits was found within progeny originating from Douiret and Kairouan populations (mean and CV across the 15 traits 48.4 and 46.5%, respectively). Level of phenotypic differentiation (Q_ST) varied according to measured traits; it ranged from 0.108 for flowering time to 0.63 for mean crown width with an average of 0.29. Means comparison and principal component analysis showed that six genotypes from different origins were ranked as salt tolerant and three others as salt sensitive. These findings indicate the potential for selecting plants or traits with improved salt tolerance within that species. The method used allows detection plants or traits with enhanced salinity tolerance after 2 mo of growth for the ability to grow at salt concentrations that prevent the growth of other plants.

AB  - Spectral and thermal assessments may enable the precise, high-throughput and low-cost characterisation of traits linked to drought tolerance. However, spectral and thermal measurements of the canopy water status are influenced by the crops' soil coverage, the size of the biomass and other properties such as the leaf angle distribution. The aim of this study was to develop a referenced spectral method that would be minimally influenced by potentially perturbing factors for retrieving the water status of differing cultivars. Sixteen spring barley cultivars were grown in field trials under imposed drought stress, natural drought stress and irrigated conditions. The relative leaf water content of barley plants declines diurnally from pre-dawn until the afternoon, and other plant traits such as the biomass change little throughout the day. As an indicator of the current drought stress, pre-dawn and afternoon values of the relative leaf water content were assessed spectrally. Diurnal changes in reflectance are only slightly influenced by other perturbing factors. A new spectral index (diurnal dehydration index) was developed by using the wavelengths 730 and 457 nm collected from an active spectrometer. This index allowed the differentiation of the drought tolerance of barley plants. The diurnal dehydration index was significantly related to final biomass, grain yield and harvest index and significantly different between cultivars. Compared with other indices, the diurnal dehydration index offered a higher stability in retrieving the water status of barley plants. Due to its diurnal assessment, the index was barely influenced by the differences in cultivars biomass at the time of measurement. It may represent a valuable tool for assessing the water status or drought tolerance in breeding nurseries.

AB  - The complex interplay of climate shifts over Eurasia and global sea level changes modulates freshwater and saltwater inputs to the Black Sea. The dynamics of the hydrologic changes from the Late Glacial into the Holocene remain a matter of debate, and information on how these changes affected the ecology of the Black Sea is sparse. Here we used Roche 454 next-generation pyrosequencing of sedimentary 18S rRNA genes to reconstruct the plankton community structure in the Black Sea over the last ca. 11,400 y. We found that 150 of 2,710 species showed a statistically significant response to four environmental stages. Freshwater chlorophytes were the best indicator species for lacustrine conditions (> 9.0 ka B. P.), although the copresence of previously unidentified marine taxa indicated that the Black Sea might have been influenced to some extent by the Marmara Sea since at least 9.6 ka calendar (cal) B. P. Dinoflagellates, cercozoa, eustigmatophytes, and haptophytes responded most dramatically to the gradual increase in salinity after the latest marine reconnection and during the warm and moist mid-Holocene climatic optimum. According to paired analysis of deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) isotope ratios in fossil alkenones, salinity increased rapidly with the onset of the dry Subboreal after similar to 5.2 ka B. P., leading to an increase in marine fungi and the first occurrence of marine copepods. A gradual succession of dinoflagellates, diatoms, and chrysophytes occurred during the refreshening after similar to 2.5 ka cal B. P. with the onset of the cool and wet Subatlantic climate and recent anthropogenic perturbations.

AB  - The Albufera of Valencia, one of the largest oligohaline coastal lagoons of the Iberian Peninsula, has suffered hydrological and landscape modifications since medieval times. This paleolimnological study clears up the controversy about the factors, which drove the lake to its present state. Lithological descriptions, ostracod paleoassemblages and Cyprideis torosa (Jones, 1850) shell morphological variations and geochemistry (delta O-18, delta C-13 and Sr/Ca) have been used to reconstruct the lake ecosystem evolution during the last two centuries. The sandy sediments at the bottom of L'Antina core (63 cm) presented a typical assemblage of brackish water ostracods, with shellderived delta O-18 values, inferred salinity and Sr/Ca-WATER characteristic of waters with marine influence. However, 10 cm above, coinciding with a drastic change in lithology, ostracod palaeoassemblages and decreased shell delta O-18 indicated a shift to freshwater influences. At the top of the sequence, inferred salinity suggests oligohaline waters and ostracods have almost disappeared. The early brackish conditions of Lake Albufera changed at the beginning of the 19th century when important hydrological modifications were undertaken for irrigation and started the major period of rice field expansion. Later, with the change of traditional rice farming to a more technological agriculture, together with increased domestic and industrial sewage inputs, the Albufera became a highly eutrophicated system 50 years ago. Eventually, the loss of macrophyte cover, cyanobacteria blooms and the increase of grazing by fish forced the loss of ostracod communities, currently almost inexistent.

AB  - 1. Old-growth forests have features that endow them with an extraordinary ecological value. These forests are sources of habitat diversity and, consequently, biodiversity, which makes them a basic objective of conservation programs. Insects have been traditionally used as indicators of forest condition.
   2. The aim of this study is to uncover patterns of Hymenoptera abundance and diversity, and their relationship with structural features in old-growth forests. We use pan traps to sample the community of flying Hymenoptera in two old-growth forest types (silver fir and mountain pine) with important structural differences.
   3. Compared to other surveys of local Hymenoptera communities, our sampling yielded an extremely high number of species (630).
   4. At the plot level, the two forest types showed important differences in family richness and diversity, but not in abundance or in species richness and diversity. However, variability in species richness was higher among pine than silver fir plots, leading to overall higher species richness in the former.
   5. Species composition also differed between pine than silver fir forests, and these differences were related to important structural differences between the two forest types.
   6. Canonical correspondence and multiple regression analysis yielded contrasting habitat requirements among Hymenoptera families and functional groups (bees, sawflies, parasitic wasps and predatory wasps).
   7. We conclude that flying Hymenoptera communities can be used as good indicators of forest structure, habitat complexity and conservation status.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between the adaptive processes of Suaeda fruticosa for Pi acquisition and the physic-chemical and biological characteristics of two soil types under moderate and high saline conditions. Four treatments were established in pots: namely SS100, SS600, CS100 and CS600 where SS stood for sandy soil and CS for calcareous soil, and the indexes 100 and 600 were NaCl concentrations (mM) in irrigation distilled water. Assuming that Pi per g of plant biomass is an indicator of plant efficiency for P acquisition, the results showed that Pi acquisition was easiest on SS100 and was difficult on CS100. The differences in Pi acquisition between plants on SS100 and CS100 could be attributed to the low root surface area (-30%) and to the low alkaline phosphatases (Pases) activities (-50%) in calcareous rhizospheric soil. The high salinity level had no effect on the efficiency of P acquisition on SS but increased this parameter on CS (+50%). In the latter soil type, high acid phosphatase activities were observed in rhizospheric soil at high salinity level. Acid phosphatase seemed to be secreted from the roots. The higher secretion of acid phosphatase in this soil was related to the root lipid peroxidation in response to elevated salinity associated with the augmentation of unsaturated acids which might induce an oxidative damage of the root membrane. Thus we can conclude that in deficient soil such as calcareous, the efficiency of P acquisition in S. fruticosa which was difficult at moderate salinity level can be enhanced by high salinity level.

AB  - Recently, a lack of any significant relationship between Suckling bout duration and milk or energy intake has been revealed in several mammal species. However, a short suckling bout duration could be taken as an indicator of shortage of milk and lack of maternal care, and could therefore be used to test the parent-offspring conflict hypothesis. We examined suckling bout duration of 20 plains zebra (Equus burchellii) foals, at the Dvur Kralove Zoo, and collected data on suckling events during 19 months of observation. In total, we recorded 3252 suckling bouts during 831 h of observation. As expected, suckling bout duration decreased with increasing age of the foal. The suckling bouts differed in duration when terminated by the foal, mother or any other adult mare (foal > mother > herdmate). Thus, bouts terminated by the mother should indicate that demands of the foal were not satisfied. The shortest bouts were those terminated by a herdmate; however, herdmates terminated few suckling bouts. Moreover, since the foal was able to resume suckling after interruption, the effect of a herdmate on suckling behaviour was very limited. Finally, we found that suckling bout duration was shorter in pregnant mothers than in non-pregnant ones, suggesting higher mother-offspring conflict when the mother was pregnant. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of the termination of suckling bouts and the mother's pregnancy when interpreting suckling bout duration of equids, which has received little attention in previous studies. Our Study showed that environmental condition can affect the suckling behaviour of captive equids. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To provide information pertaining to features fundamental for survival, activity and spread of the Gulf Coast tick Amblyomma maculatum Koch (Acari: Ixodidae), vector of agents of human spotted fever rickettsiosis (boutonneuse fever) and canine hepatozoonosis, we determined water balance characteristics for each life stage, supplementing earlier work on adults, for a more comprehensive evaluation through the life cycle. The water balance profile of A. maculatum follows a consistent developmental pattern where the egg is the major water-conservation stage, the larva emphasizes water gain (water vapor absorption from drier air; low critical equilibrium activity, CEA), the adult emphasizes water retention (low net transpiration rate) and the nymph is transitional. A. maculatum in the various stages shares a similar dehydration tolerance limit, CEA, percentage body water content and inability to drink free water from droplets with other ticks. The low net transpiration rate of A. maculatum is the distinguishing feature, classifying A. maculatum as xerophilic compared to other tick species and their corresponding stages. Of importance, the low net transpiration rate of A. maculatum does not match the humid environment (predicting high net transpiration rate) where this tick is distributed, rather it reflects conditions of the microhabitat and slightly altered behaviors relevant to drying out that permit survival in the larger areas that they occupy. Thus, the view that net transpiration rate is an indicator of habitat preference in terns of moisture requirements needs to be modified. Ticks operate on a smaller scale (i.e., microhabitat), indicating a need for direct field observations.

AB  - The adsorption of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs; atrazine and diuron) onto lampblack was studied in the presence of nonionic, cationic, and anionic surfactants (Triton(R) X-100), benzalkonium chloride [BC], and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate [LAS]) to determine the effect of the surfactant on HOC adsorption onto a hydrophobic carbonaceous geosorbent. Linear alkylbenzene sulfortate showed an adsorption capacity higher than that of BC but similar to that of Triton X-100, implying the charge property of a surfactant is not a useful indicator for predicting the surfactant's adsorption onto a hydrophobic medium. The results also indicated that the octanol-water partition coefficient (K-OW) of a surfactant is not a good predictor of that surfactant's sorption onto a hydrophobic medium. Under subsaturation adsorption conditions (i.e., before sorption saturation is reached), surfactant adsorption reduced HOC adsorption to a significant extent, with the reduction in HOC adsorption increasing monotonically with the amount of surfactant adsorbed. Among the three surfactants, Triton X-100 was the most effective in reducing HOC adsorption, whereas BC and LAS showed similar effectiveness in this regard. Under the same amount of the surfactant sorbed, the reduction in atrazine adsorption was consistently greater than that for diuron because of atrazine's lower hydrophobicity. No significant difference was observed in the amount of the HOC adsorbed under different adsorption sequences. Our results showed that the presence of surfactant can significantly decrease HOC adsorption onto hydrophobic environmental media and, thus, is important in predicting HOC fate and transport in the environment.

AB  - Jordan Valley is one of the important areas in Jordan that involves dense agricultural activities, which depend on groundwater resources. The groundwater is exploited from an unconfined shallow aquifer which is mainly composed of alluvial deposits. In the vicinity of the Kafrein and South Shunah, the shallow aquifer shows signs of contamination from a wide variety of non-point sources. In this study, a vulnerability map was created as a tool to determine areas where groundwater is most vulnerable to contamination. One of the most widely used groundwater vulnerability mapping methods is SINTACS, which is a point count system model for the assessment of groundwater pollution hazards. SINTACS model is an adaptation for Mediterranean conditions of the well-known DRASTIC model. The model takes into account several environmental factors: these include topography, hydrology, geology, hydrogeology, and pedology. Spatial knowledge of all these factors and their mutual relationships is needed in order to properly model aquifer vulnerability using this model. Geographic information system was used to express each of SINTACS parameters as a spatial thematic layer with a specific weight and score. The final SINTACS thematic layer (intrinsic vulnerability index) was produced by taking the summation of each score parameter multiplied by its specific weight. The resultant SINTACS vulnerability map of the study area indicates that the highest potential sites for contamination are along the area between Er Ramah and Kafrein area. To the north of the study area there is a small, circular area which shows fairly high potential. Elsewhere, very low to low SINTACS index values are observed, indicating areas of low vulnerability potential.

AB  - Human breath contains hundreds of trace volatile organic compounds. These volatile substances may be generated in the body or may be absorbed as contaminants from the environment. Some of the endogenous substances are characteristic markers of pathophysiological processes and clinicians are already using breath testing of such substances as an additional noninvasive diagnostic tool for certain diseases. Isoprene, another volatile compound, is formed enclogenously in humans, and while the biochemical pathways of biosynthesis and exact origins of isoprene found in human breath have not been elucidated in sufficient depth, its measurement in exhaled breath has been suggested as a non-invasive indicator with diagnostic potential. This test has not yet reached the level of routine clinical methods and is still under development. Breath isoprene levels have been reported to be altered in a number of clinical conditions; however, the physiological meaning of these changes has not been established. Various lines of supportive evidence suggest that isoprene is related to cholesterol biosynthesis. Therefore, breath isoprene measurements could potentially be used for mass screening for lipid disorders and could, at minimum, serve as an additional parameter to complement invasive tests for monitoring the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy, pharmacological and dietary or lifestyle. As a potentially useful biomarker of mevalonate synthesis in humans, it may have non-invasive applications, not only in metabolic disorders, but possibly also in cancer screening. In the present work, we aim to give a concise overview of breath isoprene, its measurement techniques, problems concerning its physiological meaning, and potential applications as a non-invasive biomarker in modern medicine.

AB  - Given sufficient time and genetic variation, populations of ectothermic animals living in different thermal environments are expected to diverge in their thermal optima for growth. Several recent studies have used common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles as models to study animal adaptation to geographic variation in ambient temperatures, but little attention has been paid to how the growth of different body parts responds to variation in temperature. We examined the variation in early growth in body. tail and relative tail length of common frog tadpoles in a common garden experiment that subjected individuals from six populations situated along a 1600-km latitudinal gradient to different temperature and food treatments. We found a high degree of latitudinally unordered inter-populational differentiation in relative tail length, and that increasing levels of environmental stress (low temperature and restricted food) lead to increased mean relative tail length. This occurred mainly because of changes in body growth, not because of changes in tail growth per se. This suggests that growth of the tail itself is less sensitive to environmental stress than body growth, but at the same time the relative length of tail can be a good indicator of growth conditions experienced by individuals. In general, the results do not support the earlier proposition that common frog tadpoles in the south have relatively longer tails due to increased risk of predation, but indirect evidence was found to support the contention that the populations along the latitudinal gradient have different thermal optima for growth as indicated by latitudinally ordered differences in how relative tail length changed in response to temperature treatments.

AB  - Ensuring sustainable agriculture in semiarid Africa requires the implementation of methods to balance nutrients and to conserve soil organic matter (SOM). There is an urgent need to improve the management of all types of SOM input. In this paper; the authors review a wide range of agricultural practices and discuss their advantages, limitations and feasibility. They distinguish `traditional systems' such as traditional fallow, parkland and manuring from `improved systems' such as `improved fallow', forest fallow, alley cropping, cover crops and application of composted manure. Biomass production (BMP) for `improved systems' is mainly linked: (i) for agroforestry, to the tree species used in forest fallow, to the synchronization of nutrient supply by the soil with the cereal demand in alley cropping, and generally to the efficiency of the root system and its development with the depth; (ii) for cover crops, BMP is mainly linked to the initial soil fertility and to the ecological zone: establishment and management of cover crops are not yet fully mastered under some conditions such as an annual rainfall below 800 mm and/or on very clayey soils; (iii) for manure, BMP is mainly linked to the improvement of fallow in order to ensure sufficient forage resources. Because semiarid Africa is mainly a livestock zone, the authors emphasise manure: constraints, quality indicators and tools used to encourage its production, are analysed. Thus it was concluded that the intensification of manure production and its rational use in semiarid African regions, threatened by drought and malnutrition, is very important: this cannot be separated from the production of plant biomass, whose possibilities have been examined above.

AB  - The goal of this study is to identify the causes of membrane failure observed during a 15-month operation of a low pressure reverse osmosis (RO) membrane pilot plant to treat a highly organic surface water from the Hillsborough River in Tampa, Florida, using various surface analytical techniques. Three different commercial RO membranes, made of cellulose acetate or polyamide, were used in this pilot study, and all of these membranes showed performance deterioration presumably due to membrane fouling and degradation at given experimental conditions. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of membrane failure, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were performed on the surface of the polymeric RO membranes used. More specifically, molecular composition including surface functional groups were identified from XPS analysis, confirmed by FTIR, and correlated to membrane failure. In addition, surface morphology and fouling layer composition were determined by SEM/EDS. The results indicated that the cellulose acetate membrane was biologically damaged, while the polyamide membrane was compromised by chlorine oxidation. The biodegradation of cellulose acetate was evidenced by the presence of nitrogen on XPS and FTIR scans. Chlorine uptake shown in XPS and FTIR scans of used polyamide membranes was a good indicator of chemical degradation. This study demonstrated that XPS, combined with FTIR and SEM/EDS, is a valuable diagnostic tool for failure analysis of polymeric RO membranes and provides valuable information to aid the manufacturers in designing better membranes for reverse osmosis.

AB  - The effects of sub-grid-scale land use differences in modifying the stability of prestorm environments has been studied using data from the Department of Energy Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) in Kansas and Oklahoma and a mesoscale model. To quantify the atmospheric instability, three indices were used: the lifted index, the modified K index, and convective available potential energy. The spatial variations of these indices were calculated from simulations using spatially varying and spatially uniform surface fluxes as lower boundary conditions. The CART is approximately 10(5) km(2) in area and is characterized by large areas of contrasting vegetation cover and surface sensible and latent heat fluxes. The spatially varying fluxes were calculated with the SiB2 model using data from the CART. Six days, during which isolated thunderstorms developed, were chosen for the study. The results suggest that sub-grid-scale variations in land use differences do not modify the spatial distribution of the stability indices in the southern Great Plains to any significant degree. Predictions of areas of preferred development of deep convection, based on changes in the indices, are not improved by accounting for sub-grid-scale variations in land use. The indices were found to be potentially useful but imperfect indicators of the occurrence of deep convective precipitation at scales smaller than that of the CART. At the model resolution used (grid spacing of 2.08 km) a close correlation was not found between regions of precipitation and regions with enhanced simulated vertical updrafts related to land-use differences, but a detailed study of local triggering has not been carried out.

AB  - Analytical chemiluminescence and bioluminescence represent a versatile, ultrasensitive tool with a wide range of applications in diverse fields such as biotechnology, pharmacology. molecular biology, clinical and environmental chemistry. Enzyme activities and enzyme substrates and inhibitors can be efficiently determined when directly involved in luminescent reactions, and also when chev take part in a reaction suitable for coupling to a final light-emitting reaction. Chemiluminescence detection has been exploited in the fields of flow-injection analysis and column-liquid chromatographic and capillary-electrophoretic separative systems, due to its high sensitivity when compared with colorimetric detection. It has widely been used as an indicator of reactive oxygen species formation in cells and whole organs, thus allowing the study of a number of pathophysiological conditions related to oxidative stress. Chemiluminescence represents a sensitive and rapid alternative to radioactivity as a detection principle in immunoassays for the determination of a wide range of molecules (hormones, food additives, environmental pollutants) and in filter membrane biospecific reactions (Southern, Northern. Western, dot blot) for the determination of nucleic acids and proteins. Chemiluminescence has also been used for the sensitive and specific localization and quantitation of target analytes in tissue sections and single cells by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques. A relatively recent application regards the use of luminescent reporter genes for the development of bioassays based on genetically engineered microorganisms or mammalian cells able to emit visible light in response to specific inorganic and organic compounds. Finally, the high detectability and rapidity of bio- and chemiluminescent detection make it suitable for the development of microarray-based high throughput screening assays, in which simultaneous, multianalyte detection is performed on multiple samples.

AB  - This study evaluates the utility of cell compounds as indicators of nutrition status of plant populations. An overview of the soluble free amino-acids, carbohydrates and P-compounds in the two year classes of leaves from Rhododendron ferrugineum populations showing variable biological performances, was drawn up using carbon-13 and phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The results showed differences between the age of leaves and the degree of population closure. The open population, which has the smallest growth rate and net primary productivity, had generally lower levels of aminoacids but higher levels of carbohydrates and P-compounds. Neither the amounts of mineral nitrogen produced by the soils nor the total nitrogen concentrations in leaves differed significantly. Still we hypothesize that the nitrogen avail ability could be largely responsible for the variations observed between the populations, as phosphorus analyses showed that the two populations did not suffer significant P deficiencies. Differences in vitality of R. ferrugineum may be explained by the fact that in an open population R. ferrugineum is forced into a situation of sharing nutrients with other species while in a closed population it is the sole species to exploit a specific pool of nutrients. Finally we observed that the C-13- and P-31-NMR approach is more suitable for studying the nutrition status of plant populations under field conditions than the determination of the total amounts of different elementary nutrients.

AB  - Laser ablation microprobe analyses of clinopyroxenes equilibrated with carbonatite melt at 20-22 kbar and 1050-1100 degrees C are used to calculate partition coefficients for an extensive suite of trace elements. Our experiments were performed on a mixture of peridotite minerals and two types of carbonates with differing trace element contents (natural carbonatite and mixtures of sedimentary carbonates). Although trace element concentrations vary by an order of magnitude between the carbonate mixtures, the partition coefficients are similar. Some, however, differ substantially from previously published values. Most of the measured elements have broadly similar partition coefficients of D-cpx/clq = 0.1-0.4, including Pr, Nd, Eu, Dy, Er and Hf, which are reported here for the first time. Considerably higher partition values are found for Ti and V which are compatible in clinopyroxene with D-cpx/lq = 1.4 +/- 0.6 for Ti and 2.9 +/- 0.9 for V (1 sigma).
   The clinopyroxene partitioning data for carbonatite (D-cpx/clq) are remarkably similar to published values for silicate melts (D-cpx/slq), with significant exceptions for the behaviour of Ti, Pa, Nb and perhaps Ta, whereas values for other silicate minerals differ more strongly between carbonatite and silicate melts. From our results, the most sensitive indicator of mantle metasomatism by carbonatite melt as opposed to silicate melt infiltration should be low Ti/Eu in metasomatised peridotites assuming closed-system metasomatism. In contrast to suggestions from some studies of metasomatised mantle xenoliths Zr/Hf ratios appear to remain unchanged during carbonatite metasomatism. These chemical effects only partly agree with those described from natural mantle rocks interpreted to result from carbonatite metasomatism.

AB  - Eighteen lakes were added to a published training set of 46 British Columbia (BC) lakes in order to expand the original range of total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to analyze the relationship between diatom assemblages and environmental variables. Specific conductivity and [TP] each explained significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) directions of variance in the distribution of the diatoms. The relationship between diatom assemblages and [TP] was sufficiently strong to warrant the development of a weighted-averaging (WA) regression and calibration model that can be used to infer past trophic status from fossil diatom assemblages.
   The relationship between observed and inferred [TP] was not improved by the addition of more eutrophic lakes, however the [TP] range and the number of taxa used in the transfer function are now superior to the original model. Diatom species assemblages changed very little in lakes with TP concentrations greater than 85 mu g l(-1), so we document the development of a model containing lakes with TP less than or equal to 85 mu g l(-1). The updated model uses 59 training lakes and covers a range of species optima from 6 to 41.9 mu g l(-1) TP, and a total of 150 diatom taxa.
   The updated inference model provided a more realistic reconstruction of the anthropogenic history of a highly eutrophic BC lake. The model can now be used to infer past nutrient conditions in other BC lakes in order to assess changes in trophic status.

AB  - Differences in the social and economic environment across countries encourage humans to migrate in search of better living conditions, including job opportunities, higher salaries, security and welfare. Quantifying global migration is, however, challenging because of poor recording, privacy issues and residence status. This is particularly critical for some classes of migrants involved in stigmatised, unregulated or illegal activities. Escorting services or high-end prostitution are well-paid activities that attract workers all around the world. In this paper, we study international migration patterns of sex-workers by using network methods. Using an extensive international online advertisement directory of escorting services and information about individual escorts, we reconstruct a migrant flow network where nodes represent either origin or destination countries. The links represent the direct routes between two countries. The migration network of sex-workers shows different structural patterns than the migration of the general population. The network contains a strong core where mutual migration is often observed between a group of high-income European countries, yet Europe is split into different network communities with specific ties to non-European countries. We find non-reciprocal relations between countries, with some of them mostly offering while others attract workers. The Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPc) is a good indicator of country attractiveness for incoming workers and service rates but is unrelated to the probability of emigration. The median financial gain of migrating, in comparison to working at the home country, is 15.9%. Only sex-workers coming from 77% of the countries have financial gains with migration and average gains decrease with the GDPc of the country of origin. Our results suggest that high-end sex-worker migration is regulated by economic, geographic and cultural aspects.

AB  - Rock glaciers are receiving increased attention as a potential source of water and indicator of climate change in periglacial landscapes. They consist of an ice-debris mixture, which creeps downslope. Although rock glaciers are a wide-spread feature on the Tibetan Plateau, characteristics such as its ice fraction are unknown as a superficial debris layer inhibits remote assessments. We investigate one rock glacier in the semiarid western Nyainqentanglha range (WNR) with a multi-method approach, which combines geophysical, geological and geomorphological field investigations with remote sensing techniques. Long-term kinematics of the rock glacier are detected by 4-year InSAR time series analysis. The ice content and the active layer are examined by electrical resistivity tomography, ground penetrating radar, and environmental seismology. Short-term activity (11-days) is captured by a seismic network. Clast analysis shows a sorting of the rock glacier's debris. The rock glacier has three zones, which are defined by the following characteristics: (a) Two predominant lithology types are preserved separately in the superficial debris patterns, (b) heterogeneous kinematics and seismic activity, and (c) distinct ice fractions. Conceptually, the studied rock glacier is discussed as an endmember of the glacier-debris-covered glacier-rock glacier continuum. This, in turn, can be linked to its location on the semiarid lee-side of the mountain range against the Indian summer monsoon. Geologically preconditioned and glacially overprinted, the studied rock glacier is suggested to be a recurring example for similar rock glaciers in the WNR. This study highlights how geology, topography and climate influence rock glacier characteristics and development.

AB  - Under global climate change, more frequent and widespread droughts have dramatic impacts on the water and carbon cycles. Water use efficiency (WUE) is a commonly used indicator reflecting the trade-off relationship between carbon sequestration and water consumption. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the variations in WUE and the effects of drought on WUE in sensitive alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. Based on 6-year (2013-2018) continuous carbon and water flux data observed by the eddy covariance system, WUE was calculated by gross ecosystem productivity (GEP)/evapotranspiration (ET). WUE followed a unimodal variation with time during growing seasons in the years without droughts. However, drought disrupted this pattern by its effects on the coupled relationship between carbon and water fluxes. Specifically, droughts showed divergent effects on WUE variations in different periods of the growing seasons. In the early-growing seasons, droughts induced an increase in WUE. During this period, WUE was mainly regulated by temperature and leaf area index (LAI), and the GEP was low due to the smaller LAI. Therefore, the drought-induced reduction in GEP was less than that in ET; thus, WUE increased. In the mid-growing seasons, droughts depressed WUE. WUE was dominated by water conditions and the LAI during this period. When drought occurred, GEP decreased faster than ET, and hence, WUE decreased. In the late-growing season, WUE was mainly driven by temperature and the LAI, but short-term drought slightly enhanced WUE. These results are helpful in understanding the responses of fragile alpine ecosystems to future climate change.

AB  - As the problem of ocean warming worsens, the environmental adaptation potential of symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria is directly related to the future and fate of corals. This study aimed to analyse the comprehensive community dynamics and physiology of these two groups of organisms in the coral Pocillopora sp. through indoor simulations of heat stress (which involved manually adjusting the temperature between both 26 degrees C and 34 degrees C). Heat treatment (>= 30 degrees C) significantly reduced the abundance of Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria by more than 70%. After the temperature was returned to 26 degrees C for one month, the Symbiodiniaceae density was still low, while the absolute number of bacteria quickly recovered to 55% of that of the control. At this time point, the F-v/F-m value rose to 91% of the pretemperature value. The content of chlorophyll b associated with Cyanobacteria increased by 50% compared with that under the control conditions. Moreover, analysis of the Symbiodiniaceae subclade composition suggested that the relative abundance of C1c.C45, C1, and C1ca increased during heat treatment, indicating that they might constitute heat-resistant subgroups. We suggest that the increase in the absolute number of bacteria during the recovery period could be an important indicator of coral holobiont recovery after heat stress. This study provides insight into the cross-linked regulation of key symbiotic microbes in the coral Pocillopora sp. during high-temperature stress and recovery and provides a scientific basis for exploring the mechanism underlying coral adaptation to global warming.

AB  - Featured Application This study proposes a new daylight dynamic metric which serves to quantify more accurately the energy consumption of electric lighting for spaces with seasonal use, optimizing the window design. Nowadays, daylight dynamic metrics are the most useful indicators to quantify the use of natural light, with daylight autonomy (DA) being one of the most widespread among all of them. This metric represents the percentage of the occupied time throughout the year in an indoor space when daylight reaches the minimum illuminance level to develop a specific task. Accordingly, the higher the percentage of DA, the shorter the switching on time of electric lighting. However, this metric considers for its calculations all business days of a whole standard year, and is thus not an accurate indicator for seasonal use spaces such as school classrooms. In this context, a variant of this metric is proposed, namely partial daylight autonomy (DAp), which is a non-lineal derivation of DA that considers those seasonal use spaces, helping to define the real percentage of indoor daylight use in order to properly quantify the accurate switching on time of electric lighting and therefore its energy consumption. As deduced from the analysis, the more precise results provided by DAp reach divergences close to 10% in comparison with the original conception of DA. Thus, this metric serves to estimate more accurately the impact on energy consumption if an electric lighting control system is implemented through lux meters. This new proposal has been monitored under real sky conditions in a test cell, providing converging results with those observed in the simulation process.

AB  - Individuals differ in their ability to create instances of emotion that are precise and context-specific. This skill - referred to as emotional granularity or emotion differentiation - is associated with positive mental health outcomes. To date, however, little work has examined whether and how emotional granularity might be increased. Emotional granularity is typically measured using data from experience sampling studies, in which participants are prompted to report on their emotional experiences multiple times per day, across multiple days. This measurement approach allows researchers to examine patterns of responses over time using real-world events. Recent work suggests that experience sampling itself may facilitate increases in emotional granularity in depressed individuals, such that it may serve both empirical and interventional functions. We replicated and extended these findings in healthy adults, using data from an intensive ambulatory assessment study including experience sampling, peripheral physiological monitoring, and end-of-day diaries. We also identified factors that might distinguish individuals who showed larger increases over the course of experience sampling and examined the extent of the impact of these factors. We found that increases in emotional granularity over time were facilitated by methodological factors, such as number of experience sampling prompts responded to per day, as well as individual factors, such as resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia. These results provide support for the use of experience sampling methods to improve emotional granularity, raise questions about the boundary conditions of this effect, and have implications for the conceptualization of emotional granularity and its relationship with emotional health.

AB  - Digestive system functionality is a key process linked to larval recruitment and survival. However, little is known about organ development and enzyme maturation of the digestive system of North Sea Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). In this study, herring larvae were reared at 13 degrees C from hatching to 69 day post hatch, covering four developmental stages: (1) yolk sac (8-9 mm), (2) pre-flexion (9-14 mm), (3) flexion (12-18 mm) and (4) post-flexion stages (15-30 mm). Combined histological (semi-quantitative scoring) and enzyme analyses (pancreatic and intestinal) showed that developmental stages are strongly linked to physiological changes. The larvae lack a functional stomach and use the intestine as the primary site of digestion which is mainly supported by pancreatic enzyme activity. The intestine acquired adult enzymatic digestive features with a functional brush border at the end of the flexion stage and pyloric ceca started to develop during the post-flexion stage. The transition from pre-flexion to flexion stage and the end of the post-flexion stage are energetically taxing periods as indicated by a reduced number and size of liver vacuoles. Based on these findings, we consider these moments as critical periods, where herring larvae could be dramatically affected by suboptimal feeding conditions in the field. This implies that pre-flexion stage larvae with low or no liver reserves may not be able to proceed to the next developmental stage. Hence, the level of energy storage in first-feeding larvae needs to be examined for its use as a field indicator of survival and development.

AB  - Regulated rivers downstream of dams often exhibit highly modified thermal regimes in addition to modified hydrologic regimes; downstream river temperatures can be seasonally much warmer or cooler than unregulated streams. Selective water withdrawals can be used to minimize thermal impacts to downstream reaches. However, other water quality parameters, in-reservoir production, and species composition also vary with depth. In the South Fork McKenzie River, in the Pacific Northwest of North America, an existing large dam was retrofitted to mix and export water from multiple depths, allowing dam operators to adjust the outflow temperatures to be in sync with the upstream thermal regime. We examined benthic macroinvertebrate responses after implementation of selective water withdrawal, comparing it to thermally similar flow-through conditions, expecting to see shifts in the community over time to resemble upstream, undammed reaches. However, species composition and traits downstream of the dam became more dissimilar to upstream and to flow-through after selective water withdrawal. These changes included increases in non-insect taxa and taxa known to feed on plankton and detritus. The most likely explanation for this transition is that selective water withdrawal from multiple depths of a stratified reservoir included epilimnetic releases, which resulted in increased export of plankton and organic material downstream. This strategy favored taxa able to capitalize on resource subsidies from the reservoir. Our findings highlight the interconnected nature of responses to dams and dam operations, including the importance of considering biotic communities in addition to temperature and flow when planning water management strategies.

AB  - : To assist increasing annual acreage of Texas-grown (U.S.A.) strawberries, it is essential to select cultivars with excellent plant and fruit quality characteristics suitable to the diverse environments. This study assessed multiple traits of 10 strawberry cultivars grown under high tunnels. A significant difference (p <= 0.05) was observed for all traits, which possessed a wide variability of metabolites. Plant analysis (number of live plants, plant vigor, and harvest yield) indicated that the yield ranged from 226 to 431 g/plant, positively correlated to plant vigor. Fruit physicochemical characteristic analysis, including red color (absorbance at 500 nm) and taste-associated indicators [degrees Brix, titratable acidity (TA), and total soluble solids (TSS)/TA], showed that degrees Brix and TSS/TA ranged from 8.0 to 12.9 and from 9.1 to 15.3, respectively. More than 300 volatiles were identified using solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and total volatiles varied 1.5 times with high variance of individual compounds between cultivars. Descriptive sensory analysis indicated that strawberry flavor was positively associated with sensory attributes of sweetness, jammy, fruity, buttery, fresh, and creamy while negatively related to bitterness, astringency, and sourness. Partial least squares regression indicated that strawberry flavor was highly correlated with sweet taste and volatile composition. No specific relationship between these traits and day-neutral or June-bearing varieties was identified. Ideal cultivars for Texas growing conditions with superior and balanced flavor qualities were Albion, Sweet Charlie, Camarosa, Camino Real, and Chandler.

AB  - Considering the importance of dairy farming and negative effects of heat stress, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of heat stress via temperature-humidity index (THI) and diurnal temperature variation (DTV) for somatic cell score (SCS) of Holstein dairy cattle, using random regression models. Data were a total of 52,012 test-day records for SCS of 9,765 first parity Holstein cows from Brazil, collected from 1997 to 2013, along with weather records (THI and DTV) from 18 weather stations. Least square linear regression models were used to determine THI and DTV thresholds for SCS increase caused by heat stress. In addition to the standard model (SM; without bioclimatic variables), THI and DTV were combined in various ways and tested for different days, totaling 21 models. Thresholds of THI and DTV for SCS increase was 70 (0.09 score unit/THI) and 9 (0.03 score unit/DTV), respectively. The model that included THI and DTV as fixed effects, considering the two days average, presented better fit (AIC, BIC and -2logL). Estimated breeding values (EBVs) and reliability of EBVs improved when using this model. Changes on SCS may be an early indicator of heat stress in Holstein cattle reared in tropical conditions. The sires are re-ranked when bioclimatic variables are included in the model. More significant reclassifications of sires were observed when we increased selection pressure. This study provides strong evidence of a genotype by environment interaction on SCS. Genetic evaluation using average of two days of THI and DTV as fixed effects, improves EBVs and reliability of EBVs.

AB  - Soil health research has developed soil tests to validate management strategies for creating healthier soils, such as cover crops, compost, and reduced tillage. Missing in this research agenda are soil health management strategies and diagnostics tailored to the systematic variation of soils. The Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database offers comprehensive estimates for many properties linked to soil health indicators. This research uses unsupervised classification of soil surface (0-30 cm) properties and root restrictive horizons in an internationally important agricultural region, the Central and Coastal Valleys of California, covering 5.6 million ha of mostly cropland. K-means clustering of 10 soil properties derived from SSURGO revealed groups distinct from USDA-NRCS Soil Taxonomy. Clustering metrics, data visualization, and validation tests justified a seven-region soil health conceptual model that divided the landscape into two broad classes-those with and without performance limitations. Results revealed three pedogenic conditions limiting soil performance: (a) root restrictive horizons that impede root growth into deeper soil; (b) salinity and alkalinity harmful to crops; and (c) shrink-swell properties making soils challenging to cultivate. Soils without performance limitations, soils with restrictive horizons, and salt-affected soils are further divided by texture and/or organic matter for a total of seven soil health regions. In reality, variation in soil properties is often continuous across the landscape and sometimes fractal in nature, but this research establishes a testable framework for evaluating soil health diagnostics according to geographically coherent differences in soil properties, demonstrating potential for how soil health management and interpretation can be tailor-made to the landscape.

AB  - Pollution of sediments by metals is a global issue, with developing countries like Nigeria, having its large PORTION. Niger River, the most valued river in Nigeria, is under serious anthropogenic perturbations with no measures to save the river by concerned authorities. Samplings were conducted at 12 designated stations of the lower reaches of the river within the southern region of Nigeria. The elements (As, Fe, Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn and Hg) were analysed using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The average levels of As, Fe, Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn and Hg in the river sediments were 12, 115, 18, 11, 0.71, 36 and 0.59 mg/kg, respectively. Certain indices, including the enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (I (geo)), pollution load index (PLI) and contamination factor (CF), were used to assess the ecological risk posed by metals in sediment. Cadmium in five locations (SP4- SP8) and Hg for sites SP4 and SP5, had their I (geo) values above 1.0, which implies that these stations were moderately polluted. The EF values for Cd, Hg and As were above 1.5 (EF > 1.5) in sites SP4 and SP5 especially in the dry season, indicating strong enrichment of these elements in sediment to anthropogenic influences. Potential ecological risks of heavy metals in sediment showed weak to very high threat which implies that the condition is much frightening to the biota and inhabitants in the vicinity of the river as well.

AB  - Granulated Activated Carbon (GAC) filtration is a common process for advanced wastewater treatment. In such filters, the removal of organic substances results from adsorptive as well as biological processes. This work investigated the potential of biological processes and their influence on GAC-filter performance. During 32 months, the removal of micropollutants,Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and the spectral absorption coefficient was monitored in six GAC-filters. The effects of pre-treatment (cloth- and/or membrane-filtration), EBCT (from 6 - 35 min) and GAC-type were evaluated. Likewise, the impact of the influent's fluctuations in temperature, flow and concentration (ammonia, nitrate, and soluble reactive phosphorus (sRP)) were analysed. Biological processes were tracked by the frequency of backwashing, oxygen consumption, removal of poorly absorbable micropollutants and production of transformation products. Pre-treatment influenced biofilm growth significantly. Membrane filtration delayed the first backwashing event by 122 d in comparison to cloth-filtration, where the first backwash was conducted after only 21 d. Removal of poorly absorbable substances was observed early on (40 - 50 d). Parallel operation contributed to a better utilisation of the GAC-capacity and the biological removal potential. Influent nitrogen species > 0.5 mg N/L promoted biofilm growth, whereas sRP seemed to have no effect. The developed biofilm and optimal operating conditions led to longer life spans of the GAC-filters, making carbon usage rates comparable to those from PAC applications. The results suggest that biological processes accounted for about 25 - 42% of the totally removed DOC at the end of the operation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Given the essential role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in soil systems and agriculture, their use as biological indicators has risen in all fields of microbiology research. However, AMF sensitivity to chemical pesticides is poorly understood in field conditions, and not explored in ecotoxicology protocols. Hence, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of glyphosate (Roundup (R)) and diur-on+paraquat (Gramocil (R)) on the germination of spores of Gigaspora albida and Rhizophagus clarus in a tropical artificial soil. This study was conducted in 2019 at the Soil Ecology and Ecotoxicology Laboratory of the Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina. The nominal concentrations of glyphosate were 0, 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 mg a.i. kg(-1). For diuron+paraquat, the concentrations tested were 0, 10 + 20, 50 + 100, 100 + 200, 250 + 500, 500 + 1000, 750 + 1500 and 1000 + 2000 mg a.i. kg(-1). Glyphosate did not alter germination of G. albida, but germination inhibition of R. clarus spores was of 30.8% at 1000 mg kg(-1). Diuron+paraquat inhibited by 8.0% germination of G. albida, but only at the highest concentration tested. On the other hand, effects on R. clarus were detected at 50 + 100 mg kg(-1) concentration and above, and inhibition was as high as 57.7% at the highest concentration evaluated. These results suggest distinct response mechanisms of Rhizophagus and Gigaspora when exposed to herbicides, with the former being more sensitive than the later.

AB  - The occurrence of rainfall extreme events leads to several environmental, social, cultural, and economic consequences, heavily impacting agriculture. The analysis of climate extreme indices at the municipal level is of the uttermost importance to the overall study of climate variability and regional food security. Corn, bean, and cassava are among the most cultivated temporary subsistence crops. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between subsistence agriculture productivity and the behavior of rainfall extreme indices in the Rio Grande do Norte state in the period from 1980 to 2013. We used the dataset provided by Xavier (2016) and the climate extreme indices obtained through the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices. Crop productivity data were retrieved from the Municipal Agriculture Survey from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics system. The methodology evaluated the behavior and the relationship between agricultural productivity time series and extreme precipitation indicators. We applied the following statistical techniques: descriptive analysis, time series trend analysis by the Mann-Kendall test, cluster analysis, and analysis of variance to check for equal means between identified groups. Cluster analysis was considered an adequate tool for the comprehension of data spatial distribution, allowing the identification of five homogenous subregions with different precipitation patterns. Rainfall extreme indices allowed the analysis of regional conditions regarding consecutive dry days, annual precipitation in wet days, and heavy rainfall. Trends were identified in these indices and they were significantly correlated with dryland crops productivity, indicating a direct relationship between water availability and regional agroclimatic stress.

AB  - The Carex flava aggregate belongs to one of the most taxonomically difficult groups of sedges which colonize diverse habitats, from organic to sandy, from acidic to alkaline, usually humid and moist. The study included 129 vegetation plots and ten soil variables (organic matter, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, carbonates, carbon, nitrogen, pH, and the ratio between organic carbon and nitrogen). The main aim was to determine the relationships between the various plant communities C. flava agg. occur in and their soil properties. With the aid of the two-way indicator species analysis and cluster analysis, we delimited nine vegetation types from the Scheuchzerio palustris-Caricetea fuscae, Littorelletea uniflorae, Molinio-Arrhenatheretea and Alnetea glutinosae classes differing in their response to soil properties. The CCA revealed pH, N, K, C, CaCO3, P and Ca to be statistically significant, and to account for 11.55% of the total variance in species composition. The largest differences, both in terms of species composition and in soil conditions, were revealed between communities with C. lepidocarpa and C. demissa. Carex lepidocarpa occurred in calcareous and extremely rich fens (Caricion davallianae) whereas C. demissa was found to occur in poor and moderately rich fens (Sphagno-Caricion canescentis, Caricion canescenti-nigrae). Carex flava grew mostly in calcareous, rich fens and wet grasslands (Caricion davallianae, Calthion palustris). Carex viridula was found in both calcareous, extremely and moderately rich fens and wet grasslands, and in nutrient-poor habitats such as dunes and sandy lake shores. The ecological niche of C. viridula is very wide and this species showed no affinity to any specific syntaxon.

AB  - This study investigated the relationships between four behavioral and postural indicators of a compromised welfare state in loose boxes (stereotypies, aggressive behaviors toward humans, withdrawn posture reflecting unresponsiveness to the environment, and alert posture indicating hypervigilance) and the way horses perceived riding. This perception was inferred using a survey completed by the usual riding instructor and during a standardized riding session (assessment of behaviors and postures, qualitative behavior assessment (QBA) and characterization of the horses' locomotion using an inertial measurement unit). In accordance with ear and tail positions and the QBA, stereotypic and the most hypervigilant horses in loose boxes seemed to experience a more negative affective state during the riding session compared with nonstereotypic and less hypervigilant animals (P < .02 in all cases). Horses which were aggressive toward humans in loose boxes had higher scores regarding the occurrence of discomfort and defensive behaviors on the survey than nonaggressive horses (P = .03). They also presented higher dorsoventral accelerations at a canter during the riding session (P = .03), requiring the rider to increase his spinal movement (P = .005). These results suggest that aggressive horses may be harder to ride than nonaggressive animals. The expression of unresponsiveness to the environment in loose boxes was related to more reluctance to move forward, as assessed in the survey (P = .006). This study suggests that a compromised welfare state in the stable is related to horses having a more negative perception of riding. This perception could vary depending on the expression of poor welfare. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and increased variation in bilateral symmetry in a sample of monogeneans can indicate disturbance in developmental stability caused by environmental and/or genomic stress. This study was conducted to determine the presence of FA in the sclerotized structures of Haliotrematoides spp. (Monogenea) collected along the continental shelf of the Yucatan Peninsula. We hypothesize the potential effect of chemical contamination on FA. Geometric morphometrics with Procrustes ANOVA was used to WA FA in the ventral and dorsal anchors in Haliotrematoides spp. Then, Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) were used to assess the statistical associations of heavy metal concentrations, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), gene expression, PAHs metabolites in bile, fish morphometric measurements, physicochemical and spatial variables on FA patterns. Principal Component Analysis showed no clear group formation according to shape variability by sampling site. Evidence of FA for size and shape in ventral anchors of Haliotrematoides striatohamus was found, in contrast to dorsal anchors, which only displayed shape FA. For Haliotrematoides sp. only evidence for shape FA of ventral and dorsal anchors was found. The GAMLSS models revealed a significant positive relationship between the FA of Haliotrematoides spp. and PAHs, Pb, Naphthalene, Ni, pH, Hydroxy-Phenanthrene, Depth, DNA Methylation, Glutathione peroxydase and Condition factor (K). These results partially support our hypothesis that FA in the anchors would be produced by aquatic contamination but in association to other environmental variables and host related factors.

AB  - Terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) is a key indicator of the ecosystem response to climate change and land use/cover change (LUCC) in arid areas. The available global GPP data sets cannot meet the demands for local applications in arid areas due to sparse vegetation and extreme climate conditions. Here, we developed a novel GPP estimation model for the Heihe River Basin (HRB), the second largest inland river basin in northern China, and disentangled the impacts of climate change and LUCC on GPP. First, we calibrated the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) using CO2 flux observations from multiple stations in the HRB and developed a modified local GPP model (HRB-VPM). Then, we decoupled the joint effects of LUCC and climate change on GPP based on the log and differential transformation method. The results showed that HRB-VPM outperformed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and VPM GPP models in arid ecosystems. The root mean square error of HRB-VPM was 4.9 and 1.5 gCm(-2) day(-1) lower than those of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and VPM models, respectively. We concluded that the underlying driving forces of the GPP changes were distinct across the HRB. In the upper reach, climate change accounted for 65.8% of GPP changes, while in the middle and lower reaches, LUCC contributed to 75.1% of GPP changes. Our research provides an effective way to monitor arid ecosystem degradation and is useful for mitigating the negative impacts of human activities and future climate change.

AB  - Water is the prerequisite for human adaptation to climate change and is the key link among climatic conditions, humans, and the environment. Human behavior can mitigate the impacts of climate change. The present study aimed to evaluate rural people's readiness for sustainable management of water resources. To achieve this goal, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Health Belief Model (HBM) were used as the research framework. The research instrument was a closed-end questionnaire developed on the basis of TPB and HBM. The face and content validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by a panel of experts in sustainable agriculture. Its reliability was also checked in a pilot study by calculating Cronbach's alpha, the average variance extracted (AVE), R-2, and composite reliability (CR). The research sample was composed of 480 villagers from Hamadan province, Iran, who were familiar with sustainable water resources management in the context of the rooftop rainwater harvesting project. The results showed that in TPB, the variables of moral norms, attitude, and self-identity could account for 61 percent of the variance in rural people's intention to adopt the practices of sustainable water resources management. Based on HBM, the variables of perceived benefits, perceived susceptibility, and perceived severity could capture 49 percent of this variance. The results revealed that both theories had the potential to predict rural people's intention to engage in the sustainable management of water resources, but TPB proved to provide a more robust prediction than HBM.

AB  - Aquifer microbial water quality evaluations are often performed by collecting groundwater samples from monitoring wells. While samples collected from continuously pumped sources are seldom disputed as representative of the aquifer, natural biofilm present in the vicinity of well screens may introduce unwanted microbial artefacts in monitoring wells that are only periodically sampled. The need for well water purging to obtain samples void of these artefacts has been widely recognized. However, purging methods are not standardized; many approaches presume that physico-chemical water quality stability achieved through the removal of 3 to 5 well volumes is indicative of the stability of target analytes. Using a data set collected from a shallow unconfined aquifer in Southern Ontario, Canada, the need for using dedicated approaches that account for the time-dependent nature of microbial water quality changes was demonstrated. Specifically, the utility of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a rapid, field-ready biochemical indicator of microbial water quality stability was investigated. This work shows that ATP concentrations reflect time-limited (bio)colloid transport processes that are consistent with other microbial water quality parameters monitored, but different from commonly measured physical and chemical water quality indicators of well purging adequacy. ATP concentrations occasionally fluctuated even after 3 or 4 h of purging, indicating that microbial artefacts attributable to biofilms in the vicinity of the well screen can still persist. The recurrence of characteristic ATP patterns in each well was systematically examined through the novel application of dynamic time warping (DTW), a nonparametric time series analysis approach. These patterns are believed to be linked with seasonal hydrogeological conditions, which warrant consideration in the design and interpretation of subsurface microbial water quality investigations.

AB  - Given the trend of increasing imbalance in the economic development of administrative-territorial units and ensuring their innovative development, the issue of upgrading the effectiveness of the anti-crisis regional policy is becoming urgent. The research aim is to develop an econometric model for assessing the impact of asymmetries in the development of urban economies on the regional socio-economic development based on the case of Kazakhstan. The article establishes a sample of indicators of socio-economic development of cities and regions in Kazakhstan in 2014-2018. The governance indicators of the influence of the asymmetry in urban development on the regional socio-economic development in Kazakhstan have been determined based on the Granger causality test, the creation of a cognitive map and the identification of hierarchy levels. The asymmetry in regional development has been estimated applying the coefficient of variation of the relevant indicators of socio-economic development of cities and regions, taking into account the lagged variables. The developed model allows determining the convergence model of regional development, the nature of the influence of asymmetries in the development of cities on the regional economic development in the context of economic growth and recession, as well as identifying the key factors in the asymmetry of regional development. The results are based on reliable data; they are of practical importance and can serve as the basis for the elaboration of effective preventive measures for anti-crisis regional development policy, not only to neutralize asymmetries, but also to achieve economic growth under the conditions of unbalanced regional development.

AB  - A future of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, changing climate, growing human populations, and shifting socioeconomic conditions means that the global agricultural system will need to adapt in order to feed the world. These changes will affect not only agricultural land but terrestrial ecosystems in general. Here, we use the coupled land use and vegetation model LandSyMM (Land System Modular Model) to quantify future land use change (LUC) and resulting impacts on ecosystem service indicators relating to carbon sequestration, runoff, biodiversity, and nitrogen pollution. We additionally hold certain variables, such as climate or land use, constant to assess the relative contribution of different drivers to the projected impacts. Some ecosystem services depend critically on land use and management: for example, carbon storage, the gain in which is more than 2.5 times higher in a low-LUC scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 4 and Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0; SSP4-60) than a high-LUC one with the same carbon dioxide and climate trajectory (SSP3-60). Other trends are mostly dominated by the direct effects of climate change and carbon dioxide increase. For example, in those two scenarios, extreme high monthly runoff increases across 54 % and 53 % of land, respectively, with a mean increase of 23 % in both. Scenarios in which climate change mitigation is more difficult (SSPs 3 and 5) have the strongest impacts on ecosystem service indicators, such as a loss of 13 %-19 % of land in biodiversity hotspots and a 28 % increase in nitrogen pollution. Evaluating a suite of ecosystem service indicators across scenarios enables the identification of tradeoffs and co-benefits associated with different climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies and socioeconomic developments.

AB  - The snail Pomacea patula catemacensis is an endemic mollusk from the southeast Gulf of Mexico, which is commercially exploited and in decline since 2010. This decline is associated with an increasing market demand and illegal capture. We designed a small-scale production system for P. p. catemacensis and determined its financial feasibility for a base scenario. We used information gathered from stakeholders and stochastic modeling to predict the impact of uncertain variables on the economic indicators to assess the financial viability under varying conditions. The small-scale intensive production system, designed to yield 3.9 tons/year of unshelled product, requires an investment of about US $65,000. The production unit was financially assessed using the Modified Internal Return Rate and The Net Present Value of cash flow, considering a 14% discount rate and a 7% reinvestment rate. We obtained a Net Present Value of $67,000 and a Modified Internal Return Rate of 20% for the base scenario, which indicates the viability of the project. A Monte Carlo simulation was run to assess the robustness of the project to variability of three parameters: labor cost, energy cost, and market price; with random and simultaneous variation, resulting in 95% probability of getting a Modified Internal Return Rate larger than the current interest rate (8%) and a low probability (2.8%) to be financially unviable. This production system is worthy of consideration as an option to reduce the fishing pressure on the tegogolo natural populations of the Catemaco Lake while satisfying the market demand.

AB  - Blackleg, caused by Leptosphaeria maculans, is a serious disease on canola or rapeseed in Canada, Australia and Europe. Disease levels have increased in western Canada recently and additional tools are needed to improve blackleg management. Seed treatment can be a cost-effective approach against blackleg, but there is currently no registered seed-treatment product targeting aboveground blackleg infection. In this study, a range of fungicides was evaluated for control of cotyledon infection by L. maculans and blackleg of canola. Under controlled environmental conditions, fluopyram showed greater efficacy than fluquinconazole (used against blackleg in Australia) in limiting cotyledon infection, while Prosper (R) EverGol and Helix (R) Vibrance (industry standards) were ineffective. Fluopyram at a rate of 30-150 g/100 kg seed generally inhibited cotyledon infection and this efficacy was not affected by delayed soil moisture for 3 weeks after planting. This indicates that the efficacy will unlikely be affected by a slight delay in germination due to a soil moisture deficit after seeding. In addition to typical mechanisms of succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor fungicides, fluopyram also induced expression of the indicator gene coding PR-1 proteins substantially, indicating the potential for inducing disease resistance. In field trials at 75 and 150 g/100 kg seed, fluopyram reduced the infection on cotyledons resulting from pricking inoculation on both susceptible and resistant canola cultivars, potentially limiting the infection into the stem. These seed treatment rates reduced the disease severity index (DSI) substantially on the susceptible cultivar, while DSI was low on a resistant cultivar with or without fluopyram treatment.

AB  - We examined differences in species richness between reference and impacted sites to illustrate the extent to which estimated impacts of land-use change on biodiversity can be affected by the degree of baseline suitability (intactness of reference sites) and the species assemblage under consideration. We mist-netted birds at five continuous Amazonian forest sites and 33 land-bridge forest islands (0.63-1699 ha) within a large hydroelectric reservoir. We then produced a gradient of baseline suitability based on forest area of five sets of reference sites, namely continuous forest, 1000 ha, 500 ha, 250 ha and 100 ha, and contrasted these with all smaller islands combined considering two types of species assemblages. The first comprised only species captured at reference sites (baseline species assemblage), whereas the second comprised all species captured at all sites (overall species assemblage). We also examined biodiversity complementarity to define the minimum set of forest islands retaining the most number of species occurring both at continuous forest sites and across all sites. A focus on the baseline species assemblage from the most suitable baseline (continuous forest) resulted in an estimated decrease of 67% in species richness at impacted sites. In contrast, a focus on the overall species assemblage along with the use of the least suitable baseline (100 ha) as a reference condition reversed this trend, resulting in an estimated increase of 43% in species richness at impacted sites. We therefore underline the imperative of considering the intactness of reference sites to accurately assess the impacts of land-use change on biodiversity and establish conservation strategies.

AB  - This study was aimed at evaluating bentonite (BEN) and vermiculite (VER) clays as photoactive materials for photodegrading a low-concentration (100 mu g L-1) mixture of four emerging contaminants (ECs): trimethoprim (TMP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), carbamazepine (CBZ) and diclofenac (DCF), using a solar advanced oxidation process. The experiments were performed in a stirred magnetic batch reactor (SMBR) and a solar pilot plant compound parabolic collector (CPC). The effect of mass, type of catalyst clay and H2O2 dose were evaluated, and the photodegradation of ECs was followed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) and Dissolved Organic Carbon content (DOC). The results showed that the optimal dose of clays for EC degradation in both SMBR and CPC reactors was 0.2 g L-1. The photodegradation of ECs at optimal conditions by BEN and VER in the CPC decreased in the following order: DCF > TMP > SMX > CBZ and DCF > SMX > TMP > CBZ, respectively. The photodegradation rate constants for VER were 2, 32 and 1.1 times higher than those for BEN when SMX, CBZ and DCF were photodegraded with the optimal dose of clay, correspondingly. The percentage removal of DCF and SMX in experiments using BEN or VER was similar to TiO2. The TMP, SMX, CBZ and DCF degradation rate constants increased 9.05, 18.9, 2.08 and 23 times by adding [H2O2]= 200 mg L-1 and VER. The percentage removal of DOC was 16, 40 and 48% when VER and 50, 100 or 200 mg L-1 of hydrogen peroxide were added into the system, respectively. Similar results were obtained by adding BEN.

AB  - Chemical input reduction in agricultural systems is strongly demanded with the aim to improve the quality and the safety of food/feed products in an environmental sustainable perspective. Durum wheat is the most important food crop widely grown across the Mediterranean basin. However, the choice of tailored-genotypes can represent a key strategy in resource limiting conditions. The present study investigated the performance of fourteen commercial durum wheat varieties, in terms of morphologic, productive and quality traits under two cropping systems, conventional (CH) and no-chemical input (NC), for two growing seasons. The NC cropping system affected plant phenology, grain yield, and its components (i.e., ears m(-2) and test weight). However, the negative influence exerted by the NC depended by the growing season (significant interaction between growing season and cropping system), which in turn affected the production behavior of genotypes (significant interaction between growing season and genotype). The additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis showed that genotype (G) effect explained the 4.3% of the total variability, the environment (E) the 71.7% and the G x E interaction the 9.4%. The AMMI stability value (ASV) indicated that Meridiano, Claudio, Saragolla, and Normanno were the most stable genotypes among environments (combination of years and management systems). An integrated environmental assessment, including a soil nitrogen balance, can help to provide a more holistic approach to the sustainability of the no-chemical Mediterranean cropping systems based on cereal-legume rotation.

AB  - Thermokarst lakes are formed as a result of thawing of ice-rich permafrost, causing development of land depressions which in flat areas are filled with water in the case of positive water balance. Activation of the thermokarst process is one of the possible indicators of permafrost degradation under the conditions of global warming. Thermokarst lakes occur in the areas of continuous, discontinuous, and sporadic permafrost, i.e., in Siberia, Alaska, Canada, and northern Scandinavia. Specific microbial communities adapted to long-term exposure to low temperatures develop in such lakes. They vary in the rates of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism depending on the mineral composition of bottom sediments, availability of organic matter, limnological and hydrological features of the lakes. High rates of methane emission are characteristic of a number of thermokarst lakes. Recent studies of thermokarst lakes revealed active methane formation via various methanogenic pathways, as well as aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation by diverse methanogenic and methanotrophic bacteria and archaea. The question of what mechanisms and microorganisms are involved in anaerobic methane oxidation, which may be responsible for up to 80% of methane consumption in thermokarst lakes, remains, however, open. The microorganisms actively functioning beneath the ice during the long winter season, while highly important for northern aquatic ecosystems, also remain insufficiently studied. Almost no serious microbiological research on thermokarst lakes has been carried out in Russia, although permafrost occupies up to 65% of its territory, thermokarst process is common, and thermokarst lakes are numerous.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Spinal manipulations are interventions widely used by different healthcare professionals for the management of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders. While previous theoretical principles focused predominantly on biomechanical accounts, recent models propose that the observed pain modulatory effects of this form of manual therapy may be the result of more complex mechanisms. It has been suggested that other phenomena like neurophysiological responses and the activation of the immune-endocrine system may explain variability in pain inhibition after the administration of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT). The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the available evidence supporting the biological plausibility of high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust (HVLAT) on the immune-endocrine system. Materials and Methods: Narrative critical review. An electronic search on MEDLINE, ProQUEST, and Google Scholar followed by a hand and snowballing search were conducted to find relevant articles. Studies were included if they evaluated the effects of HVLAT on participants' biomarkers. Results: The electronic search retrieved 13 relevant articles and two themes of discussion were developed. Nine studies investigated the effects of SMT on cortisol levels and five of them were conducted on symptomatic populations. Four studies examined the effects of SMT on the immune system and all of them were conducted on healthy individuals. Conclusions: Although spinal manipulations seem to trigger the activation of the neuroimmunoendocrine system, the evidence supporting a biological account for the application of HVLAT in clinical practice is mixed and conflicting. Further research on subjects with spinal MSK conditions with larger sample sizes are needed to obtain more insights about the biological effects of spinal manipulative therapy.

AB  - Lake ice is a robust indicator of climate change. The availability of information contained in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer daily snow products from 2000 to 2017 could be greatly improved after cloud removal by gap filling. Thresholds based on open water pixel numbers are used to extract the freezeup start and breakup end dates for 58 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP); 18 lakes are also selected to extract the freezeup end and breakup start dates. The lake ice durations are further calculated based on freezeup and breakup dates. Lakes on the TP begin to freezeup in late October and all the lakes start the ice cover period in mid-January of the following year. In late March, some lakes begin to break up, and all the lakes end the ice cover period in early July. Generally, the lakes in the northern Inner-TP have earlier freezeup dates and later breakup dates (i.e., longer ice cover durations) than those in the southern Inner-TP. Over 17years, the mean ice cover duration of 58 lakes is 157.78days, 18 (31%) lakes have a mean extending rate of 1.11day/year, and 40 (69%) lakes have a mean shortening rate of 0.80day/year. Geographical location and climate conditions determine the spatial heterogeneity of the lake ice phenology, especially the ones of breakup dates, while the physico-chemical characteristics mainly affect the freezeup dates of the lake ice in this study. Ice cover duration is affected by both climatic and lake specific physico-chemical factors, which can reflect the climatic and environmental change for lakes on the TP.

AB  - In the present study, the toxicity of receiving waters from a highly polluted urban watercourse, the Reconquista River, Argentina, collected at a dam in the upstream part of the river was evaluated. Cnesterodon decemmaculatus, a widely distributed fish species in Pampasic rivers proposed for use in ecotoxicological evaluations, was used as a test organism. A 96-h acute toxicity bioassay with river water quality which has been characterized as moderately contaminated was performed. The treatment groups were (1) whole surface river water; (2) whole surface river water with 2 mg Cd/L added as a simulated metal contaminant pulse; (3) a negative control using reconstituted moderately hard water (MHW); (4) a metal positive control, MHW + 2 mg Cd/L; and (5) a positive genotoxicity control, MHW + 5 mg Cyclophosphamide/L (CP). The condition factor rate, micronuclei frequency, and comet assay from peripherical blood, structural changes of the gill arrangement by scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, histopathological changes in the liver and the glutathione-S-transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and protein content from the body midsection (viscera) were evaluated. According to our results, for short term exposure, SEM analyses of gills and liver histopathological analyses could be useful tools for the evaluation of target organ damage as well as comet assays for DNA damage. We propose that the 96-h laboratory bioassay protocol described is useful for monitoring the deterioration of water quality employing the teleost C. decemmaculatus and that the microscope analysis of gills and liver as well as the comet assay methodology could be sensitive endpoint indicators.

AB  - Corbicula fluminea, an Asian clam, is one of the worst invasive species in Europe that can survive in very adverse environmental conditions. Despite its negative impacts, the species also has the capacity to bioaccumulate heavy metals, contaminants and can be exploited for wastewater treatment purposes. The capacity of the Asian clam to remove Escherichia coli, used as fecal contamination indicator, was analyzed. Conventional wastewater treatment plants are not suitable to remove bacteria, thus resulting in treated municipal wastewater with high bacterial loads. E. coli clearance rate was analyzed as function of the number of clams. The bivalves can remove bacteria until concentrations below the detection limit in about 6 h. The adsorption on the clam shells' and bioaccumulation on the soft tissues were also analyzed. The depuration of clams along 48 h were analyzed revealing that no bacteria was detected in the water. Thus, these results suggest that Asian clam can bioprocess E. coli. On the other hand, results obtained by this methodology were compared with ozonation and photocatalytic oxidation using TiO2, Ag, Au, Pd-TiO2. In all treatments it was possible to achieve concentrations of E. coli below the detection limit. However, photocatalytic oxidation demands about 4700 folds more energy than ozonation, besides the costs associated with catalysts. Comparing complexity of ozonation with biofiltration, this study suggests that application of biofiltration using C. fluminea can be a suitable solution to minimize the presence of bacteria in wastewater, reducing environmental and economic impacts.

AB  - The research goal was to determine if onsite wastewater system (OWS) density had an influence on the concentrations and watershed exports of Escherichia coli and enterococci in urbanizing watersheds. Eight watersheds with OWS densities ranging from < 0.1 to 1.88 systems ha(-1) plus a watershed served by sewer (Sewer) and a mostly forested, natural watershed (Natural) in the Piedmont of North Carolina served as the study locations. Stream samples were collected approximately monthly during baseflow conditions between January 2015 and December 2016 (n = 21). Median concentrations of E. coli (2014 most probable number (MPN) 100 mL(-1)) and enterococci (168 MPN 100 mL(-1)) were elevated in streams draining watersheds with a high density of OWS (> 0.77 system ha(-1)) relative to watersheds with a low (< 0.77 system ha(-1)) density (E. coli: 204 MPN 100 mL(-1) and enterococci: 88 MPN 100 mL(-1)) and control watersheds (Natural: E. coli: 355 MPN 100 mL(-1) and enterococci: 62 MPN 100 mL(-1); Sewer: 177 MPN 100 mL(-1) and 130 MPN 100 mL(-1)). Samples collected from watersheds with a high density of OWS had E. coli and enterococci concentrations that exceeded recommended thresholds 88 and 57% of times sampled, respectively. Results show that stream E. coli and enterococci concentrations and exports are influenced by the density of OWS in urbanizing watersheds. Cost share programs to help finance OWS repairs and maintenance are suggested to help improve water quality in watersheds with OWS.

AB  - Population growth and rising water demand, climate change, severe droughts, and land-use changes are among the top severe issues in Iran. Water management in this country is sectoral and disintegrated. Each authority evaluates water based on its final intention and there is no commonplace indicator for evaluation programs. In this research, we used the Water Poverty Index (WPI) to map the status of water scarcity in a north-eastern province of Iran. Water poverty was measured based on five components of "Resources", "Access", "Capacity", "Use", and "Environment". The scores on each component were then aggregated using the weighted multiplicative function, assuming equal weights for all components. The overall WPI was evaluated to be 41.1, signaling an alarming and serious water poverty in the study area. Based on the results, Azadshahr (29.1) and Gorgan (61.6) districts had the worst and the best conditions among all cases, respectively. To better understand the importance of WPI components, four weighting alternatives were used; however, none of them resulted in a tangible improvement of WPI index. The cross-correlation between the components was also evaluated, with Access and Capacity showing significant results. Leaving out "Capacity", however, reduced WPI by 8.1. In total, "Access", "Capacity", and "Use" had the highest correlation with WPI, implying that any attempt to improve water poverty in the province must firstly tackle these issues. This study showed that WPI is an effective indicator of water scarcity assessment and could be used to make priorities for policy-making and water management.

AB  - The model reduction of mechanical problems involving contact remains an important issue in computational solid mechanics. In this article, we propose an extension of the hyper-reduction method based on a reduced integration domain to frictionless contact problems written by a mixed formulation. As the potential contact zone is naturally reduced through the reduced mesh involved in hyper-reduced equations, the dual reduced basis is chosen as the restriction of the dual full-order model basis. We then obtain a hybrid hyper-reduced model combining empirical modes for primal variables with finite element approximation for dual variables. If necessary, the inf-sup condition of this hybrid saddle-point problem can be enforced by extending the hybrid approximation to the primal variables. This leads to a hybrid hyper-reduced/full-order model strategy. This way, a better approximation on the potential contact zone is further obtained. A posttreatment dedicated to the reconstruction of the contact forces on the whole domain is introduced. In order to optimize the offline construction of the primal reduced basis, an efficient error indicator is coupled to a greedy sampling algorithm. The proposed hybrid hyper-reduction strategy is successfully applied to a 1-dimensional static obstacle problem with a 2-dimensional parameter space and to a 3-dimensional contact problem between two linearly elastic bodies. The numerical results show the efficiency of the reduction technique, especially the good approximation of the contact forces compared with other methods.

AB  - Past studies suggest that certain properties of fire emitted particulate matter (PM) relate to the combustion phase (flaming, smoldering) of biomass burning, but to date there has been little consideration of such properties for use as combustion phase indicators. We studied the thermochemical properties of PM2.5 emitted from experimental and prescribed fires using multi-element scanning thermal analysis (MESTA). Resulting thermograms show that the carbon from PM2.5 generally can be grouped into three temperature categories: low (peak similar to 180 degrees C), medium (peak between 180-420 degrees C), and high (peak > 420 degrees C) temperature carbons. PM2.5 from smoldering phase combustion is composed of much more low-temperature carbon (fraction of total carbon = 0.342 +/- 0.067, n = 9) than PM2.5 from the flaming phase (fraction of total carbon = 0.065 +/- 0.018, n = 9). The fraction of low-temperature carbon of the PM2.5 correlates well with modified combustion efficiency (MCE; r(2) = 0.76). Therefore, this MESTA thermogram method can potentially be used as a combustion phase indicator solely based on the property of PM2.5. Since the MESTA thermogram of PM2.5 can be determined independently of MCE, we have a second parameter to describe the combustion condition of a fire, which may refine our understanding of fire behavior and improve the accuracy of emission factor determinations. This PM2.5 indicator should be useful for discerning differential diffusion between PM2.5 and gases and providing insight into the impact of PM emission on atmospheric environment and the public health.

AB  - Climate change-reflected in significant environmental changes such as warming, sea level rise, shifts in salinity, oxygen and other ocean conditions-is expected to impact marine organisms and associated fisheries. This study provides an assessment of the potential impacts on, and the vulnerability of, marine biodiversity and fisheries catches in the Arabian Gulf under climate change. To this end, using three separate niche modelling approaches under a 'business-as-usual' climate change scenario, we projected the future habitat suitability of the Arabian Gulf (also known as the Persian Gulf) for 55 expert-identified priority species, including charismatic and non-fish species. Second, we conducted a vulnerability assessment of national economies to climate change impacts on fisheries. The modelling outputs suggested a high rate of local extinction (up to 35% of initial species richness) by 2090 relative to 2010. Spatially, projected local extinctions are highest in the southwestern part of the Gulf, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). While the projected patterns provided useful indicators of potential climate change impacts on the region's diversity, the magnitude of changes in habitat suitability are more uncertain. Fisheries-specific results suggested reduced future catch potential for several countries on the western side of the Gulf, with projections differing only slightly among models. Qatar and the UAE were particularly affected, with more than a 26% drop in future fish catch potential. Integrating changes in catch potential with socio-economic indicators suggested the fisheries of Bahrain and Iran may be most vulnerable to climate change. We discuss limitations of the indicators and the methods used, as well as the implications of our overall findings for conservation and fisheries management policies in the region.

AB  - Biomarkers and carbon isotope data were used to depict geochemical properties and to delineate source of the crude oils from Asmari and Bangestan reservoirs of the giant Gachsaran oilfield, SW Iran. Despite the distinct horizons of the reservoirs and severe petrophysical heterogeneity inside each reservoir, all oil samples show an identical level of thermal maturity. Furthermore, similar source-related parameters reflect identical source rock for both reservoirs. They indicate carbonate-marl source deposited in a marine environment under anoxic-suboxic conditions. Strong marine organic matter signatures of predominantly algal origin along with evidence of a terrigenous angiosperm plant contribution were detected. Geochemical evidence suggests that the Gachsaran field Asmari and Bangestan oils being sourced from a mix of organic-rich Kazhdumi and Pabdeh source rocks of Albian and Middle EoceneEarly Oligocene ages, respectively. Carbon isotope composition and V/Ni ratio signatures indicate Kazhdumi Formation as the main source rock. Meanwhile, significant presence of oleanane and less than unity values of C29/C30 h(op)an(es) ratio demonstrate a partial contribution of Pabdeh Formation. This contradiction could be explained by two scenarios; 1) incorporating very immature non-expelled Pabdeh oils into the mature Kazhdumi oils during migration or 2) partial charge form low maturity Pabdeh oils that is insufficient to impact a typical mixed signature over the geochemical fingerprint of the reservoired oils. Additionally, geochemical similarities give rise to an assumption of reservoir and trap interconnection for this giant field. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the history and cryostratigraphy of the upper permafrost in the High-Arctic Adventdalen Valley, central Svalbard. Nineteen frozen sediment cores, up to 10.7m long, obtained at five periglacial landforms, were analysed for cryostructures, ice, carbon and solute contents, and grain-size distribution, and were C-14- and OSL-dated. Spatial variability in ice and carbon contents is closely related to the sedimentary history and mode of permafrost aggradation. In the valley bottom, saline epigenetic permafrost with pore ice down to depths of 10.7m depth formed in deltaic sediments since the mid-Holocene; cryopegs were encountered below 6m. In the top 1 to 5m, syngenetic and quasi-syngenetic permafrost with microlenticular, lenticular, suspended and organic-matrix cryostructures developed due to loess and alluvial sedimentation since the colder late Holocene, which resulted in the burial of organic material. At the transition between deltaic sediments and loess, massive ice bodies occurred. A pingo developed where the deltaicsediments reached the surface. On hillslopes, suspended cryostructure on solifluction sheets indicates quasi-syngenetic permafrost aggradation; lobes, in contrast, were ice-poor. Suspended cryostructure in eluvial deposits reflects epigenetic or quasi-syngenetic permafrost formation on a weathered bedrock plateau. Landform-scale spatial variations in ground ice and carbon relate to variations in slope, sedimentation rate, moisture conditions and stratigraphy. Although the study reveals close links between Holocene landscape evolution and permafrost history, our results emphasize a large uncertainty in using terrain surface indicators to infer ground-ice contents and upscale from core to landform scale in mountainous permafrost landscapes.

AB  - A batch experiment was conducted to study the adsorption behaviors of glyphosate, glufosinate, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid (2-AEP) in marine sediments (mud, silt, and sand) from the Baltic Sea. The experiment took into account the influence of pH, salinity, and temperature on the adsorption behaviors of the studied compounds. In contrast to glufosinate, glyphosate exhibited an adsorption affinity for the three types of sediments. AMPA and 2-AEP showed similar adsorption behaviors on mud and silt, while their adsorption on sand was negligible. The equilibrium adsorption data for glyphosate, AMPA, and 2-AEP on mud and silt fit well with the linear partitioning and Freundlich isotherms, whereas the data for glyphosate on sand could only be fitted with the Freundlich isotherm. The Freundlich distribution coefficients (k(f)) were in the range of 6.1-259.5 L/kg for glyphosate, 9.2-39.5 L/kg for AMPA, and 7.7-38.5 L/kg for 2-AEP under the experimental conditions of pH 8.1, temperature = 21 degrees C, and a salt concentration of 8 g/L. The adsorption kinetic was better described by the pseudo-second-order than the pseudo-first-order model, suggesting chemisorption as the adsorption mechanism. The order of adsorption of the compounds on the sediments was: glyphosate > AMPA >= 2-AEP > glufosinate. The adsorption capacity of sediments followed the sequence: mud > silt > sand. Increasing the pH, salinity, or temperature of the solution significantly reduced the adsorption capacity of the compounds. The data obtained in this study provide valuable information on the fate and distribution of the investigated phosphonates in the Baltic Sea.

AB  - Solute mixing, spreading, and fast chemical reactions in aquifers are strongly influenced by spatial variability of the hydraulic properties, temporal flow fluctuations, and fluid density differences. We study the coupling of heterogeneity, transient forcing, and density-driven flow on mixing and chemical reactions between two fluids of different density under a stable stratification. We consider the reaction of the fast dissolution of calcite. We find that temporal fluctuations and heterogeneity cause strong local enhancement of the mixing and reaction rates and this impact increases with the degree of connectivity of hydraulic conductivity. The global mixing and reactivity, however, are on the order of or smaller than their homogeneous counterparts due to heterogeneity-induced fluid segregation. The local maxima of the mixing and reaction rates are found to be located around strongly stretched regions corresponding to high velocity zones where dispersive mass transfer mechanisms are increased by dispersion. We also find that density variations compress the interface, which in turn emphasizes local maxima in mixing and reaction rates. Numerical results provide evidence that the stretching of the interface induced by spatial heterogeneity and transient effects coupled with density variations lead to the formation of complex patterns of reactive hotspots, zones of enhanced reaction efficiency, and that its distribution is directly linked to the deformation properties and topology of the flow field. These results provide new insights into the role of spatial and temporal variability on the mixing and reaction efficiency as well as the formation of reactive geochemical patterns in actual environmental systems.

AB  - Chlorobenzenes (CBs) are a group of organic pollutants that pose a high environmental risk due to their toxicity, persistence and possible transfer in the food chain. Available data in literature show that CBs are detected in different environmental compartments such as soil, water, air and sediment. The widespread presence of CBs in the environment is related to their former extensive use in agriculture and industry. Some CBs are ranked in the list of priority pollutants by the Stockholm Convention, and their reduction or elimination from the environment is therefore of high importance. Environmental risk assessment of CBs requires knowledge on the role and importance of the main environmental fate processes, especially in soil. Furthermore, development of remediation strategies for reduction or elimination of CBs from the environment is related to the enhancement of fate processes that increase their dissipation in various environmental compartments. The main objectives of the current review were to present up-to-date data on fate processes of CBs in the soil environment and to explore possible remediation strategies for soils contaminated with CBs. Dechlorination of highly-chlorinated benzenes is the main degradation pathway under anaerobic conditions, leading to the formation of lower-chlorinated benzenes. Biodegradation of lower-chlorinated benzenes is well documented, especially by strains of adapted or specialized microorganisms. Development of techniques that combine dechlorination of highly-chlorinated benzenes with biodegradation or biomineralization of lower-chlorinated benzenes can result in useful tools for remediation of soils contaminated with CBs. In addition, immobilization of CBs in soil by use of different amendments is a useful method for reducing the environmental risk of CBs.

AB  - We identified aspects of the trapping process that afforded opportunities for improving trap efficiency of invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in a Great Lake's tributary. Capturing a sea lamprey requires it to encounter the trap, enter, and be retained until removed. Probabilities of these events depend on the interplay between sea lamprey behavior, environmental conditions, and trap design. We first tested how strongly seasonal patterns in daily trap catches (a measure of trapping success) were related to nightly rates of trap encounter, entry, and retention (outcomes of sea lamprey behavior). We then tested the degree to which variation in rates of trap encounter, entry, and retention were related to environmental features that control agents can manipulate (attractant pheromone addition, discharge) and features agents cannot manipulate (water temperature, season), but could be used as indicators for when to increase trapping effort. Daily trap catch was most strongly associated with rate of encounter. Relative and absolute measures of predictive strength for environmental factors that managers could potentially manipulate were low, suggesting that opportunities to improve trapping success by manipulating factors that affect rates of encounter, entry, and retention are limited. According to results at this trap, more sea lamprey would be captured by increasing trapping effort early in the season when sea lamprey encounter rates with traps are high. The approach used in this study could be applied to trapping of other invasive or valued species. (C) 2016 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Offshore operations have always been very challenging due to technological and operational complexities in combination with harsh environmental conditions. Geological uncertainties, high pressure flammable fluids in the presence of ignition sources, complicated structural layouts, limited response time allowance, difficulty of control and communication are some of the critical factors that pose clear threats toward safe operations and may result in high consequence events, e.g., blowouts. Developing well specified risk indicators is difficult due to such highly correlated factors and multifaceted operations. Leading indicators, which are able to identify critical events that could lead to high consequence events, have proven to be an effective tool that can help the operators in their decision making to react earlier to an event and to reduce the risk of an incident. Most of the research dedicated to leading and lagging indicators are applicable to the petrochemical industry, and there is not yet an agreement on a definition and classification of leading indicators for drilling related blowouts. This paper discusses the approaches of different organizations and institutes on leading indicators characterization and development. The drilling industry is compared with the aviation industry to identify potential elements for developing a comprehensive leading indicators framework. A workable definition of leading indicators is proposed considering the intricacy of offshore operations. Leading indicators are broadly categorized into two classes which are further segmented into different groups. Proposed categorization is analyzed with a blowout case study and simple decision support algorithms are proposed for predicting kick which is a major precursor to blowouts.

AB  - The geographic studies involving in various forms the human settlements need to also include quantitative and qualitative references on their spatial features. These studies also need to include aspects on habitation and the reference should be, in this case, to the norms in force or, where they do not exist, to regional, national or even international averages, depending on the situation. Thus, important landmarks are created for comparisons based on which analyses can be made in terms of the way natural conditions are reflected in the quality of life and in the way they could be profitably used in economy. The relief of the Ialomita Subcarpathians has been a favourable factor for the founding and development of settlements, especially along the valleys and in the depressions separated by forested hills. The first part of this study presents the land structure of and analyzes the land fund, closely related in practice to the land use. This also gives a conclusive image on the dominant economic activities. Settlement dispersion was another element for correlation, the series of values recorded being quite large by comparison to the generally unitary aspect of the relief. Later on, starting from this general image on the quality of habitation, for a precise quantification, seven indicators have been used. For five of them, a positive dynamics has been noted, confirming the development potential of the area, despite the negative demographic phenomena characterizing it at present. At the same time, this helps delimit the more or less attractive areas in this region, which could constitute the basis for diagnosis and could provide guidelines for directions of interventions by development programs where demographic and economic re-dynamization is needed.

AB  - The transgenic soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] occupies about 80 % of the global area cropped with this legume, the majority comprising the glyphosate-resistant trait (Roundup Ready(A (R)), GR or RR). However, concerns about possible impacts of transgenic crops on soil microbial communities are often raised. We investigated soil chemical, physical and microbiological properties, and grain yields in long-term field trials involving conventional and nearly isogenic RR transgenic genotypes. The trials were performed at two locations in Brazil, with different edaphoclimatic conditions. Large differences in physical, chemical and classic microbiological parameters (microbial biomass of C and N, basal respiration), as well as in grain production were observed between the sites. Some phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria), classes (Alphaproteobacteria, Actinomycetales, Solibacteres) and orders (Rhizobiales, Burkholderiales, Myxococcales, Pseudomonadales), as well as some functional subsystems (clustering-based subsystems, carbohydrates, amino acids and protein metabolism) were, in general, abundant in all treatments. However, bioindicators related to superior soil fertility and physical properties at Londrina were identified, among them a higher ratio of Proteobacteria:Acidobacteria. Regarding the transgene, the metagenomics showed differences in microbial taxonomic and functional abundances, but lower in magnitude than differences observed between the sites. Besides the site-specific differences, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Chlorophyta were higher in the transgenic treatment, as well as sequences related to protein metabolism, cell division and cycle. Although confirming effects of the transgenic trait on soil microbiome, no differences were recorded in grain yields, probably due to the buffering capacity associated with the high taxonomic and functional microbial diversity observed in all treatments.

AB  - Calcareous fens are habitats that are well-adapted to extreme ecological conditions (water with a very high calcium content). The vegetation response following the application of restoration measures (mowing, removal of shrubs) in a calcareous fen (site Sliacske travertiny, western Carpathians) was observed over six years in six permanent plots. Three plots were established in an area strongly invaded by reeds (Phragmites australis), where restoration mowing was introduced, and three plots were established in an area overgrown by willows, where the shrubs were partly removed at the beginning and no other management measures were subsequently applied. Indirect and direct gradient analyses (Principal Component Analysis and Redundancy Analysis) and General Linear Models showed that species composition in the mown reed area evolved towards the typical composition of calcareous fens, although reeds were still dominant in the canopy. The overall species richness, as well as number of fen indicator species increased here, especially on the most-detailed scale of 0.25 x 0.25 m. In contrast, the species composition in the unmown area with willows developed towards a higher abundance of wetland generalists. The species richness of vascular plants increased on the scale of 2 x 2 m, but the number of bryophyte species decreased on the scale of 0.25 x 0.25 m and the number of fen indicators species remained unchanged. Our survey showed that mowing can be used for the restoration of calcareous fens invaded by reed, but the total supression of reed can not be achieved in short time period. Furthermore, the occasional removal of shrubs on overgrown calcareous fens is not a feasible method of habitat management.

AB  - The main objective of the present work is to investigate the capability of experimental modal analysis as a nondestructive tool to characterize and quantify the fatigue behavior of laminated composite beam with different lamina orientations and cantilevered boundary condition. In the present work, experimental modal analysis was conducted on the specimens previously subjected to fatigue loading to determine the modal parameters (natural frequency, damping ratio and mode shape). This was achieved through studying the response of modal testing with different specimens of different lamina orientations as a main factor affecting fatigue life. This correlates modal parameters such as: damping ratio, natural frequency and mode shape to fatigue behavior. The composite material used in experiments is glass fiber reinforced polyester (GFRP) laminate. Plane bending fatigue tests were performed on standard fatigue specimens. The fatigue test was interrupted at different fatigue life ratios (n/N-f) and modal testing was conducted to determine the change in modal parameters. The results showed that the changes of modal parameters provide a proper means for predicting the fatigue behavior of composite structures. From the experimental results of both dynamic and fatigue tests, curve fitting technique was used to correlate modal parameters to fatigue life. An exponential and quadratic equations have been obtained which correlate fatigue life ratio to damping ratio and resonant frequency respectively. It was noticed from the curves representing exponential and quadratic equations that the value of damping ratio is more noticeable than the value of frequency, which means that the extent of fatigue damage determines the damping ratio, hence damping ratio could be said to be a good indicator of the fatigue life ratio.

AB  - In response to substantial deforestation over many decades, large scale reforestation programs are being implemented across many tropical developing countries. Examples include the United Nations Billion Trees Campaign, the National Greening Program in the Philippines, and the 5 million ha reforestation program in Vietnam. However, while substantial investments are being made in reforestation, little information exists on the drivers influencing reforestation success and how these interact to determine environmental and socio-economic outcomes. In this study we surveyed 43 reforestation projects on Leyte Island, The Philippines to identify the drivers that most influence reforestation success as measured by key indicators drawn from the literature, including interactions between drivers and between drivers and indicators. We investigated 98 potential success drivers, including technical and biophysical factors; socio-economic factors; institutional, policy and management factors; and reforestation project characteristics. We also measured 12 success indicators, including forest establishment, forest growth, environmental and socio-economic success indicators. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to identify significant relationships among drivers and indicators and this analysis was used to develop a system of driver and indicator relationships. Based on this we found that revegetation method, funding source, education and awareness campaigns, the dependence of local people on forests, reforestation incentives, project objectives, forest protection mechanisms and the condition of road infrastructure were highly connected drivers that influenced multiple success indicators either directly or indirectly. We conclude that policies targeting revegetation methods, socioeconomic incentives, forest protection mechanisms, sustainable livelihoods, diversification of funding and partnerships, technical support, and infrastructure development are likely to have a broad systemic and beneficial effect on the success of reforestation programs in tropical developing countries.

AB  - In situ bioremediation is being considered to optimize an existing pump-and-treat remedy for treatment of explosives-contaminated groundwater at the Umatilla Chemical Depot. Push-pull tests were conducted using a phased approach to measure in situ hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) degradation rates associated with various carbon substrates. Phase I included short-duration transport tests conducted in each well to determine dilution rates and retardation factors for RDX and TNT. Phase II included aquifer " feedings" conducted by injecting 150 gallons of treated site groundwater amended with ethanol, corn syrup, lactose or emulsified oil (concentrations 10, 25 and 27 mM, respectively; 12% by volume for emulsified oil). Wells received up to 6 substrate " feedings" over the course of 3 months followed by monitoring dissolved oxygen, nitrate, Fe(II), and sulfate to gauge in situ redox conditions as indicators of anaerobic microbial activity. Phase III included push-pull tests conducted by injecting 150 gallons of site groundwater amended with approximately 1000 mu g/L RDX, 350 mu g/L TNT, carbon substrate and a conservative tracer, followed by sampling over 8 d. Corn syrup resulted in the best RDX removal (82% on average) and the largest RDX degradation rate coefficient (1.4 +/- 1.1 d(-1)). Emulsified oil resulted in the best TNT removal (99%) and largest TNT degradation rate coefficient (5.7 x 10(-2) d(-1)). These results will be used to simulate full-scale in situ bioremediation scenarios at Umatilla and will support a go/no-go decision to initiate full-scale bioremediation remedy optimization.

AB  - Mussels are widespread in coastal environments and experience various physical, chemical, and bacteriological conditions. Owing to the increase of coastal urbanization, mussels are now commonly exposed not only to indigenous bacteria, but also to enteric bacteria originating from pulsed and chronic sewage discharges into coastal environments. Due to its broad resilience to environmental variations, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis is commonly used as an indicator of environmental quality in bio-monitoring programs. However, since mussel immune system capabilities may be affected by the presence of exogenous fecal bacteria in coastal seawater subjected to sewage discharges, we aimed to determine the effect of in vivo bacterial challenges on mussels' immune competency by using two exogenous enteric bacterial strains, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, and an indigenous bacterial strain Vibrio splendidus (as control). Bacterial strains were tested individually, by injection into the posterior adductor muscle at three different cell densities (10(2), 10(3), and 10(4) cells). Unlike classic in vitro experiments using higher bacterial concentrations, neither the enteric bacteria nor the indigenous strain induced significant increase or decrease of either cell-mediated (phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species, and NO (x) production) or humoral components (prophenoloxidase-like, acid phosphatase, and l-leucine-aminopeptidase production) of the immune system. This study demonstrates that, at low concentrations, E. coli and E. faecalis do not represent an additional threat that could impair M. edulis immune competency and, as a consequence, its potential of survival in coastal areas subjected to sewage discharges.

AB  - Eco-toxicological or bioassay tests have been intensively discussed as tools for the evaluation of soil quality. Tests using soil organisms, including microarthropods and plants, allow direct estimates to be made of important soil characteristics and functions. In this study we compared the results obtained by two in vitro standard bioassays following ISO or OECD guidelines: (i) the short term-chronic phytotoxicity germination and root elongation test using three different plant species Cucumis sativus L (Cucurbitaceae), Lepidium sativum L (Brassicaceae), and Medicago sativa L (Fabaceae) and (ii) the inhibition of reproduction of Folsomia candida (Collembola) by soil pollutants to investigate the toxicity of a serpentine soil present in the Italian Apennines, rich in heavy metals such as Ni, Cr, and Co. In addition, microarthropod communities were characterised to evaluate the effects of metal contents on the soil fauna in natural conditions. Abundances, Acari/Collembola ratio, biodiversity indices and the QBS-ar index were calculated. Our results demonstrate that the two in vitro tests distinguish differences correlated with metal and organic matter contents in four sub-sites within the serpentinite. Soil fauna characterisation, not previously performed on serpentine soils, revealed differences in the most vulnerable and adapted groups of microarthropods to soil among the four sub-sites: the microarthropod community was found to be rich in term of biodiversity in the sub-site characterised by a lower metal content and a higher organic matter content and vegetation.

AB  - Indicator models of sexual selection suggest that honest mating signals are costly to produce or maintain. Animals that use extended phenotypes as courtship signals may be able to reduce these costs in a given year by reusing nonbodily ornaments acquired during previous years, perhaps affecting signal honesty. I examined whether male great bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus nuchalis, are able to reduce the annual costs of signal production by reusing bower decorations acquired during previous years. I paired males that had similar numbers of bower decorations and removed decorations from one member of the pair. Males that had decorations removed from their bowers collected more decorations from the environment the following year than did control males, and they tended to steal more decorations. However, they had fewer decorations at their bowers than did control males, most likely because control males reused almost 50% of the decorations that they had acquired during previous years. These results suggest that individuals that accumulate nonbodily ornaments can reduce the costs of signal production in subsequent years; and that resource accumulation can lead to differences in both behaviour and display quality between individuals that do and do not accumulate resources. I also found a positive correlation between the number of decorations at bowers before removal and the number of decorations acquired by males after removal, suggesting that decoration numbers indicate a male's past condition and present performance.

AB  - In shallow coastal habitats scavenging netted whelks Nassarius reticulatus attached egg capsules to the stipes of red algae Chondrus crispus and occasionally on Furcellaria lumbricalis and Plumaria plumose. In the laboratory egg capsules were laid on aquaria sides and lids by individuals >= 21 mm shell length. Larger size classes produced more egg capsules and spawned over a longer period and in doing so partitioned less energy into shell growth. Large netted whelks (25-28.9 mm) produced larger capsules which contained significantly more and larger eggs than those produced by smaller individuals (21-24.9 mm). Egg capsule production continued throughout the year by regularly fed N. reticulatus held at ambient seawater temperatures. Egg production increased in the spring and summer with peak production during June (15 degrees C), decreased between August and October and resumed again during the winter (November to February at similar to 7 degrees C). During the summer (15-16 degrees C) egg capsules were smaller and contained smaller eggs than those deposited during the winter (7-10 degrees C), although the number of eggs. capsule(-1) was similar. Enforced food limitation reduced the number and size of the egg capsules, the number and size of eggs produced . female(-1) and the duration of the breeding period. Hatching success of N. reticulatus egg capsules was high (95%) even at winter seawater temperatures (11-8.5 degrees C) and the duration of embryonic development was fastest between 15 and 17.5 degrees C.

AB  - The emission of platinum group elements (PGEs) from automobile catalytic converters has led to rapid increases in Pt, Pd, and Rh concentrations in roadside media. This article represents the first systematic study in Greece to assess PGE levels in road dust and roadside soil and their temporal variation on a seasonal basis over a 12-month period. Road dust and roadside soil samples were analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry following microwave digestion. Concentrations of PGE in all samples were above the average upper crust values and local background levels, with maximum values of 306.4 ng/g Pt, 18.2 ng/g Pd, and 64.6 ng/g Rh in road dust and 225 ng/g Pt, 14.0 ng/g Pd, and 49.5 ng/g Rh in roadside soil. PGE ratios were not consistent with known catalytic converter composition throughout the sampling period reflecting the high emission of Rh from new catalytic converters. Spatial variations were influenced by various factors like driving style, matrix composition, diurnal change in traffic volume, and climatic conditions. With regard to seasonal variations, systematic changes in the temporal distribution of PGE levels were observed and followed a similar pattern between the two matrices. Except PGEs, Pb levels were determined, since it has been a typical indicator of vehicle-derived environmental lead pollution. The data indicate that despite the use of unleaded gasoline, traffic-related sources of Pb that induce levels above the local background have not been eliminated.

AB  - The publication presents the vegetation types of the highest altitudinal vegetation belt (b) in continental West Greenland. This belt occurs at altitudes above 1200-1250 m a.s.l. and mainly comprise snowbed (Salicetea herbaceae) and scree communities (Thlaspietea) as well as fragmentarily developed fellfield vegetation (Carici-Kobresietea). The observed vegetation types are characterized and differentiated from each other as well as from related communities of the lower vegetation belt c. The borderline between these belts is mainly characterized by the disappearance of several vegetation types and plant species in belt b. Several indicators (species, vegetation types) for a distinction of these belts arc identified. The Study completes the information basis needed for the construction of a model of altitudinal vegetation belts in continental West Greenland and of a first broad scale vegetation map of this area. It also includes vegetation releves from the highest elevations (up to 1320 m a.s.l.) and with the highest species richness (95 species) known from Greenlandic mountains up to now.
   In the second part an altitudinal zonation hypothesis is evaluated which infers altitudinal vegetation belts from latitudinal arctic vegetation zones. Similarities and differences between vegetation belt b and the related latitudinal Bioclimate Subzone B are discussed using idealized toposequences of vegetation in Svalbard as well as additional data from the circumpolar area. It is concluded that similarities on the level of classes, alliances and even associations arc numerous especially in extreme habitats. Differences can be explained by the specific conditions In Mountain habitats such as a higher degree of oceanity and wind abrasion as well as by different species pools of the regarded

AB  - A second-order central composite design was employed to investigate the effect of organic matter (OM) content and soil acidity (pH) on the cadmium toxicity to Paronychiurus kimi (Lee), a collembolan species native to Korea. Two independent variables, OM and pH, were adjusted from 0 to 10% (in total dry wt) and 4.5 to 7.0, respectively. Cadmium concentrations tested were 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mg/kg dry soil. The toxic effects that cadmium exerted on P. kimi (28-day median lethal concentration (LC(50)s)) varied significantly with different combinations of OM content and pH. The second-order response surface model was appropriate for describing combined effects of OM and pH on the cadmium toxicity to P. kimi. Linear effects (OM and pH) were predominant contributors accounting for approximate to 70% of the total variance of cadmium toxicity to P. kimi. No significant quadratic (pH X pH) and interaction (OM X pH) effects were observed; therefore, the final second-order response surface model could be reduced as follows: 28-day LC50 of cadmium (mg/kg) = -94.87 + 26.69 X OM + 16.64 X pH - 1.82 X OM2. Validation of the developed response surface model using 4 soil media with different OM content and pH resulted in a significant correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.97) between predicted and observed 28-day LC50. Based on physico-chemical properties of the test media, developed models can be used to explain the variation of cadmium toxicities at various environmental conditions and may improve current environmental risk assessment procedures of metals.

AB  - The idea of highly accurate (definitive) methods by radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA) is presented and illustrated with several examples of methods worked out in this Laboratory over the past several years. Definitive methods by RNAA are constructed by combining reactor neutron activation with very selective and quantitative post-irradiation separation of the indicator radionuclide by column chromatography followed by gamma-ray spectrometric measurement. All conditions for the determination of the individual element are optimized and uncertainties associated with every step of the analytical procedure are minimized. Even after the method has been thoroughly elaborated and validated through the analysis of appropriate certified reference materials (CRMs), the results obtained in each series of measurements are acknowledged as obtained by definitive method only when a series of previously formulated criteria is simultaneously fulfilled. The examples of definitive methods for the determination of cadmium, cobalt and molybdenum, respectively, in biological materials are presented. Each of these methods has detection limit of the order of ng g(-1) or better, and yields accurate and precise results. The expanded standard uncertainty is of the order of 2.6% for the case of single-element determination (Co) and 3.4-5.2% for the less favourable case (Mo) where there is necessity for simultaneous determination of uranium to correct for interference due to fission reaction. Definitive methods by RNAA may constitute an option or alternative with respect to ID-MS as methods of "guaranteed accuracy" being also a perspective solution in the case of monoisotopic elements, for which ID-MS cannot be used.

AB  - Adaptive foraging decisions emerge from environmental conditions that alter fitness. Under most circumstances fitness varies with population density. So it should be possible to use density-dependent foraging not only as a surrogate for fitness, but also as an assay for habitat quality. We tested this prediction by measuring the quitting-harvest rates of red-backed voles foraging in artificial resource patches located in three different habitats where we manipulated population density. Quitting-harvest rates were less in safe foraging trays located under cover than in risky trays in the open. Voles avoided risky trays in old field and alder field habitats, and foraged all trays in a dense alder forest habitat to similar low harvest rates. Quitting-harvest rates declined with density in experiments conducted in 2005 but not in similar experiments during 2006. We interpret these complex results as evidence that rapid food renewal during the 2006 experiments increased the voles' foraging costs, and their quitting-harvest rates, in artificial food patches. Continued foraging in the trays would compromise the voles' abilities to forage elsewhere in the habitat. This conclusion is bolstered by significant differences in rainfall between years that precipitated vegetation recovery in 2006 shortly before we initiated our experiments. Our results demonstrate that we may not be able to use behavior alone to estimate population density in variable environments. So we outline more effective research designs that should allow other scientists to not only detect density-dependent foraging, but also spatial and temporal variation in habitat quality.

AB  - Several families of elastic anisotropies have been introduced by Saint Venant (Saint Venent, B. (de) (1863). Sur la distribution des elasticities autour de chaque point d'un solide ou d'un milieu de contexture quelconque, particulierement lorsqu'il est amorphe sams etre isotrope, Journal de Math. Pures et Appliques, Tome VIII (26(eme) serie) pp. 257-430) for which the polar diagram of elastic parameters in different directions of the material (indicator surface) is ellipsoidal. These families cover a large variety of models introduced in recent years for damaged materials or as effective moduli of heterogeneous materials. Ellipsoidal anisotropy has also been used as a guideline in phenomenological modeling of materials. Then a question that naturally arises is to know in which conditions the assumption that some indicator surfaces are ellipsoidal allows one to entirely determine the elastic constants. This question has not been rigorously studied in the literature. In this study, first, several basic classes of ellipsoidal anisotropy are presented. Then the problem of the determination of elastic parameters from indicator surfaces is discussed in several basic cases that can occur in phenomenological modeling. Finally, the compatibility between the assumption of ellipsoidal form for different indicator surfaces is discussed. In particular, it is shown that if the indicator surfaces of 4 root E(n) and of -4 root c(n) (where E(n) and c(n) are, respectively, the Young's modulus and the elastic coefficient in the direction n) are ellipsoidal, then the two ellipsoids have necessarily the same principal axes, and the material in this case is orthotropic.

AB  - The degree of rangeland degradation in the United States is unknown due to the failure of traditional field-based monitoring to capture the range of variability of ecological indicators and disturbances, including climatic effects and land use practices, at regional to national spatial scales, and temporal scales of decades. Here, a protocol is presented for retrospective monitoring and assessment of rangeland degradation using historical time series of remote sensing data and catastrophe theory as an ecological framework to account for both gradual and rapid changes of state. This protocol 1) justifies the use of time-series satellite imagery in terms of the spatial and temporal scale of data collection; 2) briefly explains how to acquire, process, and transform the data into ecological indicators; 3) discusses the use of time-series analysis as the appropriate procedure for detecting significant change; and 4) explains what reference conditions are appropriate. Landsat data have been collected and archived since 1972, and include complete coverage of US rangelands. Characteristics of land degradation can be retrospectively measured for a nearly 33-year trend using surrogate remote sensing-based indicators that correlate with changes in life-form composition (time series of thematic maps), declines in vegetation productivity (vegetation indices), accelerated soil erosion (soil indices), declines in soil quality (piospheric analysis), and changes in landscape configuration (time series of thematic maps). Aspects of 2 retrospective studies are presented as examples of application of the protocol to considerations of the land use impacts from military training and testing and ranching activities on rangelands.

AB  - Chironomids, pollen and spores were used to reconstruct Holocene aquatic and terrestrial environments at Alanen Laanijarvi, northern Sweden. Chironomid analysis revealed a pattern of limnological evolution from oligotrophic conditions in a relatively deep lake during 8.6 to 5.5 cal. ka BP, followed by a period of lake shallowing from 5.5 to 2.7 cal. ka BP. Increases in acidity and littoral habitat complexity may have occurred from 2.7 cal. ka BP to the present, though some compositional changes may have resulted from human disturbance. Chironomid-inferred mean July air temperatures range between 9.8 degrees C in the Early Holocene to 11.3 degrees C in the Late Holocene. Limitations on chironomid-based quantitative temperature interpretations may exist because of low taxon richness. Diatoms were recovered from the upper sediments only, from about AD 1800. Pollen and spore analysis revealed an early colonizing vegetation of juniper, sedges and birch soon after local deglaciation, followed by birch forests until about 8.3 cal. ka BP. Alder stands occurred locally to 5.5 cal. ka BP, when pine and spruce forests developed and remain to the present day. These results suggest that little major terrestrial vegetation change may occur in some northern environments with predicted future global warming, where it is predicted to be most severe. Aquatic environments may, however, be greatly affected by a shift in precipitation regime, causing changes in allochthonous organic input, lake depth and possibly the amount of human activity or disturbance in the watershed.

AB  - Microstructure of a natural slip zone was comprehensively examined using a combination of images captured systematically by optical microscopy (OPM) and backscattered electron microscopy (BEM) techniques. Microstructural features identified on these images were processed and evaluated using an advanced image analysis system, which proved that quantitative analyses could considerably enhance the understanding of shear behavior of slip zones. It was found that variations of porosity, abundance of platy clay particles and alignments of particles are significant indicators revealing nature of deformation processes. These indicators show that global mechanical behavior of the investigated slip zone can be conceptualized as that of normally consolidated clayey soils under drained conditions.
   The geometric patterns of the microstructure of the slip zone are similar to the S-C fabrics seen in tectonic shear zones. It is suggested that combined progressive bulk simple shear and pure shear modes enable to realistically reconstruct the kinematic history of the slip zone, through which particle movements and microstructural evolution were accomplished via various types of particulate flows. The results of this study show that clay mineralogy plays a more important role in the development of the slip zone than abundance of clay-size particles, while both clay mineralogy and relative proportions of each particle size fraction control the response of particles to shear deformation. Among the fractions present in the slip zone, fine silts are the strongest indicator of global shear stress characterized by their highest degree of alignment, whereas clay particles are the weakest. Highest degree of shape preferred orientation is also found within fine silt domains. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The causes of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) are poorly understood, yet it has been widely used as a measure of fitness. Many have demonstrated that individuals with low FA are preferred as mates, and it has been argued that this is because FA provides an indicator of genetic quality. However, the relative importance of genes versus environment in determining the level of FA shown by an organism is currently the subject of much controversy. As yet there is no clear consensus as to whether FA generally has a heritable component and if so how large this might be, or indeed if it is sensible to generalize at all. In Musca domestica flies with low wing length FA have been found to enjoy higher mating success. In order to interpret this finding we assess whether wing length FA in this species is inheritable, and also how it is influenced by environmental stresses induced by temperature and crowding. We also examine whether offspring viability is related to parental FA. We found that wing length FA in M. domestica had no detectable heritable components, and parental FA did not influence offspring viability. FA was influenced by rearing temperature, with flies exhibiting highest FA at the lowest rearing temperature (15 degrees C). Larval survival rate was greatest, and the resulting adults largest, at the intermediate rearing temperature (25 degrees C) compared to higher of lower temperatures, suggesting that 25 degrees C is close to the optimum for the development than does wing FA. These results are discussed in relation to the unity of FA as a tool for use in evolutionary studies. (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Viroids, small single-stranded circular RNAs endowed with autonomous replication, are unique systems to conduct evolutionary studies of complete RNA genomes. The primary structure of 36 progeny variants of peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd), evolved from inoculations of the peach indicator GF-305 with four individual PLMVd cDNAs differing in their pathogenicity, has been determined. Most progeny variants had unique sequences, revealing that the extremely heterogeneous character of PLMVd natural isolates most probably results from the intrinsic ability of this RNA to accumulate changes, rather than from repeated inoculations of the same individual trees under field conditions. The structure of the populations derived from single PLMVd sequences differed according to the observed phenotype. Variant gds6 induced a reproducible symptomatic infection and gave rise to a more uniform progeny that preserves some parental features, whereas variant gds15, which induced a variable phenotype, showed a more complex behaviour, generating two distinct progenies in symptomatic and asymptomatic individual plants. Progenies derived from variants esc10 and Is11,which incited latent infections, followed a similar evolutionary pattern, leading to a population structure consisting of two main groups of variants, one of which was formed by variants closely related to the parental sequence. The evolution rate exhibited by PLMVd, considerably higher than that reported for potato spindle tuber viroid, may contribute to the fluctuating symptomatology of the severe PLMVd natural isolates. However, the polymorphism observed in PLMVd progenies does preserve some structural and functional elements previously proposed for this viroid, supporting the fact that they act as constraints limiting the genetic divergence of PLMVd quasispecies generated de novo.

AB  - In order to assess the effects of the execution of the `Port of Bilbao Enlargement Project', epifauna living on hard substrata and environmental parameters were quantitatively investigated from 1994 to 1996. A programme of repeated non-destructive sampling at 8 stations was carried out during the construction period of a breakwater and the filling operations on the shoreline. A correlation analysis was used as a method to extract potential indicator species of particular environmental conditions measured in the field. We postulate that the remaining species (about 80% of the total species data set), insensitive to any of the investigated environmental factors, were unnecessary for the purposes of assessing the environmental impact caused by the port building works. Classification and ordination techniques were then conducted at two contrasting levels by using the full species data set and the selected faunal indicator data subset. All plots showed separation of sampling sites in 3 major groups, which were easily related to the perturbations caused by a siltation gradient from the estuary mouth. This suggests that the amount of effort required in the enumeration of all the organisms sampled may be dramatically reduced by identifying only faunal indicators of environmental discontinuities in the field. So far, the engineering works developed on the western side of the bay have not caused dramatic temporal changes in species composition, or at least they have not had an effect that was larger than the variations detected among the study sites due to siltation from the estuary mouth.

AB  - Population trends of colonising brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula were monitored between 1981 and 1993 at Waipoua Forest in Northland, New Zealand. Canopy defoliation and possum-related damage to eight plant indicator species were assessed annually for four years after an aerial poison operation in 1990, to determine whether the operation had reduced possum numbers and halted possum-related damage to the vegetation. Trap catch estimates of possum density increased by over 70% during the 1980s. The poison operation killed 87% of possums, and ongoing leg-hold trapping (1991-1993) maintained population levels at 7-9% trap catch. Reduction of the possum population did not produce a significant positive short-term vegetation response, but did halt the continuing downward trend in vegetation condition evident in nearby forested areas where possum densities were not reduced. Other measures of possum impact (browsed foliage, stem damage) improved significantly within a year of the poison operation, and may prove more sensitive short-term indicators of reduced possum-related damage. The apparent ability of residual possum populations to retard vegetation recovery has important implications for forest health strategies based on intermittent poison operations. While a large initial population reduction is required to halt vegetation decline, an ability to maintain residual possum populations at very low levels appears necessary for significant vegetation recovery. Targetting the increased resources now available for reducing possum populations to fewer areas of higher conservation value may well return greater ecological dividends than attempts to sustain long-term reduction of possum populations over large areas of more modified indigenous forest.

AB  - Habitat loss is a significant driver of biodiversity loss, causing fragmentation into small, isolated patches of suitable land cover. This reduces the permeability of landscapes to the movement of individuals and reduces the likelihood of metapopulation persistence. Quantifying functional connectivity, the ability of a focal species to move between resource patches, is therefore essential for conservation management. There is substantial evidence supporting a technique based on 'population synchrony'- the degree of correlation in time-series of annual population growth rates between different long-term monitoring sites, to provide a measure of functional connectivity. However, synchronised population dynamics are not only driven by the movement of individuals between sites, but also shared environmental conditions which must be accounted for. Here, we use species survey data from over four decades to investigate average levels and temporal trends in population synchrony for 58 British bird and butterfly species. We first show that population synchrony is significantly associated with synchrony in some seasonal climatic variables. Once we accounted for spatiotemporal climatic patterns, we found that synchrony in butterflies declined over time by 71% between 1985 and 2000 but increased by 64% in recent years. Synchrony in birds showed some decline between 1999 and 2005, after which there appears to being recovery, however most species (74%) show no significant overall change in synchrony. Our proposed indicator provides a 'species-eye-view' of functional connectivity using widely available abundance data. Developing such indicators of functional connectivity, which can be updated annually, is crucial to improve the effectiveness of land management strategies for conservation under increasing environmental change.

AB  - Background Chronic stress is implicated in behavioral and health issues in cats, but methods for recognition, evaluation, and measurement of stress are lacking. Cortisol concentration is typically used as an indicator of stress. Objectives To evaluate use of an enzyme immunoassay to quantitate hair and nail cortisol concentrations (HCC and NCC) in cats and evaluate associations between HCC and NCC and behavioral, physical, and environmental correlates of chronic stress in cats. Animals Forty-eight adult, owned or community cats. Methods Cross-sectional study. Nail clippings and hair were collected from cats. Medical history and cat daily lifestyle questionnaires were completed by owners or caretakers. A commercial laboratory performed cortisol extraction and quantification using a validated enzyme immunoassay kit. Correlational and regression analyses were used to evaluate associations between HCC and NCC and behavioral, environmental, and medical factors. Results Hair and nail cortisol concentrations were significantly associated (r(s) = 0.70; P < .001), but HCCs varied widely within and among cats. Cats with litterbox issues had significantly increased HCC (P = .02) and NCC (P = .001) as compared to cats without litterbox issues. Cats with groomed coats had lower HCCs (P = .02) as compared to cats without groomed coats, whereas cats with dander and mats had higher NCCs (P = .01) as compared to cats without dander and mats. Conclusions and Clinical Importance The quantification of NCCs might improve identification and evaluation of chronic stress in cats. The variability of HCCs in individual cats warrants caution using this measurement in chronic stress studies.

AB  - Greenhouse gases from industrial activities have become a global problem. Emissions management is being developed to raise awareness of the importance of controlling pollution in general and atmospheric emissions in particular. In 2017, the deficit of the rights of issuance in the industrial sectors increased up to 8.3% (verified emissions in 2017 versus allocation in 2017). This trend will increase more at the end of Phase III due to a progressive reduction in allocation. Phase IV will be much more restrictive in allocating emission rights than Phase III. The extra cost of this deficit reinforces the need for industry in general to reduce CO2 and for the paper industry to reduce GHG emissions and generate credits. Old factories are typically identified as sources of pollution in addition to being inefficient compared to new factories. This article discusses the possibilities offered by maintenance actions, whose integration into a process can successfully reduce the environmental impact of industrial plants, particularly by reducing the CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2-eq units henceforth CO2) they produce. This case study analyzes the integration of maintenance rules that enable significant thermal energy savings and consequently CO2 emissions reduction associated with papermaking. Managing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as the amount of cold water added to the boiler circuit and the conditions of the air blown into the dryer section hood, can be used as indicators of CO2 emissions generated. The control of the water and temperature reduces these emissions. A defined measure-in this case, t CO2/t Paper-indicates an achievement of a 21% reduction in emissions over the past 8 years.</p>

AB  - Objectives We examine the prevalence and sociodemographic risk factors of skeletal indicators of stress in forensic samples of undocumented migrants from Mexico and Central America. Materials and methods Cranial and dental remains of 319 migrants recovered in the Arizona and Texas borderlands were assessed for porotic hyperostosis (PH), cribra orbitalia (CO), and linear enamel hypoplasias (LEH). Logistic regression models for each condition were estimated to test for associations with biological sex, age, recovery location, and whether individuals were identified. Additional models estimated for a subsample of identified migrants included region of origin, residential context, and community indigeneity. Results The full sample shows moderate crude prevalence of CO (9.6%) and LEH (34.1%), and a high prevalence of PH (49.6%). Significantly higher odds of PH are associated with being male (2.16 times higher), unidentified (1.89 times higher), and recovered in Arizona (3.76 times higher). Among identified migrants, we fail to find associations significant at the p < 0.05 level between skeletal stress and all sociodemographic variables except age. Discussion The factors associated with PH may be related to influences on decisions to migrate and diversity among migrant sending regions. The skeletal evidence for early life stress is generally consistent with common public health concerns among impoverished communities in the region. The lesions themselves are viewed as embodied risk of physiological disturbance when resource access is structured by higher-level social, economic, and political forces. Forensic anthropologists would benefit from increased sensitivity to embodied structural violence among the vulnerable individuals and communities they serve.

The proposed methodology generated three monthly and annual values of CAQIAV that differ based on the threshold used for data normalization: Unhealthy (level of alertness), Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (level of prevention), and National Standard thresholds. The analysis of the PM10 subindex (AQIsubPM10) and PM2.5 subindex (AQIsubPM2.5) was similarly performed monthly and annually. The results show that AQIsubPM10 performs better than AQIsubPM2.5 in annual and monthly terms, indicating that the pollution in the Aburr ' a Valley is mainly anthropogenic. Nevertheless, in the most critical months (February and March), government policies should not focus solely on restricting the mobility of private vehicles, since this mobile source only contributes 2.7% of the PM2.5 particles in the Aburr ' a Valley. Moreover, in these months, several natural phenomena hinder the dispersion of air pollutants due to the morphological and climatic conditions of the valley. In conclusion, this study recommends the implementation of a CAQIAV based on the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups threshold as it avoids putting the health of citizens at risk, especially for those belonging to sensitive groups. Likewise, several guidelines and solutions are proposed to configure a comprehensive sustainable development policy in the Aburr ' a Valley.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas that increasingly threatens environmental conditions and public health. In addition to conventional socio-economic mitigation measures, a healthy urban design can substantially contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, previous attempts only concentrated on the impacts of horizontal landscape pattern and spatial structure on CO2 emissions. The relationship between three-dimensional building structure and CO2 emissions remains to be explored. To fill this knowledge gap, our study analyzed which building indicators matter most to CO2 emissions in high-density areas. First, we discovered the linear relationships between CO2 emissions and various potential spatial drivers based on Pearson correlation test. Second, we examined whether the additional consideration of different building-related indicators can better explain the variation in CO2 emissions using random forest regression. These experiments indicated that building coverage ratio, mean building number, spatial congestion degree, and floor area ratio can exert substantial impacts on CO2 emissions in the study area. Building structure is a key factor affecting CO2 emission volumes. For example, our improved model yields a lower root relative squared error (32.53%) than the benchmark model (34.68%). This methodological framework, which can be easily applied to any other regions, is expected to provide valuable information for the reduction of CO2 emissions from the perspective of vertical urban planning. Policy-makers should carefully consider the impact of building structure on CO2 emissions at an earlier stage of the healthy urban design. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND The assessment of the environmental risks for pesticides is a current topic of the European Union (EU) strategy 'Farm to Fork'. Therefore, an analysis of the status quo of pesticide use from 2010 to 2015 and the associated environmental risks was performed for sugar beet cultivation in Germany. Based on this assessment, crop protection strategies should be developed that contribute to risk reduction.
   RESULTS Pesticide use data from 2314 randomly chosen sugar beet growing farms were available from annual farm surveys from 2010 until 2015. Possible environmental risks from pesticide applications were calculated with the model SYNOPS-GIS. Each pesticide application pattern was combined with several model fields. The concentrations of active ingredients in the non-target compartments, namely soil, neighboring surface waters and field margins, were used to determined risk indices (exposure toxicity ratios, ETRs) for different terrestrial and aquatic reference species. ETRs were mainly lower than a risk threshold used throughout this study (ETR = 1). The risks caused by herbicide use were studied in more detail since herbicides are applied on nearly all fields. The aquatic risks posed by herbicides were independent of specific active ingredients or application patterns. Instead, certain combinations of active ingredients, application dates and field-specific environmental conditions provoked higher risks. The aquatic risks were strongly influenced by the distance of the fields to surface waters.
   CONCLUSIONS Further risk mitigation seems possible by combining field-specific measures and technical options.

AB  - Soil health initiatives have categorized assays for enzyme activities (EAs) that measure p-nitrophenol and ester-linked fatty acid methyl ester (EL-FAME) as Tier 2 indicators for biological activity and community structure analysis, respectively. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays of functional and taxonomic communities are emerging Tier 3 indicators. To facilitate comparisons of soil biological health between research groups that may employ different methods, we applied these current and emerging indicators to semiarid soils from the Texas High Plains sampled in the growing season and postharvest from 2014 through 2018. Microbial groups via EL-FAME markers and EAs were strongly correlated (r > .79) with qPCR assays of equivalent taxonomic and functional genes. To further quantify the predictive power of these relationships, we modeled several genes as a function of EA or EL-FAME markers, combined with other related covariates (e.g., soil texture, pH, irrigation, and soil organic C [SOC]) using a generalized linear model. The latter was trained using data from 2014, which was an average year in terms of temperature and precipitation for the region. Subsequently, the model was tested making predictions for 2015-2018, which represented high variability in climatic conditions, ensuring a thorough assessment of its predictive power. In most cases, soil texture, SOC, and Tier 2 indicators were identified as moderate to strong predictors of the biological responses. Our results suggest that the different approaches for assessing either function or community in these semiarid soils were highly comparable and provided similar information on how microbial communities were responding to both management and climate.

KW  - Leakage management
AB  - The revision of the Drinking Water Directive (DWD), which the process of consultation by the European Parliament is coming to the end, includes a commitment for all Member States to assess the level of water leakage. The overarching aim of this action is to reduce water loss through leaks. In regard to this, use of performance indicators as suitable to enable assessment of water utility performance with regard to leakage reduction, including impacts on environment and cost-efficiency, is recommended. The paper provides results from water losses evaluation with the set of performance indicators (PI), considering dependence on the availability of resources and specific operating conditions. An analysis of different PI that are necessary to evaluate in most of leakage reduction methods was conducted considering step-by-step approach. Furthermore, the most relevant data for leakage analysis and management on a network level was determined. Presented PI can be used to improve leakage management of small water supply system. Similarly as in the Deming cycle, the described tool provides for planning activities, executing activities in accordance with the plan, checking the degree of execution of objectives included in the plan, and on the basis of conducted analyses and lessons learned, the so-called improvement. The results of the analysis lead to the conclusion that through a comprehensive, systematically improved strategy, the high effectiveness of the system could be reach. The reliable monitoring does not have to be based on advanced technological methods, which are often unavailable for small water supply system, due to high investment and operating costs. The results indicate that integrated IT systems, as SCADA, might not be directly beneficial to water loss management in small networks with moderate leakage levels.

AB  - Organic sulfur compounds, such as benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene, are present in crude oils, and specific isomers of these classes are known to be geochemical markers of maturity, lithology and biodegradation. Thus, knowledge of the individual concentrations of these target molecules enables us to characterize petroleum basins for better exploration. In this work, a simple and effective gas chromatography?triple quadrupole mass spectrometry method without preliminary fractionation was developed and validated for the determination of 14 organic sulfur compounds assumed to be geochemical markers for crude oils. The research was focused on the optimization of a highly selective GC-based analytical strategy using triple quadrupole MS in multiple reaction monitoring. Sample preparation was carried out by simple dilution in DCM. The method was validated, and the following parameters were expressed in terms of intraday precision: linearity, limit of detection, accuracy and precision. The limit of detection ranged from 0.005 ?g mL-1 (benzothiophene) to 0.159 ?g mL-1 (benzonaphthothiophene). Intraday assay precision was lower than 20% in all cases. Recoveries ranged from 78.2% (1,4dimethyldibenzothiophene) to 117% (2,4,7-trimethyldibenzothiophene). After validation, the procedure was successfully applied to the determination of S-markers in 8 crude oil samples, and the method was determined to be precise, accurate, and suitable. Diagnostic ratios based on benzothiophenes to dibenzothiphenes were applied as tools to evaluate maturity, biodegradation and depositional ambient conditions. A cross-plot of methyldibenzothiophene versus dimethyldibenzophene ratio was utilized to classify oils according to their maturity.

AB  - The new scientific school on the nature-like convergent mining technologies, which assume preventive negotiation of geomechanical consequences of mining-induced damage in the lithosphere, requires adjustment of the conventional modeling methods using the factor of time. In the framework of the main theories of similarity, the comparative studies of different model material composition are carried out, and the formula of solidifying mixtures is justified for equivalent materials for modeling joint loading of manmade and natural components of geotechnical systems. An original procedure is proposed for the construction of block models by means of gluing, such that the unit block sizes are determined in terms of sizes blocks generated by joint systems, and the number and location of gluing points are selected as function of condition of healed joints. The new procedure efficiency is checked by the method of calibration and comparison of the modeling data with the quantitative assessments of he real-10 rock masses. For different mining systems, the interpolating functions of the influence factor are plotted to image the rock mass stability categories. The new instrumentation is created for the integrated lest workbenches, which provides integrated patterns of strength, deformation and acoustic characteristics of physical models of the proposed convergent geotechnical systems, the obtained values of the strength and deformation charactaristics of the physical models made it possible to calibrated the relevant numerical models based on the retrospective analysis of deformation process evolution. It has been proved for the first time that the values of microstrains can be used as the indicators of the secondary stress field in the structure of anthropogenically altered subsoil as an independent object in the lithosphere.

AB  - The main Global Change factors with larger impacts on high mountain ecosystems include climate change, land use change and nitrogen (N) deposition. In Spain, phosphorus (P) deposition coming from Saharian dust has also an impact in these ecosystems. Atmospheric deposition of these compounds can have large effects on nutrient cycling and soil biota. Nematodes are a key group of such biota, since they occupy multiple positions in the soil food web, play key roles in the ecosystem and are good indicators of soil condition. For three years, we have simulated N and P deposition in four alpine and sub-alpine systems along an aridity gradient and analyzed their effects on soil nematode communities and microorganisms. Fungi and bacteria communities reduced their presence with aridity buy only fungi responded to N deposition. Nematode communities also reduced their abundances with aridity, while N deposition increased nematode biomass due to the increase in bacterivore nematodes, and P deposition increased the contribution of microbivores simplifying the soil food webs. Fungivore nematodes were less sensitive than bacterivores to stoichiometric unbalances, and, in general, communities in arid sites were characterized by a prevalence of the bacterivore decomposition channel and a lower relevance of belowground herbivory. Global Change factors such as the increases in aridity and atmospheric N deposition, together with the potential increase in the deposition of Saharian P, could have long-term effects on the composition and structure of the Spanish high mountain soil food webs and on the ecosystem functions they provide.

AB  - Technical systems used in adverse environments are subject to very intense degradation and their parts deterioration. Due to the problematic placement of some parts, it is sometimes very difficult, to indicate the level of degradation and possible failure occurrence. Therefore, it is very useful to work with the available field operation data. Since we possess such data and apply progressive methods to model the degradation, we are able to predict the possible failure occurrence and forecast residual useful life. At first, we apply spectral analysis approaches. The spectral analysis is used to capture extreme values in the data structure. The extreme values are later filtered out to avoid future estimations which might be affected by the deformed inputs. In the next step, we use non-parametric smoothing and state space models to acquire trend, variance and related statistics in the data structure. These characteristics are later used as input parameters for specific and new forms of diffusion processes. With these diffusion processes we would like to model the degradation evolvement and failure occurrence. The failure occurrence is represented as one of the statistics of the first passage time (FPT). FPT is a moment when the modelled trajectory hits the predefined threshold - such threshold represents a critical limit for our observation.
   The outcomes are useful for (i) degradation modelling, deterioration prediction and condition assessment, (ii) operation and maintenance planning and rationalisation, and (iii) life cycle cost optimisation and safety improvement. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pixels of clouds and cloud shadows in a remote sensing image impact image quality, image interpretation, and subsequent applications. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud removal method based on deep learning that automatically reconstructs the invalid pixels with the auxiliary information from multi-temporal images. Our method's innovation lies in its feature extraction and loss functions, which reside in a novel gated convolutional network (GCN) instead of a series of common convolutions. It takes the current cloudy image, a recent cloudless image, and the mask of clouds as input, without any requirements of external training samples, to realize a self-training process with clean pixels in the bi-temporal images as natural training samples. In our feature extraction, gated convolutional layers, for the first time, are introduced to discriminate cloudy pixels from clean pixels, which make up for a common convolution layer's lack of the ability to discriminate. Our multi-level constrained joint loss function, which consists of an image-level loss, a feature-level loss, and a total variation loss, can achieve local and global consistency both in shallow and deep levels of features. The total variation loss is introduced into the deep-learning-based cloud removal task for the first time to eliminate the color and texture discontinuity around cloud outlines needing repair. On the WHU cloud dataset with diverse land cover scenes and different imaging conditions, our experimental results demonstrated that our method consistently reconstructed the cloud and cloud shadow pixels in various remote sensing images and outperformed several mainstream deep-learning-based methods and a conventional method for every indicator by a large margin.

AB  - Calcretes and palustrine carbonates are two types of continental carbonates that contain significant environmental information and can be found in nearshore environments. In three stratigraphic sections studied in the coastal area of the Yucatan Peninsula and the island of Cozumel, multiple levels of calcretes and palustrine carbonates were identified. The presence of these continental carbonates combined with calcarenites suggests a transition from a shallow marine deposit to a continental environment for paleosol development. This research analyzes the geochemical (delta C-13 and delta O-18), mineralogical and micromorphological characteristics of the calcarenite, palustrine carbonate and calcretes to infer their paleoenvironmental formation conditions. The mineralogy of the samples consists entirely of aragonite and calcite. The micromorphology allowed us to identify alpha-calcretes and beta-calcretes, as well as palustrine carbonates such as peloidal and mottled limestones. The isotopic signature of Palustrine carbonate has an intermediate isotopic signature (delta C-13 mean value of - 5.24 parts per thousand, delta O-18 mean value of - 4.9 parts per thousand), falling between that of calcarenites and calcretes. The delta C-13 (ranging from -10.10 to - 7.50 parts per thousand) and delta O-18 ( - 5.63 to - 4.64 parts per thousand) values of all calcretes analyzed in this work are similar to the values reported for the Pleistocene and Holocene calcretes exposed in the Caribbean Sea region. Isotopic values of delta C-13 in the studied sections are interpreted as the result of a change in vegetation from a predominant C3 vegetation associated with a cool-wet climate to a C3/C4 mixed vegetation, which is a plant cover that grows in a drier-hotter climate.

AB  - An accurate battery model is essential for precise estimation of battery performance indicators, such as state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), etc. It helps in determining the optimum energy management and therefore, optimum utilization of the battery capacity. Some of the battery model parameters may change with the variation of environmental conditions, such as operating temperature, and therefore, accurate temperature compensated model estimation is necessary to minimize the error in battery model and SoC estimation. This article presents a novel parameters extraction method for the Thevenin equivalent circuit model of Li-ion batteries considering their resiliency on temperature effect. The proposed approach represents each of the RC parallel circuits of the Thevenin-based equivalent circuit battery model as a first-order linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The resistance and capacitance values for each of the RC circuits in the model have been identified as the parameters of a standard LTI system using the system identification theory and represented them as the temperature-compensated model parameters. The proposed model can be applied to various applications, such as SoC, SoH estimation, and battery energy management. In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed modeling approach, the model is augmented with the conventional extended Kalman filter to enable accurate SoC estimation under varying operating temperatures. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach and its suitability to enhance SoC estimation under a wide operating temperature range (-5 to 45 degrees C) have been validated through laboratory experiments in the LabVIEW platform.

AB  - The effects of food type, salinity and temperature on the growth performance and antioxidant status ofHippocampus reidijuveniles at 2.5 months old were evaluated in this study. Three trials were conducted for 56 days. Seahorses fed frozen mysid shrimp (MD) exhibited significantly higher survival, growth performance and feed efficiency compared with that of seahorses fed frozen adultArtemia(AD) or a mixture consisting of MD and AD at the ratio of 1:1 (MAD). Mortality of seahorse cultured at 30 degrees C reached 100% at 49 days. Despite no significant difference, the survival and growth performance of seahorses were higher at 26 than 28 degrees C. Seahorses had better growth performance at salinities of 15-20 ppt, but the survival and growth performance of seahorses were not significantly different among salinity groups. Seahorses fed MD or MAD had better antioxidant status based on the results of total phenolic content (TPC) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity in the MD and MAD groups, and significantly higher reducing power in MD than AD. No significant difference in all antioxidant indicators was recorded in 26 and 28 degrees C groups. TPC, DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power activity of seahorses were significantly higher at 15 and 20 ppt, and metal chelating activity of seahorses at 15 ppt was significantly higher than that of seahorses at higher salinities. Based on these results,H. reidijuvenile is recommended to be fed MD at a temperature of 26 degrees C and salinity of 15-20 ppt.

AB  - Improved ethanol production from rice straw, as well as its environmental and socio-economic effects, was studied and compared with fossil fuels. Alkaline, i.e., sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), pretreatments improved the ethanol yield at cold (0 degrees C), mild (25 degrees C), and hot (93 degrees C) pretreatment temperatures. Different substrate characteristics, including enzymatic saccharification, accessible surface area, chemical composition, buffering capacity, enzyme adsorption and desorption, and structural changes, were analyzed to determine the most influencing factors on ethanol yield. Both alkaline pretreatments led to the highest ethanol yields using the pretreatments at 93 degrees C followed by 0 degrees C. The maximum ethanol yield (85.1%) belonged to the sample pretreated with NaOH at 93 degrees C, corresponding to 150% increase compared with ethanol yield of the untreated straw (30.9%). Glucose yield from enzymatic hydrolysis and water swelling capacity were the only characteristics that showed similar trends to the obtained ethanol yield and also presented their optimum values, 84.1% and 5.5 g/g, respectively, at the conditions with the highest ethanol yield (NaOH, at 93 degrees C). Therefore, glucose yield and water swelling capacity were the factors with the closest correlation with ethanol yield. Environmental assessments estimated that the annual bioethanol production from untreated rice straw in Iran was 141 million L that could be increased up to 615 million L after pretreatment with NaOH at 93 degrees C. This amount can supply ethanol needs in Iran as E5 for 169 days in a year, which in turn reduces 888 kt of GHG emissions.

AB  - Here, a large-scale 3D physical similarity simulation experiment model is developed to understand the complex environment of the surrounding rock during the tunnel boring machine (TBM) construction at the auxiliary adit of the Laobawan Coal Mine. Monitoring multiple indicators including "sound-heat-light-electric" in the testing system in real time revealed the evolution characteristics of the surrounding rock supported by the adit segment. We found that the deformation of the surrounding rock follows different trends during different stages of TBM construction. The deformation of the surrounding rock and the expansion of the fissure can be divided into four stages during which the evolution of the deformation is nonhomogeneous, namely the initial, excavation stress rebalance, fissure growth, and fissure penetrating stages. A 1.3-m-diameter loose ring of surrounding rock is formed. The change in the microstrain of the segment can be divided into two stages. The first stage corresponds to the growing period while the second stage corresponds to a stabilizing period of the microstrain. Owing to the reorganization of the surrounding rock structure and stress reconstruction, a rapid microstrain increasing zone will occur in the growth stage, while rapid microstrain increasing and decreasing zones will occur in the stabilization stage. The segment stress gradually transforms from the inherent symmetric to an asymmetric characteristic. After the adit construction, the segment stress gradually transitions from the highly asymmetric state to a relatively uniform condition, while the magnitude of the stress significantly increases. These results will aid in environmentally TBM construction in the mining industry, understanding the deformation and damage characteristics of the surrounding rocks, and designing the segment support.

AB  - Context It is widely accepted that wildlife is subjected to detrimental human noise within urban landscapes but little is known about how the intensity of land use changes soundscapes. Objectives The objective of this research was to produce quantitative associations between characteristics of ambient soundscapes and land use intensity. These relations were used to examine the 2 kHz demarcation between anthrophony and biophony and compare the impact of different sized contributing areas on ambient soundscape characteristics. Methods This study related the surrounding land use intensity of 67 sites in north central Florida (USA) to several metrics describing their recorded soundscapes. Land use intensity was measured remotely at three scales using the landscape development intensity index (LDI). Results The analysis revealed that the LDI index had a statistically significant effect on soundscape characteristics after controlling for important factors such as climate, season, and attenuation due to hard ground. The trends between LDI and soundscape confirmed that human generated sounds are loud, continuous, and occupy low frequencies. The evenness of the sound distribution decreased with landscape intensity and LDI correlated significantly with sound below 3 kHz. Land use intensity within a 100 and 500-m radius contributing area were most closely related to soundscape metrics. Conclusions LDI is a tool with the potential to predict the extent and intensity of anthropogenic noise disturbance on wildlife from remote sensing data. The utility of this tool allows for widespread application to identify and mitigate conflicts in the acoustic realm between human noise and wildlife.

AB  - The adaptive capacity of individuals, from their cells to their overall performance, allows species to adjust to environmental change. We assess a hierarchy of responses (from cells to organismal growth and behaviour) to understand the flexibility of adaptive responses to future ocean conditions (warming and acidification) in two species of fish with short lifespans by conducting a long-term mesocosin/aquarium experiment. Fishes were exposed to elevated CO2 and temperature in a factorial design for a five-month period. We found a feedback mechanism between cellular defence and behavioural responses. In circumstances where their antioxidant defence mechanism was activated (i.e. warming or acidification), increased feeding rates prevented oxidative damage (i.e. during warming Sp. 1). However, when feeding rates failed to increase to provide additional energy needed for antioxidant defence, oxidative damage could not be prevented (warming + acidification Sp. 1). In contrast, when the activation of antioxidant defence was not required, energy intake from increased feeding was redirected to increased fish growth (acidification Sp. 2, warming + acidification Sp. 2), whilst no gain in growth rate was observed where feeding remained unchanged (acidification Sp. 1 or warming Sp. 2). This adaptive strategy seems to rely on the inherent behavioural response of fishes to their environment and such adjustability shows the kind of responses that organisms may express to prevail in future ocean climate. Indeed, assessing the link between responses from cellular to organismal levels, using a diversity of fitness indicators and behaviour, provides a fundamental understanding of how organisms as a whole may adjust to prevail in a future world.

AB  - The conventional prolonged parboiling process results in high operation cost and grain darkening, which may limit consumption. Moreover, residue generation by rice industries is another challenge. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of microwave irradiation during soaking and gelatinization stages of parboiling rice. Processing time, colorimetric profile, broken and nongelatinized grains, sucrose and glucose content, free 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural, and residual phosphorus were evaluated. As the soaking and gelatinization times during microwave treatments increased, the colorimetric parameters increased; however, the values were lower than those with the conventional process. Regardless of soaking time, a decrease in broken and nongelatinized grains was obtained by using the lowest steaming time (5 min). Additionally, lower residual phosphorus content was found in soaking water (10 and 20 min) when using microwave irradiation. Under favorable conditions, a reduction in the levels of broken and nongelatinized grains, residual phosphorus, and color changes was observed, indicating that microwave irradiation may be more beneficial than conventional parboiling. Practical Application Parboiling requires a high volume of water and soaking time, which leads to high costs, underutilization of infrastructures, and high residue in the water after processing. The rapid parboiling process involves the use of microwaves during the soaking and gelatinization stages. The main advantages of the microwave parboiling process include reduced processing time, ranging from 83% to 95%, higher gelatinization, greater yield, reduced darkening, and reduced residual phosphorus in the effluents by 60%.

AB  - Low-flow events can cause significant impacts to river ecosystems and water-use sectors; as such, it is important to understand their variability and drivers. In this study, we characterise the variability and timing of annual total frequency of low-streamflow days across a range of headwater streams within the continental United States. To quantify this, we use a metric that counts the annual number of low-flow days below a given threshold, defined as the cumulative dry days occurrence (CDO). First, we identify three large clusters of stream gauge locations using a Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) clustering algorithm. In terms of timing, results reveal that for most clusters, the majority of low-streamflow days occur from the middle of summer until early fall, although several locations in Central and Western United States also experience low-flow days in cold seasons. Further, we aim to identify the regional climate and larger scale drivers for these low-streamflow days. Regionally, we find that precipitation deficits largely associate with low-streamflow days in the Western United States, whereas within the Central and Eastern U.S. clusters, high temperature indicators are also linked to low-streamflow days. In terms of larger scale, we examine sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, finding that extreme dry years exhibit a high degree of co-occurrence with different patterns of warmer SST anomalies across the Pacific and Northern Atlantic Oceans. The linkages identified with regional climate and SSTs offer promise towards regional prediction of changing conditions of low-streamflow events.

AB  - The monitoring of meteorological drought is critically important for tropical and subtropical water-limited ecosystems, which play key roles in the global carbon cycle and ecosystem services. Satellite remote sensing is the only practical approach for tracking drought changes with high resolution and an instantaneous response. However, the application of remote sensing drought indices derived from optical and infrared bands has been constrained due to cloud contamination. Here the Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI), a multi-sensor microwave remote sensing drought index integrating state-of-the-art multiple satellite microwave-derived precipitation, soil moisture and land surface temperature information, was processed to improve the meteorological drought monitoring capability of satellite remote sensing. The index was evaluated against the 1 to 12 month field-based drought indicators Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapo-transpiration Index (SPEI) and anomalies in the satellite-derived Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from 1998 to 2014. MIDI with an optimal ensemble of multiple satellite precipitation products showed a better improvement in meteorological drought monitoring capability than MIDI based on an individual satellite precipitation dataset, and had statistically strong correlation in particular with 1 month SPI/SPEI over a wide range of bio-climatic zones spanning from arid to humid. Moreover it showed significantly higher correlations with EVI anomalies than SPI/SPEI. The results demonstrated the reliability and superiority of MIDI in monitoring meteorological drought with the ability to work in all weather conditions. Therefore, MIDI provides a gateway to employing satellite microwave remote sensing for reliable meteorological drought monitoring, with the potential for long-term drought assessments as well as near-real-time drought monitoring using operational satellites.

AB  - As human population increases worldwide, water quality will become increasingly problematic, and food consumed raw may be of higher risk. This is already evident for oysters grown in coastal areas - despite regulations based on bacterial indicators, oysters are still implicated in food-borne outbreaks worldwide. The pathogens most frequently detected are human noroviruses, which are shed at high concentrations in human excreta and are very resistant to environmental conditions. Sewage treatment plants usually apply a variety of steps such as activated sludge treatment, chlorine or UV disinfection to eliminate contaminants, these processes have variable efficacy. This study demonstrates the impact of replacing an old lagoon-based sewage treatment plant with a new membrane bioreactor sewage treatment plant on human norovirus levels in treated sewage and oysters. While comparable norovirus concentrations were detected in the influent samples, a clear difference was observed in effluent quality, as norovirus was only detected in one sample after treatment in the new membrane bioreactor system, confirming the efficiency of such technology. As a direct impact, oysters located close to the membrane bioreactor sewage outfall were less frequently contaminated by norovirus, and showed lower concentrations compared to the first period of the study when they were exposed to sewage effluent from the lagoon outfall. Shellfish located upstream showed comparable contamination levels suggesting that there are also other sources of norovirus contamination in the estuary. Considering the health benefits of shellfish consumption, improving wastewater quality will make an important contribution to enhancing the safety of shellfish and international food security.

AB  - Emissions of polluted air in East Asia have gradually decreased over the last decade. Those air pollutants have been transported over long distances and influenced new particle formation (NPF) in the downstream region. We obtained 5-year data of the mobility size distribution and SO2 and particulate (PM2.5) emissions on Fukue Island (32.75 degrees N, 128.68 degrees E), Japan. Frequent NPF events in the 2013 campaign were observed around 60% under the transboundary transport of polluted air by northwesterly wind. In contrast to the data obtained in the last 2-year campaign (2016-2017), these NPF events (<25%) may reflect a relatively clean environment. The daily average SO2 and PM2.5 concentrations over the campaign periods are 2.3 +/- 2.2ppb and 17.6 +/- 8.5 mu gm(-3) (February 23 to March 7, 2013), 1.3 +/- 0.9ppb and 13.8 +/- 4.7 mu gm(-3) (February 27 to March 18, 2015), 0.8 +/- 0.5ppb and 14.7 +/- 5.3 mu gm(-3) (February 27 to March 25, 2016), and 0.5 +/- 0.5ppb and 12.1 +/- 4.6 mu gm(-3) (January 28 to April 19, 2017), respectively. These reductions of emissions may be due to the measures implemented by the local government in the source region to handle the adverse impacts of environmental pollution. The latest condition of atmospheric nanoparticles on Fukue Island can be used as an indicator to determine the concentration levels of regional air pollutants in East Asia.

AB  - The planning and operation of multi-generation units needs to be properly addressed, to guarantee a correct assessment of their performance with respect to standard energy generation units. Performance indicators are defined to compare energy conversion units, and in presence of multiple outputs an allocation methodology is required. There is currently no single method to allocate input resources and impacts in cogeneration and multigeneration systems, as the number of aspects that are involved leads to different approaches. Each method provides specific advantages related to the target for which it has been defined, but attention must be paid on the entire range of boundary conditions that could affect the results. This paper evaluates the current methodologies for allocation factors calculation in Combined Heat and Power plants, to present an indication of the strengths and the limits of each approach. The methods are applied to multiple case studies, by considering the operation data from existing natural gas plants of different size, technology and conversion efficiency. The use of real data allows to consider actual situations in which the choice of the method could lead to different indications. The results show the significant variability of the allocation factors, the main drivers being the choice of the methodology itself, the conversion technology and the reference efficiency values that are set for separate production of heat and power. A discussion is proposed on the importance of defining proper methods and reference parameters, with particular attention to the applications for which the allocation factors need to be calculated and the potential effects on energy policies and regulations.

AB  - The occurrence of specific micropollutants (MPs), indicators of domestic and hospital wastewater, was investigated in a river connected to a karst spring based on two sampling campaigns under varying flow conditions. The MPs characterized by a high frequency of occurrence (acesulfame-K, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, nonylphenol, and iohexol) were highly reflective of wastewater discharged in ephemeral streams and tributaries, as well as specific point sources such as farms and hospital effluents. A mixing model based on chloride mass fluxes allows the quantification of the percentage of untreated wastewater effluents in inflowing water from river tributaries, which varied between 0.7-99% and 5.0-10% in low flow and high flow, respectively. The frequency of occurrence of MPs is related to the volume of wastewater input, extent of river dilution, persistence of the MPs, and type of point source contamination on the river. Relationships were established between MPs such as ibuprofen and acesulfame-K (ACE-K), indicating their co-existence in highly consumed generic medicine and their suitability as wastewater co-tracers. Additionally, the number of consumers of gemfibrozil (GEM) and acesulfame-K were estimated based on mass loads in the river tributaries for management purposes. Groundwater contamination is mostly due to diffuse and point sources infiltration occurring on the spring catchment, including the sinking stream that could contribute up to 17% to the mass loads of some micropollutants (e.g., ACE-K and GEM) at the spring. Nevertheless, the increase of MPs use with growing urbanization is expected to have a much significant impact on the groundwater quality in the future.

AB  - The interest in using remote sensing data in agriculture, including plant disease assessments, has increased considerably in the last years. The satellite-based Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) sensor has been launched recently for multispectral vegetation condition assessment for agricultural and ecosystem applications. The aim of this pilot study conducted in the greenhouse using a hand-held spectroradiometer was to assess the utility of the same wavebands as used in the Sentinel-2 MSI in assessing and modeling coffee leaf rust (CLR) based on the non-linear radial basis function-partial least squares regression (RBF-PLS) machine learning algorithm, compared with ordinary partial least squared regression (PLSR). The RBF-PLS derived models satisfactorily described CLR severity (R-2=0.92 and RMSE=6.1% with all bands and R-2=0.78 and RMSE=10.2% with selected bands) when compared with PLSR (R-2 = 0.27 and RMSE = 18.7% with all bands and R-2 = 0.17 and RMSE = 19.8% with selected bands). Specifically, four bands, B2 (490 nm), B4 (665 nm), B5 (705 nm) and B7 (783 nm) were identified as the most important spectral bands in assessing and modeling CLR severity. Better accuracy was obtained for most severe levels of CLR (R-2=0.71 using all variables) than for moderate levels (R-2=0.38 using all variables). Overall, the findings of this study showed that the use of RBF-PLS and the four Sentinel-2 MSI bands could enhance CLR severity estimation at the leaf level. Further work will be needed to extrapolate these findings to the crop level using the Sentinel-2 platform.

AB  - The paper discusses a problem of result interpretation for odorants dispersion modeling. The most common mistakes were brought to attention when assessing the impact of odor nuisance caused by installations on the environment. Differences were indicated between odor dispersion modeling and the reference methodology for modeling of an individual substance air level (acc. to the Regulation of the Minister of Environment from 2010). Four approaches to present and interpret the results of model calculations were discussed, including annual frequency of certain odor levels and their maximum concentrations, which enable practical conclusions to be drawn. The method to estimate odor nuisance caused by an installation against the selected air quality standards was presented, including the reference values set out in the draft bills for the Polish Act on Counteracting Odor Nuisance and the European Horizontal Guidance for Odour (IPPC H4). The difference between the environmental odor detection and recognition threshold and the threshold concentrations determined under the laboratory conditions was explained. The forecasting method for odor frequency occurrence in the designated area was demonstrated as well as the annual number of hours the odor will be detectable at recognizable level. The way to forecast odor occurrence of certain intensity was demonstrated, including how to convert its concentration to intensity according to the psychophysical laws of Weber-Fechner and Stevens. In addition, application of modeling results of pollutant dispersion in the atmosphere was demonstrated in assessment of odors that may occur in the worst meteorological and technological circumstances. The examples discussed could be employed in modeling of potentially high impact installations as well as in development of environmental impact assessments of projects or air quality forecasts.

AB  - The paper presents slaughterhouse wastewater treatment implemented as a combination of thermal pre-treatment and main electrochemical treatment, with a simultaneous ozonation. The efficiency of the characteristic indicator removal and the quantity of generated sludge according to electrode types (stainless steel, iron and aluminium), treatment time (5-30 minutes) and amperage (50-100 A) was tested. The wastewater is characterized by a very unpleasant odour, high colouring value (17400 CoPt), turbidity (4230 NTU), total suspended solids (1730 mg dm(-3)), chemical oxygen demand (3720 mg dm(-3)) and biochemical oxygen demand (1870 mg dm(-3)) as well as increased values of ammonium (128 mg dm(-3)) and phosphates (93 mg dm(-3)). Thermal pre-treatment removed 98.23% turbidity, 89.94% colour, 75.14% total suspended solids (TSS), 49.73% BOD5 and 36.29% COD. A stainless steel electrode set proved to be the most efficient in the removal of organic indicators and ammonium and the lowest sludge volume, whereas aluminium electrodes were the most efficient in colour removal, although with the highest sludge production. The best results were achieved by a combination of all three electrode types, with a simultaneous ozonation of 20-minute contact time, amperage of 70 A and voltage of 10 V. Following the electrocoagulation / electrooxidation by stainless steel electrodes, electrocoagulation / ozonation by iron electrodes and electrocoagulation / ozonation with aluminium electrodes and the final ozonation, 100% colour, turbidity and TSS were removed as well as 99.77% COD and 99.25% BOD5, 99.98% phosphates, 99.80% ammonium and 43.86% total dissolved solids. All measured indicators complied with the conditions for discharge into the environment.

AB  - This work aims at describing a simulation model that studies the influence of the cell string layout on the performance of solar panels taking into account the environmental conditions. Several solar cell string configurations in the photovoltaic modules are simulated using a simulation program for integrated circuits, looking for a mitigation of the effects of shading and/or non-uniform illumination of the solar panel. The simulation model is validated using data provided by Solarus,1 as well as results obtained experimentally in Sweden concerning outdoor tests or using a lab solar simulator with similar collectors. The model is simple and flexible enough to be easily matched to various string layout configurations and, unlike several maximum power point tracking procedures, it allows the correct assessment of the maximum power in situations presenting multiple maxima in the power versus voltage stationary characteristic of the solar panel. The simulated and experimental average electrical efficiency in December in Gavle (Sweden) for flat collectors manufactured by Solarus with strings of 38 solar cells connected in series is around 20%. Modifications in the solar modules currently manufactured in Solarus are proposed, together with the identification of the contexts in which they represent a reasonable added value. Examples of module configurations with overlapped bypass diodes show an increase of almost 100% in the short circuit current. The methodology used in this work for the design of the solar cell configuration is a valid contribution to the analysis of stationary roof/ground grid-tied or off-grid small installations and it represents undoubtedly an important tool for the enterprises in the manufacturing process.

AB  - A new supported catalyst composed of a nanostructured TiO2 film deposited on a stainless steel mesh (nanoTiO(2)-SS) using the Metal Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition (MOCVD) technique was evaluated for the photocatalytic degradation of a mixture of contaminants of emerging concern. Results showed that under the oxidative conditions tested, the nanoTiO(2)-SS catalyst demonstrated an efficiency in degrading the target contaminants higher than that observed under direct photolysis and photocatalysis using the conventional TiO2 Degussa P25 catalyst at the same amount of TiO2 participating to the photo catalysis. Specifically, the rate of removal of warfarin and trimethoprim obtained with the new catalyst was found twice the one observed by using TiO2 Degussa P25 and approximately 1.6 times faster for metoprolol, carbamazepine and gemfibrozil. An evaluation of the electrical energy per order magnitude of removal (EE/O) confirmed the enhanced performance of the new catalyst (24.3-31.8 kWh m(-3) rather than 32.8-39.3 kWh m(-3) for conventional TiO2 and that the performance is compound-dependent. Toxicity testing revealed that some assays are suitable for the investigation of bioactivity of treated waters containing contaminants of emerging concern at mu g L-1 level. Specifically, the AMES Fluctuation Test, Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test and Green alga Selenastrum capricornutum test provided valuable results for an environmental impact assessment. On the other hand, the Daphnia magna and Vibrio fischeri acute toxicity tests were not sensitive enough to detect bioactivity in the samples analysed without prior pre-concentration.

AB  - Scarce water resources mainly in arid and semi-arid areas have caused an increasing interest for applying irrigation protocols aiming to reduce water spends. The effects of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) on the performance of apricot trees (Prunus armeniaca L. cv. "Bulida") were assessed in Murcia (SE Spain), during three consecutive growing seasons (2008-2010). The hypothesis was that RDI would not restrict yield but increase fruit quality while saving water. Two irrigation treatments were established: i) control, irrigated to fully satisfy crop water requirements (100% ETc) and ii) RDI, that reduced the amount of applied water to: a) 40% of ETc at flowering and stage I of fruit growth; b) 60% of ETc during the stage II of fruit growth and c) 50% and 25% of ETc during the late postharvest period (from 60 days after harvest). Stem water potential, gas exchanges, trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA), fruit diameter, yield and fruit quality traits were determined. Vegetative growth was decreased by the use of RDI (12% less TCSA on average for the three years), whereas yield was unaffected. In addition, some qualitative characteristics of the fruits, such as the level of soluble solids, sweetness/acidity relation and fruit colour, were improved by the use of RDI. These results and average water savings of approximately 30%, lead us to conclude that RDI strategies are a possible solution for irrigation management in areas with water shortages, such as arid and semi-arid environments.

AB  - The National Environment Council (CONAMA Resolution 375/06) defined to achieve sanitation quality parameters, for the use of sewage sludge in agriculture, the adoption of additional pathogen reduction processes is necessary. Sludge that is stored for longer periods generally shows higher levels of sanitation, particularly on the helminth egg inactivations which are among the most resistant pathogens. The objective of this study was to monitor the Ascaris egg removal and inactivation efficiency of long-term storage of sludge from septic tanks and up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors, besides evaluating the influence of covering and manually revolving or stirring the sludge over a 2-year period. The study was undertaken in the cities of Fazenda Rio Grande and Apucarana, Southern Brazil. In total, 18 experimental treatments were installed and nine samples were assessed at weeks 0, 4, 9, 13, 17, 30, 47, 61, and 104. The standard defined in the CONAMA for class A sludge (one viable egg per 4 g TS) was reached for all treatments at 9 weeks of storage. Two years of storage were necessary in order for the covered, UASB-centrifuge sludge to reach CONAMA standards. Of the six treatments using septic sludge, only one achieved the established standard. This treatment was realized in Apucarana and involved a revolving/stirring process. The period of 104 weeks of storage of the septic sludge was not sufficient to completely inactivate Ascaris eggs for the other treatments. Between study locations, Apucarana performed better than Curitiba which is likely due to greater levels of insolation and temperature.

AB  - Altitudinal gradients are an excellent study tool to help understand the mechanisms shaping community assembly. We established a series of altitudinal gradients along the east coast of Australia to describe how the distribution of a hyper-diverse herbivore group (night-flying Lepidoptera) changes across an environmental gradient in subtropical and tropical rainforests. Two transects were in subtropical rainforest in the same bioregion, one in south-east Queensland (28.7 degrees S) and one in north east New South Wales (29.7 degrees S). Two were in tropical rainforest, one in mid-east Queensland (21.1 degrees S) and one in the Wet Tropics of northern Queensland (17.5 degrees S). Replicate plots were established in altitudinal bands separated by 200m. Canopy and understorey moths were sampled at the beginning and end of the wet season using automatic Pennsylvania light traps. We sorted a total of 93400 individuals, belonging to 3035 species. The two subtropical transects in the same region showed similar patterns of turnover across altitude, with the most distinctive assemblage occurring at the highest altitude. Moth assemblages in the tropical transects tended to show distinct lowland' and upland' communities. For species that were common across several of the transects, many were found at lower altitudes in the subtropics and higher altitudes in the tropics, suggesting they are sensitive to environmental conditions, and track their physiological envelopes across latitudes. These results suggest ubiquitous altitudinal stratification in tropical and subtropical Australian rainforests. The marked response of species to latitude and altitude demonstrates they are sensitive to climatic variables and can be used as indicators to understand future community responses to climate change.

AB  - It is important to develop research methods that will detect deterioration in population health before severe declines occur. Amphibian population declines are widespread; the main causes are anthropogenic and include habitat fragmentation due to agriculture, mining, fires, and urban development. Brazil is the richest country in species of amphibians, and the Brazilian regions with the greatest amphibian diversity are experiencing relatively high rates of habitat destruction. We tested the use of measurements of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) taken on adult frogs, as well as heterozygosity estimates in frog populations, to detect anthropogenic stress. We hypothesized that greater human occupancy in the landscape might result in more stressful conditions for amphibians, which would be reflected in high FA levels and/or reduced heterozygosity. We conducted this study at the Espinhaco mountain range in southeastern Brazil, using an endemic species (Bokermannohyla saxicola, Hylidae) as a model. We found that adult frog FA levels differed among localities but did not find significant correlations between human modification of the landscape and FA levels. In the subsample of localities for which we had genetic data, heterozygosity was significantly inversely correlated with FA in adult frogs, and heterozygosity decreased with increasing human occupancy in the landscape, except for populations with marginal distribution within the species range that already had very low heterozygosity. Our major finding was that reduced heterozygosity may be caused by population isolation resulting from human occupancy (among other causes) and is correlated with increased fluctuating asymmetry, so that either may indicate higher levels of stress in populations of B. saxicola.

AB  - Presented work addresses the development and application of artificial olfactory (e-nose) as an efficient nondestructive handheld system to extract quality attributes of variety of orange cultivars at various cultivated lands. An ARM-9 (S3C2440 controller) based advance embedded electronic nose system has been developed for on-site odor acquisition, processing and ripeness level prediction for various orange cultivars. Developed handheld electronic nose system is light weight, low power, and easy operable to every consumer. Various statistical multivariate data analysis techniques (PCA, LDA, QDA, and KNN) implementation on electronic nose measurements helped estimating optimal harvest dates for various orange cultivars. Developed handy system has been optimized in the sense of selectivity, sensitivity of gas sensors using the implementation of temperature control for heating element of the gas sensors. Various temperature, humidity models also have been developed to improve the performance of developed system in different environmental conditions. Data acquisition process has been performed using developed system for 100 orange samples have two different cultivars (mandarin and sweet orange). Extracted parameters have been subjected towards supervised Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation algorithm to training and testing of developed handheld electronic nose system to predict quality parameters of oranges. A good correlation has been found between developed handheld electronic nose system signals and quality attributes indicators and it shows that system can successfully detect and predict various quality parameters of orange samples. Results of developed handheld electronic nose system have been validated with commercial standard electronic nose Alpha Fox 3000 system and it has been observed that efficiency varies around 94 +/- 0.3 %.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) and soil moisture are the most important factors controlling yield in Colombian coffee crops. Since long-term productivity is contingent on robust early growth, it is imperative to study these factors in seedlings in order to ensure maximum yield potential of mature trees. A greenhouse experiment with four soil water and four N levels was used to determine how these two important variables affect quantifiable parameters representing seedling performance. Shoot biomass, the most obvious indicator of performance, was increased by both higher soil moisture and higher N application, although root biomass increased with N application only in wetter soils and in general the root to shoot ratio diminished with increasing N application. Like shoot biomass, leaf N content and N derived from fertilizer (Ndff) also increased with increasing N application, with relatively more leaf N recovered from fertilizer as soil moisture increased. Evapotranspiration (EVPT) responded to soil moisture, whereas water use efficiency, in terms of shoot mass produced per unit of evapotranspired water, responded dramatically to N level but was not affected by soil moisture. The strong effect of N application on water use efficiency was affirmed by the higher C-13/C-12 ratios and stem water potentials of plants grown under higher N levels, indicating greater water stress in these plants. All of these responses were associated with changes in photosynthesis as a result of acclimation to the imposed conditions. Consideration of these results will facilitate new recommendations for maximizing growth of coffee seedlings by increasing water and N use efficiency while reducing the economic and environmental impacts attributed to N fertilizers.

AB  - Final product of waste biostabilization process is stabilized organic fraction. It is a solid waste, after biological process, which perform requirements of actual law regulation (Dz.U. z 2012, poz. 1052). To determine stabilization of waste degree (in practice decomposition of organic matter degree), used indicator which define biological activity.
   The Polish regulations adopted that one of the parameters indicating the degree of stabilization of waste, is the respiration activity index AT4.
   Oxygen consumption during organic matter decomposition process, could have 0-order or 1st-orderreaction character. Suitable fit of the model to react is crucial, to correctly determine the kinetic parameters of the reaction. For this reason, experiments, which purposes were to: examine the relevance of two mathematical models, to the oxygen consumption curves, for waste samples that are in various stages of the biostabilization process, and to propose a model of the highest utility, were performed. The study was conducted on an industrial scale, in operating conditions biostabilization plant, where biostimulator was used to reduce odors. Two variants, first using waste with biostimulator and second without biostimulator were tested. During the biostabilization process, samples were collected in weekly intervals. Samples of waste were transported to the laboratory, where respiratory activity was measured.
   Research has shown that independently of the duration of the process, and the inoculation or without -inoculation of biostimulator, the best fitting model which describes the kinetics of oxygen consumption is the first order reaction model. It was also shown that the addition of biostimulator increase respiration activity of waste during first 3 weeks of biostabilization process.

AB  - Regularly managed electric power line corridors may provide habitats for both early-successional grassland plant species and disturbance-dependent alien plant species. These habitats are especially important in urban areas, where they can help conserve native grassland species and communities in urban greenspace. However, they can also provide further footholds for potentially invasive alien species that already characterize urban areas. In order to implement power line corridors into urban conservation, it is important to understand which environmental conditions in the corridors favor grassland species and which alien species. Likewise it is important to know whether similar environmental factors in the corridors control the species composition of the two groups. We conducted a vegetation study in a 43 kilometer long urban power line corridor network in south-western Finland, and used generalized linear models and distance-based redundancy analysis to determine which environmental factors best predict the occurrence and composition of grassland and alien plant species in the corridors. The results imply that old corridors on dry soils and steep slopes characterized by a history as open areas and pastures are especially suitable for grassland species. Corridors suitable for alien species, in turn, are characterized by productive soils and abundant light and are surrounded by a dense urban fabric. Factors controlling species composition in the two groups are somewhat correlated, with the most important factors including light abundance, soil moisture, soil calcium concentration and soil productivity. The results have implications for grassland conservation and invasive alien species control in urban areas.

AB  - Forage is among the essential ecosystem services provided by tropical savannas. Expected changes in climate and land use may cause a strong decline in herbaceous forage provision and thus make it advisable to monitor its dynamics. Spectroscopy offers promising tools for fast and non-destructive estimations of forage variables, yet suffers from unfavourable measurement conditions during the tropical growing period such as frequent cloud cover and high humidity. This study aims to test whether spatio-temporal information on the quality (metabolisable energy content, ME) and quantity (green biomass, BM) of West African forage resources can be correlated to in situ measured reflectance data. We could establish robust and independent models via partial least squares regression, when spectra were preprocessed using second derivative transformation (ME: max. adjusted R-2 in validation (adiR(VAL)(2))= 0.83, min. normalised root mean square error (nRMSE)= 7.3%; BM: max.adiR(VAL)(2) = 0.75, min. nRMSE = 9.4%). Reflectance data with a reduced spectral range (350-1075 nm) still rendered satisfactory accuracy. Our results confirm that a strong correlation between forage characteristics and reflectance of tropical savanna vegetation can be found. For the first time in field spectroscopy studies, forage quality is modelled as ME content based on 24-h in vitro gas production in the Hohenheim gas test system and crude protein concentration of BM. Established spectral models could help to monitor forage provision in space and time, which is of great importance for an adaptive livestock management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Post-anthesis high temperature stress is a major concern for the winter wheat producing areas in east China, especially in Shandong province. Fourteen agronomic and physiological traits were studied in 58 Chinese wheat accessions under high-temperature conditions in 2012 and 2013. High temperature stress led to reduction in grain yield and other yield component traits. Significant variations were observed for grain yield per plant (GYPP), grain weight per spike (GWS), thousand kernel weight (TKW), grain number of the main-spike, spikelet number and biological yield per plant. Among the physiological traits measured, chlorophyll content and normalized difference vegetation index showed significant variation under high temperature stress. The results indicate that heat susceptibility index estimated for TKW, GYPP, GWS and flag leaf senescence scale (FLSS) could be used as selection criteria for identifying heat tolerant genotypes for the Shandong province. The results also suggest that FLSS is a good, quick visual indicator of staygreen for field selection for heat tolerance. After harvest, TKW can be measured as final indicator of heat tolerance. The varieties Gaoyou 9415, Hemai 13, Jimai 22, Kexin 9, Shannong 8355, Taishan 23, Yannong 5286 and Zimai 7 were heat tolerant and potential germplasm for heat tolerance breeding in Shandong province and other parts of China. The results could be useful for breeding climate resilient varieties for China or other countries in the world suffering high temperature stresses during grain filling period.

AB  - Studies on the effects of inorganic nutrients manipulation (specially nitrogen and phosphorus) in freshwater macroalgae are scarce. Physiological responses (growth, photosynthesis, and pigment contents) to nitrogen and phosphorus impoverishment (nitrate and phosphates, respectively) were analyzed under culture conditions in two populations of Compsopogon caeruleus coming from environments with distinct levels of saprobity (oligosaprobic and mesosaprobic, designated isolates o and m, respectively). The aim was to evaluate the isolate responses (decrease or increase in physiological performance) to decrease in inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Three dilutions in original concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus of Bold Basic Medium were tested. For the nitrogen treatments, the isolate m had a more pronounced decrease in general performance in comparison to isolate o: lower values of effective quantum yield and phycobiliprotein concentrations in all nitrogen dilutions. Phycobiliprotein degradation is a typical and widely reported response of red algae under nitrogen scarcity. For the phosphorus experiments, the isolate o showed a more pronounced decrease in general performance in comparison to isolate m: lower values of maximum photosynthetic rate (P-max) and photosynthetic efficiency (a), besides lower phycobiliprotein concentrations in all dilutions. The best performance of C. caeruleus was found at higher nutrient concentrations, confirming previous records as a good bioindicator of enriched environments. Nevertheless, the two populations differed in the mode that they use these resources, thus suggesting a possible phenotypic difference between them. Physiological responses of these isolates to nitrogen and phosphorus impoverishment seem to be more related to the type of limiting nutrient than to saprobity.

AB  - Individual variation in the response to environmental challenges depends partly on innate reaction norms, partly on experience-based cognitive/emotional evaluations that individuals make of the situation. The goal of this study was to investigate whether pre-existing differences in behaviour predict the outcome of such assessment of environmental cues, using a conditioned place preference/avoidance (CPP/CPA) paradigm. A comparative vertebrate model (European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax) was used, and ninety juvenile individuals were initially screened for behavioural reactivity using a net restraining test. Thereafter each individual was tested in a choice tank using net chasing as aversive stimulus or exposure to familiar conspecifics as appetitive stimulus in the preferred or non preferred side respectively (called hereafter stimulation side). Locomotor behaviour (i.e. time spent, distance travelled and swimming speed in each tank side) of each individual was recorded and analysed with video software. The results showed that fish which were previously exposed to appetitive stimulus increased significantly the time spent on the stimulation side, while aversive stimulus led to a strong decrease in time spent on the stimulation side. Moreover, this study showed clearly that proactive fish were characterised by a stronger preference for the social stimulus and when placed in a putative aversive environment showed a lower physiological stress responses than reactive fish. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time in sea bass, that the CPP/CPA paradigm can be used to assess the valence (positive vs. negative) that fish attribute to different stimuli and that individual behavioural traits is predictive of how stimuli are perceived and thus of the magnitude of preference or avoidance behaviour.

AB  - Biofilters, designed to facilitate the infiltration of stormwater into soil, are generally ineffective in removing bacteria from stormwater, thereby causing pollution of groundwater and receiving surface waters. The bacterial removal capacity of biofilters has been shown to be lower in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) and during intermittent infiltration of stormwater. To improve the removal of fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli) under these conditions, we amended sand with 5% (by weight) biochar, a carbonaceous geomedia produced by pyrolysis of biomass, and investigated the removal and remobilization of E. coli. Three types of biochar were used to evaluate the role of biochar properties on the removal. Compared to sand, biochar not only retained up to 3 orders of magnitude more E. coli, but also prevented their mobilization during successive intermittent flows. In the presence of NOM, the removal capacity of biochar was lower, but remained higher than sand alone. The improved retention with the biochar amendment is attributed to an increase in the attachment of E. coli at the primary minimum and to an increase in the water-holding capacity of biochar-amended sand, which renders driving forces such as moving air water interfaces less effective in detaching bacteria from grain surfaces. Biochars with lower volatile matter and polarity appear to be more effective in removing bacteria from stormwater. Overall, our results suggest that a biochar amendment to biofilter media has the potential to effectively remove bacteria from stormwater. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land use has an important role influencing stream ecosystem processes, such as leaf litter breakdown. Here, we assessed rates of leaf litter breakdown in low-order tropical streams draining forest, agriculture, and urban land uses in Puerto Rico. To measure leaf breakdown rates, we placed litter bags made of coarse mesh in nine streams, three for each land use type. At each stream, we measured changes in leaf mass over time, leaf breakdown rates, macroinvertebrate assemblages, and stream physicochemistry. Streams differed in their water physicochemistry, with urban streams showing high values for most variables. Stream physical habitat was evaluated using a visual assessment protocol, which indicated that agricultural and urban streams were more degraded than forested streams. Leaf breakdown rates were fast in all streams (k values ranging 0.006-0.024). Breakdown rates were significantly related to the physical conditions of the stream channel (e.g., visual protocol scores), with fastest rates in forested streams. Invertebrates colonizing leaves were mainly mayflies (Leptophlebiidae, Baetidae, and Caenidae), dipterans (Chironomidae), caddisflies (Polycentropodidae), and beetles (Elmidae and Gyrinidae). Our streams lacked large decapod populations, contrasting with other Puerto Rican streams. We found little evidence for an insect effect on leaf breakdown. Results suggest that land use is an important factor affecting leaf litter processing in streams. In contrast to studies in temperate regions, we found little evidence for a positive nutrient related effect of agricultural land use on decomposition rates. Changes in the physical characteristics of streams appear to be the main drivers behind observed decomposition patterns.

AB  - Large-scale exposure of acid sulfate soils during a hydrological drought in the Lower Lakes of South Australia resulted in acidification of surface water in several locations. Our aim was to describe the techniques used to monitor, assess and manage these acidification events using a field and laboratory dataset (n = 1,208) of acidic to circum-neutral pH water samples. The median pH of the acidified (pH < 6.5) samples was 3.8. Significant (p < 0.05) increases in soluble metals (Al, Co, Mn, Ni and Zn above guidelines for ecosystem protection), SO4 (from pyrite oxidation), Si (from aluminosilicate dissolution) and Ca (from carbonate dissolution and limestone addition), were observed under the acidic conditions. The log of the soluble metal concentrations, acidity and SO4/Cl ratio increased linearly with pH. The pH, alkalinity and acidity measurements were used to inform aerial limestone dosing events to neutralise acidic water. Field measurements correlated strongly with laboratory measurements for pH, alkalinity and conductivity (r (2) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 0.97) but only moderately with acidity (r (2) = 0.54), which could be due to difficulties in determining the indicator-based field titration endpoint. Laboratory measured acidity correlated well with calculated acidity (r (2) = 0.87, acidity present as Al-III >> H+ a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand Mn-II > Fe-II/III) but was about 20 % higher on average. Geochemical speciation calculations and XRD measurements indicated that solid phase minerals (schwertmannite and jarosite for Fe and jurbanite for Al) were likely controlling dissolved metal concentrations and influencing measured acidity between pH 2 and 5.

AB  - Earthworm populations can be assessed using various extraction solutions of which the most widely used is formaldehyde (0.5%). Although formaldehyde extraction has been proposed as a standard method by ISO, its use has been questioned due to its toxic and carcinogenic properties, and the associated risks to human health and the environment. Alternative, safer methods are needed, so the present study was undertaken to evaluate the efficiency of a low cost and non-toxic onion (Allium cepa L) extract solution in collecting earthworms in two soil types in Southern Brazil. The study was divided in three parts. In the first, we examined the efficiency of solutions with 60, 80, 100, 170 and 200g onion extract L-1 H2O in extracting earthworms from a sandy Ultisol underlying a citrus orchard. The second experiment evaluated the effectiveness of solutions of 25, 75, 125 and 175g onion extract L-1 H2O compared with the standard formaldehyde solution (0.5%) in extracting earthworms from a clayey Oxisol cultivated with corn. The third experiment compared the onion extract solution at concentration of 175 g L-1 with formaldehyde (0.5%) in extracting earthworms from the sandy Ultisol. Increasing concentrations of onion extract solution led to higher extraction of earthworms in both soil types, but the highest numbers were obtained with 175 g L-1 H2O, a concentration that had similar efficiency to the standard solution of formaldehyde (0.5%). The onion extract solution is a low cost and non-toxic alternative to the use formaldehyde in extracting worms from soils, although further research is warranted to assess its use in other soils, climates and vegetation conditions.

AB  - The approval of the current Bathing Water Directive (Directive 2006/7/EC) set the necessity to define the bathing water profile. The goals established in the definition of the profile are: (i) to know the processes that determine the concentration of bacteriological indicators in the aquatic environment, (ii) to obtain relationships between the cause of pollution and its effects, and (iii) to evaluate the fulfilment of the Directive and to set the Quality Monitoring and Assessment Program, according to the bacteriological characteristics of the bathing water. In this paper an approach to elaborate the bathing water profile and its application to several bathing waters located in Santander municipality (North Spain) is shown. The methodology involves the assessment of advection, diffusion and reaction processes of bacteriological organisms in the aquatic environment by using mathematical models and the selection of an indicator to evaluate the probability to exceed the bacteriological concentrations established in Directive 2006/7/EC, which is useful for the 'source apportionment' assessment. In the definition of the bathing water profile we have considered the sanitation system operating under normal conditions, which includes storm water overflows, uncontrolled discharges and the discharge produced when the pumping system of the wastewater breaks. Finally, according to the bacteriological characteristics of the bathing water it is necessary to develop the Quality Monitoring and Assessment, which has been done taking into account the requirements established in Directive 2006/7/EC and the uncertainties detected in such a method regarding the number of samples to be considered.

AB  - Despite growing evidence from longitudinal studies of a link between early-life stress and the development of asthma, very few of these examine one of the most severe types of early-life stress: childhood maltreatment. Cross-sectional studies on this topic have relied on retrospective self-reports of maltreatment. This study investigates associations between childhood maltreatment indicated by child protection agency records versus self-reports and lifetime asthma diagnosis in young adults, adjusting for socioeconomic status and mental. disorders. Methods: A nationally representative general population survey of DSM-IV mental disorders in New Zealand (n = 12,992) obtained information on lifetime diagnoses of chronic physical conditions. Information from a subsample of survey respondents aged 16 to 27 years (n = 1413) was linked with a national child protection database to identify respondents with a history of agency involvement, which was used as a proxy for childhood maltreatment. Retrospective reports of maltreatment were also obtained. Results: Child protection agency history was associated with elevated odds (odds ratio = 2.88 [95% confidence interval = 1.7-4.74]) of a lifetime diagnosis of asthma. After adjusting for a variety of indicators of socioeconomic status, lifetime mental disorders, lifetime smoking, and body mass index, this association remained significantly elevated (odds ratio = 2.26 [95% confidence interval = 1.33-3.83]). Retrospectively self-reported maltreatment in childhood was not associated with asthma. Conclusions: Childhood maltreatment was associated with elevated odds of asthma diagnosis. These findings are consistent with the possibility that early-life stress may be one of the environmental factors that increase the risk of asthma in genetically vulnerable individuals.

AB  - The aim of this study was to select rhizobia from a collection previously created from nodulated legumes grown in semiarid environments to be used as bioinoculants. The selection was based on the analyses of symbiotic efficiency and molecular analyses. Twenty-nine strains of rhizobia were evaluated. The symbiotic efficiency was tested by cross-inoculations with 12 traditional cultivated legumes including pea (Pisum sativum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), vicias (Vicia spp.), clover (Trifolium spp.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and lupin (Lupinus spp.). The nodC gene was used as a symbiotic marker of host specificity for discriminating and consequently selecting between strains with similar growth values. This rendered 12 symbiotypes which were consistent with their hosts of origin. The 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region was successfully used for the validation of nodule occupancy revealing its potential for strain identification in nodulation studies. The strains showed variability in their nodulation patterns and the host range was strain-specific. Some combinations were restrictive displaying nodulation only with their host plants, while it was found that 21 strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum by. viceae and eight plant species of Fabeae tribe constituted one cross-inoculation group. Nodule weight, as an indicator of infectiveness, and shoot dry weight, as an indicator of effectiveness, were the plant features employed to discriminate among strains with better symbiotic performance. These molecular and agronomic analyses allowed us to select specific native strains for each plant species and soil of origin. They could be employed in field inoculations trials using cultivars of agricultural legumes previously selected under typical Mediterranean conditions contributing to the development of sustainable agriculture.

AB  - The assessment of animal welfare requires the collection of multiple indicators of welfare but quantification of their associations in different contexts is lacking. Previous studies have examined correlations between a few indicators, but not relationships between many different indicators, or between indicators taken from the same individuals in more than one environment. We housed 60 hens for six sequential 35-day phases in different pen environments. During each phase, a series of behavioural and physiological measures was taken for every bird: body and plumage condition, surface body temperature, behaviours observed in the home pens and during test periods, tonic immobility, physiological blood profiles, and faecal sample composition. Most variation in nearly all measures was not explained by either individual bird or grouping effects but varied across phases within the birds. Acknowledging this, we examined correlations between all parameters at the phase within-bird level, selecting a conservative P-value. A consistent set of correlations showed that a slow approach response and alert behaviour in the novel object test was associated with higher bodyweight, lower body temperature and lower acute phase protein, heterophil:lymphocyte ratio and blood glucose level. A cluster analysis confirmed these correlations. Other important parameters known to be linked to the hens' environmental preference (eg comfort behaviour) were independent of the set described above. We conclude that statistical techniques can reveal patterns of independence and redundancy in the collection of behavioural and physiological measures of welfare.

AB  - The United Kingdom (UK) Government has national and international commitments to tackle the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. Biodiversity indicators are used to measure and communicate progress in meeting these commitments. From 2005 onwards, butterflies have been adopted as Governmental biodiversity indicators in England, Scotland and for the UK as a whole. The indicators are compiled using butterfly abundance data collected through the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, at a network of site established from 1976 onwards. The indicators show that butterfly numbers have fluctuated considerably from year-to-year, though analysis of the underlying smoothed multi-species trends for (habitat) 'specialist' species show significant long-term declines in each country since the 1970s. Trends in wider countryside 'generalist' species vary at the country-level from little or no overall change in Scotland and across the UK, to declines over selected years in England. Comparisons of changes in butterfly abundance before and after the 2010 target was set in 2002 suggest that the rate of decline at the UK-level is increasing for specialist species. In spite of large amounts of investment since 2000 to improve the habitat condition of protected areas, the trend for butterfly populations is no different in protected areas compared to elsewhere. Analysis by policy sector in England, shows that butterflies are declining rapidly in both forestry land and farmland, although in the latter habitat type, improvements are being seen on land entered into agri-environment schemes. We conclude by assessing the extent to which butterflies may represent broader biodiversity and help inform and evaluate conservation policy.

AB  - The Indian River Lagoon (IRL) and the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE), both located in Florida, USA, are affected by a variety of anthropogenic pressures. Benthic macroinvertebrates have been monitored quarterly since February 2005, at 15 stations, in order to assess benthic health. Since the SLE and IRL are situated in a subtropical area, it is affected by two major climatic seasons, dry (winter) and wet (summer). This contribution investigates the application of the AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and multivariate-AMBI (M-AMBI), to assess the ecological status of these estuaries. AMBI was firstly calculated after assigning most of the previously unassigned species to each of the five ecological groups (from sensitive to first order opportunistic species). Three main benthic assemblages, associated to oligohaline, meso-polyhaline and euhaline stretches, have been identified within the area. Reference conditions of richness, Shannon's diversity and AMBI have been derived for these assemblages; M-AMBI has then been calculated. Both methods show that the inner part of the SLE is affected by anthropogenic pressures (increased freshwater inflow, with elevated nutrient input, and sedimentation), whilst the IRL is less affected. We have demonstrated that AMBI and M-AMBI are insensitive to the dramatic seasonal changes occurring in the SLE/IRL. At some of the stations a significant positive trend in benthic quality has been identified, linked to the polluted freshwater discharges decrease. The use of both tools seems adequate in assessing benthic health in this subtropical area. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bacteria produce different types of biofilms under distinct environmental conditions. Vibrio fischeri has the capacity to produce at least two distinct types of biofilms, one that relies on the symbiosis polysaccharide Syp and another that depends upon cellulose. A key regulator of biofilm formation in bacteria is the intracellular signaling molecule cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP). In this study, we focused on a predicted c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase encoded by the gene binA, located directly downstream of syp, a cluster of 18 genes critical for biofilm formation and the initiation of symbiotic colonization of the squid Euprymna scolopes. Disruption or deletion of binA increased biofilm formation in culture and led to increased binding of Congo red and calcofluor, which are indicators of cellulose production. Using random transposon mutagenesis, we determined that the phenotypes of the Delta binA mutant strain could be disrupted by insertions in genes in the bacterial cellulose biosynthesis cluster (bcs), suggesting that cellulose production is negatively regulated by BinA. Replacement of critical amino acids within the conserved EAL residues of the EAL domain disrupted BinA activity, and deletion of binA increased c-di-GMP levels in the cell. Together, these data support the hypotheses that BinA functions as a phosphodiesterase and that c-di-GMP activates cellulose biosynthesis. Finally, overexpression of the syp regulator sypG induced binA expression. Thus, this work reveals a mechanism by which V. fischeri inhibits cellulose-dependent biofilm formation and suggests that the production of two different polysaccharides may be coordinated through the action of the cellulose inhibitor BinA.

AB  - In the northeastern part of Estonia, near the town of Narva, there are two large oil shale fuelled power plants, Baltic PP and Estonian PP. On burning oil shale the main atmospheric pollutants are fly ash, sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides. The radial increment was measured and concentrations of Ca and Cu were estimated in the stemwood of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) from four sites in the influence area of the Narva power plants. Increment cores were taken also from two sites in an unpolluted area located 112 and 120 km northwest from the Estonian PP. The stands selected for investigation were similar as to their edaphic conditions and forest survey indicators (75- to 80-year-old (Oxalis-) Myrtillus-type pine stands of 0.7-0.8 density and of quality class II). The strongest effect of air pollution on radial increment was observed on the sampling site in the direction of dominating winds at a distance of 22 km to northeast from the Estonian PP. Using the annual rings, the core samples were divided into five-year sections (1945-1949; 1950-1954 etc.). The concentration of Ca increased and that of Cu decreased from the youngest, outermost annual rings towards the centre of the stem. High concentrations of Ca and Cu in stemwood in 1970-1974 may be due to the launching of the Estonian PP in 1969 in addition to the Baltic PP, which has operated since 1959.

AB  - Soil quality can be determined by monitoring, over time, specific chemical, physical or biological properties. Agronomists have long recognized the benefits of maintaining and increasing soil organic carbon (SOC), as well as its labile or particulate (POC) and humic acid (HA) fractions. This research was aimed at the evaluation of continuous wheat (WW) and wheat-grazing (WG), non-fertilized (nf) and annually fertilized with N + P (f), effects on the quantity, quality and dynamics of the organic fractions. The soil (0-0.15 m) was sampled during 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1997. Fertilizer application increased labile organic fraction contents compared with the recalcitrant ones. Fertilization increased POC from 0.11 to 0.19% in WW and from 0.15 to 0.20% in WG, while fulvic acid carbon was increased from 0.083 to 0.167% and from 0. 101 to 0.140% in WW and WG, respectively. The humified fraction quantity and quality were modified by fertilization. Quantity differences depended on production system, mainly, animal grazing activity. Changes in HA quality were related to higher labile OC content. The HA extracted from fertilized soils showed higher aliphatic and phenolic -OH groups contents than unfertilized ones, associated to high labile organic fractions contents. The POC dynamics suggested a strong dependence to annual precipitation, mainly water availability during the fallow period. These results confirm the important effect of the long-term fertilization on POC content and HA quality. They could be utilized as soil quality indicators, however, soil physical and climatic conditions must be considered. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies to determine the appropriateness of the use of populations of indicator bacteria on poultry carcasses for process verification were undertaken in commercial slaughterhouses. Samples were collected from neck skin by excision or from whole carcass rinses and were examined for a range of presumptive process hygiene indicator bacteria. Coefficients of variation were calculated for each bacterial indicator and were significantly lower in excised samples, indicating more reproducible bacterial recovery by this sampling method. Total viable counts of aerobic bacteria. Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas in samples collected by excision had the lowest coefficients of variation when compared with other indicators and were therefore used for further study. The uncertainties associated with the quantification of each bacterial indicator were calculated and were lowest overall for total viable counts of aerobic bacteria. In general, uncertainty was higher for lower bacterial numbers. Results of microbiological testing on pooled excised neck skin samples were not significantly different from the mean of individually analyzed samples. Bacterial numbers increased by 1 log unit when cultures were stored under chilled conditions typical of those used for transporting samples to external laboratories. but the increases were not significant for Pseudomonas and aerobic bacteria when storage time was less than 17 h. Weak relationships were identified between bacterial indicator numbers and duration of processing, although cleanliness of the processing environment diminished visibly during this time. In the plants visited for this study, there was a poor relationship between presumptive bacterial indicator numbers and process hygiene. Consequently, bacterial analyses for process verification purposes may be of limited value.

AB  - Heat stress in feedlot cattle can cause decreases in feed intake and growth, and in extreme cases may result in death. Providing shade during hot weather has shown inconsistent results, reducing direct and indirect losses in some areas of the United States, but not in others. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the dynamic responses of feedlot cattle to environmental conditions with and without access to shade, and to determine the most appropriate physiological measurement for monitoring feedlot cattle during hot weather as a guide for improved management. Eight crossbred steers (initially weighing 294.7 +/- 10.8 kg) were randomly assigned to one of eight individual pens, where one of two treatments were applied: shade access, or no-shade access. Respiration rate, daily feed intake, and core body temperature were collected, using automated systems during eight periods, for a total of 37 days. The data were analysed using four categories of daily maximum temperature humidity index (maximum I-TH) values (Normal for maximum I-TH < 74; alert for 74 <= maximum I-TH < 78; Danger for 78 < maximum I-TH < 84; Emergency for maximum I-TH >= 84). Shade was found to impact the physiological responses in all ITH categories, with the largest impacts in the Danger and Emergency categories. Shade lowered respiration rate and core body temperature during the peak temperature hours of the day. It was concluded that respiration rate is the most appropriate indicator of thermal stress to monitor because it was consistently affected in all ITH categories, it is easy to monitor without the need for costly equipment, and there is little or no lag associated with it.

AB  - Though RpoS, an alternative sigma factor, is required for survival and adaptation of Escherichia coli under stress conditions, many strains have acquired independent mutations in the rpoS gene. The reasons for this apparent selective loss and the nature of the selective agent are not well understood. In this study, we found that some wild type strains grow poorly in succinate C minimal media compared with isogenic strains carrying defined RpoS null mutations. Using an rpoS(+) strain harboring an operon lacZ fusion to the highly-RpoS dependent osmY promoter as an indicator strain, we tested if this differential growth characteristic could be used to selectively isolate mutants that have lost RpoS function. All isolated (Suc(+)) mutants exhibited attenuated beta-galactosidase expression on indicator media suggesting a loss in either RpoS or osmY promoter function. Because all Suc(+) mutants were also defective in catalase activity, an OsmY-independent, RpoS-regulated function, it was likely that RpoS activity was affected. To confirm this, we sequenced PCR-amplified products containing the rpoS gene from 20 independent mutants using chromosomal DNA as a template. Sequencing and alignment analyses confirmed that all isolated mutants possessed mutated alleles of the rpoS gene. Types of mutations detected included single or multiple base deletions, insertions, and transversions. No transition mutations were identified. All identified point mutations could, under selection for restoration of beta-galactosidase, revert to rpoS(+). Revertible mutation of the rpoS gene can thus function as a genetic switch that controls expression of the regulon at the population level. These results may also help to explain why independent laboratory strains have acquired mutations in this important regulatory gene. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work evaluates the suitability of spectral mixture analysis (SMA) methods to assess vegetation cover seasonal changes in a desertification context. Our main interest is to produce remotely sensed derived maps, sensitive to vegetation activity and quite independent of the soil background. A further aim is to analyse the inter-annual variations of this magnitude for different natural vegetation species, in response to seasonal and climatic changes. Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) was obtained using a Variable Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (VESMA) technique. The aim is to identify the main vegetation cover and lithological units and decompose them in separate stages. The use of specific spectral signatures for each pixel allows for a better adaptation of the endmembers to local conditions, which is an important prerequisite to ensure the accuracy of fractions. The method has been tested on a well documented area, the Guadalentin river basin, located in south-eastern Spain. Unlike pine forest and stipa classes, rosmarinus, sparse shrubs and seasonal grasses classes displayed larger inter-annual variability, showing higher stress in response to water availability. A comparative analysis between FVC and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was also conducted. Average values were used as indicators of the dynamics of the vegetation cover, with the variance of each vegetation class giving similar results. The correlation between both magnitudes varied from 55% for the class with least coverage to 90% for the densest vegetation class. Regarding seasonal evolution, the average values and standard deviations of the changes in each vegetation class in specific periods were related to seasonal changes and the effects of the rainfall pattern. Significant differences were found between the two methods, with FVC showing a higher coherence.

AB  - Identification of reliable biomarkers for oxidative stress for the prediction of the early development of pathological conditions is essential. The detection of biomarkers for oxidative stress such as degradation products of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), oxysterols, and oxidized proteins, as indicators of oxidative stress are in use, but suffers from insufficient specificity, accuracy and reliability. The overall aim of the present study was to develop new markers which will not only provide information about the presence and level of oxidative stress in biological systems but also on the type of reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved and their metabolic consequences. In the first stage of the study, we compared the level and type of oxidized products formed when different ROS were applied onto three major biomolecules, i.e. cholesterol, linoleic acid (LH) and tyrosine, representing sterols, PUFA and protein, when each compounds was exposed alone or in a mixture to the ROS [copper ions, 2,2-azobis(2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl)]. It was found that different types of oxidants resulted in the formation of different types of oxidation products. Furthermore, oxidation pattern differs when the substrates (cholesterol, PUFA or amino acid) were present alone or in a mixture. As biological systems such as lipoproteins and cell membranes are composed of the above studied molecules, the need for simultaneous detection of the major oxidized products is requires for better characterization of the oxidative stress outcome.

AB  - Three grasses (Holcus lanatus, Anthoxanthum odoratum and Festuca ovina) and three herbs (Rumex obtusifolius, Plantago lanceolata and Hieracium pilosella) were grown in a greenhouse at 3 nutrient levels in order to evaluate plant allocation, architecture and biomass turnover in relation to fertility level of their habitats.
   Four harvests were done at intervals of 4 weeks. Various plant traits related to biomass partitioning, plant architecture, biomass turnover and performance were determined. Differences in nutrient supply induced a strong functional response in the species shoot:root allocation, but architecture and turnover showed little or no response. Architectural parameters like specific leaf area and specific root length, however, in general decreased during plant development.
   Species from more nutrient-rich successional stages were characterized by a larger specific leaf area and longer specific shoot height (height/shoot biomass), resulting in a higher RGR and total biomass in all nutrient conditions. There was no evidence that species from nutrient-poor environments had a longer specific root length or any other superior growth characteristic. The only advantage displayed by these species was a lower leaf turnover when expressed as the fraction of dead leaves and a shorter specific shoot height (SSH) which might prevent herbivory and mowing losses.
   The dead leaf fraction, which is a good indicator for biomass and nutrient loss, appeared to be not only determined by the leaf longevity, but was also found to be directly related to the RGR of the species. This new fact might explain the slow relative growth rates in species from a nutrient-poor habitat and should be considered in future discussions about turnover.

AB  - Traditionally the Dusun indigenous people of Borneo consider Mt. Kinabalu the home of spirits and ancestors, and they are loath to climb the summit without good cause and plentiful propitiation. In apparent accordance with these beliefs, Projek Etnobotani Kinabalu has recorded few useful plants at high elevations on Mt. Kinabalu. We ask the question: is this an ecological relationship with fewer useful plants being collected at high elevations, or is it an ethnological product of belief with fewer plants collected where people fear to tread? With an indigenous Dusun plant expert (second author) well versed with all areas of Mt. Kinabalu, data on the number and kinds of useful plants were collected for dominant and indicator plant species (168 spp.) among all ecologically identified vegetation types. Results indicate that there are more useful plant species at lower elevations - but there are also more unused species. Once the data are corrected for change in the number of plant species with elevation (useful spp./total spp.), the proportion of useful species are not significantly different over elevation. Thus, useful species are a function of overall biodiversity (i.e., number of useful spp. are correlated with number of plant species, a secondary ecological factor) and not a direct ecological correlate with elevation. The number or kinds of uses also correlates with total number of plant species. In support of direct ecological causation, there is evidence that edaphic conditions (i.e., ultramafic and other poor soils) are associated with reduced proportions of useful species. Ultimately, both ethnological and ecological factors contribute to patterns of people's use of plants with many implications for conservation and biodiversity.

AB  - Fura-2 is one of the most frequently used fluorescent Ca indicator dyes; yet it has limitations in tracking large intracellular Ca transients due to its high affinity for Ca. Since high affinity is of advantage when small Ca changes are to be detected, we tried the application of Fura-2 in skeletal muscle fibres which had been loaded with 15 mM internal EGTA to eliminate contractile artifacts. Under these conditions, the free Ca transients are considerably reduced in amplitude and strong saturation of Fura-2 is avoided. Cut segments of isolated muscle fibres were voltage-clamped in a double vaseline gap set-up. In the presence of high internal EGTA, free Ca (as measured with the rapid metallochromic indicator antipyrylazo III) drops rapidly from one value to a lower quasi steady-state value at the end of a depolarizing voltage pulse. This property allowed inspection of the dissociation kinetics of Ca from Fura-2 in the myoplasmic environment. The dissociation rate constant k(off) in the fibre was determined from the time constant of the exponential decay of the Fura-2 signal as a function of the final level of free Ca. We obtained a value of 26 s(-1) at the experimental temperature of 12 degrees C. Knowledge of k(off) in the cell is essential for reconstructing the time course of free Ca from indicator bound Ca and for estimating the time course of the rate of release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The described combination of high EGTA buffering with Fura-2 fluorescence recording may be particularly useful for the determination of Ca release in small muscle cells.

AB  - Multigeneration systems offering superior energy utilization efficiency are considered to be the next alternatives to conventional energy supply methods. In this study, a novel combined cooling, heating, power, and potable water system is proposed and experimentally investigated. An absorption chiller, a desiccant dehumidifier prototype, an indirect evaporative cooler prototype, and an adsorption chiller prototype are incorporated to realize an integrated energy/temperature cascade utilization system that recovers dissipated waste heat from a gas turbine. The proposed system's performance is firstly assessed by means of a 4E (exergy, energy, economic, and environment) off-design analytical method. Key results reveal that 71% of the dissipated waste heat can be recovered, and the primary energy saving ratio is 32.5%. In addition, the proposed system is capable of reducing up to 256 tons of CO2 emission every year compared with the conventional system. Results further highlight that the payback period of the proposed system is about 1.1 years when the annual operation time and power ratio of the gas turbine are 8000 h and 0.9, respectively. In addition, the effects of different variables on the economic feasibility of the proposed system are analyzed. Results also indicate that both national grid efficiency and fuel price exert greater influence on the payback year of the proposed system. Further, a case study is performed based on a typical tropic city's electricity, cooling, and heating demands. Lastly, the proposed system can be employed as a promising energy source supply taking into consideration its excellent energy saving potential, environmental sustainability, and economic feasibility.

AB  - Yearly population growth will lead to a significant increase in agricultural production in the coming years. Twenty-first century agricultural producers will be facing the challenge of achieving food security and efficiency. This must be achieved while ensuring sustainable agricultural systems and overcoming the problems posed by climate change, depletion of water resources, and the potential for increased erosion and loss of productivity due to extreme weather conditions. Those environmental consequences will directly affect the price setting process. In view of the price oscillations and the lack of transparent information for buyers, a multi-agent system (MAS) is presented in this article. It supports the making of decisions in the purchase of sustainable agricultural products. The proposed MAS consists of a system that supports decision-making when choosing a supplier on the basis of certain preference-based parameters aimed at measuring the sustainability of a supplier and a deep Q-learning agent for agricultural future market price forecast. Therefore, different agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) have been considered, as well as the use of edge computing technologies to reduce costs of data transfer to the cloud. The presented MAS combines price setting optimizations and user preferences in regards to accessing, filtering, and integrating information. The agents filter and fuse information relevant to a user according to supplier attributes and a dynamic environment. The results presented in this paper allow a user to choose the supplier that best suits their preferences as well as to gain insight on agricultural future markets price oscillations through a deep Q-learning agent.

AB  - Thermal indices are widely used to predict the human body's thermal sensation indoors and outdoors, with standard effective temperature (SET*) being the most commonly used index. Although SET* has been well-proven in predicting indoor static thermal comfort, it has not yet proven its applicability in thermal comfort and dynamic condition assessments outdoors. Refers to verify the application of SET* in both an indoor and transitional space, experiments were conducted in the badminton hall of Guangzhou University (representing the indoor space) and the overhead floor of the experimental building of Guangzhou University (representing the transition space). Thirty healthy college students were first asked to walk for 20 min at four walking speeds and then to rest for 10 min. During the whole process, environmental parameters and the mean thermal sensation vote (MTSV) were recorded. Thereafter, the relationship between MTSV and the calculated SET* was established; notably, the applicability of the SET* prediction model in the transitional space was significantly better than that in the indoor space during walking. An improved SET* prediction model and the corresponding thermal stress categories are proposed to predict the dynamic thermal sensation, which is suitable for either walking indoors or in transitional spaces. From the linear regression equation in the improved model, it was obtained that the thermal comfort interval (MTSV falling within +/- 0.5) represented by alpha SET* is 24-37.5 degrees C. In addition, through Probit regression analysis, the thermal sensation level corresponding to the improved SET* (alpha SET*) was determined. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study highlights the modern pollen-vegetation relationships along an altitudinal gradient covering the lower temperate (similar to 2,000 masl) to alpine vegetation zones (similar to 3,800 masl) in the Bhagirathi valley, western Himalaya. The pollen dispersal dataset compared with the altitudinal vegetation distribution in the valley shows incoherency between the arboreal taxa and their respective pollen proportions. Discriminant analysis (DA) revealed the role of diurnal valley winds in pollen mixing between altitudinal vegetation zones. Pollen of arboreal taxa are transported profusely from the lower temperate vegetation zones to alpine zone. Whereas pollen of non-arboreal taxa, dominantly growing in the sub-alpine and alpine meadows, remain close to their source and represent the prevailing localized environmental conditions in the valley. Study revealed Pinus and Quercus as dominant arboreal pollen taxa throughout the altitudinal transect with a distinct transition in their representation between similar to 2,500 and 2,600 masl. High percentage of Pinus (Quercus) pollen below (above) this transition zone nearly corresponds with the present distribution of conifer (pine-oak) and broadleaved (oak-pine) forests in the valley and can be taken as a marker zone to infer palaeoecological changes. The sub-alpine and alpine krummholz, Juniperus and Ericaceae are found autochthonous in their pollen distribution that can serve as good indicators of relative tree-line and glacier dynamics in past. This pollen-vegetation relationship dataset could be an analogue for the interpretation of fossil pollen records in terms of extant vegetation in the mountain regions.

AB  - Changing environmental conditions are influencing the seasonal timing in life history events of organisms. Such shifts in phenology are often linked to increasing temperatures that stimulate faster developments or earlier arrivals. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in terrestrial and aquatic realms, but data and knowledge are limited on how early life stages of fish are affected over long-term and broad environmental scales. Here, we analyze 2 decades (1974-1996) of size class-specific Baltic herring Clupea harengus membras L. larval data along the whole coast of Finland to expose shifts in phenology linked to changes in environmental covariates. We use a novel Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal hurdle model that describes larval occurrence and abundance with separate processes. Abundances are modeled with the Ricker population growth model that enables us to predict size-specific larvae groups in relation to the environment while accounting for population density dependence. We quantify shifts in phenology at multiple life stages, based on first appearances of smallest larvae (<10 mm) and by detection of higher proportions of larger larvae (>15 mm) appearing earlier than they have done historically. Our results show a strong signal in shifting phenology of the larvae toward an earlier development of 7.7 d per decade. Increasing temperature had a positive effect on the earlier development of larger larvae. Additionally, we highlight that the survival of larvae becomes more density dependent as their size increases. Our modeling framework can reveal phenological shifts of early life stages in relation to environmental change for survey data that do not necessarily cover the onset of reproduction.

AB  - This work sought to predict soil microbiological attributes based on soil fertility and texture, elemental contents determined by portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, and terrain attribute data with and without addition of season (dry or rainy) and phytophysiognomy as auxiliary predictors. Soil samples were collected in both seasons in four phytophysiognomies. Analyses for prediction of basal soil respiration, microbial biomass carbon, metabolic quotient, and microbial quotient were performed. Terrain attributes, total elemental concentrations obtained by portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, soil fertility and texture as well as phytophysiognomy and season were used as predictor variables. Prediction models were created via conditional random forest algorithm and validated with leave-one-out cross-validation through coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error, mean absolute error and ratio percent deviation. The best results were delivered when phytophysiognomy and season were included as predictors. Metabolic quotient, microbial quotient, microbial biomass carbon and basal soil respiration achieved the best prediction using only soil fertility and texture data (R2 = 0.79, 0.66, 0.65, 0.91, respectively). Predictions of basal soil respiration and metabolic quotient using only terrain data achieved R2 values of 0.91 and 0.73, respectively. Elemental concentrations determined by portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry reasonably predicted two microbiological attributes. It is possible to adequately predict these four microbiological attributes both locally and spatially through terrain and soil properties data. We encourage further investigations on prediction of these and other microbiological attributes under different environmental conditions and at shorter spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Studies on cooperative breeders have addressed the effects of non-breeding 'helpers' on reproduction and parental care, but the consequences for offspring physiology and long-term survival are less understood. Helpers are expected to benefit offspring, but their presence can also lead to decreased pre- or post-natal parental reproductive effort. To examine whether prenatal and postnatal helpers influence offspring condition, we conducted a whole-clutch cross-fostering experiment in sociable weavers (Philetairus socius) that altered the nestlings' social environment (presence/absence of helpers). We tested whether relative telomere length (rTL), an indicator of somatic maintenance, was influenced by prenatal and/or postnatal presence of helpers 9 and 17 days after hatching, and whether rTL predicted long-term survival. Nine days after hatching, we found an overall positive effect of postnatal helpers on rTL: for nestlings with prenatal helpers, a reduction in the number of helpers post-hatch was associated with shorter telomeres, while nestlings swapped from nests without helpers to nests with helpers had a larger rTL. However, when prenatal helpers were present, an increased number of helpers after hatching led to shorter telomeres. Nine-day old chicks with longer rTL tended to be more likely to survive over the 5 years following hatching. However, close to fledging, there was no detectable effect of the experiment on rTL and no link between rTL and survival. This experimental study of a wild cooperative breeder, therefore, presents partial support for the importance of the presence of helpers for offspring rTL and the link between early-life telomere length and long-term survival.

AB  - Highly accelerated life testing (HALT) is one of the most popular step-stress testing methodologies for identifying the weaknesses and increasing product reliability in a fast and cost-efficient way. The traction inverter plays a critical role in EV/HEV power train systems, and the requirements on its reliability at the harsh environment operation are becoming more demanding. In this article, to evaluate the weak links and various components performance and ascertain the effect of high temperature on the traction inverter, the traction inverter HALT was carried out with high-temperature stress between 190 degrees C-220 degrees C taking the IGBT on-die temperature as the benchmark. Nine traction inverters were tested, which were divided into four groups with respect to the designed step-stress test profile. The changes in electrical and thermal indicators were observed online using the proposed monitoring system. At the end of each test, the effects of different conditions on the overall testing time, failure modes, and damage were examined, and the damages were listed systematically and discussed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the dc-link capacitor at different temperatures and the related degradation were observed online. The results show that the inverter can operate hundreds of hours with the IGBT on-die temperature of 200 degrees C, and the gate driver board chip of 127 degrees C. The findings in this study could help to the improvement design of the traction inverter, as well as to keep the design life prediction never be overestimated.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is an important challenge in developing and emerging countries, where two realities co-exist. On the one hand, their metropolitan cities exhibit an integrated MSW system with a specialized fleet for the collection and landfills for the final disposal, concentrating on environmental initiatives such as municipal recycling programs. On the other hand, their regional cities show an MSW system based on adapted transports for collection and open dumps for final disposal. Besides, they face other environmental problems due to local conditions. This research proposes a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to close the gap between these two realities. In particular, we study the city of Valdivia (Chile), one of the main regional capitals of South America, which shares similarities with other southern regional cities in the Global South. This city disposes 95% of its MSW in open dumps and presents one of the highest environmental pollution rates in Latin America. We analyze the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy performance of six scenarios, seeking a solution for these problems. The results obtained show that a waste-to-energy scenario would generate savings of GHG emission and particulate matter, reaching 11.3% and 21.8%, respectively. Using our LCA approach, we can provide environmental evidence to highlight the importance of improving MSW management in regional cities, closing the gap with MSW management in metropolitan cities, and contributing to national targets such as United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and Nationally-Determined Contributions.

AB  - This work addresses the economic, social and environmental analysis of an indigenously developed building energy optimization system for residential and office buildings in Germany. The developed system consists of 14 different wireless network embedded sensors, wireless communication protocol, multi-dimensional data warehouse, graphical user interfaces and energy optimization software with artificial intelligence-backed control algorithms. The R&D activity is accomplished in the 'Intelligent Building Energy Management System' research project, which is funded by the State of Lower Saxony-Germany in the frame of Innovation Support Program between the years 2014 and 2018. The system is tested in two appropriately selected test buildings in Germany. It has been recorded that the system provides energy efficiency levels between 29.34% and 38.18% under different seasonal and occupancy conditions in office and residential building types. The analysis is accomplished within the framework of four main indicators. These are economic indicators including calculations of lifetime cost and payback rate methods, resource use indicators including the calculation of reduced energy use as a result of the energy efficiency provided by the system, social indicator including additional expendable income calculations and environmental indicators including calculations depicting the benefits of reducing harmful emissions. Analysis results illustrate that building energy optimization systems provide a cost-effective method for promoting energy efficiency goals. Results of the indicators prove monetary benefits for the building occupants in terms of resource use, return on investment and social impact, as well as quantifiable benefits for easing the harmful effects of climate change phenomenon.

AB  - Probabilistic topic modelling is frequently used in machine learning and statistical analysis for extracting latent information from complex datasets. Despite being closely associated with natural language processing and text mining, these methods possess several properties that make them particularly attractive in metabolomics applications where the applicability of traditional multivariate statistics tends to be limited. The aim of the study was thus to introduce probabilistic topic modelling more specifically, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in a novel experimental context: volatilome-based (sea) food spoilage characterization. This was realized as a case study, focusing on modelling the spoilage of Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar) at 4 degrees C under different gaseous atmospheres (% CO2/O-2/N-2): 0/0/100 (A), air (B), 60/0/40 (C) or 60/40/0 (D). First, an exploratory analysis was performed to optimize the model tunings and to consequently model salmon spoilage under 100% N-2 (A). Based on the obtained results, a systematic spoilage characterization protocol was established and used for identifying potential volatile spoilage indicators under all tested storage conditions. In conclusion, LDA could be used for extracting sets of underlying VOC profiles and identifying those signifying salmon spoilage, giving rise to an extensive discussion regarding the key points associated with model tuning and/or spoilage analysis. The identified compounds were well in accordance with a previously established approach based on partial least squares regression analysis (PLS). Overall, the outcomes of the study not only reflect the promising potential of LDA in spoilage characterization, but also provide several new insights into the development of data-driven methods for food quality analysis.

AB  - In this study, 12 farmed Atlantic salmon (similar to 1200 g) were tagged with commercially available heart rate (HR) bio-loggers and maintained in a controlled fish tank laboratory environment at 9 degrees C on a 12 h day/night cycle for 13 weeks. Apart from one fish that had obtained severe wounds on the tail region in the beginning, the remaining fish survived the entire test period and displayed consistent and similar HR in response to the day/night cycles with peak HR midday during feeding. At the end of the experiment, untagged conspecifics had significantly higher weights, fork lengths and conditions factors, showing the bio-logger may have a long term negative impact on growth. However, tagged fish still gained weight during the trial. Resting HR, as measured at night and early morning, decreased significantly over the first 2-3 weeks, and remained stable at similar to 25 beats min (-1) between week 3 and 10, highlighting that substantial time is required for complete recovery following implantation of the bio-logger. At the start of week 11, 12 and 13, crowding stress trials of 30 min were performed which elevated HR to 55.7 beats min(-1), whereafter it took 24 h to recover normal HR. Emerging biologger technologies can provide otherwise unobtainable information on the physiology and behaviour in free swimming individual fish over long periods and has great potential as welfare assessment tools in aquaculture. However, the impact of the tag must be considered with regards to the general representativeness of untagged counterparts when interpreting data.

AB  - The emission of CO2 from the soil in agricultural areas is the result of the interaction of several factors, including soil and crop management practices and local edaphoclimatic conditions. The dynamics of organic carbon (OC), in the midst of reform processes in agricultural areas, can be used as an indicator of chemical soil quality because carbon loss is directly related to its lability, quality, or decomposition capacity. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the reform of degraded pastures in the soil organic matter compartment and its effect on mitigating CO2 emissions. The study was carried out in the municipality of Selviria, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in two areas destined for extensive beef cattle grazing, subsidized by the forage plant Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu. Geostatistical meshes were installed in the areas, and soil samples of deformed and undeformed structures were taken to evaluate the physical and chemical attributes of the soil. The results indicated that soil management practices, followed by the cultivation of sorghum intercropped with U. brizantha, increased the total OC (TOC) stocks through the stable fraction (OC associated with the mineral fraction) and consequent reduction in CO2 emissions from the soil. This highlights the spatial variability in CO2 emissions and how soil attributes affect the flow of CO2 into the atmosphere. The use of multivariate geostatistics has made it possible to forecast CO2 emissions from the soil. This small-scale study provides a theoretical basis for the large-scale spatial monitoring of biogeochemical processes that control CO2 emissions in agricultural ecosystems, particularly in degraded pasture areas.

AB  - The determination of the spatiotemporal patterns and driving factors of PM2.5 is of great interest to the atmospheric and climate science community, who aim to understand and better control the atmospheric linkage indicators. However, most previous studies have been conducted on pollution-sensitive cities, and there is a lack of large-scale and long-term systematic analyses. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal evolution of PM2.5 and its influencing factors by using an exploratory spatiotemporal data analysis (ESTDA) technique and spatial econometric model based on remote sensing imagery inversion data of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), China, between 2000 and 2016. The results showed that 1) the annual value of PM2.5 was in the range of 23.49-37.67 mu g/m(3) with an inverted U-shaped change trend, and the PM2.5 distribution presented distinct spatial heterogeneity; 2) there was a strong local spatial dependence and dynamic PM2.5 growth process, and the spatial agglomeration of PM2.5 exhibited higher path-dependence and spatial locking characteristics; and 3) the endogenous interaction effect of PM2.5 was significant, where each 1% increase in the neighbouring PM2.5 levels caused the local PM2.5 to increase by at least 0.4%. Natural and anthropogenic factors directly and indirectly influenced the PM2.5 levels. Our results provide spatial decision references for coordinated trans-regional air pollution governance as well as support for further studies which can inform sustainable development strategies in the YREB.

AB  - Environmental change associated with anthropogenic disturbance can lower habitat quality, especially for sensitive species such as many amphibians. Variation in environmental quality may affect an organism's physiological health and, ultimately, survival and fitness. Using multiple health measures can aid in identifying populations at increased risk of declines. Our objective was to measure environmental variables at multiple spatial scales and their effect on three indicators of health in ornate chorus frog (Pseudacris ornata) tadpoles to identify potential correlates of population declines. To accomplish this, we measured a glucocorticoid hormone (corticosterone; CORT) profile associated with the stress response, as well as the skin mucosal immune function (combined function of skin secretions and skin bacterial community) and bacterial communities of tadpoles from multiple ponds. We found that water quality characteristics associated with environmental variation, including higher water temperature, conductivity and total dissolved solids, as well as percent developed land nearby, were associated with elevated CORT release rates. However, mucosal immune function, although highly variable, was not significantly associated with water quality or environmental factors. Finally, we examined skin bacterial diversity as it aids in immunity and is affected by environmental variation. We found that skin bacterial diversity differed between ponds and was affected by land cover type, canopy cover and pond proximity. Our results indicate that both local water quality and land cover characteristics are important determinants of population health for ornate chorus frogs. Moreover, using these proactive measures of health over time may aid in early identification of at-risk populations that could prevent further declines and aid in management decisions.

AB  - Drought has become an important natural disaster, affecting the development of Inner Mongolia, as an important animal husbandry region in China. In this study, the characteristics and trends of the Inner Mongolia drought are thoroughly analysed by calculating the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at different time scales, based on monthly precipitation and temperature data from 40 national meteorological stations in Inner Mongolia from 1958 to 2019. Subsequently, the area drought intensity (ADI), which is a comprehensive evaluation indicator for evaluating drought intensity within the region, is proposed, taking into account the effects of the persistent drought on drought intensity. The results show that drought has increased during this period, with a remarkable increase in the frequency and the area of drought. The areas with stronger drought intensity are mainly located in the west, north central, and the western area of the east. Since 2000, March to October are identified as drought-prone months and April is characterised as the month with the highest frequency of drought. The inflection points of SPEI and climate conditions both appeared in 1990s and it is speculated that the increase in drought may have been caused by excessive temperature rise. The frequency, coverage area, and continuous duration of drought have increased greatly after climate mutation in this region. According to the changes in the spatial distribution of the ADI and frequency of drought occurrence, the drought-stricken areas shifted from the southeast to the northwest after climate mutations. The findings from this study provide a theoretical basis for the drought management of Inner Mongolia.

AB  - The objective of this study was to calculate the environmental impact of raising pigs fed diets with 192, 182, 172, or 162 g kg(-1) crude protein (CP) from 15 to 30 kg live weight, using a life cycle assessment (LCA) based on either predicted or observed performance and excretion data. The predicted data were calculated for two animal profiles: one with feed intake and weight gain data being representative of the national Brazilian average (y(p-AVG)), and the other being representative of the specific experimental farm conditions (y(p-SPC)) Performance and excretion of pigs were either measured (y(obs)) or predicted (y(p)) for each CP scenario by using InraPorc (R) model and LCA impacts were calculated from these data. The y(p) and y(obs) data of performance, nutrient excretion, and LCA were then compared using a Bayesian paired approach. Whatever the calculation methods, the decrease in dietary CP reduced the environmental impacts per kilogram of weight gain on acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), and land occupation. Predicted data from y(p-SPC) did not differ from y obs data except for nitrogen excretion and AP and EP impacts. Predicted data from Y(p-AVG )differed from yobs for all criteria except for body weight gain, phosphorus excreted, and cumulative energy demand, mainly because of the lower feed conversion ratio for average data. It was concluded that the use of predicted data calculated from specific farm indicators could better explain the environmental impact of pig farming in Brazil compared with the use of national average indicators.

AB  - The existence of soil fauna can be used as a parameter of soil quality, soil fauna which is used as an indicator of soil fertility certainly has a relatively abundant amount. One type of soil fauna is the soil mesofauna. The existence of soil mesofauna groups in a habitat is very dependent on the environmental conditions. Field research was carried out in the Lampung State Polytechnic garden under stands of cacao, rubber, coconut, oil palm, coffee and on grass vegetation. Laboratory research was conducted at the Laboratory of Chemical Analysis and the Lampung State Polytechnic Food Laboratory. The study was conducted in September-October 2017The study aimed to obtain, population, diversity index, and dominance index of soil mesofauna in various vegetation plantations, and obtain a correlation between population, diversity index, dominance index of soil mesofauna found with environmental factors. The results of the study showed that soil mesofauna on various fields with plantation vegetation were found in 5 groups of soil mesofauna (Acarina, Araneae, Collembola, Hymenoptera, Symphyla) and the rest were not included in the 5 orders. Acarina is the most common order. The highest mesofauna population was found under the vegetation of rubber plants as many as 95 head dm-3, while the lowest mesofauna was found in vegetation which was 27 dm-3. Mesofauna diversity index in each treatment was included in the low category with H values ranging from 0.42 to 1.05. The population of soil mesofauna correlated positively with all environmental factors (organic C, pH, and water content) or showed a direct relationship. Diversity index, and dominance index of soil mesofauna negatively correlated with all environmental factors (organic C, pH, and water content) or showed opposite directions.

AB  - Background
   Many studies have reported that housing tenure (HT) is associated with health, but little is known about its association in Japan. We investigated the cross-sectional association between HT and self-rated health (SRH) among Japanese adults, taking demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status (SES) into consideration.
   Methods
   We used data from a nationally representative survey conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (28,641 men and 31,143 women aged >= 20 years). HT was divided into five categories: owner-occupied, privately rented, provided housing, publically subsidized, and rented rooms. SRH was evaluated using a single-item inventory and dichotomized into poor (very poor/poor) and good (very good/good/fair). We calculated adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for poor SRH with logistic regression models. Covariates included demographic factors (i.e., age, gender, marital status, family size, smoking status, and chronic medical conditions) and SES factors (i.e., education, equivalent household expenditures, and occupation).
   Results
   Among analyzed participants, 75.9% were owner-occupiers and 14.6% reported poor SRH. After adjustment for all covariates, compared with owner-occupiers, private renters (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.26-1.47), publically subsidized renters (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.19-1.48), and residents in rented rooms (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.22-1.62) were more likely to report poor SRH. Stratified analyses by SES factors showed that the association between HT and poor SRH was stronger in the socially disadvantaged than in the higher socioeconomic group.
   Conclusions
   Our results show a significant association between HT and SRH, independent of socio-demographic factors. HT may deserve greater attention as an indicator of socioeconomic position in Japan.

AB  - Airborne pollen is a recognized biological indicator and its monitoring has multiple uses such as providing a tool for allergy diagnosis and prevention. There is a knowledge gap related to the distribution of pollen traps needed to achieve representative biomonitoring in a region. The aim of this manuscript is to suggest a method for setting up a pollen network (monitoring method, monitoring conditions, number and location of samplers etc.). As a case study, we describe the distribution of pollen across Bavaria and the design of the Bavarian pollen monitoring network (ePIN), the first operational automatic pollen network worldwide.
   We established and ran a dense pollen monitoring network of 27 manual Hirst-type pollen traps across Bavaria, Germany, during 2015. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the data was then performed to select the locations for the sites of the final pollen monitoring network. According to our method, Bavaria can be clustered into three large pollen regions with eight zones. Within each zone, pollen diversity and distribution among different locations does not vary significantly. Based on the pollen zones, we opted to place one automatic monitoring station per zone resulting in the ePIN network, serving 13 million inhabitants.The described method defines stations representative for a homogeneous aeropalynologically region, which reduces redundancy within the network and subsequent costs (in the study case from 27 to 8 locations). Following this method, resources in pollen monitoring networks can be optimized and allergic citizens can then be informed in a timely and effective way, even in larger geographical areas.

AB  - Cadmium is a highly toxic trace metal, which can be of geogenic or anthropogenic origin, for example, minerals, phosphate fertilizers, and combustion emissions. Due to its low sorption affinity compared to other heavy metals, Cd is easily mobilized, potentially resulting in elevated Cd concentrations in groundwater. This study assessed background levels of Cd in groundwater related to hydrogeology and hydrogeochemical processes through evaluation of a large hydrogeochemical data set composed of groundwater analyses from 6300 wells in Northwestern Germany. Calculated Cd background levels in groundwater were between 0.01 mu g/L in hydrogeological units with mainly reducing conditions and 0.98 mu g/L in less reducing groundwater recharge areas. The results showed that groundwater Cd concentrations above 0.5 mu g/L (the German threshold value) are not necessarily elevated but could be the regional or ambient background level, depending on the hydrogeological unit. What would be considered as ambient background levels, however, indicated the influence by continuous intensive land use as well as the local geology, which is dominated by glacial deposits. Cadmium concentrations in groundwater were mainly controlled by hydrogeochemical and hydrogeological parameters and not by the amount of anthropogenic Cd input, in particular through the use of phosphate fertilizers. Instead, analyses of the solid phase revealed that Cd release from the aquifer matrix due to changes in hydrogeochemical parameters was more likely. Aquifer sediments in Northwestern Germany can be enriched in Cd originating from multiple sources, which in turn can cause elevated Cd concentrations in groundwater.

AB  - The range of attacks implemented on wireless networks is quite wide. To avoid or reduce the likelihood of an attack, it is necessary to use various defense mechanisms. Existing protection mechanisms are not always suitable for robotic systems and may not fully provide the necessary level of security. Thus, it is necessary to develop new ways of protection, which would be specific to groups of mobile robots. In this study, we propose an analysis of the following cyber parameters: the power consumption and the residual energy, as well as an in-depth traffic analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the attack and identify abnormal network. We realized an analysis of the behavior of robotic systems under normal conditions and determined that, by their nature, robotic systems have a static and uniform behavior. We developed an experimental stand, and also conducted a theoretical analysis to confirm our assumptions. We found that some indicators of the components of the robotic system change statically; that is, there was a little deviation from the mean. Thus, we identified a set of metrics that allow us to determine how static the operation of the robotic system and its components is. Metrics allow us to evaluate parameters such as power consumption, and incoming/outgoing/redirected/dropped network packets. The results obtained are important for creating an integrated system for detecting anomalies in robotic systems. At the same time, the robotic node can analyze these parameters independently and make calculations that do not greatly affect performance. The main idea of this paper is to define a set of metrics characterizing the static behavior of a robotic system for the further development of an anomaly detection system.

AB  - Human motion detection and activity recognition are becoming vital for the applications in smart homes. Traditional Human Activity Recognition (HAR) mechanisms use special devices to track human motions, such as cameras (vision-based) and various types of sensors (sensor-based). These mechanisms are applied in different applications, such as home security, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), gaming, and healthcare. However, traditional HAR methods require heavy installation, and can only work under strict conditions. Recently, wireless signals have been utilized to track human motion and HAR in indoor environments. The motion of an object in the test environment causes fluctuations and changes in the Wi-Fi signal reflections at the receiver, which result in variations in received signals. These fluctuations can be used to track object (i.e., a human) motion in indoor environments. This phenomenon can be improved and leveraged in the future to improve the internet of things (IoT) and smart home devices. The mainWi-Fi sensing methods can be broadly categorized as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Wi-Fi radar (by using Software Defined Radio (SDR)) and Channel State Information (CSI). CSI and RSSI can be considered as device-free mechanisms because they do not require cumbersome installation, whereas the Wi-Fi radar mechanism requires special devices (i.e., Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)). Recent studies demonstrate that CSI outperforms RSSI in sensing accuracy due to its stability and rich information. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in the CSI-based sensing mechanism and illustrates the drawbacks, discusses challenges, and presents some suggestions for the future of device-free sensing technology.

AB  - Crop growth models including CERES-Maize and CROPGRO-Soybean have been used in the past to evaluate causes of spatial yield variability and to evaluate economic consequences of variable rate prescriptions. In this work, a nitrogen prescription program has been developed that simulates the consequences of different nitrogen prescriptions using the DSSAT crop growth models. The objective of this paper is to describe a site-specific nitrogen prescription and economic optimizer program developed for computing spatially optimum N rates over long periods of weather and plant population for maize (Zea mays L.) using the CERES-Maize model. The application of the model was demonstrated on a field in Germany and another one in the USA to evaluate the concept across different environmental conditions. The user can determine the short- and the long-term optimal spatial nitrogen prescription based on crop price and nitrogen cost. The program simulated short-term optimum N applications that averaged 9% (McGarvey field, USA) and 48% (Riech field, Germany) lower than the uniform rates actually applied in the fields. The program indicated different site-specific N management options for low and high yielding fields under the assumed prices for maize and N. The implementation of a site-specific plant population management was investigated. A site-specific-optimization of plant population showed a higher profitability in the heterogeneous field in Germany. Hard pan depth, hard pan factor, root distribution factor and the percentage of available soil water across the heterogeneous field were useful indicators in predicting the magnitude of site-specific plant population benefits over uniform rates.

AB  - According to Hoekstra et al. (2011) the water footprint within a geographic area is defined as the total freshwater consumption and pollution within the boundaries of the area. The grey part of the water footprint refers to pollution and is an indicator of the water volume needed to assimilate a pollutant load that reaches a water body. It is possible then, based on the grey water footprint to estimate if the water available in a river at a particular cross-section will be sufficient to maintain a water pollution level (WPL) below 100%. The crossing of 100% indicates that the waste assimilation capacity has been fully consumed in this particular catchment.
   In this paper, the grey water footprint from nonpoint source pollution has been calculated based on long-tenn hydro-metrological data for the upper part of a small agricultural catchment (area of 23.4 km(2)) (Zagozdzonka River) in central Poland. Based on land use and the amount of fertilizers applied in the catchment, together with information about the natural concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in the river, as well as maximum acceptable concentration, the water pollution level has been calculated tin actual conditions. The estimation of future runoff decreases for the considered catchment (Banasik, Hejduk 2012) has been applied in order to estimate potential future water pollution levels. The calculation shows that, even when the management practices in this catchment remain as they are, including the current extensive crop production, the WPL of 100% will be exceeded in the year 2033 (for phosphorus) and 2043 (for nitrogen) due only to the decreasing availability of water.

AB  - This paper describes the development and testing of the ALMaSS rabbit model and its baseline, and subsequently its application to the question of lagomorph population vulnerability in environmental risk assessment (ERA). Development and testing following a pattern-oriented modelling protocol resulted in a model able to replicate local and landscape-level rabbit population patterns. We then tested how robust rabbit populations are to an (imaginary) extreme toxic stressor at a landscape level in a variety of landscapes, and to what extremes key uncertain model parameters must be pushed to cause extinctions. This was contrasted with the same (imaginary) toxic stressor applied to the already existing ALMaSS hare model. For EU risk assessment of plant protection products, these results clearly indicate that if the protection goal is population-level impacts, either in abundance and/or distribution, then the hare is a much more vulnerable species than the rabbit under all the conditions tested. Rabbits would only be more vulnerable than hares if the entire population were to be exposed simultaneously, when lower body mass would then be a critical factor. This did not occur even though the toxicant and exposure scenarios tested here were extreme and, in fragmented landscapes at scales used here, will not occur in reality from the use of plant protection products on crop fields. As well as specifically answering the question on rabbit versus hare vulnerability, this study generally illustrates the potential application of models for setting focal species for risk assessments.

AB  - The consistent supply of fresh fish to commercial markets may mask growing fishing footprints and localized depletions, as fishing expands to deeper/further reefs, smaller fish, and more resilient species. To test this hypothesis, species-based records and fisher interviews were gathered over one year within a large, demand-driven coral-reef fishery in Chuuk, Micronesia. We first assessed catch statistics with respect to high windspeeds and moon phases that are known to constrain both catch and effort. While lower daily catch success was predicted by higher windspeeds and greater lunar illumination, total daily landings fluctuated less than fishing success across environmental gradients. Instead, daily landings were mainly driven by the number of flights from Chuuk to Guam (i.e., international demand). Given that demand masked local drivers of overall catch volume, we further evaluated species-based indicators of fisheries exploitation. Most target species (75%) had either a positively skewed size distribution or proportional contributions that were dependent upon favorable conditions (i.e. season and moon phases). Skewed size distributions indicated truncated growth associated with fishing mortality, and in turn, suggested that size-based management policies may be most effective for these species. In contrast, environmentally-constrained catch success indicated species that may be more susceptible to growing fishing footprints and may respond better to gear/quota/area policies compared to size policies. Species-based responses offered a simplified means to combine species into fisheries management units. Finally, a comparison of commercial and subsistence landings showed higher vulnerability to fishing among species preferentially targeted by commercial fisheries, offering new insights into how commercial harvesting can disproportionately impact resources, despite having lower annual catch volumes.

AB  - The temporal irregularity of rainfall, characteristic of a Mediterranean climate, corresponds to the irregularity of the environmental effects on soil. We used aggressiveness as an indicator to quantify the potential environmental impact of rainfall. However, quantifying rainfall aggressiveness is conditioned by the lack of sub-hourly frequency records on which intensity models are based. On the other hand, volume models are characterized by a lack of precision in the treatment of heavy rainfall events because they are based on monthly series. Therefore, in this study, we propose a new methodology for estimating rainfall aggressiveness risk. A new synthesis parameter based on reformulation using daily data of the Modified Fournier and Oliver's Precipitation Concentration indices is defined. The weighting of both indices for calculating the aggressiveness risk is established by multiple regression with respect to the local erosion R factor estimated in the last decades. We concluded that the proposed methodology overcomes the previously mentioned limitations of the traditional intensity and volume models and provides accurate information; therefore, it is appropriate for determining potential rainfall impact over long time periods. Specifically, we applied this methodology to the daily rainfall time series from the San Fernando Observatory (1870-2010) in southwest Europe. An interannual aggressiveness risk series was generated, which allowed analysis of its evolution and determination of the temporal variability. The results imply that environmental management can use data from long-term historical series as a reference for decision-making. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Necrotic enteritis (NE) is a serious disease of poultry caused by the bacterium C. perfringens. To identify proteins of C. perfringens that confer virulence with respect to NE, the protein secretions of four NE disease-producing strains and one baseline nondisease-producing strain of C. perfringens were examined. The problem then becomes a clustering task, for the identification of two extreme groups of proteins that were produced at either concordantly higher or concordantly lower levels across all four disease-producing strains compared to the baseline, when most of the proteins do not exhibit significant change across all strains. However, the existence of some nuisance proteins of discordant change may severely distort any biologically meaningful cluster pattern. We develop a tailored multivariate clustering approach to robustly identify the proteins of concordant change. Using a three-component normal mixture model as the skeleton, our approach incorporates several constraints to account for biological expectations and data characteristics. More importantly, we adopt a sparse mean-shift parameterization in the reference distribution, coupled with a regularized estimation approach, to flexibly accommodate proteins of discordant change. We explore the connections and differences between our approach and other robust clustering methods, and resolve the issue of unbounded likelihood under an eigenvalue-ratio condition. Simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with a number of alternative approaches. Our protein analysis along with further biological investigations may shed light on the discovery of the complete set of virulence factors in NE.

AB  - The article's aim is to find out whether student's nationality influences the assessment of access to financial resources, state support for entrepreneurship, and students' inclination to start a business after graduating from college. The questionnaire was completed by 1352 students: 409 from 14 CR universities; 375 from 3 PL universities and 568 from 8 universities in SR. To meet the goal of the article, mathematical statistics such as chi-squared test, pivot tables, z-score, and descriptive statistics were used. One of the most significant findings is that there were significant differences between the students of different nationalities when assessing access to financial resources. The most significant interest in after graduation entrepreneurship was seen in students from Poland (38.1%), then from Slovakia (35.7%), and the least interest was demonstrated by the students from Czech Republic (26.9%). Students from Czech Republic (25.9%) and Slovak Republic (17.4%) had significantly different views on the quality of legal conditions for entrepreneurship in their countries. Students from Czech Republic evaluated access to external resources and payment discipline as being the worst (27.4%), as compared to the ratings by the students from Slovakia (22.4%) and Poland (19.5%). In addition to state support and access to financial resources, other essential factors are: the social environment in the country (family, society, politicians, the media); macroeconomic environment (statistical indicators - GDP, employment, inflation); quality of the business environment (administrative burden on entrepreneurs, improving the situation of business entities compared to the situation in the business environment 5 years ago); quality of higher education (university education system, acquired knowledge and their subsequent application), etc.

AB  - In this work, new insights on organic matter (OM) removal performance along with the assessment of the toxicity of landfill leachate (LL) treated by Electrocoagulation (EC) method were investigated. In the context of response surface methodology (RSM), the optimal EC experimental conditions were sought by applying a 33 complete factorial design, regarding pH, current density and electrolysis time as operational parameters. The sum of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, namely as dissolved total carbon (DTC), was chosen as a global response parameter. Other EC experiments were performed, keeping fixed pH and current density at local optimal values and varying the electrolysis time. Determination of the median lethal concentration (LC50) from bioassays based on Artemia salina and Lactuca sativa indicators was performed. A second-order polynomial function was statistically validated with good predictions of the DTC data, indicating best removals by setting values of pH, current density, and electrolysis time at 5, 128.57 Am-2 and 120 min, respectively. Additionally, removals above 90% were achieved for color, turbidity, iron concentration and dissolved inorganic carbon, whereas reductions on related-to-organic matter parameter values were around 60%. Although the EC treatment reduced the LL effluent toxicity, as verified by toxicity bioassays, 90 min treatment times showed best results on LC50, but higher toxicity was persistent in electrolysis times below 40 min. Thus, a second stage of treatment based on a biological process could be suitably included in order to abate recalcitrant OM and decrease remaining toxicity in a more efficient integrated treatment system.

AB  - Groundwater ecosystems comprising micro-organisms and metazoans provide an important contribution to global biodiversity. Their complexity depends on geology, which determines the physical habitat available, and the chemical conditions within it. Despite this, methods of classifying groundwater habitats using geological data are not well established and researchers have called for higher resolution habitat frameworks. A novel habitat typology for England and Wales (UK) is proposed, which distinguishes 11 geological habitats (geo-habitats) on hydrogeological principles and maps their distribution. Hydrogeological and hydrochemical data are used to determine the characteristics of each geo-habitat, and demonstrate their differences. Using these abiotic parameters, a new method to determine abiotic habitat quality is then developed. The geo-habitats had significantly different characteristics, validating the classification system. All geo-habitats were highly heterogeneous, containing both high quality habitat patches that are likely to be suitable for fauna, and areas of low quality that may limit faunal distributions. Karstic and porous habitats generally were higher quality than fractured habitats. Overall, 70% of England and Wales are covered by lower quality fractured habitats, with only 13% covered by higher quality habitats. The main areas of high quality habitats occur in central England as north-south trending belts, possibly facilitating dispersal along this axis. They are separated by low quality geo-habitats that may prevent east-west dispersal of fauna. In south-west England and Wales suitable geo-habitats occur as small isolated patches. Overall, this paper provides a new national-scale typology that is adaptable for studies in other geographic areas.

AB  - Heat tolerance in poultry production was obtained attention due to the need for genetic lines that can withstand climate changes. This study aimed at investigating heat tolerance in commercial and native broiler genetics, as well as the physiological and growth performance responses of HSP70 genotypes submitted to heat stress. In Experiment I, heterophil: lymphocyte (H: L) ratio, as an indicator of heat tolerance, was compared between commercial broilers (n = 100) and Thai native chickens (n = 100). Growing chickens (with similar initial weight) of each genetic strain were randomly divided into two groups: 1) thermoneutral environment (26 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C) and 2) heat stress (36 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C). The results showed that native chickens originating from a tropical environment presented lower H: L ratio and mortality rate compared with commercial broilers. In Experiment II, HSP70 genotypes were compared. PCRRFLP was applied to identify the genotypes (C1C1, n = 38; C1C2, n = 38; and C2C2, n = 28). Ten-week-old chickens of each genotype were evaluated in the same environments described in Experiment I. Heat-stress indicators-respiratory rate (RR), cloacal temperature (CT), packed cell volume (PCV), and average daily gain (ADG)-were measured for three weeks. The significant difference in PCV indicated that C2C2 chickens were less tolerant to heat stress compared to other genotypes. The RR, CT, and ADG were not significantly different among all genotypes. Since the C2C2 genotype was shown to be sensitive to heat stress, C1C1 and C1C2 could be used as markers for heat-tolerant genetic strains of Thai indigenous chickens and hybrid commercial lines.

AB  - The need to improve the assessment of the wildfire hazard in nature reserves is considered. It is suggested that the natural vegetation fuel map compiled by using a specially developed determinant of the types of main conductors of burning having regard to the period of a fire-hazardous season should be used for such purposes. The types of prime conductors of burning constitute the major group of vegetation fuels which determines the possibility of the spread of burning across the territory covered by vegetation. A classification of this group was carried out on the basis of long-term pyrological investigations in different regions of the RF. The vegetation fuel maps are presented for the Stolby nature reserve, separately for the spring (autumn) and summer seasons, because the southern-taiga forests are characterized by a predominance of the grass forest types with the involvement of gramineous species. The map of the current wildfire hazard is compiled and presented as an example, on the basis of the vegetation fuel map for the spring (autumn) periods of the season for drought class II according to the weather conditions. This map is representative of the possibility or impossibility of the spread of burning for each area in the nature reserve in the event that the source of fire (of anthropogenic or natural origins) appears. It is shown that vegetation fuel map can be compiled for any nature reserve by using the determinant of the types of prime conductors of burning.

AB  - Most commercially available optical oxygen sensors target the measuring range of 300 to 2 mu mol L-1. However these are not suitable for investigating the nanomolar range which is relevant for many important environmental situations. We therefore developed a miniaturized phase fluorimeter based measurement system called the LUMOS (Luminescence Measuring Oxygen Sensor). It consists of a readout device and specialized "sensing chemistry" that relies on commercially available components. The sensor material is based on palladium(II)-5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorphenyl)-porphyrin embedded in a Hyflon AD 60 polymer matrix and has a K-SV of 6.25 x 10(-3) ppmv(-1). The applicable measurement range is from 1000 nM down to a detection limit of 0.5 nM. A second sensor material based on the platinum(II) analogue of the porphyrin is spectrally compatible with the readout device and has a measurement range of 20 mu M down to 10 nM. The LUMOS device is a dedicated system optimized for a high signal to noise ratio, but in principle any phase flourimeter can be adapted to act as a readout device for the highly sensitive and robust sensing chemistry. Vise versa, the LUMOS fluorimeter can be used for read out of less sensitive optical oxygen sensors based on the same or similar indicator dyes, for example for monitoring oxygen at physiological conditions. The presented sensor system exhibits lower noise, higher resolution and higher sensitivity than the electrochemical STOX sensor previously used to measure nanomolar oxygen concentrations. Oxygen contamination in common sample containers has been investigated and microbial or enzymatic oxygen consumption at nanomolar concentrations is presented.

AB  - The Bulonggoer paleo-oil reservoir (BPR) on the northwest Junggar Basin is the first Devonian paleo-oil reservoir discovered in North Xinjiang, China. Solid bitumens occur within sandstone pores and as veins filling fractures. Samples of both types were analyzed using stable carbon isotope and reflectance measurements, as well as molecular biomarker parameters.
   The extremely positive delta C-13 values and biomarker indicators of depositional environment/lithology, such as pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph), C-29/C-30 hopane, diasteranes/regular steranes and dibenzothiophene/ phenanthrene ratios, indicate a siliciclastic source for the BPR and their deposition in a highly reducing hypersaline environment. The presence of long chain n-alkanes and abundant tetracyclic diterpanes, C-20-C-21 tricyclic terpanes and perylene are indicators of higher plant organic matter input. Moreover, the bimodal distribution of C-27 > C-28 < C-29 regular steranes and abundant methyltriaromatic steroids also support a contribution of microalgae as well as higher plants organic matter. The similar molecular composition and thermal maturity parameters indicate that the reservoir and veined solid bitumens were altered from a common paleo-petroleum, which originated from peak oil window matured source rocks.
   All solid bitumens from the BPR are characterized by relatively low bitumen reflectance values (Rb% < 0.7), suggesting that they were generated from low temperature processes rather than oil thermal cracking. Comparatively, the Rb% values for veined bitumens are higher than reservoir bitumens, indicating that the veined bitumens occurred earlier and experienced higher thermal conditions.

AB  - AimsTo determine the impact of septic systems on water quality and in so doing identify watershed level characteristics that influence septic system impact.
   Methods and ResultsWater samples were collected from streams in 24 well-characterized watersheds during baseflow to analyse for the levels of faecal indicators Escherichia coli and enterococci. The watersheds represent a gradient of land-use conditions from low to high density of septic systems, as well as developed to undeveloped uses. Our findings indicate statistically significant interaction between septic density and season for enterococci count (P=0005) and stream yield (P=004). Seasonal variations in bacterial count and stream yield were also observed, with significant differences between spring-winter and summer-winter. Results from multiple linear regression models suggest that watershed characteristics (septic system density, median distance of septic systems to stream, per cent developed area and forest cover) and water temperature could explain approximately half (R-2=050) of the variability in bacterial count and yield in spring and summer.
   ConclusionsThere is a significant positive relationship between septic system density and faecal pollution levels. However, this relationship is season dependent and is influenced by watershed level characteristics such as median distance of septic systems from streams, per cent developed area and forest cover.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study confirms the significant impact of septic systems on faecal pollution during baseflow and provides the tools that will enable effective pollution monitoring at the watershed scale.

AB  - Epiphytic lichens are a functionally important and species-rich component of Alpine forests, including several species of conservation concern. Their dependence on specific host trees predicts that forests with different tree species composition host different lichen communities, enhancing lichen diversity in forest landscapes. In this study, we tested for the first time the effect of forest type on patterns of epiphytic lichen diversity, in the Italian Alps. We sampled the main forest types of the South Tyrol, a typical Alpine region of Italy. We also assessed the influence of factors related to forest structure and climatic conditions. Our results demonstrate that different forest types host statistically different lichen communities, suggesting that the conservation of lichen diversity is entrusted to the maintenance of forest landscape heterogeneity, including forest types of minor economic value and rural habitats. The highest number of species was found in grazed larch forests and in high-elevation spruce forests, while the poorest pool was found in low-elevation spruce forests, beech forests and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests. High-elevation spruce forests also had the highest number of red-listed lichens, as the non-intensive management of these forest type allows the establishment of a rich lichen biota. Our results also emphasize the role for lichen conservation of some forest types that are of minor economic importance, such as oak (Quercus pubescens), riparian, and silver-fir (Abies alba) forests. This can also apply to grazed larch (Larix decidua) forests that are maintained by traditional farming, which shape one of the most pleasing aspects of the Italian Alpine landscapes.

AB  - Fish eyes and brain are highly susceptible to environmental Hg exposure but this issue is still scarcely investigated, mainly regarding methylmercury (MeHg) accumulation. Yet, Hg levels in fish lens have not been previously examined under field conditions. Total Hg (tHg), MeHg and inorganic Hg (iHg) levels were assessed in the brain, eye wall and lens of the golden grey mullet (Liza aurata) from an Hg contaminated area, both in winter and summer, together with water and sediment levels. Sampling was performed at Aveiro lagoon (Portugal) where a confined area (LAR) is severely contaminated by Hg. Fish brain, eye wall and lens accumulated higher levels of tHg, MeHg and iHg at LAR than the reference site, reflecting faithfully environmental spatial differences. The brain and eye wall responded also to the winter-summer changes found in water and sediment, accumulating higher levels of MeHg (and tHg) in winter. Contrarily, lens was unable to reflect seasonal changes, probably due to its composition and structural stability over time. The three neurosensory structures accumulated preferentially MeHg than iHg (MeHg was higher than 77% of tHg). Lens exhibited a higher retention capacity of MeHg (mean around 1 mu g g(-1) at LAR), accumulating higher levels than the other two tissues. Interestingly, MeHg and iHg levels were significantly correlated for the brain and eye wall but poorly associated within the two analysed eye components. The high levels of MeHg found in the brain, eye wall and lens could compromise their functions and this needs further research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The UN-Habitat Integrated Sustainable Waste Management (ISWM) benchmarking methodology was applied to profile the physical and governance features of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in the former Soviet Union city of Bishkek, capital of the Kyrgyz Republic. Most of the ISWM indicators were in the expected range for a low-income city when compared with 20 reference cities. Approximately 240,000 t yr(-1) of MSW is generated in Bishkek (equivalent to 200 kg capita(-1) yr(-1)); collection coverage is over 80% and 90% of waste disposed goes to semi-controlled sites operating with minimal environmental standards. The waste composition was a distinctive feature, with relatively high paper content (20-27% wt.) and intermediate organic content (30-40% wt.). The study provides the first quantitative estimates of informal sector recycling, which is currently unrecognised by the city authorities. Approximately 18% wt. of generated MSW is recycled, representing an estimated annual saving to the city authorities of US$0.7-1.1 million in avoided collection/disposal costs. The waste management system is controlled by a centralised municipal waste enterprise (Tazalyk); therefore, institutional coherence is high relative to lower-middle and low-income cities. However, performance on other governance factors, such as inclusivity and financial sustainability, is variable. Future priorities in Bishkek include extending collection to unserved communities; improving landfill standards; increasing recycling rates through informal sector cooperation; improving data availability; and engaging all stakeholders in waste management strategy decisions. Extending the scope and flexibility of the ISWM protocol is recommended to better represent the variation in conditions that occur in waste management systems in practice.

AB  - Surface mining drastically disturbs landscapes and soil properties. Reclamation can restore and improve soil quality and biomass productivity. Time required for soil reclamation to restore soil quality to premined conditions in southeastern United States is unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate chronosequence effects on restoration quality indicators in reclaimed coal mine soil from different land use landscapes and agroecosystems in Mississippi. Study sites in 0- to 3-, 5- to 7-, and 10- to 12-year-old reclaimed soils were compared with adjacent undisturbed sites. Soil samples collected at the 0- to 15-cm and the 15- to 30-cm depths within a grid in a radius of 3 m were mixed to produce composite samples and kept frozen until analyzed. Soil bulk density (rho b) was the highest (1.48 g cm(-3)) in the youngest (<1 year) site and decreased with increasing age to the oldest (12-year) site (1.07 g cm(-3)). Soil quality indicators (aggregate stability, total C, organic C, and microbial biomass C) increased with increasing reclamation age in forest and grass ecosystems. Concentrations of C were greater at the summit than at shoulder and foot-slope positions. Soil pH, Ca, Mg, Cu, and Zn were higher in newly reclaimed soil than in soils reclaimed 12 years earlier possibly because of reclamation liming practices, which buffer pH to greater than 7.0 in newly reclaimed sites. Reclamation practices improved soil quality over time. Soil quality indicators reached levels similar to those of undisturbed soil within 7 to 12 years after reclamation, indicating successful reestablishment of healthy and sustainable soils in the postmining ecosystems.

AB  - In utero exposure of rodents to valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, has been proposed to induce an adult phenotype with behavioural characteristics reminiscent of those observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have evaluated the face validity of this model in terms of social cognition deficits which are a major core symptom of ASD. We employed the social approach avoidance paradigm as a measure of social reciprocity, detection of biological motion that is crucial to social interactions, and spatial learning as an indicator of dorsal stream processing of social cognition and found each parameter to be significantly impaired in Wistar rats with prior in utero exposure to VPA. We found no significant change in the expression of neural cell adhesion molecule polysialylation state (NCAM PSA), a measure of construct validity, but a complete inability to increase its glycosylation state which is necessary to mount the neuroplastic response associated with effective spatial learning. Finally, in all cases, we found chronic HDAC inhibition, with either pan-specific or HDAC1-3 isoform-specific inhibitors, to significantly ameliorate deficits in both social cognition and its associated neuroplastic response. We conclude that in utero exposure to VPA provides a robust animal model for the social cognitive deficits of ASD and a potential screen for the development of novel therapeutics for this condition.

AB  - Norovirus is a highly infectious pathogen that is commonly found in oysters growing in fecally contaminated waters. Norovirus outbreaks can cause the closure of oyster harvesting waters and acute gastroenteritis in humans associated with consumption of contaminated raw oysters. Extensive efforts and progresses have been made in detection and forecasting of oyster norovirus outbreaks over the past decades. The main objective of this paper is to provide a literature review of methods and techniques for detecting and forecasting oyster norovirus outbreaks and thereby to identify the future directions for improving the detection and forecasting of norovirus outbreaks. It is found that (1) norovirus outbreaks display strong seasonality with the outbreak peak occurring commonly in December-March in the U.S. and April-May in the Europe; (2) norovirus outbreaks are affected by multiple environmental factors, including but not limited to precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, wind, and salinity; (3) various modeling approaches may be employed to forecast norovirus outbreaks, including Bayesian models, regression models, Artificial Neural Networks, and process-based models; and (4) diverse techniques are available for near real-time detection of norovirus outbreaks, including multiplex PCR, seminested PCR, real-time PCR, quantitative PCR, and satellite remote sensing. The findings are important to the management of oyster growing waters and to future investigations into norovirus outbreaks. It is recommended that a combined approach of sensor-assisted real time monitoring and modeling-based forecasting should be utilized for an efficient and effective detection and forecasting of norovirus outbreaks caused by consumption of contaminated oysters.

AB  - The thermophilic bacilli, such as Anoxybacillus flavithermus and Geobacillus spp., are an important group of contaminants in the dairy industry. Although these bacilli are generally not pathogenic, their presence in dairy products is an indicator of poor hygiene and high numbers are unacceptable to customers. In addition, their growth may result in milk product defects caused by the production of acids or enzymes, potentially leading to off-flavours. Dairy thermophiles are usually selected for by the conditions during dairy manufacture. These bacteria are able to grow in sections of dairy manufacturing plants where temperatures reach 40-65 degrees C. Furthermore, because they are spore formers, they are difficult to eliminate. In addition, they exhibit a wide temperature growth range, exhibit a fast growth rate (generation time of approximately 15-20 min) and tend to readily form biofilms. Many strategies have been tested to remove, prevent and/or delay the formation of thermophilic bacilli biofilms in dairy manufacture, but with limited success. This is, in part, because little is known about the structure and composition of thermophilic bacilli biofilms in general and, more specifically, in milk processing environments. Therefore, new cleaning regimes often do not target the problem optimally. A greater understanding of the structure of thermophilic biofilms within the context of the milk processing environment and their link with spore formation is needed to develop better control measures. This review discusses the characteristics and food spoilage potential, enumeration and identification methods for the thermophilic bacilli, as well as their importance to dairy manufacture, with an emphasis on biofilm development and spore formation.

AB  - Vertical distribution and abundance of three numerically dominant krill species (Nyctiphanes simplex, Nematoscelis difficilis, and Euphausia eximia) were surveyed in the Gulf of California to understand the role of oxidative stress in their daily vertical migration (DVM) and zoogeographic patterns. Superoxide radical production, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzyme activities were analyzed from krill collected with stratified nets from the surface down to 200 m during January, July, and October 2007. The upper boundary of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) was significantly shallower during October than during January. N. simplex was always distributed above the hypoxic layers, mostly in coastal upwelling areas. Ne. difficilis and E. eximia were relatively abundant during January, but detected mostly during their ascending migration. N. simplex was the most sensitive species to high temperatures and low oxygen concentrations, showing evidence of oxidative stress during summer (100 times more lipid peroxidation and 30 times more antioxidant enzyme activities than in winter). Ne. difficilis had higher glutathione peroxidase activity than N. simplex, which could facilitate its larger DVM. Low abundance of Ne. difficilis at 100 m during summer suggests that high temperature was also an environmental limiting factor. Oxidative stress indicators could explain the absence of N. simplex and Ne. difficilis in the eastern tropical Pacific and the ability of E. eximia to live in the OMZ and the eastern tropical Pacific. The latter had higher superoxide radical production and smaller lipid peroxidation during October. This suggests that E. eximia antioxidant enzyme activities are enough to avoid oxidative damage when exposed to hypoxic conditions during DVM.

AB  - Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is a critical parameter in the study of river sediment transport and water quality variation, but traditional measurement methods are costly and time-consuming. This paper is focused on presenting a methodology that may be useful in estimating SSC which is of key importance in process geomorphology and hydrology. In previous studies, remote sensing has been applied to estimate the SSC of sea waters as well as low turbid inland waters like lakes, reservoirs and short river reaches visible within a single Landsat satellite image coverage. Rivers, especially highly turbid large rivers, have largely been ignored. The dataset used in this paper includes measured SSC and multi-temporal Landsat ETM+ images covering most part of the Yangtze River. Using an effective easy-to-use atmospheric correction method that does not require in situ atmospheric conditions, retrieved water reflectance of Band 4 was found to be a good SSC indicator within the large SSC range 22-2610 mg l(-1). The newly developed regression relation between SSC and water reflectance of Band 4 appears to be able to provide a relatively accurate SSC estimate directly from Landsat ETM+ images for the Yangtze River from the upper, the middle to the lower reaches. With the relation it is possible to estimate or map out SSC dynamics of large rivers which lack SSC data due to constraints of conventional measurements. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The use of plant water status indicators such as midday stem water potential (psi(stem)) and maximum daily trunk shrinkage (MDS) in irrigation scheduling requires the definition of a reference or threshold value, beyond which irrigation is necessary. These reference values are generally obtained by comparing the seasonal variation of plant water status with the environmental conditions under non-limiting soil water availability. In the present study an alternative approach is presented based on the plant's response to water deficit. A drought experiment was carried out on two apple cultivars (Malus domestica Borkh. 'Mutsu' and 'Cox Orange') in which both indicators (psi(stem) and MDS) were related to several plant physiological responses. Sap flow rates, maximum net photosynthesis rates and daily radial stem growth (DRSG) (derived from continuous stem diameter variation measurements) were considered in the assessment of the approach. Depending on the chosen plant response in relationship with psi(stem) or MDS, the obtained reference values varied between -1.04 and -1.46 MPa for psi(stem) and between 0.17 and 0.28 mm for MDS. In both cultivars, the approach based on maximum photosynthesis rates resulted in less negative psi(stem) values and smaller MDS values, compared to the approaches with sap flow and daily radial stem growth. In the well-irrigated apple trees, day-to-day variations in midday psi(stem) and MDS were related to the evaporative demand. These variations were more substantial for MDS than for midday psi(stem).

AB  - Drought occurs when there is a deficit in soil water supply to the plant. Severe drought limits crop yield by causing the plant's water use to be limited compared with a well-watered crop. Too much water (flooded soils) also causes stress to the plant whose roots are in saturated soil for long periods. Both situations lead to crop water stress, ultimately resulting in reduced crop yield. Since flood and drought can occur intermittently in cropping, an effective yield predictor should contain both flood and drought stress components for better representation of the range of natural conditions the plant might encounter during its growth period. This paper details the modification of the Crop-Specific Drought Index (CSDI) model by introducing a soil saturation factor, resulting in a Crop-Specific Stress Index (CSSI) model. The study was conducted in eastern Nebraska and southeastern Minnesota. The coefficients used in the CSSI model were estimated by a jackknifing procedure based on 1971-2002 climate data, nonirrigated yield data of corn (Zea mays L.), and soil information retrieved from the STATSGO database in the crop districts. Results show that all indicators of agreement between the estimated and actual yields show improvement of the new CSSI model over the old CSDI model in all districts. Results also show that the CSSI model outperforms the CSDI model in years characterized by soil saturation. For instance, the CSDI for 1993 overestimates the relative yield in northeastern Nebraska by about 28% while the CSSI underestimates the 1993 yield by 3%.

AB  - Blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) are an effective indicator species for West Nile virus (WNV) and may be regionally important in surveillance efforts. The sites of WNV replication and sensitivity of virus detection techniques are undefined for blue jays. The objectives of this study were to describe the gross and microscopic pathology associated with natural WNV infection in blue jays, as well as determine the most appropriate tissues to be used for virus isolation, reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques. Blue jays were collected in Georgia, USA, between May and September 2001. Initial screening by virus isolation indicated that 36 of 59 blue jays chosen for evaluation were WNV positive. From this group, 20 positive and five negative birds were chosen to compare virus detection techniques. Six positive and five negative birds were selected for histopathology examination. Splenomegaly and poor body condition were the most consistent gross findings among positive birds. The most consistent histopathologic findings in the tissues of WNV-positive blue jays were rnononuclear leukocytosis and epicarditis/myocarditis. Brain, heart, and lung had the highest viral titers, and WNV antigen was most often detected by IHC in heart, kidney, liver, and lung. Reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction proved to be the most sensitive diagnostic test applied in this study irrespective of the tissue type. Brain tissue could be used effectively for both virus isolation and RT-nPCR, and this tissue is simple to remove and process. The success of IHC is highly dependent on tissue selection, and the use of multiple tissues including heart, kidney, liver, or lung is recommended.

AB  - In potable water reuse, treated wastewater becomes part of the drinking water supply. An important question associated with this practice is whether or not the organic quality of the treated wastewater is chemically different from that of non-human impacted water. This question was addressed in a case study of indirect potable water reuse where the organic matrix of the South Platte River was analyzed upstream and downstream of the discharge of treated wastewater effluent using conventional water quality parameters combined with pyrolysis-GC/MS. Effluent-derived organic material (EfOM) was found to be more aliphatic and had higher organic nitrogen and halogen content compared to organic material derived from "natural" (non-anthropogenic) sources (NOM). Seasonal changes that resulted from the change in the contributions of aquatic and terrestrial sources were not observed in EFOM; but they were strongly observed in NOM under the control of natural processes. Using principal component and factor analyses, the pyrolysis fragments of phenol, alkyl-phenols, and acetic acid were identified as the seasonal indicators for the NOM set of samples. In contrast, benzaldehyde, benzonitrile, chlorobutanoic acid, furancarboxaldehyde, and methylfurancarboxaldehyde were identified as the indicators for wastewater inputs for the EFOM set of samples. Overall, the results from conventional water quality parameters and pyrolysis-GC/MS revealed that: (1) EfOM bears a chemical signature distinct from NOM and (2) under the conditions of this study, EfOM discharged to the South Platte River persisted and controlled organic quality at downstream points.

AB  - Monitoring vast landscapes has, from the beginning of rangeland management, depended on people's judgements. This is no longer tenable, but a more effective method has yet to be devised. The problem is how to do an economical inventory that will detect ecologically important change over extensive land areas with acceptable error rates. The error risk is a function of adequate sample numbers and distribution for each indicator monitored. Of all of the indicators identified for monitoring, ground cover and its inverse, bare ground, may be the most discussed. Ground-cover measurements address soil stability and watershed function which are first-priority ecological concerns; are well adapted to remote sensing frameworks thus allowing extensive, unbiased, economical sampling; and, the measurements, especially when done by computer image analysis, have the potential to reduce or avoid the human-judgement factor. Data collection through remote sensing appears the most logical approach to acquiring appropriately distributed information over large areas in short time periods and on random sites far removed from easy ground access. The value of satellite and high-altitude sensors for landscape-level evaluations, such as plant community distribution, is well established but these tools are inadequate for inventory and measurement of details needed for valid conclusions about range condition. New advances in low-altitude remote sensing may give us the ability to accurately measure bare ground and perhaps other indicators. Combining information from high and low-altitude sensors appears to offer an optimal path for developing a practical system for cost-effective, data-based, rangeland monitoring and management.

AB  - Growing altricial birds may experience nutritional stress in the nest due to sibling competition, food restriction, or parasites. Nutritional stress may be detected through its effect on nestling growth, although genetic and maternal effects may interfere with its expression. A more direct way of estimating nutritional stress may be through measurements of organismic stress in growing birds. Heterophillymphocyte ratios (H/L) have been proposed as reliable physiological indicators of the stress response. Heat-shock protein (HSP) synthesis is induced by animals in response to various stressors, making the concentration of HSPs a suitable measure of organismic stress. In a study of growing pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), we assessed H/L from cell counts in blood smears and levels of two HSPs, HSP60 and HSP70, from the cell fraction of peripheral blood. H/L and the level of HSP60 were significantly positively associated in nestlings of 13 days of age, while the level of HSP70 was not related to the other two measures. Small nestlings with respect to tarsus length on day 7 had higher levels of HSP60 and higher H/L values. Brood means of nestling mass, tarsus length, and wing length shortly before fledging were negatively related to both mean HSP60 level and mean H/L ratio. Brood variances in body mass and wing length on day 13 were positively associated with mean HSP60 levels but not with mean H/L values. Up to 80% of variation in some traits was explained by stress indicators.

AB  - Several studies have shown the relevance of satellite systems in detecting, monitoring, and characterizing fire events as support to fire management activities. On the other hand, up to now, only a few satellite-based platforms provide immediately and easily usable information about events in progress, in terms of both hotspots, which identify and localize active fires, and the danger conditions of the affected area. However, this kind of information is usually provided through separated layers, without any synthetic indicator which, indeed, could be helpful, if timely provided, for planning the priority of the intervention of firefighting resources in case of concurrent fires. In this study, we try to fill these gaps by presenting an Integrated Satellite System (ISS) for fire detection and prioritization, mainly based on the Robust Satellite Techniques (RST), and the Fire Danger Dynamic Index (FDDI), an original re-structuration of the indice Combinado de Risco de Incendio Florestal (ICRIF), for the first time presented here. The system, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) data, provides near real-time integrated information about both the fire presence and danger over the affected area. These satellite-based products are generated in common formats, ready to be ingested in Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies. Results shown and discussed here, on the occasion of concurrent winter and summer fires in Italy, in agreement with information from independent sources, demonstrate that the ISS system, operating at a regional/national scale, may provide an important contribution to fire prioritization. This may result in the mitigation of fire impact in populated areas, infrastructures, and the environment.

AB  - This study deals with organic matter in the Early Jurassic Datta shale in the Upper Indus Basin, Pakistan. Organic geochemical and microscopic techniques were used to investigate organic matter input, environmental condi-tions of deposition as well as petroleum generation potential. The geochemical results suggest that the shales display mainly fair to good source rock generation potential, with poor petroleum generation potential in some samples. The HI varies between 32 and 519 mg HC/g TOC, with many of the samples appearing to be mainly Type II and mixed Type II-III kerogen, and thereby exhibiting the ability to generate both oil and gas. The dominance of such Type II kerogen in some samples is consistent with the high HI values (>300 mg HC/ g TOC) and high fluorescence alginite macerals. A section of the shale within the Datta Formation appears to be gas-prone, with HI values of less than 200 mg HC/g TOC. Biomarkers also indicate the presence of mixed organic matter of planktonic/bacterial and land plant input, which were deposited in a marine environment under relatively oxic conditions. The biomarker characteristics of the extracted shales correlate well with those of the oil from the Chanda Oilfield, indicating that the Datta shales are likely to be the effective source rock. This is supported by the thermal maturity, which ranges from moderate to peak-maturity, as indicated by vitrinite reflectance values of 0.69-0.82%, and the biomarker maturity indicators.

AB  - This paper focuses on the experimental study and comparative analysis of characteristics, boundary conditions and ignition behavior of slurry fuels prepared from peat, coal processing waste (slime and filter cake), and lignite. Waste turbine oil (with a fraction of 10%) was an additional combustible component. The use of waste oils in waste-derived blends can provide a significant increase in the integral characteristics of fuel ignition as well as increase its calorific value. We measured the ignition delay times, duration of burning, ignition temperatures, peak combustion temperatures, and emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. These characteristics are fundamental for designing the production areas involving fuel supply, atomization, and combustion, as well as flue gas treatment. The experiments were conducted using a lab-scale furnace and small fuel portions. The relative efficiency ratios (considering energy, environmental, and cost criteria) of waste-derived blends were evaluated relative to conventional fuels, such as coal and fuel oil. We established that the most promising fuel slurries have a heterogeneous composition and consist of milled coal, slime, and peat. The averaged efficiency indicator of the studied mixtures varies in the range of 1.6-9.5 (versus coal) and 3.9-30.2 (versus fuel oil). In accordance with experimental data and calculations, the fuel consisting of 30% filter cake, 20% coal slime, and 50% water has the greatest potential in terms of a combination of energy, environmental, and cost criteria. The data obtained can be used to develop waste-to-energy technologies as well as to rationalize the involvement of low-rank fuels and wastes into the energy sector.

AB  - Despite growing milk demand and imports, market-oriented milk production and formal processing in Ethiopia is limited to areas around Addis Ababa, notwithstanding its competing land use demand. This study assessed biophysical and market potential for developing the dairy sector, characterizing Ethiopian dairy clusters. Biophysical data from geographic information system (GIS) sources and information from key informants were combined in mapping and ranking these clusters on milk production potential. Twenty-four indicators in six major categories were applied for this assessment: feed availability, environmental conditions for dairy cattle, current production status, access to inputs and services, output market access, and production expansion potential. Feed availability (fodder, crop residues, and agro-industrial by-products as well as land availability and affordability) were the main drivers for dairy development, followed by the current production status, mainly driven by number of (improved) dairy cattle and (formal) milk volumes. Dairy clusters close to Addis Ababa had the highest overall scores for development potential, mainly determined by local demand and access to inputs. For dairy sustainable dairy development in Ethiopia, companies seeking long-term opportunities may avoid the Addis Ababa area and develop dairy production and processing in other clusters especially in Amhara and Tigray regions, with good milk production potential but less developed market infrastructure. The combination of biophysical data and key informant knowledge offered key strengths in delivering valuable results within a short time span. It however requires a careful selection of knowledgeable key informants whose expertise cover a broad scope of the dairy value chain.

AB  - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is among the most common inner ear diseases. Although BPPV is one of the most common causes of dizziness, its pathogenesis remains unknown. Air pollutants might reach the middle ear through the eustachian tube and be absorbed into the inner ear through the round window membrane, increasing the risk of BPPV. We investigated the relationship between air pollution and BPPV risk. Data were extracted from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database, which contains health claims information of the entire South Korean population. Variables of interest included the number of patients diagnosed with BPPV in Seoul, South Korea, patients' clinical and demographic characteristics, and osteopenia status. Seoul's daily air pollution indicators, including SO2, CO, O-3, NO2, PM10, and PM2.5, were obtained from the Korea Environment Corporation website. Overdispersed Poisson regression analysis was performed. In the multivariable analysis, NO2 air concentration (ppb) was associated with increased incidence of BPPV. In analysis stratified by gender, levels of NO2 were associated with increased incidence of BPPV in both men and women. In the analysis stratified by age, NO2 air concentration was associated with increased incidence of BPPV among all adults over the age of 19 years. In the analysis stratified by osteopenia status, NO2 was associated with increased incidence of BPPV in patients with and without osteopenia. Air levels of NO2 were associated with increased incidence of BPPV in the present study. This finding contributes toward a better understanding of BPPV pathogenesis and improved prevention and management of this condition.

The average concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in 22 surface water samples and 14 sediment samples were 90.07 ng/L and 80.65 ng/g dw, respectively. Sixteen types of OCPs, dominated by HCHs, DDTs and heptachlor, were detected in the Dongting Lake. The relationships of OCP residues between Dongting Lake and its tributary rivers have been discussed and the hydraulic connections with the Yangtze River and the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) were also considered. Results showed that the shortage of runoff, earlier dry season, and reduction of sediment deposition extremely deteriorated the hydraulic conditions, magnified the water cycle, and restrained the self-purification of OCPs. The n-ary sumation OCPs in surface water were concentrated in the inlets of Yangtze River, Lishui River, Zishui River, Yuanshui River, and Xiangjiang River. Moreover, the n-ary sumation OCPs in the outlet of the Yangtze River also maintained a high level, indicating that OCPs posed adverse effects on the Yangtze River. Risk assessments of OCPs in the surface water of Dongting Lake were estimated according to available water quality guidelines and health risk assessment models. The results indicated that OCPs in the surface water of Dongting Lake were safe for aquatic organisms and human health. In addition, sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) were also applied to evaluate the potential ecotoxicological risks of OCPs in sediments. The results presented that contaminants of gamma-HCH; o,p '-DDD; and dieldrin in sediment had adverse effects on benthic organisms, indicating that fundamental solutions should be proposed to control OCP contamination in Dongting Lake.

AB  - In the European Union, the built environment is responsible for more than the 25% of all waste generated, highlighting the need to adopt circular practices. To indicate the level of circularity, common indicators mainly focus on: 1) the amount of virgin materials, 2) the amount of unrecoverable waste, and 3) the product lifetime. However, a holistic methodology covering the macro (material impact), meso (supply chain) and micro level (design) is still to be fully developed. In this research, two indicators - the Building Circularity Indicator (BCI) and the novel Predictive BCI (PBCI) - combine the Material Circularity Indicator with Embodied Energy (EE), Embodied CO2 (EC) analyses and Design for Disassembly (DfD) criteria. A full and simplified version are tested for different case studies in different climate zones in the EU. EE ranges between 1.49 GJ/m(2) and 7.60 GJ/m(2), while EC between 0.15 tCO(2)/m(2) and 0.73 tCO(2)/m(2). In the full version, the BCI and PBCI ranges respectively from 0.23 and 0.28 to 0.04 and 0.10 with regard to mass, EE and EC. The simplified version ranges between 0.10 and 0.62, revealing to be a more accurate indicator when data are available for only a few dozen components. To enable comparisons among different buildings, results show how different interpretations of the DfD criteria affect the BCI, highlighting the need to indicate strict boundary conditions, a minimum number of evaluated components, and precise criteria on how the DfD criteria relate to either a material, a subcomponent/component, or its relationship to its context.

AB  - Balanites aegyptiaca is a characteristic and emblematic tree species native to the dry zones of Africa and Asia. It has considerable socio-economic importance throughout its natural range of distribution because of its multiple uses. Despite this, the technological properties of its wood are not well known, hence sometimes inappropriate uses but potential for others. In order to match applications to characteristics of the wood, we determined physical stability indicators (density, infradensity, total radial shrinkage, total tangential shrinkage, total volumetric shrinkage and fibre saturation point) and mechanical behaviour indicators (longitudinal modulus of elasticity, bending strength and compression strength). Ninety-three specimens taken from 13 trees from the Sahelian and Sudanian zones in Chad and the Sahelian zone in Senegal were tested. Our results show that B. aegyptiaca wood from these three provenances is medium-heavy (797 kg/m(3)) with moderate dimensional stability: shrinkage anisotropy is above 2 (2.2) and total radial and tangential shrinkage rates are medium at 4 % and 8.5 % respectively. Its mechanical characteristics are medium (static bending and compression strength at 49.4 MPa and 104.5 MPa respectively) to weak (longitudinal modulus of elasticity at 10,473 MPa). A comparison of the results obtained according to the provenance of the specimens showed variable tendencies depending on the characteristics analysed, although the variations between the three provenances are limited. Our study results show that the use of B. aegyptiaca wood as a material could be appropriate for a wider range of purposes, on condition that suitable management methods are in place with a view to their restoration by planting.

AB  - Straw biochar could improve the water holding capacity effectivity of salinized soil, increase soil fertili, enhance crop yield, reduce greenhouse gas emission, and mitigate climate change. The mechanism of using straw biochar for soil improvement is different under various climate and soil texture conditions. To explore the mechanism of using straw biochar to improve soil and its influence on crop yield in the typical arid and semi-arid, a large temperature difference between day and night, soil temperature at different depths, and physiological changes and crop yield of maize at different growth stages were studied. It is assumed that straw biochar can improve the properties of salinized soil including physicochemical indexes, and crop physiological index, stimulates the positive circulation between soil, vegetation, and microorganisms, and plays a role in improving soil quality. The results showed that biochar application increased the average soil temperature (T) by 2 degrees C and reduced day-night T differences. Application of 30 t/ha biochar increased the average maize leaf T by 2.2 degrees C and photosynthetic rate by 16.5%. Furthermore, the average transpiration rate doubled compared to control, and the chlorophyll value increased by 21%. The application of biochar improved the utilization rate of nitrogen fertilizer by enhancing ammonification. Biochar application caused a maximum overall yield increase of 11.9% compared to control treatment (CK). Therefore, these results provide a practical basis for improving weakly alkaline farmland soils in arid and semi-arid areas, and provide an effective method to potentially mitigate the environmental crisis and promote sustainable development in agriculture.

AB  - The article is focused on examining the characteristics of alcohol consumption among working women with high social and educational status. The aim of the work is to consider the features of alcoholic behavior of business women - top and middle managers and business owners. The choice of this social group of women is due to the fact that significant negative processes of change in alcoholic behavior occur precisely in this group of women, but in the most hidden way. The situation with the involvement of business women in alcohol consumption is analyzed on the basis of quantitative and qualitative studies conducted by the team of Sector of Sociology of Deviant Behavior of ISRAS - FCTAS RAS. The objectives of the study are to determine the regularity and intensity of alcohol consumption by business women, the structure of alcoholic beverages they consume, the nature of intoxication; to study factors contributing to the alcoholization of business women, attitudes towards alcohol, motives of consumption. It has been shown that business women, in terms of many indicators of alcohol behavior, represent a risk group, characterized by increased alcoholism. The factors contributing to alcoholization of business women are identified, the role of alcohol in their lives is considered, as well as the motives of consumption. The analysis made it possible to identify several social functions of alcohol consumed by business women: alcohol as a resource in professional activities, and alcohol as a way to cope with life difficulties, stress. New patterns of alcoholic behavior of business women represent a form of strategic adaptation to the changed conditions of life.

AB  - Measuring well-being and living conditions at local level is essential for policy makers who wish to study inequalities and formulate targeted and effective economic and social intervention policies. In Italy, the available official statistics in this field are usually provided at regional level and several studies have been carried out in order to obtain the estimates of those measures at disaggregated level, which is done in order to obtain estimations at provincial level. However, due the heterogeneity of these phenomena within each province, it is important to possess data at micro-territorial level, that is at the municipality level, in order to study and monitor territorial development and inequalities in depth.This paper proposes an estimation of household consumption expenditure, one of the most important indicator of the economic material well-being of an area, for the 7893 Italian municipalities.To this end, the cokriging spatial interpolation technique was employed in order to explore its potentialities. This method is normally used in natural sciences to predict variables of interest at micro territorial level, using available sample data or population aggregates, analysing their spatial dependence and introducing information on auxiliary correlated variables available at micro level. In this study, the available information on household consumption expenditure at provincial level was combined with the data on taxable income at municipality level as auxiliary variable.The evaluation of model performance enabled us to confirm the validity of this approach to obtain a more detailed picture of the local systems for which intervention policies are important.

AB  - The abundance of the saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica tatarica L., 1766) in the Northwest Pre-Caspian region has remained at an extremely low level over the past 20 years. Comparison of some biological parameters of the population for periods with different numbers of animals made it possible to reveal a number of low-population features. Thus, along with a decrease in the number of saigas (from 800 000 heads in 1958 to 4500 in 2016), its habitat area also decreased (from 60 000-70 000 to 2000-3000 km(2), respectively), and a significant part of the population transitioned to a sedentary lifestyle in the protected areas of the Chernye Zemli ecoregion. A long-time deficiency of sexually mature males in the population (less than 10%) led to a decrease in its growth and, consequently, to a decrease in its number. At the same time, the total fecundity of females decreased (from 1.27 +/- 0.25 calves in years of high abundance to 0.92 +/- 0.39 recently) due to an increase in barrenness in different age groups caused by the lack of males in the population. Males prevail over females in newborns (51.9 and 48.1%, respectively). The increased weight of newborn saiga calves (100 g on average for both males and females) and their decreased mortality in the first days after birth (under favorable weather conditions) indirectly indicate the normal course of embryogenesis and a sufficient quantity and quality of feed. An increase in the proportion of sexually mature stags will lead to an increase in the population number, as the reproductive functions of the population practically did not change during the period of its depression.

AB  - Faecal pollution modelling is a valuable tool to evaluate and improve water management strategies, especially in a context of water scarcity. The reduction dynamics of five faecal indicator organisms (E, coli, spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia, somatic coliphages, GA17 bacteriophages and a human-specific Bifidobacterium molecular marker) were assessed in an intermittent Mediterranean stream affected by a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Using Bayesian inverse modelling, the decay rates of each indicator were correlated with two environmental drivers (temperature and streamflow downstream of the WWTP) and the generated model was used to evaluate the self-depuration distance (SDD) of the stream. A consistent increase of 1-2 log(10) in the concentration of all indicators was detected after the discharge of the WWTP effluent. The decay rates showed seasonal variation, reaching a maximum in the dry season, when SDDs were also shorter and the stream had a higher capacity to self-depurate. High seasonality was observed for all faecal indicators except for the spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia. The maximum SDD ranged from 3 km for the spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia during the dry season and 15 km for the human-specific Bifidobacterium molecular marker during the wet season. The SDD provides a single standardized metric that integrates and compares different contamination indicators. It could be extended to other Mediterranean drainage basins and has the potential to integrate changes in land use and catchment water balance, a feature that will be especially useful in the transient climate conditions expected in the coming years.

AB  - For any given territory, disaster risk is a function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. The conceptual frameworks for these dimensions are largely debated in the scientific studies, focusing on spatial and temporal references and on system perspective of risk assessment. Despite broad in their scope, the analytical frameworks proposed to analyse policy programmes to reduce risk generally miss that risk indicators should be grounded on geographical and spatial features of the neighbouring territories and not only on communities' behaviour, and their resilience, as the paradigmatic solution in front of system events in areas prone to natural multi-hazard. The definition of "community" and of "neighbourhood" that are relevant for risk assessment cannot be simply defined in terms of absolute size of population or economic activity of individual local units under analysis or of the formal aggregation provided by jurisdictional agreements on specific functions. The paper presents an empirical analysis on spatially-lagged data in Italy, which was massively hit by adverse natural events in the last decade. It suggests to focus on social and material vulnerability, by using the comprehensive indicator at municipality level elaborated by the Italian Institute of Statistics. At the municipality-level, the analysis shows a positive correlation between multi-hazards, on the one hand, and spatially-lagged exposure and vulnerability, on the other. Thus, conditions in neighbouring municipalities would matter in prioritizing policy interventions aiming at mitigating hazard impacts, reducing vulnerability and enhancing communities' resilience. The definition of significant neighbouring spaces opens to a conceptualization of vulnerability grounded on a relational perspective in the creation of collective goods. This could enhance more effective Disaster Risk Reduction programmes.

AB  - The effects of herbivores and sediment deposition on the structure and composition of the macroalgal communities on coral reefs were tested together experimentally and, in the field, in one of the most disturbed reefs of the Caribbean, the leeward reefs of the Bocas del Toro region, Panama. In this area, the potential natural herbivores have been replaced by small-bodied herbivores, mainly the urchin Echinometra viridis, and sediment deposition has increased as a result of land use in the zones close to the reefs. Experimental studies consisted of herbivorous exclusion and artificial increase in sediment deposition; while, in different sites of the studied area, relationships between macroalgal communities, herbivore abundance and sediment deposition were examined in situ. Both approaches suggest that changes on macroalgal species and the structure of the communities are mediated by herbivores and sediment deposition. The experimental approach showed an interaction between the studied factors. Sediment deposition, at the levels used in the experiment, did not limit the grazing of E. viridis. This urchin controlled the development of communities, mainly the erect macroalgae, independently of the level of sediment deposition tested. However, with the treatment of herbivores present and increase of sediment deposition, Ceramiales turf replaced cyanophytes. This contrasted with our findings in the field, where extreme values of sediment deposition coincided with minimal urchin populations. These last conditions favoured communities dominated by erect macroalgae, but their composition and abundance differ from those of communities that develop under low herbivory and low sedimentation because the deposited sediments also influence the community structure.

AB  - At a global scale, delta morphologies are subject to rapid change as a result of direct and indirect effects of human activity. This jeopardizes the ecosystem services of deltas, including protection against flood hazards, facilitation of navigation, and biodiversity. Direct manifestations of delta morphological instability include river bank failure, which may lead to avulsion, persistent channel incision or aggregation, and a change of the sedimentary regime to hyperturbid conditions. Notwithstanding the in-depth knowledge developed over the past decades about those topics, existing understanding is fragmented, and the predictive capacity of morphodynamic models is limited. The advancement of potential resilience analysis tools may proceed from improved models, continuous observations, and the application of novel analysis techniques. Progress will benefit from synergy between approaches. Empirical and numerical models are built using field observations, and, in turn, model simulations can inform observationists about where to measure. Information theory offers a systematic approach to test the realism of alternative model concepts. Once the key mechanism responsible for a morphodynamic instability phenomenon is understood, concepts from dynamic system theory can be employed to develop early warning indicators. In the development of reliable tools to design resilient deltas, one of the first challenges is to close the sediment balance at multiple scales, such that morphodynamic model predictions match with fully independent measurements. Such a high ambition level is rarely adopted and is urgently needed to address the ongoing global changes causing sea level rise and reduced sediment input by reservoir building.

AB  - High-altitude ecosystems are found in mountain chains and plateaus worldwide. These areas tend to be underrepresented in insect biodiversity assessments because of the challenges related to systematic survey at these elevations, such as extreme climatic and geographic conditions. Nonetheless, high-altitude ecosystems are of paramount importance because they have been seen to be species pumps for other geographic areas, such as adjacent locations, functioning as buffers for population declines. Moreover, these ecosystems and their biodiversity have been proposed to be fast-responding indicators of the impacts caused by global climate change. Bees have been highlighted among the insect groups that have been affected by these problems. This work used bees as a proxy to demonstrate and reinforce the importance of systematic surveys of high-altitude ecosystems. Here, field collections were undertaken and an updated review was conducted for the native bee biodiversity of the high-altitude ecosystem found at the Andes system of central Chile, including the phenological trends of these insects during the flowering season. Of the 58 species that have been described for this location, we were able to confirm the occurrence of 46 of these species as a result of our sampling. In addition, thanks to these recent collections, a new species of Xeromelissa Cockerell is described in the present work. These findings highlight the need for further high-altitude insect surveys of this biome, which include both temporal and spatial complexity in their design, to allow for accurate assessment of bee species diversity and compositional changes in these mountain regions.

AB  - Introduction. The article reflects the authors' system for calculating the level and quality of digitalization of the educational process in Russian universities. This task is actualized by a number of circumstances of modern realities. The need to create a digital twin / double for each university has become a trend due to the importance of providing applicants, students and graduates with the most accessible educational environment. The high-quality digital environment of a university during the spread of pandemics is an important condition for maintaining the stability of the educational process. Today, the ability of universities to quickly adapt the digital educational space to the needs of distance learning is a significant sign of the viability and quality of the management staff of higher education institutions. Methods and materials. To develop the system, the authors used a mathematical tool - the method of summary indicators for calculating the level of digitalization of universities, which allows to evaluate various characteristics of the value, efficiency and quality of objects with a significant number of different parameters. Analysis. To develop indicators - basic rating indicators - the authors used the results of a preliminary study of the best practices of digitalization of the university environment of leading foreign and Russian universities. The system takes into account the needs for digitalization of the educational environment of three different categories: applicants, students and graduates. Results. The introduction of the rating into the Russian practice will allow to justify a system of recommendations to university administrations to improve the level and quality of their digitalization of the educational process.

AB  - To detect the large-scale spatial pattern of the benthic macroinvertebrate communities and the relationship with their environment on the East China Sea shelf, forty sites were sampled for benthic macroinvertebrates and environmental variables during August and September 2015. A total of 12529 benthic macroinvertebrate individuals and 274 species were collected, with crustaceans being predominant, followed by mollusks. Four communities were identified by hierarchical agglomerative cluster (HAC) analysis and cross-verified by nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination: an Inshore community (IC); a Transitional community (TC); a Northern offshore community (NOC); and a Southern offshore community (SOC). Significant differences in their community structure were found by permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). The indicator species varied among the four communities, with Solenocera crassicornis, Sternaspis scutata and Virgularia sp. dominating IC, Solenocera koelbeli, Trachysalambria curvirostris and Nitidotellina valtonis dominating TC, Parapenaeus fissuroides, Onustus exutus and Drachiella morum dominating NOC, and Heikeopsis japonica, Solenocera pectinulata and Actiniaria dominating SOC. Significant differences among communities were detected for species number (S), Margalef's index (d), Pielou's index (J'), Hill's number (N-infinity), total taxonomic distinctness (S Delta(+)), average phylogenetic diversity (Phi(+)), total phylogenetic diversity (S Phi(+)) and abundance through statistical analyses. The redundancy analysis (RDA) model revealed that turbidity, silicate and depth were significant environmental variables influencing the benthic macroinvertebrates. Variation partitioning (VPA) showed that water characteristics had a greater impact than sediment conditions on the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates in the East China Sea.

AB  - The increasing presence of intermittent distributed generation (DG) based on renewable energy sources (RESs) is heavily affecting the operation and management of modern distribution grids. Even though the use of distributed energy storage systems (DESSs) and the integration of advanced demand response (DR) programs are expected to mitigate this problem, security, safety, economic, and technical reasons are limiting the tests of these mechanisms in working systems. The test in simulation and emulation environments has proved to be an effective solution for the development of advanced control and protection schema, but their use for the simulation of the typically unpredictable behavior of end-users seems at least questionable. This paper proposes a testing framework for the analysis of experimental control strategies of distributed energy systems. The framework, based on a service-oriented architecture, can be easily interconnected to different systems, including renewable generators and storage systems. This framework can be used to analyze the performance of real energy systems, working in near-to-real conditions. The framework has been used for a pilot test on a subset of the facilities of the eLUX laboratory of the University of Brescia. The proposed framework allows analyzing the energy performance of this system by means of proper key performance indicators (KPIs). The efficiency analysis of a battery energy storage system (BESS) is presented, by proposing KPIs to evaluate the effect of different control strategies. Further KPIs are also used to evaluate the effectiveness of the BESS for improving the energy self-consumption of a photovoltaic system.

AB  - Understanding the extent to which captivity generates maladaptation in wild species can inform species recovery programs and elucidate wild population responses to novel environmental change. Although rarely quantified, effective population size (N-e) and genetic diversity should influence the magnitude of plastic and genetic changes manifested in captivity that reduce wild fitness. Sexually dimorphic traits might also mediate consequences of captivity. To evaluate these relationships, we generated >600 full- and half-sibling families from nine wild brook trout populations, reared them for one generation under common, captive environmental conditions and contrasted several fitness-related traits in wild versus captive lines. We found substantial variation in lifetime success (lifetime survival and reproductive success) and life history traits among wild populations after just one captive generation (fourteen- and threefold ranges across populations, respectively). Populations with lower heterozygosity showed lower captive lifetime success, suggesting that captivity generates maladaptation within one generation. Greater male-biased mortality in captivity occurred in populations having disproportionately higher growth rates in males than females. Wild population N-e and allelic diversity had little or no influence on captive trait expression and lifetime success. Our results have four conservation implications: (i) Trait values and lifetime success were highly variable across populations following one generation of captivity. (ii) Maladaptation induced by captive breeding might be particularly intense for the very populations practitioners are most interested in conserving, such as those with low heterozygosity. (iii) Maladaptive sex differences in captivity might be associated with population-dependent growth costs of reproduction. (iv) Heterozygosity can be a good indicator of short-term, intraspecific responses to novel environmental change.

AB  - Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) synthesize magnetite and greigite crystals under low oxygen conditions in the water column or uppermost sediment (greigite-producing bacteria are found below the oxic-anoxic transition). Dissolved iron and oxygen contents in local environments are known to be limiting factors for the production and preservation of biogenic magnetite. Understanding the processes that link MTB to their living environments is fundamental to reconstructing past chemical variations in the water column and sediment, and for using the magnetic properties of biogenic magnetite as environmental proxy indicators. Previous studies have suggested that the frequently identified biogenic soft (BS) and biogenic hard (BH) magnetite types are associated with equant and more elongated morphologies, respectively, and that their abundance varies in accordance with sedimentary oxygen content, where MTB that produce the BH component live in less oxygenated environments. We test this hypothesis in a high-resolution integrated environmental magnetic and geochemical study of surface sediments from Mamangua Ria, SE Brazil. Based on magnetic and pore water profiles, we demonstrate that both the BS and BH components occur within microaerobic environments and that as sediment oxygen content decreases with depth, the BS component disappears before the BH component. With continued burial into the sulfidic diagenetic zone, both components undergo progressive dissolution, but the BH component is more resistant to dissolution than the BS component. Our observations confirm previous inferences about the relative stability of these phases and provide a firmer basis for use of these two types of biogenic magnetite as paleoenvironmental proxies.

AB  - Acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) is a serine hydrolase, whose main function is to modulate neurotransmission at cholinergic synapses. It is, therefore, the primary target of some pesticides and heavy metals. Its inhibition in aquatic organisms has been used as an indicator of the presence of these pollutants in water bodies. The present study aimed to characterize physicochemical and kinetic parameters of brain AChE in the benthic fish Hoplosternum littorale and to analyze the in vitro effects of pesticides (dichlorvos, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, parathion-methyl, temephos, carbaryl, carbofuran, aldicarb, diflubenzuron, novaluron and pyriproxyfen) and metal ions (As-+(3), Cd2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, K+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Zn2+) investigating the potential of this enzyme as environmental biomarker based on current regulations. Specific substrates and inhibitors have indicated AChE to be the predominant cholinesterase (ChE) in the brain of H. littorale. Peak activity was observed at pH 8.0 and 30 degrees C. The enzymatic activity is otherwise moderately thermostable (approximate to 50% activity at 45 degrees C). The enzyme can reduce the activation energy of acetylthiocholine hydrolysis reaction to 8.34 kcal mol(-1) while reaching a rate enhancement of 10(6). Among the pesticides under study, dichlorvos presented an IC50 value below the maximum concentrations allowed by legislation. This study presents the first report on the inhibition of brain AChE activity from Siluriformes by the pesticides novaluron and pyriproxyfen. Mercury ion also exerted a strong inhibitory effect on its enzymatic activity. The H. littorale enzyme thus has the potential to function as an in vitro biomarker for the presence of the pesticide dichlorvos as well as mercury in areas of mining and industrial discharge.

AB  - Triggered by decreases in photoperiod and temperature, evergreen needle-leaved trees in the boreal region downregulate photosynthetic activity and enter dormancy in autumn. Accompanying changes in canopy structure and chlorophyll content are small and precede the cessation of photosynthetic activity. Low solar elevation and cloud cover during this period pose additional challenges for the use of optical satellite instruments. Alternatively, environmental variables that correlate with photosynthesis, such as soil freeze, can be detected from satellite microwave observations independent of weather and illumination conditions. We tested for the first time the usability of satellite-observed soil freeze from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) instrument as a proxy indicator for the end of vegetation active period (VAPend) at six eddy covariance sites in Finland and Canada. The time when soil freeze commenced over the large SMOS pixel can be employed to estimate VAPend (R-2=0.84, RMSE=7.5days), defined as the time when the photosynthetic capacity of the forest drops below 10% of the growing season maximum. In comparison to satellite-based soil freeze timing, an air temperature-based proxy from ERA-Interim reanalysis data showed better performance (R-2=0.92, RMSE=5.2days). VAPend was mapped in the boreal forest zone in Finland and Canada from both indicators based on linear regression models.

AB  - Rivers worldwide are impacted by human activities such as habitat degradation, habitat fragmentation, waterway flow regulation, and introduction of exotic species, which are responsible for the reduction or the disappearance of native species in many parts of the world. The Oglio River, a tributary of the Po River in Northern Italy, is a good example of a river with a long history of human alteration and where exotic invasions are present. We used data on water parameters and fish communities along the watercourse to investigate whether low flow conditions, degraded water quality, abundant exotic species, and the presence of migration barriers could be a disadvantage for native species. We used ordination methods (redundancy analysis), variance partitioning analysis, and the threshold indicator taxa analysis to explore changes in community composition and ecofunctional traits along an altitude gradient. We found that exotic species affected native ones more than water quality and hydromorphological parameters. Native species were most abundant in the upper reach of the Oglio River, despite low flow and shallow depth. Moreover, rheophilic and clear water native fish decreased rapidly in the lower reach of the river, where exotic species increased. This distribution could be explained by the presence of barriers in the middle reach, which block exotic species migrating upstream from the highly invaded Po River, and by a lower suitability of the upper reach for some exotic species. Our results provide a general description of the fish fauna of a strongly regulated river and can contribute to develop more effective fish and water management practices.

AB  - Accurately mapping, modeling, and managing the diversity of wetlands present in estuaries often relies on habitat classification systems that consistently identify differences in biotic structure or other ecosystem characteristics between classes. We used field data from four Oregon estuaries to test for differences in vegetation structure and edaphic characteristics among three tidal emergent marsh classes derived from National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) data: low estuarine marsh, high estuarine marsh, and tidal palustrine marsh. Independently of NWI class, we also evaluated the number and types of plant assemblages present and how edaphic variables, non-native plant cover, and plant species richness varied among them. Pore water salinity varied most strongly across marsh classes, with sediment carbon and nitrogen content, grain size and marsh surface elevation showing smaller differences. Cover of common vascular plant species differed between marsh classes and overall vegetation composition was somewhat distinct among marsh types. High estuarine marsh had the largest species pools. However, plot-level plant diversity was similar among marsh classes. Non-native species cover was highest in tidal palustrine and high estuarine marshes. The marshes in the study contained a large number of plant assemblages with most occurring across more than one marsh class. The more common assemblages occurred along a continuum of tidal elevation, soil salinity, and edaphic characteristics, with varying plant richness and non-native cover. Our data suggest that NWI classes are useful for differentiating several general features of Oregon tidal marsh structure, but that more detailed information on plant assemblages found within those wetland classes would allow more precise characterization of additional wetland features such as edaphic conditions and plant diversity.

AB  - Over the past few decades, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations have increased within streams of the central Rockies, a pattern linked to regional N deposition trends. As NO3-N concentrations increase, in-stream biological demand may become saturated and stream N export may increase. In mountain landscapes, streams generally flow through steep, narrow valleys with limited riparian area and strong stream-hillslope connectivity. Interspersed between the narrow valleys are wide segments where substantial floodplain riparian areas can develop. Here, we coupled measures of stream reach NO3-N flux balances with nutrient enrichment experiments along two stream reaches of contrasting valley morphology in Rocky Mountain National Park. The stream reaches were (1) a narrow valley segment with limited floodplain riparian area and (2) a longitudinally adjacent (directly downstream) wide valley segment with extensive floodplain riparian area. We found that in-stream biological uptake of added NO3-N was limited in both segments, presumably as a consequence of saturating conditions. Assessment of mass flux indicated that the narrow valley segment was a consistent source of water and NO3-N across flow states, while the wide segment was a sink at high flow and a source at low flow. Due to low in-stream biological retention, gross gains and losses of water and NO3-N to and from the stream exerted primary constraint on segment mass balances. Our results suggest that the exchange of water and nutrients between the stream and adjacent landscape can exert strong control on reach-scale nutrient export, particularly in streams experiencing or approaching N saturation.

AB  - The rigidity of mortgage contracts and a variety of frictions in the design of the market and the intermediation sector hindered efforts to restructure or refinance household debt in the aftermath of the financial crisis. In this paper, we focus on understanding the design and implementation challenges of ex ante and ex post debt relief solutions that are aimed at a more efficient sharing of aggregate risk between borrowers and lenders. Using a simple framework that builds on the mortgage design literature, we illustrate that ex ante-designed, automatically indexed mortgages and policies can facilitate a quick implementation of debt relief during a crisis. However, the welfare benefits of such solutions are substantially reduced if there are errors in understanding the underlying structure of income and housing risk and their relation to the indexes on which these solutions are based. Empirical evidence reveals significant spatial heterogeneity and the time-varying nature of the distribution of economic conditions, which pose a significant challenge to the effective ex ante design of such solutions. The design of ex post debt relief policies can be more easily fine-tuned to the specific realization of economic risk. However, the presence of various implementation frictions and their spatial heterogeneity can significantly hamper their effectiveness. Consequently, we argue that effective mortgage market design will likely involve a combination of ex ante and ex post debt relief solutions, with state contingencies. We conclude by discussing the potential gains-which can be large, given significant regional heterogeneity-from tying mortgage terms and policies to local indicators, as well as mechanisms that may alleviate the adverse effects of ex post implementation frictions.

AB  - Social capital formation of the urban community contributes to the compactness of living, involvement in a variety of activities, the diversity of emerging problems and the possibility of their joint solutions. The purpose for the study is to study the social capital of urban communities of two major cities of the Vologda oblast - Vologda and Cherepovets - and identify their common and distinctive features. The theoretical framework of analysis lies in the concept of social capital, which demonstrated the role and importance of social relations for growth and development. Further expansion of the concept's problems caused interest in specific environments of its formation, including the city. The empirical framework of the study includes the results of a public opinion survey in the mentioned cities conducted by the experts of the Russian Academy of Sciences in June, 2017. The hypothesis of the study is that cultural, economic, and social differences affect the state of structural characteristics of social capital, particularly trust, which in turn affects the relations of solidarity and the level of responsibility for the state of affairs in the city. Characteristics of social capital such as the level of interpersonal and institutional trust, involvement in social and political life, readiness to unite with others were analyzed. It is noted that the state of the main indicators of social capital in cities varies. Analysis of specific features of its manifestation can provide information on the reasons for the existing differences in population's perception of government bodies, possibilities of their interaction, as well as information for making reasonable management decisions to avoid conflicts between the authorities and the population, creating conditions for strengthening their interaction.

AB  - To investigate the genotypic differences associated with the growth potential and leaf traits of Cornus wilsoniana W., we planted twenty C. wilsoniana families in southeastern China and analyzed nineteen leaf morphological and physiological traits that have potential relationships with growth. Seedling growth and leaf traits exhibited high variability among the C. wilsoniana families. The phenotypic coefficients of variation (CVs) of these traits varied from 5.33% (leaf length/leaf width, LL/LW) to 23.17% (stomatal conductance, gs), and their heritabilities (H-2) ranged from 0.17 (chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b, Chl(a)/Chl(b)) to 0.75 (stem height, H and Chl(a)). There was greater genetic variation in the physiological traits than in the morphological traits. H was significantly positively correlated with instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE), Chl(a), Chl(b) and total Chl, and diameter (D) was significantly positively correlated with net photosynthetic rate (P-n), g(s), WUE, Chl(a), Chl(b) and total Chl and was negatively correlated with leaf phosphorus (LP). Based on cluster analysis, three families were selected as superior families for the study area due to their seedling growth and leaf traits. These results indicate that Pn, Chla, Chlb and total Chl are good indicators to use for selecting superior families of C. wilsoniana with better growth performance; additionally, high WUE and low LP are also critical leaf traits for cultivar selection because plant adaptation to environmental conditions is important for growth performance.

AB  - Mountain soils play an essential role in ecosystem management. Assessment of land potentials can provide detailed spatial information particularly concerning nutrient availability. Spatial distributions of topsoil carbon, nitrogen and available phosphorus in mountain regions were identified using supervised learning methods, and a functional landscape analysis was performed in order to determine the spatial soil fertility pattern for the Soyang Lake watershed in South Korea. Specific research aims were (1) to identify important predictors; (2) to develop digital soil maps; (3) to assess land potentials using digital soil maps.
   Soil profiles and samples were collected by conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling considering operational field constraints such as accessibility and no-go areas contaminated by landmines as well as budget limitations. Terrain parameters and different vegetation indices were derived for the covariates. We compared a generalized additive model (GAM) to random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR). For the predictor selection, we used the recursive feature elimination (RFE). A land potential assessment for soil nutrients was conducted using trimmed k-mean cluster analysis.
   Results suggested that vegetation indices have powerful abilities to predict soil nutrients. Using selected predictors via RFE improved prediction results. RF showed the best performance. Cluster analysis identified four land potential classes: fertile, medium and low fertile with an additional class dominated by high phosphorus and low carbon and nitrogen contents due to human impact. This study provides an effective approach to map land potentials for mountain ecosystem management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Physical model testing is an important research tool for coal petrography engineering as it can solve many difficult problems associated with high risks and requiring long time periods to investigate with field studies. However, the accuracy of physical model tests can be reduced by problems with testing equipment, such as small model specimen size, poor airtightness and insufficient stress and pressure loading ability. To study the problems of coal petrography engineering in complicated stress environments, especially those in fluid-solid coupling, we designed and developed a multi-functional physical model testing system. The entire testing system consists of several specific sub-systems: loading, specimen shaping and installation, data monitoring and acquisition, pumping and gas injection, excavation simulating. The testing system can simulate complicated stress environments of coal-rock mass, and it can also be used to study the characteristics of strength-deformation, seepage-rheology and instability-failure under the conditions of gas-solid coupling and gas-liquid-solid multi-phase coupling. A load-unload experiment of air pressure and three-dimensional stress was conducted using the testing system. The experiment verified major technical indicators such as the loading capacity, sealing pressure and test precision, as well as operational stability of the testing system. The strain fields within the model specimen are well distributed and approximately linear with the stress. The stress of the specimen surface is approximately well distributed, and the specimen is subjected to uniform stresses. The testing system meets the requirements of the design parameters and has great potential significance to help reveal the scientific laws and inherent mechanisms of coal petrography engineering.

AB  - Grazing is an economically important activity in Southern Patagonia's steppe and woodland ecosystems. In the past, emphasis has been on maximizing the provisioning capacity of these ecosystems with little concern for the longer term conservation of the ecosystem services related to climate regulation, like carbon sequestration. This is changing rapidly as livestock producers in the region work to develop a certification scheme for sustainable land management for Patagonians rangelands. This study is a scientific contribution towards this broader social objective in which we test whether soil C concentration in topsoil (10 cm depth) can be used as an indicator of rangeland condition. Data on climate, soil chemistry, topography, ecosystem type and stocking rates were obtained from the PEBANPA network of permanent plots database for 145 sites across Southern Patagonia. These variables were used as independent variables in a partial least squares regression in which top soil C was the dependent variable. The effects of land use (stocking rate) on top soil C were barely detectable at the regional scale in Patagonia. Top soil C was however strongly associated with other independent variables, notably soil chemistry and climate variables and also vegetation type. Thus, changes in land use management may not have a significant impact on soil carbon sequestration in these types of ecosystems. This may be because many factors interact to determine top soil C such that the footprint of overgrazing on top soil C is drowned out at the regional scale by other variables. This highlights the need for further work to develop indicators for sustainable land management in the region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil moisture constrains the activity of decomposer soil microorganisms, and in turn the rate at which soil carbon returns to the atmosphere. While increases in soil moisture are generally associated with increased microbial activity, historical climate may constrain current microbial responses to moisture. However, it is not known if variation in the shape and magnitude of microbial functional responses to soil moisture can be predicted from historical climate at regional scales. To address this problem, we measured soil enzyme activity at 12 sites across a broad climate gradient spanning 442-887mm mean annual precipitation. Measurements were made eight times over 21months to maximize sampling during different moisture conditions. We then fit saturating functions of enzyme activity to soil moisture and extracted half saturation and maximum activity parameter values from model fits. We found that 50% of the variation in maximum activity parameters across sites could be predicted by 30-year mean annual precipitation, an indicator of historical climate, and that the effect is independent of variation in temperature, soil texture, or soil carbon concentration. Based on this finding, we suggest that variation in the shape and magnitude of soil microbial response to soil moisture due to historical climate may be remarkably predictable at regional scales, and this approach may extend to other systems. If historical contingencies on microbial activities prove to be persistent in the face of environmental change, this approach also provides a framework for incorporating historical climate effects into biogeochemical models simulating future global change scenarios.

AB  - In this assay, a tunable pH sensing system was developed based on Ag nanoclusters (Ag NCs) capped by hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (PEI) with different molecular weights (abbreviated as Ag NC-PEIs). For instance, when the molecular weight of PEI was 600 or 1800, the fluorescence intensities of Ag NCs exhibited a linear fashion over the pH range 4.10-7.96; when the molecular weight of PEI was 25,000, the pH linear range was from 4.78 to 7.96; when the molecular weight of PEI was 70,000, the pH linear range was 6.09-8.95. According to the molecular weight of PEI 600/1800, 25,000, and 70,000, the color change point was pH 4.10-4.78, 533-6.09, and 6.09-6.80, respectively. Therefore, Ag NC-PEI 600 and 1800 were proper to acid conditions; Ag NC-PEI 25,000 was sensitive to weak acid media; while Ag NC-PEI 70,000 was adapted to neutral solution. The tunable and selective color change points brought an excellent feature of Ag NC-PEIs as visual pH indicators, which was flexible and applicable to a variety of environments. Besides, the ratios of absorbance at 415 nm and 268 nm of Ag NCs also showed linear relationships with pH variations. Therefore, there were three ways of this system for sensing pH values, including fluorescence assay, ultraviolet-visible measurement, and visual detection, suggesting that this tunable pH-sensing platform was more feasible, reliable, and accurate.

AB  - The perennial shrub Larrea tridentata is widely successful in North American warm deserts but is also susceptible to climatic perturbations. Understanding its response to rainfall variability requires consideration of multiple time scales. We examine intra-annual to multiyear relationships using model simulations of soil moisture and vegetation growth over 50 years in the Mojave National Preserve in southeastern California (USA). Ecohydrological model parameters are conditioned on field and remote sensing data using an ensemble Kalman filter. Although no specific periodicities were detected in the rainfall record, simulated leaf-area-index exhibits multiyear dynamics that are driven by multiyear (approximate to 3 years) rains, but with up to a 1 year delay in peak response. Within a multiyear period, Larrea tridentata is more sensitive to winter rains than summer. In the most active part of the root zone (above approximate to 80 cm), >1 year average soil moisture drives vegetation growth, but monthly average soil moisture is controlled by root uptake. Moisture inputs reach the lower part of the root zone (below approximate to 80 cm) infrequently, but once there they can persist over a year to help sustain plant growth. Parameter estimates highlight efficient plant physiological properties facilitating persistent growth and high soil hydraulic conductivity allowing deep soil moisture stores. We show that soil moisture as an ecological indicator is complicated by bidirectional interactions with vegetation that depend on time scale and depth. Under changing climate, Larrea tridentata will likely be relatively resilient to shorter-term moisture variability but will exhibit higher sensitivity to shifts in seasonal to multiyear moisture inputs.

AB  - The annual cycle and phenology of phytoplankton (satellite-derived chlorophyll-a, Chl-a) in the coastal upwelling region off central-southern Chile, their time-space variation, the extent of their coupling with those of wind-driven upwelling (as Zonal Ekman Transport, ZET), Sea Surface Temperature (SST), and Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) were analyzed using a similar to 10 year satellite time series (2002-2012). Wavelet analysis (WA) was applied to extract the dominant frequencies of variability and their recurrence, to derive the phenological indexes, and to assess the extent of the coupling between Chl-a and environmental forcing in the annual frequency. Index estimates were obtained from minimum and maximum accumulated values in two different frequency bands, annual (WA-ANF) and all except the synoptic (WA-ALF). The annual frequency was dominant in all the variables; however, the annual cycle and phenology of Chl-a displayed higher submeso and mesoscale variability. The mean onset date of Chl-a was similar to those of PAR and ZET with WA-ALF and cross WA indicated that, for the most part, their annual cycles were coupled or coherent. Few interannual changes in Chl-a phenology were detected, including a similar to 1 month longer duration (WA-ALF) during La Nina 2010-2011. The mean anomalies in the magnitudes of Chl-a and ZET during the upwelling season showed a slight but significant trend, negative for Chl-a and positive for ZET, while SST remained relatively constant. This pattern was unexpected since three La Nina-related conditions were identified during the 2007-2012 period.

AB  - As a necessary precursor to reconstructing the palaeoenvironmental conditions likely to be temporarily influenced by salt bearing ground waters, modern sites of Central Germany, known from the literature to be continental salt water localities, were investigated for their ostracod faunas. Analysing their associations enables the test of several methods in palaeoenvironmental analysis based on ostracods. In total, 54 ostracod taxa are documented. One species, Microdarwinula zimmeri, is new for the area. Interesting is the historical occurrence of Cyprideis torosa and Cytheromorpha fuscata, typically regarded as indicators of brackish water. The draining of wetlands has led to the disappearance of many former inland salt sites so that only a few of the sampled water bodies still show slightly elevated salinity (oligohaline range). The most important factors for the distribution of ostracod associations are groundwater influence, turbidity and ecological stability, whereas the type of dominating ions is of lesser importance because of time-averaging using taphocoenoses from surface sediments in our study. The relative proportion of ecological groups of ostracods appears to be the best tool for reconstructing past habitat types. The newly established Ostracod Permanence Index and Ostracod Turbulence Index allow the recognition of the influx of ground and surface waters, perennial habitats and flowing waters. A test of the Mutual Ostracod Temperature Range (MOTR) method demonstrates its capability to reconstruct, with a precision of +/-2 degrees C, the mean July and January air temperatures for the time interval 2002-2012. Additionally, the study contributes to the poorly known Recent distribution of ostracods in Central Germany. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land cover (LC) is one of the most important and easily detectable indicators of change in ecosystem services and livelihood support systems. This paper describes the decadal dynamics in LC changes at national and sub-national level in Bhutan derived by applying object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques to 1990, 2000, and 2010 Landsat (30 m spatial resolution) data. Ten LC classes were defined in order to give a harmonized legend land cover classification system (LCCS). An accuracy of 83% was achieved for LC-2010 as determined from spot analysis using very high resolution satellite data from Google Earth Pro and limited field verification. At the national level, overall forest increased from 25,558 to 26,732 km(2) between 1990 and 2010, equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 59 km(2)/year (0.22%). There was an overall reduction in grassland, shrubland, and barren area, but the observations were highly dependent on time of acquisition of the satellite data and climatic conditions. The greatest change from non-forest to forest (277 km(2)) was in Bumthang district, followed by Wangdue Phodrang and Trashigang, with the least (1 km(2)) in Tsirang. Forest and scrub forest covers close to 75% of the land area of Bhutan, and just over half of the total area (51%) has some form of conservation status. This study indicates that numerous applications and analyses can be carried out to support improved land cover and land use (LCLU) management. It will be possible to replicate this study in the future as comparable new satellite data is scheduled to become available. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil and water management is particularly relevant in semi-arid regions to enhance agricultural productivity. During periods of water scarcity, soil moisture differences are important indicators of the soil water deficit and are traditionally used for allocating water resources among farmers of a village community. Here we present a simple, inexpensive soil wetness classification scheme based on qualitative indicators which one can see or touch on the soil surface. It incorporates the local farmers' knowledge on the best soil moisture conditions for seeding and brick making in the semi-arid environment of the study site near Arusha, Tanzania. The scheme was tested twice in 2014 with farmers, students and experts (April: 40 persons, June: 25 persons) for inter-rater reliability, bias of individuals and functional relation between qualitative and quantitative soil moisture values. During the test in April farmers assigned the same wetness class in 46% of all cases, while students and experts agreed on about 60% of all cases. Students who had been trained in how to apply the method gained higher inter-rater reliability than their colleagues with only a basic introduction. When repeating the test in June, participants were given improved instructions, organized in small subgroups, which resulted in a higher inter-rater reliability among farmers. In 66% of all classifications, farmers assigned the same wetness class and the spread of class assignments was smaller. This study demonstrates that a wetness classification scheme based on qualitative indicators is a robust tool and can be applied successfully regardless of experience in crop growing and education level when an in-depth introduction and training is provided. The use of a simple and clear layout of the assessment form is important for reliable wetness class assignments.

AB  - Stated preference studies are increasingly employed to estimate the value of attributes of European agrarian landscapes and changes therein. Despite the vast amount of case studies, preferences for landscape attributes are context specific, which inhibits cross-case comparison and up-scaling. In this study, we address this problem by applying a meta-analysis of stated preference studies that focus on attributes of European agrarian landscapes (n = 345). The main objective of this study is to identify generic preferences for particular types of landscape attributes across case studies. In addition, landscape context variables that explain preference heterogeneity between different cases that address similar landscape attributes are identified. We find that landscape attributes that describe mosaic land cover, historic buildings or the presence of livestock generally receive the highest stated preferences across cases. Furthermore, we find relations between preferences for particular attributes and context variables - such as population density and GDP per capita - using a meta-regression analysis. The results of the present study provide the first cross-disciplinary and cross-case evidence on relations between preferences for landscape attributes and socio-economic and landscape context conditions. The study is a first step toward up-scaling of landscape preferences and the development social landscape indicators that reflect the perceived value of landscapes at regional and pan-regional scales, which is increasingly important as landscape policies are progressively implemented at European level.

AB  - Poultry litter (PL) is a by-product of broiler production. Most PL is land applied. Land-applied PL is a valuable nutrient source for crop production but can also be a route of environmental contamination with manure-borne bacteria. The objective of this study was to characterize the fate of pathogens, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), and bacteria containing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) after application of PL to soils under conventional till or no-till management. This 2-yr study was conducted in accordance with normal agricultural practices, and microbial populations were quantified using a combination of culture and quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Initial concentrations of Campylobacter jejuni in PL were 5.4 +/- 3.2 x 10(6) cells g(-1) PL; Salmonella sp. was not detected in the PL but was enriched periodically from PL-amended soils. Escherichia coli was detected in PL (1.5 +/- 1.3 x 10(2) culturable or 1.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(7) genes g(-1)) but was rarely detected in field soils, whereas enterococci (1.5 +/- 0.5 x 10(8) cells g(-1) PL) were detected throughout the study. These results suggest that enterococci may be better FIB for field-applied PL. Concentrations of ARGs for sulfonamide, streptomycin, and tetracycline resistance increased up to 3.0 orders of magnitude after PL application and remained above background for up to 148 d. These data provide new knowledge about important microbial FIB, pathogens, and ARGs associated with PL application under realistic field-based conditions.

AB  - The interest in renewable energy sources has gained great importance in Europe due to the need to reduce fossil energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, as required by the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) of the European Parliament. The production of energy from energy crops appears to be consistent with RED. The environmental impact related to this kind of energy primarily originates from crop cultivation. This research aimed to evaluate the environmental impact of different crop systems for biomass production: single and double crop. The environmental performances of maize and maize plus wheat were assessed from a life cycle perspective. Two alternative scenarios considering different yields, crop management, and climatic conditions, were also addressed. One normal cubic metre of potential methane was chosen as a functional unit. Methane potential production data were obtained through lab experimental tests. For both of the crop systems, the factors that have the greatest influence on the overall environmental burden are: fertilizer emissions, diesel fuel emissions, diesel fuel production, and pesticide production. Notwithstanding the greater level of methane potential production, the double crop system appears to have the worse environmental performance with respect to its single crop counterpart. This result is due to the bigger quantity of inputs needed for the double crop system. Therefore, the greater amount of biomass (silage) obtained through the double crop system is less than proportional to the environmental burden that results from the bigger quantity of inputs requested for double crop.

AB  - Although riverine periphytic algae attached to riverbed gravel are dominant species in flowing rivers, there is limited toxicity data on them because of the difficulty in cell culture and assays. Moreover, it is well known that sensitivity to pesticides differ markedly among species, and therefore the toxicity data for multiple species need to be efficiently obtained. In this study, we investigated the use of fluorometric microplate toxicity assay for testing periphytic algal species. We selected five candidate test algal species Desmodesmus subspicatus, Achnanthidium minutissimum, Navicula pelliculosa, Nitzschia palea, and Pseudanabaena galeata. The selected species are dominant in the river, include a wide range of taxon, and represent actual species composition. Other additional species were also used to compare the sensitivity and suitability of the microplate assay. A 96-well microplate was used as a test chamber and algal growth was measured by in-vivo fluorescence. Assay conditions using microplate and fluorometric measurement were established, and sensitivities of 3,5-dichlorophenol as a reference substance were assayed. The 50 percent effect concentrations (EC(50)s) obtained by fluorometric microplate assay and those obtained by conventional Erlenmeyer flask assay conducted in this study were consistent. Moreover, the EC50 values of 3,5-dichlorophenol were within the reported confidence intervals in literature. These results supported the validity of our microplate assay. Species sensitivity distribution (SSD) analysis was conducted using the EC(50)s of five species. The SSD was found to be similar to the SSD obtained using additional tested species, suggesting that SSD using the five species largely represents algal sensitivity. Our results provide a useful and efficient method for high-tier probabilistic ecological risk assessment of pesticides. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conservation practices are increasingly important components of sustainable management systems, and information about their influence on soil characteristics is needed. Soil parameters were assessed in no-till (NT) or minimum tillage (MT) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production near Stoneville, MS, Mississippi Delta region, that included cover crop (rye [Secale cereal L.] or Balansa clover [Trifolium michelianum Savi var. balansae (Boiss.) Azn.]) vs. no cover crop. Soils (0-2, 2-5, and 5-15 cm) were sampled (2001-2006) before cotton planting. Independent of tillage, both cover crops accumulated more soil C than no cover, and N was greatest under clover. Soils (0-15 cm) under clover had greater aggregate stability than rye or no cover. The major factor influencing bulk density and infiltration was proximity to crop row bed and wheel traffic, but infiltration rates were sixfold greater under MT than NT (P < 0.01), with less effect of cover crop (P < 0.06, clover > rye or no cover). Moderate tillage slightly increased abundance of both reniform nematodes and earthworms, but neither was affected by cover crop. Fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity was higher in clover (50%) and rye (20%) in surface soil than with no cover. Soil microbial community structure (total fatty acid methyl ester analysis) (2005-2006) indicated a significant cover crop effect but no tillage effect. Mycorrhizal bioindicator (16:1 omega 5c) was greater in soil with rye than clover or no cover; however, cotton mycorrhizal infection was 40% greater in fibrous roots from rye or clover plots than roots from plots with no cover. Collectively, cotton production with a cover crop and reduced tillage resulted in soil conditions indicative of soil quality.

AB  - Lake Xiaolongwan is a closed maar lake located in the Long Gang Volcanic Field, northeast China. Core XLW2 was collected in 2007 from the central region of the lake and provides a palaeoecological reconstruction over the past ca. 130 years (dated using radiometric methods: Pb-210 and Cs-137). Diatom floristic changes and catchment productivity (carbon isotope ratios) were analysed within the core. Indicators of atmospheric pollution (XRF and SCP inventories) were also measured. Results show a marked transition from a dominant benthic assemblage to a planktonic one (increasing P:B ratios) starting after ca. 1940 AD, becoming most prominent after ca. 1980 AD (P:B > 1). Most notable floristic changes result from the increase in the planktonic species Discostella woltereckii. These changes are concomitant with increased temperature trends from the region and reconstructed temperature anomalies of the Northern Hemisphere. SCP concentrations and flux rates also increase after ca. 1950 AD, with highest values seen at ca. 1980 AD after which values decline. Normalised elemental geochemistry (e.g. Pb/Ti) also show marked changes after ca. 1970 AD, most likely derived from atmospheric deposition of Pb. The recent increase in D. woltereckii precedes anthropogenic contamination (Pb/Ti) at the site and persists after the decline in SCP concentrations. This suggests that the recent increases are driven by increased mean annual temperature trends. These temperature trends may be manifested as changes in ice cover persistence, a longer growing season and/or increased DOC at Lake Xiaolongwan: conditions for which planktonic species have a more competitive advantage.

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of aspen furniture on cardiovascular parameters, locomotor activity (LA) and faecal welfare indicators in rats. A total of 12 BN and 12 F344 male rats were group housed (n=3) in conventional cages. In this crossover study, responses of all rats to the following cage furniture items were investigated: two types of simple maze, a rectangular tube and a control with no cage furniture. In one of the two maze groups, the rats had to gnaw through wood in order to obtain food. The mean values of the LA in all groups and differences in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate of the rats housed in the various furniture item groups were compared to the values of the rats housed in control cages with no furniture, on days two, six, ten and 14 in each period (both light and dark phases). The F344 rats were generally more active than the BN rats during the dark phase, but not during the light phase. Based on the MAP results, the tube appeared to be a poor choice for F344 rats, while for BN rats all furniture items seemed beneficial, with both board types apparently superior to the tube. In general, F344 rats had higher faecal corticosterone levels than BN rats with the reverse being true for secretory IgA values. In conclusion, LA and cardiovascular parameters seemed appropriate ways to evaluate the impact of cage furniture on physiological parameters, and covered structures such as tubes do not seem to provide any enrichment value in these two rat strains.

AB  - The utilization of energy from classical natural sources has some limitations therefore new possibilities for its enhancement are sought. Tubular light guides (TLG) are simple devices that allow the transmission of daylight into interiors of domestic or commercial buildings. The light transmission efficiency (LTE) is important indicator of the light guide performance. It depends on the geometry and optical parameters of the light guide but it seems also on the sky conditions. LTE can be investigated by measurements or calculations. Measurements under a real sky meet with difficulties of sky luminance distribution stability because sun is continually moving and properties of atmosphere are changing. Measurements of the LTE made under the artificial sky with the precisely defined sky luminance distribution can give answer to the question: "Depends the light transmission efficiency of tubular light guides on the sky type determined by the luminance distribution?" It was found that theoretical prediction methods combined with numerical methods could be used to answer this question.
   In this paper are presented results of theoretical calculations of the tubular light guide transmission efficiency using ray-tracing prediction method compared with measurement results obtained under the artificial sky installed at the Institute of Construction and Architecture of Slovak Academy of Sciences in Bratislava. The main aim of this paper is to offer a method for determination of tubular light guide inner reflectance and mathematically prove that light guide transmission efficiency is different for various standardized overcast sky types.

AB  - We study the formation and the stability of International Environmental Agreements (IEAs) in a pollution abatement model with a quadratic cost function. Countries play a two-stage game: in the first stage each country decides to join or not the coalition while, in the second stage, the quantity of pollution abatement is chosen. To analyze the stability of coalition structures in a multiple coalition game, we use the notion of the Largest Consistent Set (LCS) which allows players to be farsighted. Chwe (1994) developed the concept of farsighted stability: an outcome is stable and it is in the LCS if and only if deviations from it or potential further deviations are not unanimously preferred to the original outcome by the coalition considering the deviations. Applying this notion of stability in the IEA context we assume that, when a country or a sub-coalition contemplate exiting or joining an agreement, it takes into account the reactions of other countries ignited by its own actions. The goal of this paper is to identify the resulting stable structures and the LCS, examining the cooperation among countries with respect to an indicator of countries' environmental awareness. We show that large coalitions are possible outcomes of the game if the farsightedness is considered. In particular, we obtain general sufficient conditions that assure the farsighted stability of the Grand Coalition. In a computational way, we prove that if the environmental awareness is larger than a threshold value, the number of coalition structures belonging to LCS goes down with respect to the initial coalition structures and coalitions with singleton countries never exist. Moreover, we present a useful Maple algorithm to compare the cost functions and to determine direct dominance.

AB  - Studying metal-biomolecule interactions is critical to the elucidation of the molecular basis of the biological functions and toxicity of metals. In the present study, a competitive fluorimetric approach has been developed to measure the apparent affinity of biomolecules for Be(2+) by using a Be(2+)-specific fluorigenic probe (10-hydroxybenzo[h]quinoline-7-sulfonate, HBQS). Under physiological conditions, HBQS coordinates with Be(2+) in a molar ratio of 1:1 and results in a fluorescence shift from 580 nm for HBQS to 480 nm for the Be-HBQS complex associated with significant fluorescence enhancement. When a beryllium ligand is present in the mixture of Be(2+) and HBQS, the competition of ligand against HBQS for beryllium ion binding results in dissociation and thus a fluorescence decrease of the Be-HBQS complex. By titrating ligand and monitoring the dose-dependent decrease of Be-HBQS complex fluorescence at 480 nm, the apparent affinity between ligand and Be(2+) can be derived. Applying this simple approach, the apparent affinities of various nucleotides and the iron-storage protein ferritin for beryllium ion have been determined. In particular, the apparent dissociation constant of Be(2+) and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) was also validated by an electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (ESI-MS) method. The general applicability of the proposed competition assay was further demonstrated using FluoZin-1, a zinc fluorescent indicator, in a binding study for Zn(2+) and bovine serum albumin. This newly developed competitive fluorimetric assay provides a sensitive, simple, and generic approach for affinity estimation of metal and biomolecule binding. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present paper, the associations between residential traffic noise exposure from the noise sources - road, rail and aircraft - and self-reported indicators of health and well-being are investigated in a representative sample of the Swiss population. The study is based on record linkage of the Swiss GIS Noise Database (Son Base) and the Swiss Household Panel (SHP), a large panel survey with more than 10,000 respondents all over the country. A range of exposure-effect relationships of noise exposure and parameters of health and well-being such as self-reported health status, satisfaction with health, sleep disturbances, the intensity of the wish to move from the current residence as well as the awareness of "noise problems" at the place of living were investigated. Both unadjusted as well as models that controlled for age, sex, socioeconomic status, degree of urbanization at the place of residence, and personal living conditions were developed. A contribution of residential noise exposure as regards subjective estimates of health cannot been ruled out, but must be put into perspective as the effects of exposure measures were of rather small magnitude, especially compared to well-established determinants of health. Against the background of the explanatory power of classic health predictors, the present analyses allow one to gage the contribution of residential noise exposure on subjective health outcomes from a more general, integral point of view.

AB  - Binding between pyrene and four fulvic acid factions sequentially eluted by 0.01 M HCl (F1), 0.01 M HCl + 20% methanol (F2), 0.01 M + 40% methanol (F3), and 0.01 M HCl + 100% methanol (F4) was measured by fluorescence quenching. The influences of the functional groups of the fractions under different pH conditions on the binding behavior are discussed. The results showed that the binding coefficient (log K(DOC)) of pyrene for F1 to F4 increased from 4.19 to 5.3. Log K(DOC) was positively correlated with the aromaticity of fulvic acid fractions but negatively correlated with the ratio of (O + N)/C and the ratio of UV absorption at 250 Am and 365 nm (E(2)/E(3)). As an indicator of polarity around the pyrene molecule, the ratio of intensity of pyrene at 374 nm and 384 nm (I(1)/I(3)) decreased with the increase of fulvic acid fraction concentrations. All fractions decreased in ability to quench as the pH increased. For a given pH value, the quenching ability followed the order of F1 < F2 < F3 < F4. The differences in the effects of pH on the quenching ability of fulvic acid fractions could be attributed mainly to the conformation of the fulvic acid fractions. Hydrophobic effect and the interactions of pi-electrons from the aromatic regions of the fulvic acid and pyrene played dominant roles in the binding process. Env.iron. Toxicol.

AB  - Soil loss rates on rangelands are considered one of the few quantitative indicators for assessing rangeland health and conservation practice effectiveness. An erosion model to predict soil loss specific for rangeland applications is needed because existing erosion models were developed from croplands where the hydrologic and erosion processes are different, largely due to much higher levels of heterogeneity in soil and plant properties at the plot scale and the consolidated nature of the soils. The Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM) was designed to fill that need. RHEM is an event-based derivation of the WEPP model made by removing relationships developed specifically for croplands and incorporating new equations derived from rangeland data. RHEM represents erosion processes under disturbed and undisturbed rangeland conditions, it adopts a new splash erosion and thin sheet-flow transport equation developed from rangeland data, and it links the model hydrologic and erosion parameters with rangeland plant communities by providing a new system of parameter estimation equations based on 204 plots at 49 rangeland sites distributed across 15 western U.S. states. RHEM estimates runoff erosion, and sediment delivery rates and volumes at the spatial scale of the hillslope and the temporal scale of a single rainfall event. Experiments were conducted to generate independent data for model evaluation, and the coefficients of determination (r(2)) for runoff and erosion predictions were 0.87 and 0.50, respectively, which indicates the ability of RHEM to provide reasonable runoff and soil loss prediction capabilities for rangeland management and research needs.

AB  - Arsenic in groundwater has been a concern in South and Southeast Asia for more than a decade. We explore here the possibility that hydrogeologic factors recently shown to influence the distribution of arsenic might also affect the level of contamination of shallow (< 20 m) wells with microbial pathogens. A total of 96 shallow tube wells in two nearby villages of Bangladesh were surveyed during the wet and dry seasons, along with 55 deeper wells in neighboring villages. One of the two villages is located in a particularly sandy environment where recharge is rapid and shallow wells contain little arsenic. Shallow aquifers in the other village are capped with an impermeable clay layer, recharge is an order of magnitude slower, and arsenic levels are high. The fecal indicator E. coli was detected in 43% of shallow wells, compared with 12% of deeper wells. More shallow wells contained E. coli during the wet season (61%) than during the dry season (9%). In the wet season, a higher proportion of shallow wells in the village with low arsenic levels (72%) contained E. coli compared with the village having high arsenic levels (43%). Differences in arsenic and E. coli distributions between the two sites are likely due to the differences in permeability of near-surface sediments although differences in average well-depth between the two villages (9 +/- 4 vs. 15 +/- 3 m) may play a role as well. Hydrogeologic conditions that favor high levels of fecal contamination but low levels of arsenic in shallow groundwater should be taken into account during arsenic mitigation throughout South and Southeast Asia.

AB  - Collision with conductors and earth cables is a known impact generated by transmission power lines, however there is virtually no information on how these infrastructures might affect bird distribution in a landscape context. With this work we specifically hypothesise that transmission power lines may affect the occurrence of a threatened bird, the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax). To test this hypothesis we used a Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM), analysing the effects of power lines in a landscape perspective and simulating population trends as a response to power line installation and habitat changes induced by agricultural shifts in southern Portugal. The data used in the dynamic model construction included relevant gradients of environmental conditions and was sampled during the breeding seasons of 2003-2006. Transmission power lines were significantly avoided by the little bustard and the developed StDM model showed that the distance to these utility structures is the most important factor determining breeding densities in sites with suitable habitat for the species, which possibly leads to displacement of populations and habitat fragmentation. The model simulations also provided the base to analyse the cumulative effects caused by the habitat degradation that can ultimately lead to the extinction of local populations. Within priority conservation sites, the dismantling of existing transmission lines should be considered whenever possible, in order to ensure adequate breeding habitat. The model is considered useful as an auxiliary tool to be used in environmental impact assessments, management and conservation studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Negative cognitive bias-the tendency to interpret ambiguous situations pessimistically-is a central feature of stress-related disorders such as depression. The underlying neurobiology of this bias, however, remains unclear, not least because of a lack of translational tools. We established a new ambiguous-cue interpretation paradigm and, with respect to the etiology of depression, evaluated if environmental and genetic factors contribute to a negative bias. Rats were trained to press a lever to receive a food reward contingent to one tone and to press another lever in response to a different tone to avoid punishment by electric foot-shock. In the ambiguous-cue test, the lever-press responses to tones with frequencies intermediate to the trained tones were taken as indicators for the rats' expectation of a positive or negative event. A negative response bias because of decreased positive and increased negative responding was found in congenitally helpless rats, a genetic animal model of depression. Moreover, treatment with a combined noradrenergic-glucocorticoid challenge, mimicking stress-related changes in endogenous neuromodulation, biased rats away from positive responding. This response shift was accompanied by neuronal activation in dentate gyrus and amygdala. Thus, environmental and genetic risk factors for depression induce a response bias, which resembles the pessimistic bias of patients suffering from depression. The behavioral paradigm described constitutes a useful tool to study the neuronal basis of decision making under ambiguous conditions and may promote innovative pharmaco- and psychotherapy for depression.

AB  - The scheduling of life history events over the year is a central characteristic of organisms in seasonal environments. Here, we report on seasonality in growth rate and cellular energy allocation, as well as timing of maturation, egg production and brood release, through a full annual cycle of Onisimus litoralis, a lysianassoid amphipod dominating soft bottoms in the intertidal zone in the high Arctic. We observed that O. litoralis follows a semelparous 2 yr life cycle, with growth and development mainly taking place in summer, but with slow growth also in winter, which with the lack of energy reserves suggests that it feeds year-round. The importance of the spring bloom of phytoplankton in fueling growth and development is reflected in carbohydrate and protein content. Relatively stable lipid content and no build-up of energy stores prior to egg production indicate income breeding. Seasonal differences in energy consumption are apparent, with higher consumption in summer, but as a result of increased energy content during summer, the energy budget remains relatively stable during the whole year. The life history observed is similar to that of previous studies, but our observations do not support iteroparity, which has been suggested by others. Parental care, through a 'start pack' of energy to the offspring and the ability to time the brood release to favorable conditions, add flexibility to the life history strategy. Easy access to the species and a good understanding of its biology support further use of O. litoralis as an indicator species for environmental change in the Arctic.

AB  - Temporary ponds are seasonal wetlands annually subjected to extreme and unstable ecological conditions, neither truly aquatic nor truly terrestrial. This habitat and its flora have been poorly studied and documented because of the ephemeral character of the flora, the changeable annual weather that has a great effect on the small, herbaceous taxa and the declining abundance of temporary ponds. The objectives of this study are: (a) to define plant community diversity in terms of floristic composition of ephemeral wetlands in SW Portugal, (b) to identify temporary pond types according to their vegetation composition and (c) to identify those ponds that configure the European community priority habitat (3170* - Mediterranean temporary ponds).
   Vegetation sampling was conducted in 29 ponds, identifying 168 species grouped among 15 plant communities. Soil texture, pH, organic C and N content were measured, but only N and percent of clay appear to be related with the distribution of each community type. The results showed that ephemeral wetlands could be classified into four type: vernal pools, marshlands, deep ponds and disturbed wetlands. Vernal pools correspond to the Mediterranean temporary ponds (3170*), protected as priority habitat under the EU Habitats Directive. Submersed Isoetes species (Isoetes setaceum and Isoetes velatum) represents, together with Eryngium corniculatum, the indicator species for vernal pools. We identify also indicator plant communities of this priority habitat, namely I. setaceum and E. corniculatum-Baldellia ranunculoides plant communities. In this region, the conservation of temporary ponds has so far been compatible with traditional agricultural activities, but today these ponds are endangered by the intensification of agriculture and the loss of traditional land use practices and by the development of tourism.

AB  - A comparative analysis of the habitats of Baldellia ranunculoides (subsp. ranunculoides and subsp. repens) and Baldellia alpestris (Alismataceae) was carried out across central and western Europe. Soil samples from 43 populations were analyzed and the composition of accompanying vegetation was analyzed by canonical correspondence and indicator species analysis. Significant differences in the habitat conditions and the accompanying vegetation were found between the three taxa. B. ranunculoides subsp. repens is growing in lowland water bodies on acidic substrates (pH 5-6.3) which are markedly richer in organic matter and poorer in cations, especially in Ca2+. B. ranunculoides s. str. is also a lowland taxon, but grows on more mineral and basic substrates (pH 7-9), usually rich in Ca2+. The endemic B. alpestris grows in the most distinct habitats, on substrates with low pH and with very low Ca2+ concentrations, at much higher altitudes than the other taxa and in very specific plant communities that have almost no affinities with those of the two lowland Baldellia-taxa. The Baldellia-taxa are threatened by eutrophication of their habitats. Moreover, many of the extant populations, in particular those of B. ranunculoides s. str., are very small and will be threatened by environmental stochasticity. Reintroduction and the creation of new populations might reduce the risk of extinction. Information given on the detailed habitat preferences of the Baldellia-taxa could help conservation efforts for these endangered taxa and identify suitable sites for (re-) introductions.

AB  - Objective: To assess depression, anxiety, and anger as well as the variance that these emotions share (conceptualized as negative affect) in relationship to high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a specific indicator of parasympathetic cardiac autonomic function related to premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although individual trait negative emotions have been studied in relation to risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) as well as biological mechanisms leading to CHD end points (e.g., autonomic nervous system [ANS] dysfunction), the degree to which a general tendency to experience negative emotions may account for these relations is not known. Methods: The sample included 653 community volunteers (51.0% female; 15.8% Black) aged 30 to 54 years (mean +/- standard deviation = 43.8 +/- 7.1 years). Latent constructs of depression, anxiety, and anger were each measured by three scales from well-validated self-report questionnaires. Resting HF-HRV was derived from 5-minute segments of continuous electrocadiographs recorded during both unpaced and paced respiration conditions. Results: Structural equation models (SEM) of the individual trait emotions showed depression and anxiety related inversely to HF-HRV and anger unrelated to HF-HRV. SEM also showed negative affect related inversely to HF-HRV. All associations were present after covariate adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including age, sex, race, education, body mass index, smoking status, and blood pressure. Conclusions: Negative affect as a common pathway between depression, anxiety, and anger and impairments in cardiac autonomic function was supported, suggesting negative affect may be the unifying and potentially toxic element linking individual trait negative emotions to ANS dysregulation.

AB  - Variable N management is one of the most promising practices of precision agriculture to optimize nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) and decrease environmental impact of agriculture. The objective of this study was to test the performance of fertilization in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and triticale (Triticosecale Wittm.) determined by reflection measurements of on-the-go sensors under heterogeneous field conditions. In 2004 geo-referenced yield and N fertilization data were collected in four heterogeneous fields in southern Germany. Nitrogen demand of plants was determined throughout the growing season and the corresponding amount of N fertilizer was broadcast with the N-Sensor (Yara, Germany) in real-time. The sensor uses the red edge position (720-740 nm) as an indicator of crop N status and relates this to crop N demand. The sensor algorithm is designed to stimulate plant growth in areas with low biomass and reduce risk of lodging in areas with high biomass. Fertilization was evaluated by calculating site-specific N balance maps to delineate zones with N surplus in the soil. The results revealed some general limitations of this sensor approach in areas with yield-limiting factors other than N. Nitrogen surplus above 50 kg ha(-1) was calculated for subfield areas dominated by shallow soils. The results of this study indicated that sensor-based measurements can be used efficiently for variable N application in cereal crops when N is the main growth-limiting factor. However, the causes for variability must be adequately understood before sensor-based variable rate fertilization can safely be used to optimize N side-dressing in cereals.

AB  - We examined the effects of anthropogenic and climatic perturbations on nutrient-phytoplankton interactions and eutrophication in the waters of the largest estuarine systems in the U.S.A., the Chesapeake Bay (CB), Maryland/Virginia, and the Neuse River Estuary/Pamlico Sound (NRE/PS) system, North Carolina. Both systems have experienced large post-World War 11 increases in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loading, and nutrient reductions have been initiated to alleviate symptoms of eutrophication. However, ecosystem-level effects of these nutrient reductions are strongly affected by hydrologic variability, including severe droughts and a recent increase in Atlantic hurricane activity. Phytoplankton community responses to these hydrologic perturbations, including storm surges and floods, were examined and when possible, compared for these systems. In both systems, the resulting variability in water residence time strongly influenced seasonal and longer-term patterns of phytoplankton biomass and community composition. Fast-growing diatoms were favored during years of high discharge and short residence time in CB, whereas this effect was not observed during high discharge conditions in the longer residence time NRE/PS. In the NRE/PS, all phytoplankton groups except summer cyanobacterial populations showed decreased abundance during elevated flow years when compared to low flow years. Although hurricanes affected the CB less frequently than the NRE/PS, they nonetheless influenced floral composition in both systems. Seasonally, hydrologic perturbations, including droughts, floods, and storm-related deep mixing events, overwhelmed nutrient controls on floral composition. This underscores the difficulty in predicting seasonal and longer-term phytoplankton production and compositional responses to nutrient input reductions aimed at controlling eutrophication of large estuarine ecosystems.

AB  - The leaching behaviour of six selected pharmaceuticals was tested in different soils. Leaching experiments are a part of environmental risk assessment to estimate the distribution and fate of these pharmaceuticals in the environment. Based on the results of this assessment their mobility in soil and their potential to contaminate groundwater was evaluated. When assessing the leaching behaviour of these compounds, the influence of the properties (e.g. grain size distribution, pH, C-org) of different soils has to be taken into account. The test results indicated that the leaching potential found could be rated as low for diazepam, ibuprofen, ivermectin and carbamazepine. Therefore, contamination of the groundwater with these substances seems to be unlikely if the groundwater level is covered with sufficient layers of the soils investigated. Clofibric acid and iopromide were very mobile under the experimental conditions and thus, groundwater contamination would be possible if the soil is exposed to these pharmaceuticals, i.e. wastewater irrigation. These results are more or less in agreement with groundwater monitoring data found in the literature for ibuprofen and diazepam which were in general not present in groundwater, while clofibric acid and iopromide were frequently detected. However, a discrepancy was found for carbamazepine, since it occurs very often in groundwater. This discrepancy might be explained by the fact that the leaching tests were performed with soil, whereas in reality the groundwater contamination. occurs mainly over river sediments and sub soil from receiving waters.

AB  - An apiary trial on the use of two acaricide formulations (gel-Apiguard and vermiculite and Api Life VAR) in the control of Varroa destructor (Anderson & Trueman) was conducted in summer 2001 in Sardinia (Italy). The main goals were 1) to determine their effectiveness against V. destructor, taking into account natural mite mortality in control hives; and simultaneously 2) to determine the persistence of both formulations and residues it) honey and wax, by using a new extraction method. Both thymol formulations, after the treatments, reduced significantly the levels of mite infestations of adult bees and sealed brood, but their efficacy, expressed as percentage of mortality, was lower for both products (Api Life VAR 74.8 +/- 13.1 and 81.3 +/- 15.5, Apiguard 90.4 +/- 8.3 and 95.5 +/- 8.7 for sealed brood and adult bees, respectively) than the efficacy previously obtained with the same products in other experimental conditions. Moreover, a considerable colony-to-colony variability was recorded, and a significant negative effect of the thymol treatments on colony development was observed. During 2 wk of treatment, the bees removed nearly 95% of all the applied product (gel or vermiculite). Residues found in honey collected front the nest varied from 0.12 to 4.03 mg/kg for Api Life VAR and from 0.40 to 8.80 mg/kg for Apiguard. The residues were relatively higher in wax (Api Life VAR = 21.6 +/- 13.0; Apiguard 147.7 +/- 188.9) than in honey, because thymol is a fat-soluble ingredient.

AB  - Municipal effluents have been shown to contain a cocktail of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The estrogenic effect of these effluents has been demonstrated on both vertebrate and invertebrate species by the feminisation of the exposed males. This effect was investigated on the freshwater zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) after exposure to tertiary treated effluent from a municipal sewage treatment works (STW). Mussels were exposed to the effluent in situ for 112 days during gametogenesis (December to mid-March). Levels of vitellin (Vn)-like proteins (the major protein found in oocytes) were measured indirectly using the alkali-labile phosphate (ALP) technique and confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Significant increases (P < 0.05) in Vn-like proteins were found in both male and female mussels after exposure to the effluent, indicating that endocrine disruption (ED) had occurred. Using High-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) levels of the mussels main steroid, cholesterol were found to more than double after effluent exposure. General physiological (survival, condition, etc.) and histological effects were also investigated. Histological effects observed included a large increase in interstitial tissue between the seminiferous tubules of the gonad in male mussels exposed to effluent. Effluent, samples were tested for estrogenic compounds using the toxicity identification and evaluation method (TIE). A complex mixture of compounds with estrogenic activity was found with 17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-ethynlestradiol and bisphenol A accounting for the majority of the effluents estrogenic activity. Results indicate that the zebra mussel is a suitable bioindicator of endocrine disruption in freshwater environments. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Molluscs living in Lake Balaton accumulate persistent toxic substances, namely heavy metals, to a greater extent, than other organisms, and can serve as excellent passive biomonitors. Especially gills are good accumulators. Regular sampling showed that the level of Cd and Hg concentrations increased, while Pb contamination decreased during the past 20 years in mussels, corresponding probably to changes in pollution of the Lake. In functional, active monitoring various behavioral patterns of molluscs were employed. In mussels the periodicity of activity and rest (pumping activity vs. valve closure) is a sensitive indicator of unfavorable conditions and so of toxic substances. Low concentrations of inorganic and organic toxicants (heavy metals, PCBs, PAH compounds) cause reduction of the active and increase of the rest periods in a concentration dependent manner in a few hours. A second, suitable test for evaluating toxicity of chemicals is the measurement of the water flow through the exhalant siphon. Under the effect of toxicants the siphon activity, both the strength and duration of water flow changes characteristically within a few minutes. For both behavioral tests special techniques have been developed suitable for long duration recording, supported by mechano-electrical transduction and computerized data evaluation. In case of the pond snail (Lymnaea stagnalis L.) the behavior (positive/negative geotaxis and orientation) is disturbed in the presence of the above mentioned toxic chemicals. The execution and evaluation of the changes in the movement of the snail is based on video-recording and measurement of the direction and distance the animal performs in uncontaminated water and in the presence of the pollutants during the same period of time (0.5-4 h).

AB  - During intrasexual interactions, the visual properties of conspicuous male sexually selected traits may be important in social signalling. We used intruder models to examine the effect of pigmentation and ultraviolet (UV) reflectance of a single male trait on the responses of male blackbirds, Turdus merula. Stuffed models of male blackbirds with brown, yellow or orange bills were presented to residents in their natural habitat; we altered UV reflectance from the bills by applying nail varnish. This UV reflectance did not appear to affect the response of resident males during simulated territorial intrusions under natural signal and viewing conditions. However, models with brown bills received less attention from resident males than models displaying yellow or orange pigmentation. Brown bills are typical of first-year males and may be an effective signal of subordinate status, reducing aggression from adult males. Furthermore, resident males came closer, and initiated aggressive displays more quickly, in the presence of orange- versus yellow-billed models, suggesting that orange-billed models may be perceived as more of a threat to territory ownership. In 44% of presentations, females also responded to models (a response rate half that of males). Females spent more time more than 10 m from models when they lacked UV, suggesting that UV may be more important during intersexual interactions. However, bill pigmentation did not affect female responses to the models. Males and females may be attentive to different properties of bill appearance when establishing the territory.

AB  - A diatom transfer function to infer epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) concentration was derived using surface sediment diatom data from 68 medium-sized (10-1000 ha) lakes in Southern Finland. Publicly available monitoring records were used in lake selection to avoid gradients caused by pH and humic substances. Constrained and partially constrained ordinations indicated that TP was an important variable influencing diatom assemblages. A long floristic gradient in relation to TP was also apparent and therefore an inference model was developed for TP using unimodal-based regression and calibration methods. The final model included 61 lakes with epilimnetic TP concentrations between 3 and 89 mug P l(-1), measured during the autumnal circulation period. It has a jackknifed-estimated root mean squared error of prediction of 0.16 log mug P l(-1), a maximum bias of 0.28 log mug P l(-1), and an r(j)(2)ack of 0.76.
   The model was tested in the presently eutrophic Lake Valkjarvi (epilimnetic [TP] 60-85 mug P l(-1)), located in Southern Finland. It successfully predicted the measured autumnal epilimnetic TP concentration for the past twenty years and the changes in inferred [TP] reflected disturbances known to have occurred before that time. The diatom-based inferences show that Lake Valkjarvi was oligo-mesotrophic as late as the 1930's and has become eutrophic because of nutrient inputs from agriculture and, especially, municipalities. However, epilimnetic TP concentration has not increased further.

AB  - In recent years, following the lead of the US, several OECD countries have introduced 'workfare' policies that link receipt of unemployment and related social benefits to compulsory participation on state-administered work and training schemes. The UK's New Deal (Welfare-to-Work) for Young People is ono of the largest and most developed of these workfare programmes. Official evaluations of the UK's New Deal for Young People claim that it ha, been a national success, but overlook local variations in its results. This paper uses the Government's own performance measures, data on local unemployment flows, numbers of New Deal participants recycled through the scheme as second starts, and interviews with both local policy managers and participant, to demonstrate that these local variations have been substantial. These different indicators suggest that the programme has been noticeably less effective in many inner urban and depressed industrial labour markets, In such areas the 'recycling and churning' of participants through the programme are more significant, and suggest that local labour market structures play a significant role in shaping policy outcomes. The paper argues that recent additions to the New Deal to improve job search and matching fail to address this local variation, and that a longer-term approach is required that seeks to improve not only the employability of individuals, but also the local employment opportunities open to them. One key implication is clear: that local labour market conditions can exert a significant influence on the outcomes of national workfare type policies, not only in terms of geographical variations in the problem to be solved, but also in shaping and constraining the local nature of policy outcomes.

AB  - Identifying factors that predict higher levels of children's subjective well-being (SWB) is imperative for practice and policy implications. The current study explored latent subgroups of risks characterized by various dimensions of child well-being and investigated whether the latent risk groups were associated with children's SWB across 16 nations. The moderating role of subjective child rights as a protective factor in the relationship between latent risk profiles and children's SWB was also examined. Data of children aged 12 years from the second wave of the International Survey of Children's Well-Being (N=19,212) was analyzed. Latent profile analysis was used to identify risk profiles based on children's different risk experiences, and subsequently, multilevel regression analysis was used to identify whether group membership predicted SWB. Five latent profiles were identified: low, moderate, dual, material, and victimization risk groups. Findings revealed the concurrent nature of risks in children's lives, as they are often exposed to deficiencies across multiple domains, rather than just one. Multilevel regression analysis results signified that membership in any risk profile is linked with lower SWB of children when compared to the low risk group and highlighted the significant conditioning role of subjective child rights in the relationship between the risk profiles and SWB. Policymakers should be aware of the co-experience of multiple risk factors and devise policies that meet the needs of various groups of children at risk and advocate children as rights holders to further help children with co-occurring risks attain a higher level of SWB.

AB  - In order to monitor recovery from acidification caused by acid atmospheric deposition, desmids and water chemistry were sampled in three Dutch moorland pools regularly from 1978 to 2014. Reference desmid samples from the early twentieth century were retrieved from old collections. Changes of the desmid assemblages were assessed by analyses of traits, including indicator values for pH and total phosphate, conservation value, cell volume and surface/volume (s/v) ratio. Direct correspondence analysis (DCA) traced relations between desmids and environmental variables. Between 1916 and 2014, species composition altered due to changes in acidifying atmospheric deposition: The change was most pronounced in pools with relatively flat shores exposed to the atmosphere in extremely dry summers. After the dry summer of 1921, changes were slight, but after the dry summer of 1976, changes were dramatic, when the sulphur and nitrogen compounds stored in the water bottom oxidized and acidified the water. The conservation value declined sharply but increased again until the 1990s, partly due to the decrease in acidifying deposition. Although the acid atmospheric deposition continued to decline until the early 21th century, the conservation value declined again, as did the stability of the desmid assemblages. It is likely that internal eutrophication (nutrients), presence of toxic substances (such as hydrogen sulphide), the decline of aquatic macrophytes (substrate), shading by afforestation (light) and/or reduced supply of carbon dioxide (due to decreased local seepage) play a role. The chemical dynamics due to the large stock of sulphur and nitrogen compounds will hamper the development of rare desmids, bound to stable environmental conditions.

AB  - Temperature shocks have profound effects on biological and physiological functions at all levels of organization. However, the recovery periods from these shocks and their subsequent impacts remain unknown. Herein, our study investigated the effect of short temperature stress on survival, dormancy recovery time, nutritional indices, life traits and development rate for T. castaneum (larvae and adults) and S. oryzae adults. The results showed significant effects on survival rates of T. castaneum (larvae and adults) and S. oryzae adults. When both insects had been exposed to high-temperature shock, survival rates decreased with higher temperatures and longer periods of exposure. Furthermore, recovery times varied between and within the insect species, as prolonged exposure to thermal shocks increased recovery periods. Moreover, dormancy time resulting from the hightemperature shocks significantly affected food deterrence and food intake, regardless of the stage of development, species, exposure periods and temperature-exposure conditions. Subsequently, differences in body growth rates and food consumption rates are an appropriate indicator of differences in food conversion rates under hightemperature shocks, regardless of the species and developmental stages. On the other hand, our results indicated that as high-temperature shocks increased, the total development period increased of T. castaneum. Likewise, the pupal stage increased with increasing high-temperature shocks, and the larval stage decreased with increasing thermal shocks and increasing the periods of exposure. In summary, our study showed the importance of dormancy recovery time and its subsequent effects for improving disinfestation effectiveness of heat treatment, and understanding insect response to high temperatures.

AB  - Respiration rate is an essential indicator of vital signs, which can demonstrate the physiological condition of the human body and provide clues to some diseases. Commercial Wi-Fi devices can provide a non-invasive, cost-effective and long-term respiration rate-monitoring scheme for home scenarios. However, previous studies show that the breathing depth and location may affect the detectability of respiratory signals. In this study, we leverage the variation of the Doppler spectral energy extracted from the channel state information (CSI) collected by Wi-Fi devices to track the chest displacement induced by respiration. First, the random phase is eliminated by phase-fitting method to obtain the complex CSI containing the Doppler shift. Then, the multipath decomposition of CSI is carried out to obtain the channel impulse response, which eliminates the interference phase of the time delay and retains the Doppler shift. The dynamic path units are also separate from the multipath, which overcomes the indoor multipath effect. Finally, we conduct a time-frequency analysis to dynamic units to accumulate Doppler spectral energy. Based on these ideas, we design a complete respiration rate-monitoring system to obtain the respiration rate by using the consistency between the Doppler energy change period and the respiratory cycle. We evaluate our system through extensive experiments in several typical home environments filled with multipath. Experimental results show that the errors of the three scenarios are approximate, the maximum error is less than 0.7 bpm, and the average errors are approximately 0.15 bpm. This result indicates that our scheme can achieve high precision respiration monitoring and has good anti-multipath ability compared with existing methods.

AB  - This study introduced an innovative yet feasible and cost-effective solution to make a big step forward in the state-of-art of smart energy buildings and obtain a real meaning of net-zero energy building. In this study, the main cornerstones of the developed solution combined the following technologies: the use of novel trigeneration solar collectors without a battery, a very clever method of heat pump integration with minimal size and cost required, and two-way interaction of the building with local energy networks. Different system configurations based on the included components were suggested and analyzed for an apartment building in Denmark. A thorough techno-economic and environmental evaluation of the proposed solution and the most competent ones already proposed for the same application was carried out to rank the best configuration from various facets. A comparative parametric study was accomplished to examine and compare the variation of performance indicators with significant decision variables. In addition, the tri-objective optimization was implemented for each configuration to specify the best optimum condition from energy, economic, and environmental standpoints. According to the economic results, the configurations integrated with battery and regular heat pumps were not favorable due to the highest total cost and the payback period. Here, the proposed system, owing to its resilient energy trade possibility with the energy networks and the scaled-down heat pump, gave larger energy-saving and CO2 emission reduction rates of 16.6% and 21.6%, respectively. The multi-objective optimization showed that the capacities of the battery and the cold storage were the most effective parameters on the performance of the system.

AB  - Many lakes across Canada and northern Europe have experienced declines in ambient phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) supply for over 20 years. While these declines might create or exacerbate nutrient limitation in aquatic food webs, our ability to detect and quantify different types of nutrient stress on zooplankton remains rudimentary. Here, we used growth bioassay experiments and whole transcriptome RNAseq, collectively nutrigenomics, to examine the nutritional phenotypes produced by low supplies of P and Ca separately and together in the freshwater zooplankter Daphnia pulex. We found that daphniids in all three nutrient-deficient categories grew slower and differed in their elemental composition. Our RNAseq results show distinct responses in singly limited treatments (Ca or P) and largely a mix of these responses in animals under low Ca and P conditions. Deeper investigation of effect magnitude and gene functional annotations reveals this patchwork of responses to cumulatively represent a co-limited nutritional phenotype. Linear discriminant analysis identified a significant separation between nutritional treatments based upon gene expression patterns with the expression patterns of just five genes needed to predict animal nutritional status with 99% accuracy. These data reveal how nutritional phenotypes are altered by individual and co-limitation of two highly important nutritional elements (Ca and P) and provide evidence that aquatic consumers can respond to limitation by more than one nutrient at a time by differentially altering their metabolism. This use of nutrigenomics demonstrates its potential to address many of the inherent complexities in studying interactions between multiple nutritional stressors in ecology and beyond.

AB  - Tibetan lakes are an effective indicator of climate change as they are highly sensitive to and directly affected by climate change. The past decade has seen the seven warmest years on record globally. Such observations have prompted questions about lake changes over the Tibetan Plateau. The dense coverage of the CryoSat-2 altimeter reveals large-scale patterns in this climate change signal. We investigate lake level variations of more than 200 lakes using altimetry observations from CryoSat-2 during the period 2010 to 2019. Combined with GRACE/GRACE-FO, we evaluate the water storage change of lakes and terrestrial water storage (TWS). We find that most studied lakes generally went through three phases of change, that is, rising-hiatus/decline-rising, albeit lakes in the north Tibetan Plateau, show higher rising rates. Results also show that lake levels are widely affected by the 2015/16 El Nino event across the entire Inner Plateau via reduced precipitation. Above normal precipitation during 2016-2018, resulted in a sharp rise of similar to 1.22 m on average, accounting for 56% of the decadal lake level rise (mean/median: 2.19/1.85 m). TWS in the Inner Tibetan Plateau accumulated a net gain of 70.5 km(3), which is dominated by the net gain of lake water storage (ca. 63.3 km(3)). The interannual TWS variation is found to be associated mainly with precipitation. In particular, extreme conditions such as the 2015/16 El Nino, had a profound negative impact on the TWS. The findings in this study shed new light on the response of Tibetan lakes to recent decadal environmental changes.

AB  - Animals can employ a range of physiological mechanisms in response to unpredictable changes within their environment, such as changes in food availability and human disturbances. For example, impala exhibit higher faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels-indicative of physiological stress-in response to low food quality and higher human disturbance. In this study, we measured faecal triiodothyronine (T3) metabolite (FTM) levels in 446 wild impala from 2016 to 2018 to test the hypothesis that environmental and human disturbances would affect their physiological status. We also validated a faecal thyroid hormone assay. T3 levels mainly regulate metabolic rate and drive thermoregulation-increasing with colder temperatures. We predicted that individuals would have lower FTM levels, indicative of poor physiological status, (i) when food quality was poor, (ii) when ambient temperature (Ta) was high, (iii) in areas of high human disturbance (due to food competition with livestock) and (iv) when FGM levels were high. Interestingly, we found that Ta was the most important predictor of FTM-FTM levels decreased by 70% from lowest to highest Ta-and food quality and human disturbance only influenced FTM levels when Ta was accounted for. FTM levels also tended to increase with increasing FGM levels, opposite our predictions. Our results suggest that food quality and availability may only partially influence FTM levels and that fluctuations in Ta are a significant driver of FTM levels in a wild tropical ungulate. Given that thyroid hormones are primarily responsible for regulating metabolic rate, they may be better indicators of how wild animals metabolically and energetically respond to environmental factors and only indicate poor nutritional status in extreme cases.

AB  - Objectives Objectives: Human biologists are increasingly interested in measuring and comparing physical activities in different societies. Sedentary behavior, which refers to time spent sitting or lying down while awake, is a large component of daily 24 hours movement patterns in humans and has been linked to poor health outcomes such as risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, independently of physical activity. As such, it is important for researchers, with the aim of measuring human movement patterns, to most effectively use resources available to them to capture sedentary behavior.
   Methods This toolkit outlines objective (device-based) and subjective (self-report) methods for measuring sedentary behavior in free-living contexts, the benefits and drawbacks to each, as well as novel options for combined use to maximize scientific rigor. Throughout this toolkit, emphasis is placed on considerations for the use of these methods in various field conditions and in varying cultural contexts.
   Results Objective measures such as inclinometers are the gold-standard for measuring total sedentary time but they typically cannot capture contextual information or determine which specific behaviors are taking place. Subjective measures such as questionnaires and 24 hours-recall methods can provide measurements of time spent in specific sedentary behaviors but are subject to measurement error and response bias.
   Conclusions We recommend that researchers use the method(s) that suit the research question; inclinometers are recommended for the measurement of total sedentary time, while self-report methods are recommended for measuring time spent in particular contexts of sedentary behavior.

AB  - Rapid population growth and urban expansion in metropolitan areas have led to a dramatic increase in food demand. In most cases, urban sprawl occurs in unplanned ways, forcing pert-urban agriculture to adopt detrimental practices for biodiversity conservation and metabolic efficiency (i.e. landscape homogenization and dependence on non-renewable external inputs), facing the food-biodiversity dilemma. In order to ameliorate these negative effects over the metropolitan socioecological system, researchers have focused on developing comprehensive indicators to support sustainable urban expansion in metropolitan areas. In this paper, we use these indicators to develop an Energy-Landscape Optimization (E-LO), a nonlinear model designed for land use planning by means of considering biophysical constraints. Then, we test the model in a representative Mediterranean bio-cultural landscape in the Barcelona metropolitan area (Spain). The E-LO results allow us to propose different land use configurations for both conventional and organic agriculture, taking into account the associated socio-metabolic balances and the related landscape functional structures, with the aim to meet different societal objectives. We have fruitfully tested three settings: i) to increase conditions to host farm associated biodiversity, ii) to increase agricultural production, and iii) to minimize dependence on non-renewable external inputs. According to these socioecological objectives, we have obtained the best landscape-metabolism integration, which is a useful methodology for sustainable land use policy. This socioecological perspective is necessary for the new paradigm on agroecosystem management and landscape planning, and can help advancing towards functional green infrastructures in metropolitan areas, especially in the climate change and agroecological transition global context.

AB  - Increasing exploration interest in oil and gas hosted by early Cambrian strata has focused research efforts on early Cambrian sandstones. The origin of phosphorus and the paleoenvironment of phosphorus-bearing sandstones from the Xinji Formation are discussed in this paper. X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, grain size analysis, total organic carbon, and the concentrations of major, trace, and rare earth elements (REEs) are analyzed in this work. The sandstones are mostly sublitharenite with calcareous cement. The content of the sandstone samples is quartz (39.8%-73.9%), with Mite (7.9%-27.6%) and calcite (4.5%-29%). The mineral particles of sandstone samples are mainly well sorted with a fine particle size, suggesting strong paleohydrodynamic force. The value of SiO2 is 37.69%-78.19%, followed by Al2O3 (6.11%-13.67%). Compared with upper continental crust, the boron in the sandstone samples is relatively enriched, whereas Sc. Sr, and Ba are relatively depleted. The Sigma REE content is 124.46-323.99 ppm. Phosphorus is of biogenic origin and enriched by upwelling current. The source of the Xinji Formation sandstone samples was mainly a mixture of sedimentary rock, granite, and alkali basalt, with the provenance of terrestrial clastic materials. The sandstone was deposited under oxic conditions and a warm and humid paleoclimate with saline to brackish features on a passive continental margin. Phosphorus occurring in sandstones is sensitive to paleoclimate and can be used as an indicator to judge paleoclimate, as it is more enriched in warm and humid weather.

AB  - The combined implementation of quality by design principles and green analytical chemistry leads to development of green micellar HPLC method for analysis of atorvastatin calcium and amlodipine besylate in binary mixtures and in their tablet dosage forms within 8 min. A two-level fractional factorial design was implemented for screening of different method parameters affecting chromatographic responses. Box-Behnken design was then used to study and optimize the most critical parameters. The optimum chromatographic conditions obtained from Box-Behnken design involved the use of a mixture of 0.17 M sodium dodecyl sulfate solution adjusted to pH 2.9 and 10%v/vn-butanol as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min(-1)and column temperature kept at 45 oC. The stationary phase was X-Bridge (TM) (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mu m) column. The fluorescence detection was programmed at 276/378 nm (excitation/ emission) for the first 5 mins for atorvastatin then switched to 366/442 nm (excitation/emission) for amlodipine. A linear response was obtained over the ranges of 0.2-25 mu g mL(-1)for both drugs. The proposed method was validated and successfully implemented for the simultaneous determination of cited drugs in their different tablet dosage forms. The method was additionally applied to content uniformity testing according to the official guidelines. The application of quality by design principles and green analytical chemistry results in development of robust green method with less trial and error experiments.

AB  - The increasing frequency and severity of natural disturbances (e.g., storms and insect outbreaks) due to climate change are expected to reduce the abundance of Norway spruce stands in the European forests. Under such conditions, the assessment ofstatus quoon focusing on survival of Norway spruce stands are essential for the agility of forest management strategies. The dynamics (mortality rate) of Norway spruce stands in hemiboreal forests based on forest inventories for the period from 1975 to 2016 (inventories of 1975, 1985, 1999, 2011 and 2016) were analyzed in two forest landscapes in the western and eastern parts of Latvia (Vane and Dviete, respectively). The spatiotemporal changes in age-dependent mortality differing by abundance of Norway spruce and disturbance regime were assessed, focusing on the transitions of stands between age groups (inventories). The age-related changes in probability of stands transitioning into the next age group contrasted (p< 0.001) between sites. In Vane, the survival of stands between inventories was constant (ca. 90%), while in Dviete, it decreased sharply from 85.7% during 1985-1999 inventories to 49.3% in 2011-2016. Age-related decreases in stand survival showed local dependencies between both landscapes, namely, in Vane, notable decreases started from 61 years, while in Dviete, the downward trends started already from 31 years, probably due to different disturbance regimes. This suggests that, in forest management planning, the different outcomes for mortality patterns between both landscapes must be considered and should not be generalized for a whole country.

AB  - Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-1a is one of three major circulating forms in salmon and induced under catabolic conditions. However, there is currently no immunoassay available for this form because of a lack of standard and specific antibodies. We developed a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA) for salmon IGFBP-1a using recombinant protein for labeling, an assay standard, and production of antiserum. The TR-FIA had a low cross-reactivity (3.6%) with IGFBP-1b, another major form in the circulation. Fasting for 4 wk had no effect on serum immunoreactive (total) IGFBP-1a levels in yearling masu salmon, whereas 6-wk fasting significantly increased it. There was a significant, but weak, negative relationship between serum total IGFBP-1a level and individual growth rate (r(2) = 0.12, P = 0.01). We next developed a ligand immuno-functional assay (LIFA) using europium-labeled IGF-I to quantify intact IGFBP-1a. In contrast to total IGFBP-1a, serum intact IGFBP-1a levels increased after 4 wk of fasting, and refeeding for 2 wk restored it to levels similar to those of the fed control. Serum intact IGFBP-1a levels showed a significant negative correlation with individual growth rate (r(2) = 0.52, P < 0.001), which was as good as that of IGFBP-1b. Our findings using newly developed TR-FIA and LIFA suggest that regulation of intact IGFBP-1a levels has an important effect on growth in salmon and that intact IGFBP-1a is a negative index of salmon growth.

AB  - Rapid urbanization is one of the most concerning issues in the 21st century because of its significant impacts on various fields, including agriculture, forestry, ecology, and climate. The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, highly related to the rapid urbanization, has attracted considerable attention from both academic scholars and governmental policymakers because of its direct influence on citizens' daily life. Land surface temperature (LST) is a widely used indicator to assess the intensity of UHI significantly affected by the local land use/cover (LULC). In this study, we used the Landsat time-series data to derive the LULC composition and LST distribution maps of Nanjing in 2000, 2014, and 2018. A correlation analysis was carried out to check the relationship between LST and the density of each class of LULC. We found out that cropland and forest in Nanjing are helping to cool the city with different degrees of cooling effects depending on the location and LULC composition. Then, a Cellar Automata (CA)-Markov model was applied to predict the LULC conditions of Nanjing in 2030 and 2050. Based on the simulated LULC maps and the relationship between LST and LULC, we delineated high- and moderate-LST related risk areas in the city of Nanjing. Our findings are valuable for the local government to reorganize the future development zones in a way to control the urban climate environment and to keep a healthy social life within the city.

AB  - As a method for eco-efficiency analysis, environmental cost efficiency (ECE) indicators have been proposed for the end-of-pie (EOP) systems that referred to the techniques achieving environmental benefit under economic cost. The wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) belongs to the EOP systems; however, few studies used the ECE indicators for the sustainability evaluation. Here, this study first proposed the following processes that had been excluded in the current ECE framework and thus limited the potential application in WWTP: (1) the direct impact of wastewater on receiving water, (2) the migration and transformation of water pollutants affected by the self-purification mechanisms of receiving water. To address the aforementioned processes, this study extended the framework of ECE indicators by means of incorporating the potential growth of microorganisms as the characterization state and integrating the water quality models with the characterization models. To investigate the applicability, a full-scale WWTP was selected as the study case and the eco-efficiency of the increasing levels of sewage treatment was evaluated. The case outcome showed that, with the extended ECE indicators, the analysis of eco-efficiency could be directly related to the specific locations and could determine the specific distance ranges within which the scenarios changing were considered efficient. Moreover, the eco-efficiency could be investigated under more concrete and flexible situations because the extended framework of ECE indicators was able to include more information, such as different types of receiving water or different environmental conditions of certain water body.

AB  - The analysis and modeling of the sorption behaviors in glassy polymers, of gases and vapors in particular, is of crucial relevance for a variety of different applications. Due to the peculiar behaviors associated with the nonequilibrium character of polymer glasses, different approaches have been used so far to describe gas solubility, whose dependence on penetrant pressure or activity shows a broad spectrum of experimental behaviors. In this work, three commonly used and completely different approaches (the Dual Mode Sorption (DMS), based on simultaneous adsorption and solubility; the Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) model, considering only adsorption; and the Nonequilibrium Thermodynamic model for glassy polymers (NET-GP), considering only solubility) have been critically reviewed and compared. The screening inspects the model ability to represent the different features shown by solubility isotherms in glassy systems, as well as their ability to provide reliable predictions with parameter values consistent with the underlying physical models. Finally, physical consistency issues have been also considered whenever appropriate. The analysis reveals that DMS and GAB describe well various experimental sorption behaviors, while they fail in representing other cases, such as those shown by the S-shaped isotherms of alcohols or those due to penetrants in supercritical conditions. More remarkably, both models reveal serious physical inconsistencies in the application to sorption-desorption hysteresis. Conversely, the NET-GP approach, combined with a Lattice Fluid model (NELF) shows a better predictive power, as it can naturally account for the S-shaped isotherms, and it is also physically consistent with the behavior observed in sorption-desorption hysteresis cycles.

AB  - The rationale behind this paper relies on the fact that the effectiveness of any treatment procedure depends on the reliability of the operational and prognostic medical measurement experiment, which, in turn, relies on the metrological level of all the elements that are part of the instrumental resource.
   Given the conditions, relevant is the issue of developing a methodology for selecting measuring tools, which would allow taking into account the cost, the reliability, the metrological as well as other features and indicators of the resource in question.
   The purpose of the article is to assess the technical needs for solving problems set in the field of meaningfully defined objects - medical & biological systems (MBS). The solution to this problem can be found only on the basis of formalizing all the components that match the MBS description.
   The research value implies the introduction of formal definitions for the anatomical (AnS), physiological (PhysS) and information-energy (IES) situations of a biological object (BO) and assignment of a diagnostic status of BO as a function of AnS, PhysS and IES. In addition, we have defined the principle of identifying the features of the instrumental base on following the basis of assessing the reliability of the physiological system status.
   The pragmatic value of the data presented here implies the possibility of obtaining a numerical estimate of an acceptable reliability level that an instrumental resource can offer depending on the assessment of a physiological object sufficient reliability.
   The innovation value of this item is related to the introduction of reliability scales for the BO diagnostic status as well as the reliability coming from the instrumental resource in medical measurements.

AB  - Lightweight and at the same time adaptive solutions for building shells and structures are a potential answer to the high and increasing use of resources in the construction industry. To live up to this expectations, adaptive solutions need to provide damagefree buildings with appropriate quality of living as well as significantly higher resource efficiency. Both criteria apply to the entire life cycle and need to include the additional operating energy required for adaptivity. In a previous study on adaptive lightweight constructions [1] for facades, the physical functionality and environmental impact of some use cases were discussed at component level. In the present article, the horizon is extended to the room level. This extension enables the inclusion of characteristic values for thermal and moisture protection of the shell as well as the comfort in the room as evaluation indicators. This increases the required effort and complexity of the assessment, but the application potential of adaptive alternatives can be assessed more thoroughly and thus the information quality for decision-making on the further utilization is improved. In the study three conventional constructions, partly massive and partly lightweight constructions, as well as equivalent adaptive facades, are considered and assessed on room level. The essential evaluation criteria are quantitative statements on the fulfilment of building physics requirements and on environmental impacts. The results of the applied intermethodological research indicate a great potential for reducing resources without restricting functionality by adaptive constructions. However the results strongly depend on the specific external conditions, e.g. location.

AB  - Groundwater pollution and human health risks caused by leachate leakage have become a worldwide environmental problem, and the harm and influence of bacteria in leachate have received increased attention. Setting the isolation distance between landfill sites and groundwater isolation targets is particularly important. Firstly, the intensity model of pollutant leakage source and solute transport model were established for the isolation of pathogenic Escherichia coli. Then, the migration, removal and reduction of bacteria in the aerated zone and ground were simulated. Finally, the isolation distance was calculated based on the acceptable water quality limits, and the influence of hydrogeological arameters was analyzed based on the parameter uncertainty. The results of this study suggest that the isolation distances vary widely ranging from 106 m-5.46 km in sand aquifers, 292 m-13.5 km in gravel aquifers and 2.4-58.7 km in coarse gravel aquifers. The gradient change of groundwater from 0.001 to 0.05 resulted in the isolation distance at the highest gradient position being 2-30 times greater than that at the lowest gradient position. There was a difference in the influence of the thickness of the vadose zone. For example, under the same conditions, with the increase of the thickness of the aeration zone, the isolation distance will be reduced by 1.5-5 times, or under the same thickness of the aeration zone, the isolation distance will be significantly shortened. Accordingly, this needs to be determined based on specific safety isolation requirements. In conclusion, this research has important guiding significance for the environmental safety assessment technology of municipal solid waste landfill.

AB  - Based on research into the theory of household assets and the welfare of farmers, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-entropy weight method and cloud model were used to study the welfare level of land-lost farmers' households under the different livelihood assets of Taohuayi Village, Taohuasan Village and Taohuawu Village in Taohua Town, Nanchang City. The results show that (1) The comprehensive welfare level of asset-deficient farmers' households is between the "bad" and "medium" levels and is closer to the "bad" level. The comprehensive welfare level of asset-balanced farmers' households is between "general" and "good" and is closer to the "good" level. (2) Judging from the various functional activity indicators that affect the welfare of the land-lost farmers, after the asset-deficient farmers' households lose their land, the welfare level of the family's financial situation, social security, living environment, mental status, development opportunities, and political participation are generally at low to medium-low levels, and only living conditions are at medium-to-high levels. (3) The welfare level of the living environment of the asset-balanced farmers' households is at a moderately low level, and the welfare of the remaining functional activities is at a medium to a medium-high level. We then propose corresponding policy recommendations. After losing land, it is necessary to implement a differentiated circulation guarantee and support policies to achieve targeted compensation and support for the land-lost farmers' households to improve the welfare level of land-lost farmers' households under different living asset allocation.

AB  - Hydrogen can be a promising option as an energy storage medium in renewable power generator-based microgrid. However, the technologies used for the hydrogen storage such as high pressure in gaseous form and solid storages can significantly affect the cost performance of the hydrogen-based microgrid. In this study, a techno-economic assessment for solid hydrogen storage (metal hydride [MH])-based microgrid in Indian operating conditions has been carried out in terms of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), net present cost, and avoided environmental emissions. In the present microgrid, excess photovoltaic (PV) generator electricity is used to generate hydrogen using the alkaline water electrolyzer (EL). This generated hydrogen is stored in the MH cylinder. The stored hydrogen is converted back into electricity by fuel cell (FC) in case of insufficiency of PV electricity. The sizing of the microgrid components such as PV, FC, EL, and hydrogen storage tank are obtained for given load profile using HOMER optimization tool. An attempt has been made for the cost evaluation of the solid and high-pressure gaseous storages in the microgrid. A comparative study between two energy storage mediums such as battery and hydrogen in microgrid is also performed. In case of battery and hydrogen storages, the LCOE is found to be 0.1293 and 0.383 $/kWh, respectively. It was found that battery storage system is more economical than hydrogen storage in microgrid. Nonetheless, the difference between the LCOE in hydrogen-based microgrid is reduced considerably with optimized cost scenario of the EL, FC, and H-2 storage tank as compared to the battery storage. Such technical, economic, and environmental assessment of the MH-based microgrid system provides a firm basis to policymakers for shaping energy and environment policies for hydrogen activities.

AB  - This study compared the antioxidant properties of oregano essential oil (OEO) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) alone and when combined. The principal components in OEO were gamma terpinene (25.1g/100g), terpinen-4-ol (16.7g/100g), and carvacrol (16.2g/100g). OEO showed 60% DPPH inhibition and 10mg/g total phenolic compounds. The antioxidant capacity of OEO (0.02, 0.10, and 0.20g/100g) and BHT (0.01 and 0.02g/100g) and their combinations were tested in sunflower oil oven-heated at 60 degrees C, by measuring the chemical (peroxide value, p-anisidine value, and conjugated dienes) and volatile (hexanal, 2-heptanal, and 2,4-decadienal) indicators over 14days. The combined samples (oregano essential oil and BHT) showed the greatest protection against lipid oxidation. On day 14, the peroxide value of the control (without added antioxidants), OEO (0.02g/100g), BHT (0.01g/100g), and OEO+BHT (0.02+0.01g/100g) treatments decreased in the order of 136.36, 102.68, 83.24, and 41.37 meqO2/kg, respectively, for example. In the consumer sensory test, samples containing OEO at 0.02 and 0.10g/100g attained greater acceptance scores (7.3 and 6.7, respectively, on a 9-point hedonic scale) as compared with the control (6.1). Discriminative duo-trio testing presented significant differences between all OEO-containing samples relative to the control. The synergistic antioxidant activity between OEO (termination-enhancing antioxidant) and BHT (chain-breaking antioxidant) demonstrates an alternative approach to impede lipid oxidation in foods, by decreasing the use of synthetic compounds in the food industry.

AB  - The species dynamics is the feature of the ecosystem succession and is a key issue in the disturbance ecology. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis proposes that the highest diversity is maintained at intermediate scales of disturbance. This hypothesis has been applied to phytoplankton in water-body. It was found out that a low similarity between consecutive water samples is the result of a drastic disturbance, whereas a high similarity indicates a stable condition. To investigate whether the intermediate disturbance hypothesis is applicable to phytoplankton communities in water-body with a pollution gradient, we provided a field test in Changguangxi National Urban Wetland Park in Wuxi, China. We sampled once a month over a span of four seasons. The phytoplankton species were identified, and water quality monitoring was conducted as the disturbance factor in this study, which included the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. We calculated the similarities of phytoplankton species and water quality among the sampling locations and regarded them as the indicators of disturbance to study the impacts of water pollution. Our results indicated that (1) the fitting curves of phytoplankton community diversity and similarity showed unimodal patterns over four seasons, which supported the intermediate disturbance hypothesis; (2) the response of phytoplankton diversity to water quality levels was not clear. When the water quality similarity was plotted against the phytoplankton diversity, there was no unimodal relationship, neither in the particular season nor over an entire year. We concluded that in this study the intermediate disturbance hypothesis was confirmed by the phytoplankton composition similarity, but water quality failed to be an indicator of a disturbance.

AB  - The Permian was a key period of manganese deposition in Southern China, as evidenced by a series of large-to medium-scale manganese deposits along the margin of the Yangtze Block. This study characterizes representative examples that occur in late Middle Permian silicon-mud-limestones in Zunyi and adjacent areas and examines their implications for manganese deposit genesis and sedimentary environment. The manganese deposits are typical carbonates deposits, with the main manganese-bearing mineral being rhodochrosite, followed by calcimangite, capillitite, manganocalcite, and kutnohorite in decreasing abundance. The ore bodies, hosted in the black shale series of the Late Permian Maokou Formation, are mainly stratiform or stratoid in shape, usually have lamellar, massive, banded, fragmental, or pisolitic structures, and contain paragenetic gangue minerals including rutile, barite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite, etc. These features are characteristic of hydrothermal exhalative sedimentary deposits, implying that this was their mode of genesis. The Mn-ores have higher Co, V, Ni, Cu, Sr and total REE content, lower Y/Ho ratios, and characterized by the Fe-Mn-(Cu + Co + Ni) x 10, lgTh vs. IgU, P2O5 vs. Y and Fe/Ti vs. Al/(Al + Fe + Mn) diagrams strongly suggest hydrothermal activity during manganese mineralization. The Th/U, V/Cr and V/(V + Ni) ratios of samples from the Zunyi manganese deposits are 0.38-3.27, 3.11-24.00 and 0.38-0.99, respectively, indicating the sedimentary environment was weakly oxidizing to reducing condition.

AB  - China's new residential developments have widely taken the form of privately governed gated communities since the socialist work-unit housing system was terminated towards the end of the 1990s. Although many studies have recognised these emerging gated neighbourhoods as having improved physical conditions, there has also been a decline in neighbouring and thus they have profoundly changed the traditional collectivist regime of living in China. However, there is a lack of research into whether gated neighbourhoods cultivate a positive relationship with residents and how such relationships are shaped. Based on a questionnaire survey of 1034 households conducted in a variety of gated neighbourhoods in Wenzhou, China, this paper intends to fill the gap by using neighbourhood attachment as an indicator, and by examining the impacts of private governance. The results of regression modelling suggest that residents have considerably high place attachment in gated neighbourhoods and that private governance enhances neighbourhood attachment by emphasising market provisions. Through knowing their neighbours, being involved in neighbourhood public events, and being provided with a good neighbourhood image as well as privatised services, residents develop an attachment to the neighbourhood socially, symbolically and functionally. More importantly, by comparing market-led, mixed and state-led neighbourhoods, this research identifies the attachment in gated neighbourhoods as underlining the demand for private governance rather than for safety. Such a new form of neighbourhood governance, as illustrated in urban China, is consumption-oriented and results from the privatisation of public goods and services provision at the neighbourhood level.

AB  - Background: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is involved in blood pressure control. The available slow-releasing H2S-donors are poorly soluble in water and their ability to release H2S in biologically relevant amounts under physiological conditions is questionable. Therefore, new slow-releasing donors or new experimental approaches to fast-releasing H2S donors are needed.
   Methods: Hemodynamics and ECG were recorded in male, anesthetized Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and in Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at baseline and after: 1) intravenous (iv) infusion of vehicle or Na2S; 2) administration of vehicle suppositories or Na2S suppositories.
   Results: Intravenously administered vehicle and vehicle suppositories did not affect mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate (HR). Na2S administered iv caused a significant, but transient (2-5 min) decrease in MABP. Na2S suppositories produced a dose-dependent hypotensive response that lasted similar to 45 min in WKY and similar to 75-80 min in SHR. It was accompanied by a decrease in HR in WKY, and an increase in HR in SHR. Na2S suppositories did not produce a significant change in corrected QT, an indicator of cardiotoxicity. Na2S suppositories increased blood level of thiosulfates, products of H2S oxidation.
   Conclusions: Na2S administered in suppositories exerts a prolonged hypotensive effect in rats, with no apparent cardiotoxic effect. SHR and WKY differ in hemodynamic response to the H2S donor. Suppository formulation of fast-releasing H2S donors may be useful in research, if a reference slow-releasing H2S donor is not available.

AB  - An attempt was made to employ the reliability (R-el)-resilience (R-es)-vulnerability (V-ul) conceptual framework to develop a typical indicator system for quantitative assessment of watershed health. The study aimed to conceptualize and customize the RelResVul framework to watershed health assessment for the Shazand Watershed in Markazi Province, Iran, for the period of 1977-2014. To this end, four easily, reliable, available and accessible criteria viz. standardized precipitation index (SPI), low and high flow discharges (LFD and HFD), and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) were selected, and corresponding indices for reliability-resilience-vulnerability (RelResVul) framework were accordingly conceptualized and calculated. The thresholds of 0.1, 0.16 m(3) s(-1), 12.63 m(3) s(-1) and 25 mg l(-1) day(-1) were thus selected for SPI, LFD, HFD and SSC, respectively. The results showed a decreasing trend in R-el and R-es, and an increasing trend in V-ul for SPI and LFD in the Shazand Watershed. The results further showed an increasing trend in R-el, and a decreasing trend in V-ul for HFD and SSC. A decreasing trend was ultimately recognized in watershed health index for all criteria except SSC. Additionally, the integrated hydrological watershed health index of 0.16 +/- 0.11 obtained from the geometric mean of the RelResVul framework indices also showed a decreasing trend for the Shazand Watershed health during the study period. The results of the present initiative study can be considered as a baseline by decision makers and managers to effectively adjust watershed management strategies to handle land degradation issues in the area.

AB  - Defoliation is the main parameter for assessing tree crown conditions, and is the result of cumulative interactions among different types of stressors, including climate, air pollution, pests and diseases, and management systems. Here, we evaluated a long-term data series (1992-2013) provided by the ICPForests Level I monitoring network (16 x 16 km) in Romania. Specifically, we investigated how climate influences defoliation at different spatial and temporal levels using statistical analyses. Using periodic climatic data (mean temperature and precipitation) derived from a daily grid dataset (ROCADA) with a resolution of 0.1 x 0.1 degrees (10 x 10 km), we quantified how climatic parameters were correlated with defoliation, which was expressed as the mean tree defoliation per plot (DEF), and the proportion of damaged trees (crown defoliation > 25% -fDEF). The cross-correlation (Spearman (R)) between defoliation indicators and temperature was positive and relatively constant over time for all broadleaves and conifers, combined and separately, except for Fagus sylvatica (European beech), which had a negative cross-correlation coefficient. The correlation obtained for precipitation was similar to that obtained for temperature; however, this relationship was negative (except, again, for beech). The temporal influence of temperature on defoliation was much lower than that of precipitation, which had the greatest influence in dry regions (south and southeast Romania), especially for Quercus species. Furthermore, precipitation had a positive influence in moderate climate regions for conifers that were situated outside their natural distribution ranges. For beech and conifers situated at the upper altitudinal limits, temperature was negatively correlated with defoliation, i.e., temperature had a positive influence on health status.

AB  - Fish wastage and market prices highly depend on accurate and reliable predictions of product shelf life and quality. The Quality Index Method (QIM) and EU grading criteria for whitefish (Council Regulation(EC) No 2406/96,1996) are established sensory methods used in the market to monitor fish quality. Each assessment requires the consultation of a panel of trained experts. The indexes refer exclusively to the current state of the fish without any predictions about its evolution in the following days.
   This work proposes the development of a smart quality sensor which enables to measure quality and to predict its progress through time. The sensor combines information of biochemical and microbial spoilage indexes with dynamic models to predict quality in terms of the QIM and EU grading criteria. Besides, the sensor can account for the variability inside the batch if spoilage indexes are measured in more than one fish sample.
   The sensor is designed and tested to measure quality in fresh cod (Gadus morhua) under commercial ice storage conditions. Only two spoilage indexes, psychrotrophic counts and total volatile base-nitrogen content, were required to get accurate estimations of the two usual established sensory methods. The sensor is able to account for biological variability as shown with the validation and demonstration data sets. Moreover, new research and technologies are in course to make these measurements faster and non-destructive. This would allow having at hand a smart non-intrusive fish quality sensor.

AB  - In studying the hydro-ecological conditions in northwestern Sichuan of southwestern China, an area at the edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, stream waters were extensively sampled and analyzed for the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios (delta H-2 and delta O-18) which are often excellent indicators for a water body genesis and evolvement. The heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen were found to be, in general, gradually depleted from east to west in the region; the phenomenon is attributed mainly to continentality based on the assumption that the isotopic signatures in the precipitations were preserved in the stream waters. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 data from the Yangtze River basin were found to fall well on the global meteoric water line (GMWL), indicative of the fact that the runoff waters in this basin were primarily of meteoric origin with a regional weak evaporation prevailing during our sampling time. However, the isotopic data from a relatively small part of the area in the north belonging to the Yellow River basin are characterized by the appreciably flatter slope of the local water isotope line and lower d-excess values, suggesting that the steam waters had undergone significant evaporation due to kinetic fractionations of isotopes in a more arid climate. The stable isotope data were also applied in calculating water mixing for some selected rivers. This study represents a snapshot study of the area's hydro-ecology; more systematic studies are required in better understanding the seasonal hydrological variations.

AB  - Stable isotope analysis has been applied to the investigation of movement in several species, including marine animals. However, its application to nekton living in open coastal areas is still very scarce. This study aims to test if stable isotope analysis can be used for this purpose over a much wider spatial scale than previously investigated. Stable isotope analysis was used to 1) investigate isotopic variation in shrimp and fish, in 11 sites, along a 160 km coastal stretch, to 2) determine the site fidelity of the individuals within each species, and to 3) test the relation between the body size of the individuals within each species, at each site and the percentage of isotopic deviants. Site fidelity was the highest for the intertidal fish Gobius paganellus and Coryphoblennius galerita, with 60% and 64% of individuals considered residents, respectively, and lowest for the demersal fish Diplodus vulgaris and Diplodus sargus with 23% and 33% of resident individuals, respectively. The percentage of isotopic deviants was not correlated with length in any species. Site fidelity was considerably higher than that previously found for other open coastal areas and similar to more structured environments, like coastal ponds. It was hypothesized that the complex tri-dimensional structure of the rocky reefs that occur in this area, often encompassing channels and tide pools, offers conditions favourable to high site fidelity. This study shows that stable isotopes can be used to infer nekton movement in wide open coastal areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article analyzes data of labor motivation studies in Russian society currently undergoing a transformation with particular emphasis on the methods of studying this motivation. It demonstrated that the most frequently utilized methods (in the Soviet times, as well as in post-Soviet period) do not provide adequate information that can be applied directly to the practices of managing work process of the employees. With the help of these methodologies, we are able to identify the value systems of everyday consciousness, but not the motivational importance of labor factors. Based on the materials of a study, conducted at two private industrial enterprises from 2013 on, by using direct questions, we found out that labor motives there are: good salary, work safety, convenient work hours, relations with co-workers, adequate sanitary-hygienic conditions, job security, relations with management and interesting work. Author proposes a new methodology, in which definition of the relevance and significance of the elements of production situation is based on the analysis of correlation between indicators that reflect a balance between work values (aspirations) and ability to implement them in the labor activities (character of the current work), on the one hand, and nature of the identification of the workers with the company, on the other. As a result of its application for the workers at two private industrial enterprises from 2013 the labor content and utilization of their abilities under current production situation appeared to be the most significant. Public recognition of their work efforts, relations with management and job security also turned out to be a significant element of production situation. Proposed methodology can be utilized to identify controllable factors of labor activities of workers at specific industrial enterprises.

AB  - The potential effects of monotypic and binary metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs, ZnO, NiO, Co3O4 and TiO2) on microbial growth were evaluated in sandy soil collected from artificial recharge sites. Microbial growth was assessed based on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, dehydrogenase activity (DHA), and viable cell counts (VCC). Microbial growth based on ATP content and VCC showed considerable differences depending on NP type and concentration, whereas DHA did not significantly change. In general, ZnO NPs showed the strongest effect on microbial growth in all measurements, showing an EC50 value of 10.9 mg/L for ATP content. The ranking (EC50) of NPs based on their effect on microbial growth assessed by ATP content and VCC was ZnO > Co3O4 > NiO > TiO2. Upon exposure to binary NP mixtures, synergistic and additive modes of action were observed for ATP content and VCC, respectively. The ranges of observed (P(O)) and expected (P(E)) activity were 83%-92% and 78%-82% of the control (p-value 0.0010) based on ATP content and 78%-95% and 72%-94% of the control (p-value 0.8813) based on VCC under the tested conditions, respectively. The results indicate that the effects of NP mixtures on microbial growth in the sandy soil matrix were as great, or greater, than those of single NPs. Therefore, understanding the effects of single NPs and NP mixtures is essential for proper ecological risk assessment. Additionally, these findings demonstrate that the evaluation of NP effects may be profoundly influenced by the method of microbial growth measurement.

AB  - Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are promoted in China to ease increasing pressures of urban air pollution and oil security. In this paper, we measured two Toyota Prius HEVs by using a portable emission measurement system (PEMS) to evaluate their real-world performance with regard to gaseous emission factors and fuel consumption. Our results indicated that their average exhaust emission factors of CO, THC, NOX and CO2 were 0.25 +/- 0.08 g km(-1), 0.015 +/- 0.002 g km(-1), 0.009 +/- 0.005 g km(-1) and 136 +/- 21 g km(-1) (i.e., 5.81 +/- 0.90 L 100 km(-1) for fuel consumption) respectively, while driving the averaged on-road traffic pattern. Compared to conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles, the tested HEVs demonstrated significant advantages in simultaneously mitigating major air pollutants (e.g., NOX), greenhouse gas emissions (CO2) and fuel consumption. For example, average CO2 emission factors are reduced by approximately 35% and 15% relative to conventional gasoline and diesel cars in Macao. Unlike conventional gasoline and diesel cars, relative CO2 emission factors of HEVs were much less sensitive to speed change, while their relative NOX emission factors were reduced as average speed became lower. This indicates significant environmental and energy benefits from HEVs under congested driving conditions. Our assessment suggests that HEVs are a competitive technology option for the taxi fleet in Macao with strong advantages in saving fuel cost for taxi drivers and mitigating NOX emissions.

AB  - The effects of a dietary plant allelochemical, xanthotoxin (XA), on survivorship, development, male and female adult longevity, fecundity, and hatchability of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella L. were investigated. Oxidative stress indicators, the lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde (MDA), and protein oxidation products, protein carbonyl (PCO) contents, and activities of a detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity were determined in wax moth adults. The insect was reared from first-instar larvae on an artificial diets containing XA at 0.001, 0.005, or 0.1% to adult stage in laboratory conditions. Relative to the controls, the diets containing XA concentrations led to decreased survivorship in seventh instar, pupal, and adult stages. Compared to control diet (77.7%), the highest dietary XA concentration decreased survivorship to adulthood to 11.0%. The highest XA concentration (0.1%) reduced female longevity from 10.4 to 5.7 days and decreased egg numbers from 95.0 to 33.5 and hatchability from 82.7 to 35.6%. The lowest XA concentration (0.001%) led to about a sixfold increase in MDA content. XA at high concentrations (0.005 and 0.1%) increased MDA (by threefold) and protein carbonyl (by twofold) contents decreased GST activity. The highest dietary XA concentration decreased GST activity from 0.28 +/- 0.025 to 0.16 +/- 0.005 mu mol/mg protein/min. We infer from these findings that XA-induced oxidative stress led to decreased biological fitness. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Wheat (Triticum sativus L.) seedlings of various ages (2- to 16-day-old plants) were used to study age-dependent changes in the chlorophyll fluorescence induction (CFI) at various light intensities during flu- orescence measurements. Plants were raised in a growth chamber using hydroponics with expanded clay, controlled environmental conditions, and 690 A mu mol/(m(2) s) photon flux density (PFD) of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Parameters of CFI were determined under actinic PFD of 380, 580, 820, and 1340 A mu mol/(m(2) s) PAR. The fifth leaf from the stem base, exposed to uniform lighting, was sampled for measurements. This leaf emerged at the plant age of 16 days. Based on fluorescence data, we calculated the maximal photochemical quantum yield of photosystem II (F (v)/F (m)), the effective photochemical quantum yield of PSII (Yield), parameters of photochemical (qP) and non-photochemical (qN and NPQ) quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, the F (p)/F (t) ratio, and the "vitality index" (fluorescence decrease ratio, R (fd)). At moderate actinic PFD, applied commonly in PAM fluorometers (about 380 A mu mol/(m(2) s)), age-dependent changes in NPQ, F (p)/F (t), and R (fd) were observed. Analysis of CFI parameters in wheat leaves of different ages at PFD increasing from 380 to 820 A mu mol/(m(2) s) revealed that R (fd), NPQ, and qN are the most sensitive markers of the leaf age among all parameters tested. These suitable indicators can be used for rapid assessment of the leaf age.

AB  - Bioretention systems and biofilters are used in low impact development to passively treat urban stormwater. However, these engineered natural systems are not efficient at removing fecal indicator bacteria, the contaminants responsible for a majority of surface water impairments. The present study investigates the efficacy of biochar-augmented model sand biofilters for escherichia coli removal under a variety of stormwater bacterial concentrations and infiltration rates. Additionally, we test the role of biochar particle size and "presence of compost on model" biofilter performance. Our results show that E. coli removal in a biochar-augmented sand biofilter is similar to 96% and is not greatly affected by increases in stormwater infiltration rates and influent bacterial concentrations, particularly within the ranges expected in field. Removal of fine (<125 mu m) biochar particles from the biochar sand biofilter decreased the removal capacity from 95% to 62%, indicating biochar size is important. Addition of compost to biochar-sand biofilters not only lowered E. coli removal capacity but also increased the mobilization of deposited bacteria during intermittent infiltration. This result is attributed to exhaustion of attachment sites on biochar by the dissolved organic carbon leached from compost. Overall, our study indicates that biochar has potential to remove bacteria from stormwater under a wide range of field conditions, but for biochar to be effective, the size should be small and biochar should be applied without compost. Although the results aid in the optimization of biofilter design further studies are needed to examine biochar potential in the field over an entire rainy season.

AB  - Proper assessment of environmental quality or degradation requires knowledge of how terrestrial C pools respond to land use change. Forest plantations offer a considerable potential to sequester C in aboveground biomass. However, their impact on initial levels of soil organic carbon (SOC) varies from strong losses to gains, possibly affecting C balances in afforestation or reforestation initiatives. We compiled paired-plot studies on how SOC stocks under native vegetation change after planting fast-growth Eucalyptus species in Brazil, where these plantations are becoming increasingly important. SOC changes for the 0-20 and 0-40cm depths varied between -25 and 42Mgha(-1), following a normal distribution centered near zero. After replacing native vegetation by Eucalyptus plantations, mean SOC changes were -15 and 03Mgha(-1) for the 0-20 and 0-40cm depths, respectively. These are very low figures in comparison to C stocks usually sequestered in aboveground biomass and were statistically nonsignificant as demonstrated by a t-test at p<005. Similar low, nonsignificant SOC changes were estimated after data were stratified into first or second rotation cycles, soil texture and biome (savanna, rainforest or grassland). Although strong SOC losses or gains effectively occurred in some cases, their underpinning causes could not be generally identified in the present work and must be ascribed in a case basis, considering the full set of environmental and management conditions. We conclude that Eucalyptus spp. plantations in average have no net effect on SOC stocks in Brazil. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The development of quantitative temperature reconstructions in regions of paleoclimate interest is an important step for providing reliable temperature estimates in that region. Fossil chironomid assemblages have been studied in Patagonia showing great promise for reconstructing paleotemperatures; however there is still a lack of robust temperature inference models in that area.
   To contribute to the understanding of climate change, a transfer function using chironomids preserved in 46 lakes in Chile and Argentina was developed. The best performing model to infer the mean air temperature of the warmest month was a 3-component WA-PLS model with a coefficient of correlation (r(jack)(2)) of 0.56, a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1.69 degrees C and a maximum bias of 2.07 degrees C. This model was applied to the chironomids preserved in the sediment of the Huelmo mire (41 degrees 31'S, 73 degrees 00'W), in the lake district of northwestern Patagonia. The reconstruction showed several cold spells (one at 13,200 to 13,000 cal yr BP and a cooling trend between 12,600 and 11,500 cal yr BP) associated with the Younger Dryas and/or Huelmo-Mascardi Cold Reversal (HMCR). Our findings support climate models proposing fast acting inter-hemispheric coupling mechanisms including the recently proposed bipolar atmospheric and/or bipolar ocean teleconnections rather than a bipolar see-saw model.

AB  - Thus far, members of the genus Dehalococcoides are the only microorganisms known to dehalogenate chlorinated ethenes to ethene and thereby detoxify these common groundwater pollutants. Therefore, it is important to characterize the taxonomic and functional diversity of these key microorganisms and their reductive dehalogenase (RDase) genes in contaminated aquifers for assessing the natural attenuation potential. Little is known about the diversity of RDase genes under field conditions or in laboratory systems under selective pressure during dechlorination activities. Here, we evaluate the diversity of Dehalococcoides sp. and three RDase genes in groundwater as well as in water from a constructed wetland and microcosms setup with contaminated groundwater from the same field site in Bitterfeld (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany). The presence and relative abundance of Pinellas and Cornell subgroups of Dehalococcoides was evaluated by a novel direct sequencing method, which revealed that all sequences were identical and affiliated to the Pinellas subgroup. Contrarily, our results showed remarkable differences at the functional gene level between the systems. Of the vinyl chloride reductase genes, vcrA was detected in samples from the groundwater, wetland, and microcosms, whereas bvcA was only found in wetland and microcosm samples. The trichloroethene dehalogenase gene, tceA could not be detected at all, although complete dehalogenation activity of higher chlorinated ethenes was observed. Our study demonstrates that although the Dehalococcoides 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from the investigated systems were identical, the RDase gene diversity varied among the systems, according to the spectrum of the chlorinated ethenes present.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on fetal insulin resistance or beta-cell function in Chinese pregnant women with GDM.
   Measurements: Maternal fasting blood and venous cord blood samples (reflecting fetal condition) were collected in 65 well-controlled Chinese GDM mothers (only given dietary intervention) and 83 control subjects. The insulin, glucose and proinsulin concentrations of both maternal and cord blood samples were measured, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the proinsulin-to-insulin ratios (an indicator of fetal beta-cell function) were calculated in maternal and cord blood respectively.
   Results: Both maternal and fetal levels of insulin, proinsulin and HOMA-IR but not proinsulin-to-insulin ratios were significantly higher in the GDM group than in the control group (maternal insulin, 24.8 vs. 15.4 mu U/mL, P = 0.004, proinsulin, 23.3 vs. 16.2 pmol/L, P = 0.005, and HOMA-IR, 5.5 vs. 3.5, P = 0.041, respectively; fetal: insulin, 15.1 vs. 7.9 mu U/mL, P<0.001, proinsulin, 25.8 vs. 15.1 pmol/L, P = 0.015, and HOMA-IR, 2.8 vs. 1.4, P = 0.017, respectively). Fetal HOMA-IR but not proinsulin-to-insulin ratios was significantly correlated to maternal HOMA-IR (r = 0.307, P = 0.019), in the pregnant women with GDM.
   Conclusions: Fetal insulin resistance was higher in Chinese pregnant women with GDM than control subjects, and correlated with maternal insulin resistance.

AB  - Mercury is a major contaminant in the Arctic marine ecosystem. While extensive studies have been conducted on mercury in the Arctic's atmosphere and biota, far less is known about the distribution and dynamics of mercury species in the Arctic Ocean. Here, we present vertical profiles for total mercury (Hg-T) and total methylated mercury (MeHgT, sum of monomethylmercury and dimethylmercury) from the Beaufort Sea of the Arctic Ocean at locations with differing sea ice conditions. The concentration of Hg-T ranged from 0.40 to 2.9 pM, with a surface enrichment that can be attributed to a combination of sea ice-modified atmospheric deposition and riverine input. The concentration of MeHgT ranged from <0.04 to 0.59 pM, with a subsurface peak occurring at the same depth as a nutrient maximum with lower dissolved oxygen, which is consistent with the recent findings in the Pacific Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Mediterranean Sea. However, unlike the interior ocean regions, the nutrient maximum in the Beaufort Sea is predominantly an advective feature produced over the Chukchi Shelf. On the basis of the short lifetime of monomethylmercury in seawater, we propose that the MeHgT profile in the Beaufort Sea reflects the local, short-term remineralization of labile organic matter, and not the larger signal of organic remineralization advected from the Chukchi Sea in the halocline. The finding that MeHgT is produced locally, reflecting recent strength of organic matter cycling, not only explains wide variance in MeHgT in seawater and biota over time and space, but also implies that MeHgT could be used as an indicator of the recent export flux of labile organic matter.

AB  - The attempt to identify traits associated with plant invasions has revealed ambiguous results to date. Accounting for environmental and temporal variation in multispecies trait comparisons of native and invasive species might help explain such inconsistency.
   The relative importance of light and nutrient availability was tested in a greenhouse experiment on trait expression and variation of 15 native and 15 invasive herb species from Southeast China. In addition, N uptake of a subset of these species and its temporal pattern were assessed by means of a N-15 tracer experiment.
   A predominant lack of significant differences between the two status groups indicated strong overall trait similarities, thus supporting the 'join-the-local' hypothesis. However, at high light levels, the invasive species displayed significantly higher trait relative growth rates, whereas the native species had a higher tissue quality as displayed in a higher dry matter content of shoots and leaves. The invasion success of the invasive species could neither be explained by a general higher N uptake nor by a distinction in temporal N uptake strategy between native and invasive species.
   Despite comparable fundamental niches of the species, increased growth rates under beneficial light conditions may provide a head start advantage for invasive species compared to native ones.

AB  - As entomophilous plants, water lilies (Nymphaea) and spatterdocks (Nuphar) have low pollen production, thus can be under represented in the sediment record. These macrophytes produce distinctly shaped sclerenchyma tissue referred to as stone-cells, trichosclereids, astrosclereids or simply sclereids. This study examines the utility of using sclereids from two common species from the Nymphaeaceae Family as an alternative to their pollen. Histological studies of fresh tissues of Nymphaea odorata and Nuphar lutea show that each has distinct sclereids, but there has been confusion in the terminology used to designate their morphology. Some reports have referred to Nymphaeaceae sclereids as trichosclereids, but our histological studies show that the cells are more appropriately classified as polyramous, astrosclereids, librosclereids or rhizosclereids. Tissues from both species were treated using HCL, KOH, acetolysis and HF. We found that only the sclereids from N. lutea survived chemical treatments in a detectable form, indicating that sclereids from N. lutea can be a useful indicator of presence while the chance of observing sclereids from N. odorata in pollen preparations is very low, severely limiting the utility of the latter as a paleoecological indicator. Another limitation to using sclereids as a proxy is that they originate from tissues that require extended acetolysis treatments for release from the matrix. Finally, we examined sclereid abundance in sediments from a slough in the Florida Ever-glades, USA to determine if abundance of Nymphaeaceae sclereids correlates with Nymphaeaceae pollen and we find no significant correlation. Additional analyses are required to determine if empirical relationships exist amongst plant populations, pollen, sclereids and environmental conditions. A clear report of chemical treatments used and processing times are critical to verify results of studies utilizing sclereids. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leaf fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is considered an important indicator of environmentally induced stress in plants, but the relationship between herbivory and FA levels is not clear. In this study we compared leaf size and shape, leaf area consumed by herbivorous insects, and FA levels between individuals of Heliocarpus pallidus (Tiliaceae) from two adjacent and contrasting habitat types (deciduous and riparian) in the Chamela-Cuixmala tropical dry-forest biosphere reserve. Ten individuals of H. pallidus were collected in each habitat type. Leaf shape was assessed using geometric morphometric techniques. Results indicated statistically significant differences in leaf shape between individuals from the two habitat types. In individuals from the riparian habitat leaf area (mean = 42.3 +/- 1.2 cm(2)), herbivory levels (mean = 25.5% +/- 1.8%) and FA levels (mean = 0.38 +/- 0.04 cm) were significantly higher than in individuals from the deciduous habitat (17.2 +/- 3.5 cm(2); 9.6% +/- 1.0% and 0.18 +/- 0.04 cm, respectively). Within habitats, significant correlations were found between total leaf area and percentage leaf area removed by insects (R-2 = 0.92 in riparian habitats, R-2 = 0.9 in deciduous habitats), and between percentage leaf area removed and FA (R-2 = 0.70 in riparian habitats, R-2 = 0.79 in deciduous habitats). As has been suggested for other plant species, it is possible that the more favourable conditions in the riparian habitat enhance leaf growth, resulting in higher FA. Also, individuals in this habitat might be characterized by lower chemical defence and/or higher nutritional quality, which would explain the higher herbivory levels.

AB  - Numerous biological and chemical paleorecords have been used to infer paleoclimate, lake level fluctuation and faunal composition from the drill cores obtained from Lake Malawi, Africa. However, fish fossils have never been used to examine changes in African Great Lake vertebrate aquatic communities nor as indicators of changing paleolimnological conditions. Here we present results of analyses of a lake Malawi core dating back similar to 144 ka that describe and quantify the composition and abundance of fish fossils and report on stable carbon isotopic data (delta C-13) from fish scale, bone and tooth fossils. We compared the fossil delta C-13 values to delta C-13 values from extant fish communities to determine whether carbon isotope ratios can be used as indicators of inshore versus offshore pelagic fish assemblages. Fossil buccal teeth, pharyngeal teeth and mills, vertebra and scales from the fish families Cichlidae and Cyprinidae occur in variable abundance throughout the core. Carbon isotopic ratios from numerous fish fossils throughout the core range between -7.2 and -27.5 parts per thousand, similar to those found in contemporary Lake Malawi benthic and pelagic fish faunas. These results are the first paleo-record of fish fossils from a Lake Malawi sediment core and the first reported delta C-13 values from Lake Malawi fish fossils. This approach provides a new methodology and framework for interpreting pelagic versus inshore fish faunas, lake level fluctuations and the evolution of the Lake Malawi fish assemblages.

AB  - The forms and availability of heavy metals in contaminated soils determine the uptake potential of plants and water contamination by leaching. In this study different methods of chemical extraction were used, in order to identify the forms of Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn and evaluate the availability of these pollutants for sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), black oat (Avena strigosa Schreber) (exotic species) and Bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) (native Species), as indicators, in soils of Pb mining and metallurgy in Adrianopolis, state of Parana, Brazil. Soil samples were collected in the 0-40 cm layer in four environments of the area: soil 1 - control (native forest); soil 2 - waste in soil profile,- soil 3 - near the factory chimney (deposition of particulate material); soil 4 - heavy deposition of waste. The following extraction methods were used: DTPA-TEA pH 7.3; Ca(NO3)(2) 0.5 mol L-1; HNO3 0.5, 1.0 and 4.0 mol L-1, and concentrated HNO3/HCl (3:1). The plants were grown in a greenhouse, with three replications. The increase of pseudo-total, exchangeable and non-exchangeable heavy metal contents was verified; the highest contents of Pb and Zn Were extracted by HNO3/HCl; 9,678.2 and 894.8 mg kg(-1), respectively. Soil heavy metals based on acid extractors HNO3 0.5, 1.0 and 4.0 mol L-1 and HNO3/HCl were strongly correlated with each other. The extractor based on chelation (DTPA-TEA pH 7.3) was not efficient to predict the availability of heavy metals for plants under the study conditions. The nitric extractions should be preferred to determine Pb and Zn plant availability in the area.

AB  - Endothelial cell injury/dysfunction is considered to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis and septic shock. Although it is considered that endothelial cell apoptosis is involved in endothelial injury/dysfunction. physiological involvement remains ambiguous since the induction of apoptosis requires the inhibition of endogenous apoptosis inhibitors. Here we show that caspase-3 activation, a biological indicator of apoptosis, is observed in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Stimulation even under the influence of endogenous apoptosis inhibitors, and that activated caspase-3 is rapidly released from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) In the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), an increase in intracellular caspase-3/7 activity in response to LIPS was not detected in HUVEC up to 24 h following Stimulation even in the presence of LPS-binding protein (LBP). soluble CD14 and soluble MD-2, whereas the decrease in cell viability and increase in release of the cellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were observed in a soluble CD14/LBP-dependent manner On the other hand, even in the absence of CHX, a significant increase in caspase-3/7 activity and a cleaved caspase-3 fragment with a slight increase in LDH release was observed in culture supernatants in response to LIPS This increase in caspase-3/7 activity was observed even when LDH release was undetected. These results indicate that caspase-3 is activated by LIPS under physiological conditions and suggest that HUVEC escape from cell death by rapidly releasing activated caspase-3 into extracellular space. Failure of this escape mechanism may result in endothelial injury/dysfunction (C) 2009 Elsevier B V. All rights reserved

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant (reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)) and the oxidant (nitric oxide (NO), lipid peroxidation (MDA)) status of hepatopancreas, gills and muscle tissues of freshwater crayfish (A. leptodactylus) collected from the Keban Dam Lake and to evaluate the effect of aquatic pollution on these parameters. The crayfish samples were obtained from contaminated (Agm) and uncontaminated (Aydincik) stations at Keban Dam Lake in August 2007. The GSH-Px activity was significantly lower (p<0.05) in the gills and significantly higher (p<001) in muscle tissues samples from crayfish collected at the contaminated station compared to those collected from the uncontaminated station. GSH levels were lower in the gill and muscle of the crayfish collected at the contaminated station (p<0.05, p<0.001 respectively). No significant different in the levels of the GSH-Px and GSH in the hepatopancreas was observed between stations. The MDA levels were significantly higher in hepatopancreas, gill and muscle of the crayfish in the contaminated station (p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.01). However, NO level was found significantly higher in the hepatopancreas of crayfish from the contaminated station (p<0.01), whereas there was no difference between stations in gill or muscle tissue NO. The noted tissue distributions of the investigated parameters most likely reflected different metabolic activities and different responses to environmental conditions in the examined tissues. In particular, MDA can be a sensitive indicator of aquatic pollution.

AB  - 1. A novel experimental approach was taken to investigate the effects of distance from rainforest remnants on the recolonisation patterns of ants and other soil and litter arthropods in 'restored' habitat patches within a pasture matrix.
   2. Experimental habitat patches were created by adding a thick mulch of sterilised woodchips and leaves, and simulating shade using shadecloth, to create conditions similar to those that occur during rainforest restoration. These patches were deployed at five experimental sites in the Maleny plateau of subtropical eastern Australia. Artificial habitat patches were located at varying distances from a rainforest edge at each site, as well as within the rainforest. The experiment also included a test for efficacy of inoculation, which involved translocation of a small quantity of litter ( containing live arthropods) from rainforest habitat to isolated habitat patches.
   3. The results showed that, after 9 months, there was little colonisation by rainforest-dependent taxa in any of the experimental plots beyond those closely adjacent to forest patches. Inoculation was unsuccessful in increasing the extent of arthropod establishment.
   4. A number of explanations that potentially account for the observed results are suggested. An experimental approach provides an opportunity to test explicitly for factors considered important for the development of biota in restored habitat patches. There are, however, unavoidable limitations associated with the design of experiments that simulate small-scale analogues of restoration treatments. Avoiding these limitations may require controlled and replicated efforts in experimental restoration over larger areas, based on collaborations between researchers and practitioners.

AB  - This study focuses on the response of lacustrine littoral chironomid communities to late glacial changes in limnological, environmental and climate conditions in the Mediterranean context. Late glacial chironomid (Diptera: Chironomidae) assemblages, organic petrography and geochemistry were analysed in a sediment core from the littoral zone of Lago dell'Accesa (Tuscany, Italy), where the lake-level fluctuations and the vegetation history have been previously reconstructed. Comparison of the chironomid stratigraphy to other proxies (pollen assemblages, organic petrography and geochemistry, lake-level) and regional climate reconstruction suggested the predominant influence of lake-level changes on the littoral chironomid fauna. The main lowering events that occurred during the Oldest and the Younger Dryas were followed by higher proportions of taxa typical of littoral habitats. A complementary study of organic matter suggested the indirect impact of lake-level on the chironomids through changes in humic status and habitat characteristics, such as the type of substrate and aquatic macrophyte development. Several chironomid taxa, such as Glyptotendipes, Microtendipes and Cricotopus type patens, were identified as possible indicators of low lake-level in the late glacial records. Nevertheless, this study suggested that parallel analyses of organic matter and chironomid assemblages may be needed to circumvent misinterpretation of littoral chironomid assemblage stratigraphy. There was a weak response of the chironomid assemblages to small lake-level lowerings that corresponded to the Older Dryas and Preboreal oscillations. A higher level of determination, e.g. to the species group level, may be necessary to increase the sensibility of the indicators to lake-level changes.

AB  - Fast-growing macroalgae, including Ulva lactuca Linnaeus, respond rapidly to changes in nutrient conditions, particularly to short-term N supply. This ability to rapidly take up and assimilate N contributes to the increasing occurrence of macroalgal blooms in heavily N loaded coastal ecosystems. To determine whether long-term nutrient histories affect short-term responses in activity of N-assimilating enzymes, including nitrate reductase (NRA) and glutamine synthetase activity (GSA), internal N storage, and macroalgal growth, we conducted an in situ nitrate fertilization experiment between 7 and 22 July 2004, with fronds of U. lactuca collected from estuaries with high and low N loads in Waquoit Bay, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA (N 41 degrees and W 70 degrees). Initial NRA, GSA, % N, delta N-15, and growth of U. lactuca fronds were higher in the site where nitrate was in high supply. Differences in NRA persisted even after short-term experimental enrichment. Differences in internal N pools, delta N-15, and growth, in contrast, mirrored the changes of nutrient supply. The rate of turnover of the internal N content of U. lactuca was quite short (< 2 d), and turnover of enzyme activity may have been even shorter. N isotopic fractionation by U. lactuca appeared to be of small magnitude, unlike the case of phytoplankton, and similar to that of vascular plants. delta N-15 was a better indicator of short-term response to external and internal nutrient supplies in U. lactuca than enzyme activity or N content, and may reliably detect rapid changes in N availability, source, and uptake and assimilation processes.

AB  - In the last few years there has been great concern about declines in the abundance of several species of amphibians around the world. Among amphibians, anurans have a biphasic life cycle, with aquatic tadpoles and generally terrestrial adults, and they have an extremely permeable skin, making them excellent indicators of the health of the environment. A number of different causes have been suggested for the global decline of anurans, the pollution of their habitat by chemical stressors being considered one of the major factors. Among chemical stressors, heavy metals are known for their high toxicity at very low concentrations. This study assessed short- (96 h, 'acute') and long-term (1272 h, 'chronic') exposure to Cr(VI) at lethal (3 to 90 mg l(-1)) and sublethal concentrations (0.001 to 12 mg l(-1)) on Hypsiboas pulchellus (previously called Hyla pulchella; see Faivovich et al. 2005) tadpoles (Fam. Hylidae) from central eastern Argentina. Fertilized eggs collected from a clean pond near La Plata (Buenos Aires Province) were used for acute and chronic toxicity testing. Assays were done under controlled laboratory conditions. Results of chronic exposure were used to assess the effect of factors such as toxicant concentration and age of organisms at the beginning of exposure on the response variables (growth, development and survival until metamorphosis). Results indicated a higher sensitivity to Cr(VI) of individuals first exposed as tadpoles than those first exposed as embryos during acute and chronic exposure. Exposure to the highest sublethal concentrations (6 to 12 mg l(-1)) of the toxicant showed early inhibitory effects on growth of all treated organisms compensated at longer exposure periods with an increase in the growth rate compared to the control groups.

AB  - New epidemiological and neurohormonal evidence provides insights into the persistent public health issue of preterm delivery and its long-term health consequences for the newborn. Mechanisms linked to preterm delivery may originate early in gestation as a result of maternal cues signaling a stressful intrauterine environment. When these signals are present, the fetus responds with a series of facultative responses, including accelerated organ maturation. If these responses are unsuccessful and the environment remains insufficient, a series of feed-forward mechanisms initiate the hormonal cascade that leads to parturition, and thus, early expulsion from a stressful environment. The internal environmental cues are delivered via glucocorticoids (stress hormones) in the circulatory system, but fetal responses and the initiation of the final terminal pathway to parturition are regulated by placentally derived corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The potential costs of early expulsion from a stressful intrauterine environment are high and include an increased likelihood of perinatal and infant mortality. Permanent alterations in organ and metabolic functioning may occur, suggesting considerable fitness trade-offs. There is some evidence that preterm parturition is a maternal adaptation to limit the energetic costs of individual pregnancies in the face of poor condition at the time of conception. Moreover, nutritional stress is not the only indicator that signals a stressful environment: maternal psychosocial stress, and thus her response to an assessment of the social environment, also signal an insufficient internal environment to the fetus. The epidemiological and neurohormonal evidence for these relationships and mechanisms responsible for regulating such delicate negotiations are explored. In turn, the implications of such findings are examined from life history and public health perspectives. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Leaf nitrogen content per area (N-area) is a good indicator of assimilative capacity of leaves of deciduous broad-leaved trees. This study examined the degrees of increase in Narea in response to canopy openings as leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf nitrogen content per mass (N-mass) in saplings of eight deciduous broad-leaved tree species in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Five of the species were well-branched species with a large number of small leaves (lateral-growth type), and the other three species were less-branched species with a small number of large leaves (vertical-growth type). The degrees of increase in Narea were compared between the two crown types. In closed-canopy conditions, leaves of the vertical-growth species tended to have a lower LMA and higher N-mass than those of the lateral-growth species, which resulted in similar N-area for both. LMA increased in canopy openings in the eight species, and the degrees of increase were not largely different between the lateral- and vertical-growth species. On the contrary, N-mass was unchanged in canopy openings in the eight species. As a result, N-area of each species increased in canopy openings in proportion to the increase in LMA, and the degrees of increase in N-area were similar in the lateral- and vertical-growth species. Therefore, this study showed that the degrees of increase in N-area were not correlated with the crown architecture (i.e., the lateral- and vertical-growth types).

AB  - Energy-dependent exciton quenching, or q(E), protects the higher plant photosynthetic apparatus from photodamage. Initiation of qE involves protonation of violaxanthin deepoxidase and PsbS, a component of the photosystem II antenna complex, as a result of lumen acidification driven by photosynthetic electron transfer. It has become clear that the response of qE to linear electron flow, termed "q(E) sensitivity," must be modulated in response to fluctuating environmental conditions. Previously, three mechanisms have been proposed to account for qE modulation: (i) the sensitivity of qE to the lumen pH is altered; (it) elevated cyclic electron flow around photosystem I increases proton translocation into the lumen; and (iii) lowering the conductivity of the thylakoid ATP synthase to protons (g(H+)) allows formation of a larger steady-state proton motive force (pmf). Kinetic analysis of the electrochromic shift of intrinsic thylakoid pigments, a linear indicator of transthylakoid electric field component, suggests that, when CO2 alone was lowered from 350 ppm to 50 ppm CO2, modulation of qE sensitivity could be explained solely by changes in conductivity. Lowering both CO2 (to 50 ppm) and O-2 (to 1%) resulted in an additional increase in q(E) sensitivity that could not be explained by changes in conductivity or cyclic electron flow associated with photosystem 1. Evidence is presented for a fourth mechanism, in which changes in q(E) sensitivity result from variable partitioning of proton motive force into the electric field and pH gradient components. The implications of this mechanism for the storage of proton motive force and the regulation of the light reactions are discussed.

AB  - Information regarding the mobility of applied chemicals to soils is essential for environmental assessment of potential leaching to groundwater supplies. In this study, the mobility of deltamethrin applied to soil columns with different properties was investigated. The approach used was that of a modified miscible displacement, or transport approach, where soil columns under soil-water-saturated conditions and constant flow velocity were maintained. The extent of deltamethrin leaching losses was measured by quantifying deltamethrin concentration in the effluent solution versus time. After the transport experiments were conducted, each soil column was sectioned into 2-cm increments, and the amount of deltamethrin retained by the soil was determined from sequential methanol extractions. All measured breakthrough curves (BTCs) exhibited extensive asymmetry with sharp adsorption fronts. Extremely low mobility, and thus strong retention for deltamethrin in the soil columns, was observed. With continuous leaching of up to 80 pore volumes, effluent results showed that cumulative leaching of deltamethrin was small and ranged from only 3 to 8% of that applied. Moreover, 92 to 93% of that applied remained within the 0-2-cm layer, with only 0.5-1% extracted from the subsequent lower depths (2-4-cm and 4-6-cm layers). Deltamethrin mobility was relatively higher in a reference sand material. The use of a multireaction and transport model (MRTM) proved successful in describing the BTC from the sand column and was in close agreement with measured deltamethrin results. Based on its extremely low mobility in soils, deltamethrin is considered to be not susceptible to leaching from the soil profile.

AB  - Heterotrophic flagellates occur in nearly all soils and, in most cases, many different species are present. Nevertheless, quantitative data on their community structure and diversity are sparse, possibly due to a lack of suitable techniques. Previous studies have tended to focus on either total flagellate numbers and biomass, or the identification and description of flagellate species present. With the increased awareness of the role of biodiversity and of food web interactions, the quantification of species within the community and their response to environmental change is likely to become more important. The present paper describes a modification of the most probable number method that allows such a quantification of individual flagellate morphotypes in soil samples. Observations were also made on the biomass of flagellate morphotypes in soil. 20 to 25 morphotypes of heterotrophic flagellates were detectable per gram of two different arable soils, which were treated experimentally to test the technique. One of the soils was fumigated with chloroform vapour for different lengths of time (0, 0.5, 2 or 24 hours); this led to a reduction in the number of morphotypes, in the Shannon diversity index and in the evenness. The other soil was planted with wheat, and while rhizosphere soils contained the same morphotypes as bulk soil, the abundance of individual morphotypes was significantly different and the Shannon diversity index in rhizosphere soils was significantly higher. Soil influenced by an elevated CO2 level likewise differed significantly in morphotype abundance when compared to soil exposed to ambient levels Of CO2. The technique recovered more than 80% of the discernible morphotypes and could also be used to quantify amoebal and ciliate communities in a similar way.

AB  - A recent survey of contaminant information for the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV), Texas, has shown that little is known about contaminants and their impacts on biota of resacas (oxbows) along the US-Mexico border. In 1996, fish were collected from four resacas in the Texas-Tamaulipas border region to assess contaminant loadings and their impacts on fish and birds. Tissue residue concentrations in fish were analyzed and also compared to two histopathological bioindicators of unhealthy environmental conditions. Of the organochlorine insecticides measured, DDE was the most common and was present at relatively high concentrations (10 mug/g w/w) at some sites. DDE concentrations were nearly 20 times greater in fish from resacas in Texas than from resacas in Tamaulipas, although the limited sample sizes obtained precluded statistical comparisons. DDE concentrations in fish from the two Texas resacas were also greater than those reported in fish from nearby areas during the 1980s and 1990s. Most trace element concentrations were similar among resacas from Texas and Tamaulipas. Arsenic, however, was two to six times greater in fish from a downtown resaca in Matamoros than in fish from other resacas in Tamaulipas and Texas. The bioindicators, pigment accumulation, and macrophage aggregates (MAs), in general reflected the contamination indicated by the tissue residues for each site. Overall, it appears that some resacas of the US-Mexico border region are contaminant sinks and could pose potential health or reproductive problems for fish and wildlife, and humans that consume fish from those sites.

AB  - The chemistry-turbulence interaction remains one of the most important topics in combustion research. The ignition of premixed reactants in a highly turbulent environment is fundamentally coupled to this chemistry-turbulence interaction. The spark-ignition (SI) internal combustion (IC) engine relies on the ability of the flame kernel to survive the high-strain-rate, unsteady environment of a turbulent flowfield and successfully transition into a fully developed flame to operate cleanly and efficiently. If certain length and velocity scales within the turbulence spectrum are found to promote flame kernel growth, then by tailoring the flow passages and aerodynamics of the intake valves, piston, and combustion chamber, it may be possible to increase the efficiency and reduce the emissions of SI IC engines. This paper describes a novel experimental investigation of a spark-generated flame kernel interacting with a single vortex toroid with well-defined length and velocity scales. This experiment measured the ability of a vortex to quench a growing kernel in a very lean methane-air mixture at atmospheric pressure. The absence of superequilibrium OH concentrations, qualitatively determined by planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF), was used as in indicator of quenching. It was found that larger eddies are more effective at globally quenching the flamefront, requiring a lower strength, when compared to vortices with a smaller characteristic length. At the globally quenching condition, the maturity of the kernel was then increased incrementally until the vortex was no longer able to completely strain out the kernel. The result of this was surprising in that the larger vortices had a much narrower range of kernel maturity for which the vortex could still quench the growing kernel.

AB  - Effects of temperature x photoperiod interaction on vegetative and reproductive growth were examined in three selected groundnut genotypes by growing them in controlled-environment growth chambers with three temperature regimes (22/18, 26/22, and 30/26 degrees C, day/night) under long (12 h, long day), and short (9 h, short day) photoperiods.
   The effect of photoperiod on the total dry-matter production (TDM) was significant with the genotypes producing 32-72 % greater dry matter under LD than SD. Temperature x genotype interaction effects were significant, with the dry-matter production being greatest at 26/22 degrees C and least at 30/26 degrees C and 22/18 degrees C in two of the three genotypes.
   Leaf area (LA) was greater under LD than SD at all temperature regimes. LA accounted for 76 % of the variation in shoot + root dry weight (R-2 = 0.76, P < 0.01). A lack of relationship between LA and pod weight or pod numbers suggested that the pod development is controlled by factors other than carbon assimilation.
   The temperature x photoperiod interaction was significant for root growth, with the root weight being maximal and photoperiod effects being minimal at 22/18 degrees C, while at 26/22 degrees C, root weight declined and photoperiod effects became prominent. Low temperature (22/18 degrees C) affected the reproductive development by reducing the proportion of reproductive nodes in total (vegetative + reproductive) nodes. The conversion of pegs into pods, as indicated by pod to peg ratio (PPR), was lower in LD than in SD conditions. Results suggested that the PPR could be used as an indicator of genotypic sensitivity to photoperiod in groundnut.

AB  - At Bois Madame (Gard, France), Zn-Pb-S mineralization (Zn/Pb >4) occurs in dolomitized Kimmeridgian carbonates very near layers which are rich in organic matter of planktonic origin. Previous geological and geochemical studies have suggested early syn- or diagenetic ore deposition controlled by sulphate reducing bacteria, the metals probably having originated from regionally mineralized Triassic or Liassic formations.
   Rock-Eval pyrolysis data, complemented by biomarkers, show that the organic matter reached only the organic diagenesis-catagenesis transition owing to burial (<1500 m sedimentary cover). The beta,beta-sterane concentrations are abnormally high for this maturity, and are postulated to have arisen from low temperature catalytic transformation of alpha,alpha-steranes by reduced or elemental sulphur. Bitumens are absent from the Bois-Madame deposit, but are present in the nearby Les Malines Zn-Pb deposit, as in many Pb-Zn-S deposits. The hydrocarbons, almost certainly autochthonous, show no indication of relatively late alteration by biodegradation or water washing. The presence of hopanes (C-27-35), with high abundance in the C-27-32 range, indicate that intense bacterial activity occurred during early diagenesis, under suboxic-anoxic conditions. This interpretation is reinforced by the presence of n-alkanes in the range n-C-22 to n-C-28 dominated by compounds with an even number of carbon atoms which may have derived from the reduction of bacterial fatty-acids. Except for these even number n-alkanes, the organic geochemical evidence for sulphate reducing bacteria during early diagenesis must remain equivocal.

T2  - SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY

AB  - Sheets of sponge spicule flint of Pennsylvanian age (Bashkirian, Moscovian, Kasimovian) that are present in the northern Appalachian Basin of Ohio and adjacent parts of Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, are important indicators of paleoshorelines. This flint typically occurs with or occupies the position normally held by shallow-water limestone and contains a normal marine fauna. The flint was deposited above coal or underclay, representing the detritus-starved marine portion of a transgressive-regressive sequence and marking the eastern limit of transgression across a westward-spreading alluvial plain.
   Flint occurs at several stratigraphic positions in the upper Pottsville-lower Conemaugh interval. The most important are: Boggs, Upper Mercer and Kanawha flints of the upper Pottsville Group; Kilgore-Flint Ridge, Zaleski and Vanport flints of the lower Allegheny Group; and Brush Creek flint of the lower Conemaugh Group. Lithofacies maps of these beds were constructed to show the distribution of the flint. Limestone-hosted flint occurs in long discontinuous chains of sheetlike bodies, whereas shale-hosted flint occurs in single sheets with restricted geographic distribution. Chains of limestone-hosted flint attain maximum dimensions of a few meters in thickness, a few kilometers in width and several hundreds of kilometers in length. The Upper Mercer, Vanport and Brush Creek flints are particularly extensive, forming arcuate shoreline patterns that parallel the fronts of large delta systems.
   Beds of clay ironstone and/or coal above flint indicate that the lagoonal environment in which flint was deposited was followed closely by a change to stagnant waters. Cementation of flint with silica likely occurred under the lower pH conditions existing at that time and when depths of burial were shallow.

AB  - High-resolution stratigraphic correlation of rhythmically interbedded shale-limestone couplets in the Fort Hays Member of the Niobrara Formation made possible a detailed comparative analysis of individual shale and limestone beds over a large part of the United States Western Interior region. Petrographic and isotopic data suggest that many of the differences observed between shale and limestone beds in the Fort Hays Member are attributable to diagenetic enhancement of originally subtle lithologic variations. Similar oxygen isotopic values from relatively unaltered inoceramid shells, and similar faunal content in limestone and shale beds, indicate that periods of increased runoff and detrital influx into the Western Interior Sea were not accompanied by extensive salinity variations.
   Inoceramid bivalves in the Fort Hays Member that have been less affected by diagenesis than surrounding matrix provide a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions. Cathodoluminescence and elemental data indicate that elevated levels of manganese occur in generally unaltered inoceramid bivalve remains, mostly in the eastern part of the study area. Manganese enrichment of these inoceramids is associated with increased O-18 and decreased C-13 contents and is interpreted as primary in origin. Regional east-west gradients in O-18, C-13, and manganese content suggest that the composition of bottom water varied across the Western Interior Sea, possibly in response to a north-ward influx of Tethyan water into the eastern part of the seaway. Similar gradients are observed in shale and limestone beds, indicating that these regional isotopic variations in the Fort Hays Member occurred independently of episodes of increased runoff and detrital influx into the seaway.

AB  - Since epiphytes mainly obtain water and nutrients from surrounding air, they are extremely sensitive to environmental changes, making them reliable bio-indicators for monitoring climate change. Hemiepiphytes are one common form of epiphytic plants, consisting of primary and secondary hemiepiphytes. It is thus reasonable to suppose that the hemiepiphytes should respond strongly to an extreme change in local climatic conditions. Based on survey data of hemiepiphytes (all the investigated species are primary hemiepiphytes) on trees before (2014) and after (2018) a heavy snowfall event (2015, depth of 50 cm), we examined differences in the distribution and abundance of individuals, population structure, and the general network structure of hemiepiphyte-host associations in a subtropical forest in the Ailao Mountains (Yunnan Province, in southwest China). Contrary to our hypothesis, the results revealed no significant changes for the distribution and abundance of this hemiepiphyte community before and after the heavy-snowfall event. The population structure of all hemiepiphytes (pooled) shifted from a dynamic to a stable state, but did not change on a per species basis. According to the constructed network's parameters, no significant differences were found between years, except for changed web asymmetry, linkage density, and interaction evenness. Our results suggest hemiepiphytes are highly resilient to extreme weather perturbations: within just four years after the snowfall, the community was nearly fully restored to its prior composition and structure. We propose this resilience capability is linked to their ecophysiological characteristics and distributions on host trees.

AB  - Mammal's saliva contains a variety of electrolytes and proteins. They carry out an important role in the digestion process, in the antibacterial and antiviral activity, in lubrication and maintenance of oral general health status. It may also contain several enzymes according to dietary habits and general wellness. Sialochemistry is a valid alternative to the haematochemical analysis for the evaluation of animal health and nutritional status. At present, very little knowledge is available on health status and pathology of crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata) and no data are yet available on salivary enzymes. Between 2018 and 2020, a preliminary investigation of enzymatic activity on saliva samples was carried out from captured porcupines. In crested porcupine saliva, enzymatic activity of trypsin, chymotrypsin, N-Aminopeptidase, amylase, lignin peroxidise, cellulase and chitinase were recorded. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and alkaline phosphatase activity was also detected. The superoxide dismutase activity resulted higher (3.13 SD 3.58 U/mg proteins) than those of catalase (130.80 SD 110.65 mU/mg proteins) and glutathione S-transferase (20.21 SD 16.62 mM/mg proteins). Alkaline phosphatase activity resulted lower (5.91 SD 6.12 mU/mg proteins) than acidic phosphatase (19.00 SD 16.16 U/mg proteins) with the highest values of saliva alkaline phosphatases recorded in young individuals. These preliminary data bring new knowledge on crested porcupine saliva enzymes and may provide a useful tool for further investigation on the adaptive response of crested porcupine to different environmental condition and diet. Additional investigation concerning a possible alternative use of saliva enzymes as indicator of health and nutritional status of this rodent are desirable.

AB  - In this study, thermodynamic analysis of PW4000 engine used in long-haul aircraft was carried out for eight flight phases. For this aim, energy, exergy, and exergo-sustainability metrics regarding the PW4000 were investigated for each phase. The main goal is to reveal differences between energetic and exergetic performance of flight phases using exergetic metrics. Also, exergetic behavior of six components of PW4000 was observed through flight phases. According to energy analysis, the overall efficiency of PW4000 was calculated as 33% at cruise phase, whereas its lowest value is observed as 8.7% at taxi-out phase. Considering component-based exergetic results, the combustor has the lowest exergy efficiency through flight phases. Namely, it changes between 77.55% and 88.66% with respect to flight conditions. It is followed by exergy efficiency of High Pressure Turbine (HPT) that resides between 87.07% and 89.61%. On the other hand, the exergy efficiency of the whole PW4000 has relatively high values at climb, cruise, and descent (CCD) phases. Namely, its value is estimated to be in the range of 32% and 36% at CCD phases. Besides, the wasted exergy ratio of the PW4000 varies from 28.37% at cruise phase to 49.01% at take-off phase. Finally, the exergetic sustainability index (ESI) of the PW4000 changes between 1 and 1.28 at CCD phases, whereas the lowest ESI belongs to taxi-out phase with 0.19. It is seemed that the current analysis may seem to help investigating optimum flight phases for the highest efficiency and thereby the lowest environmental impact.

AB  - Increasing temperatures and snow scarcity pose a serious threat to ski tourism. While the impacts of climate change on ski tourism have been elaborated extensively, little is known so far on the vulnerability of winter tourism towards both internal climate variability and climate change. We use a 50-member single model large ensemble from a regional climate model to drive the physically-based snowpack model SNOWPACK for eight stations across the Swiss Alps to model daily snow depth, incorporating both natural snow conditions and including technical snow production. We make a probabilistic assessment of the vulnerability of ski tourism towards internal climate variability in a future climate by analyzing selected tourism-related snow indicators and find significant overall decrease in snow reliability in the future. Further, we show how the sensitivity towards internal climate variability differs among different tourism-related snow indicators and find that certain indicators are more vulnerable to internal climate variability than others. We show that technical snow production is an appropriate adaptation strategy to tackle risks from climate change and internal climate variability. While technical snow production can drastically reduce uncertainties related to internal climate variability, in low elevations, the technique reaches its limits to counteract global warming by the mid of the century.

AB  - Modeling of extreme weather conditions is an important issue in environmental risk assessment, management and protection. In this paper, Annual and monthly maxima of daily temperature and rainfall data dating from 1901-2016 and 1950-2018 are characterized for nine countries within the greater horn of Africa. The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is fitted to the data sets from each of the nine countries using the method of maximum likelihood. Both the location and scale parameters of the GEV is formulated as a function of time to account for variability and trends in the extremes of temperature and rainfall so that their future behavior can be predicted. Based on our results, We provide return levels for the years 2, 10, 50 100, and 200 which could be used as measures of flood protection. To understand the spatial cross-correlation patterns on different time scales in each country and how rainfall and temperature are related to agricultural variables, we utilize the detrended cross-correlation coefficient (rho(DCCA)) and its generalization, (DMCx2) to account for that, respectively. Given the results of the (DMCx2) and the fact that climate extremes pose a huge threat to agriculture and food security, we employed copula based models to describe the structure of dependence between climatic variables and the crop related variables such as yield and production quantity. The results from the copula analysis show that irrespective of the country, climatic factors and the agricultural products(production/yield) the strongest dependence is demonstrated by the pairs involving cereal crops, while the weakest dependence is characterized by the pairs involving regular potato.

AB  - The groundwater sustainability of an alluvial aquifer in the western Iran was examined by using eight different social, economic, and environmental indicators. Differing types of indicators were used including groundwater extraction, groundwater quality, and groundwater vulnerability from the environmental indicators proposed by UNESCO 2007 and the legal framework, institutional capacity, public participation, knowledge generation, and promotion and water productivity from five researcher-developed indicators. A questionnaire and an AHP analysis were used to assess groundwater sustainability in the Mahidasht aquifer. Using AHP method, the indicators were formulated as spatial thematic maps resulting in calculation of the groundwater sustainability index (GSI). Then, the final GSI was divided into four categories, including sustainable, near sustainable, unsustainable, and highly or critically unsustainable. The AHP results showed that most parts of the study area are contained within the unsustainable category. The questionnaire method also showed that the study area with the score of 1.47 belongs within the unsustainable category. The validation of AHP results indicated 97% of the area had more than 1-m of drawdown in the groundwater level and 62% of it had more than 10-m of decline in the water level. The results showed that different socio-economic and environmental indicators can provide a helpful overview of groundwater sustainability conditions for future planning and decision-making in water management. Few studies of water management using socio-economic indicators have been conducted in Iran, Therefore this study provides a novel method of groundwater sustainability assessment by using the concepts of sustainable development, and integrated spatial indicators.

AB  - Sustainable forest management needs to address biodiversity conservation concerns. For that purpose, forest managers need models and indicators that may help evaluate the impact of management options on biodiversity under the uncertainty of climate change scenarios. In this research we explore the potential for designing mosaics of stand-level forest management models to address biodiversity conservation objectives on a broader landscape-level. Our approach integrates (i) an effective stand-level biodiversity indicator that reflect tree species composition, stand age, and understory coverage under divergent climate conditions; and (ii) linear programming optimization techniques to guide forest actors in seeing optimal forest practices to safeguard future biodiversity. Emphasis is on the efficiency and effectiveness of an approach to help assess the impact of forest management planning on biodiversity under scenarios of climate change. Results from a resource capability model are discussed for an application to a large-scale problem encompassing 14,765 ha, extending over a 90-years planning horizon and considering two local-climate scenarios. They highlight the potential of the approach to help assess the impact of both stand and landscape-level forest management models on biodiversity conservation goals. They demonstrate further that the approach provides insights about how climate change, timber demand and wildfire resistance may impact plans that target the optimization of biodiversity values. The set of optimized long-term solutions emphasizes a multifunctional forest that guarantees a desirable local level of biodiversity and resilience to wildfires, while providing a balanced production of wood over time at the landscape scale.

AB  - In this paper, in view of the importance of early recovery of abnormal cardiopulmonary function of racing athletes under atmospheric haze environment, we have formulated a scientific and reasonable exercise strategy. We selected 32 racing athletes and randomly divided them into 4 groups, namely the control group (Control Group, CG), the light aerobic exercise group (LEG), and the moderate aerobic exercise group (Moderate aerobic exercise). group, MEG), and heavy aerobic exercise group (Aerobic exercise group, AEG). There are 8 speed athletes in each group, half men and women, and their training lasts for 5 weeks. Throughout the training process, we use the cardiopulmonary function test operating system purchased from Jaeger, Germany, to guide the racing athletes in different levels of aerobic training. And before and after training, the cardiopulmonary function of racing athletes is comprehensively measured. The results found that male and female athletes have significant differences in the final body indicators due to obvious differences in physiological structures. Therefore, in the atmospheric haze environment, gender differences should be actively considered when formulating aerobic training programs for racing athletes. After the experiment, the cardiopulmonary load tolerance, tolerance time, cardiopulmonary oxygen uptake and ventilation of the racing athletes were all improved. Aerobic training should pay attention to the level of training. Minor training does not improve significantly, heavy training does not improve or even deepens cardiopulmonary injury, and moderate training has the best effect. This study is helpful to guide the development of environmental protection sports under the condition of serious air pollution.

AB  - Atmospheric warming and increasing tropospheric ozone (O-3) concentrations often co-occur in many cities of the world including China, adversely affecting the health status of urban trees. However, little information is known about the combined and interactive effects from increased air temperature (IT) and elevated O-3 (K) exposures on urban tree species. Here, Ginkgo biloba and Populus alba Berolinensis' seedlings were subjected to IT (+2 degrees C of ambient air temperature) and/or EO (+2 -fold ambient air O-3 concentrations) for one growing season by using open-top chambers. IT alone had no significant effect on physiological metabolisms at the early growing stage, but significantly increased photosynthetic parameters, antioxidative enzyme activities (P < 0.05). EO alone decreased physiological parameters except for increased oxidative stress. Compared to EO exposure alone, plants grown under IT and EO combined showed higher antioxidative and photosynthetic activity. There was a significant interactive effect between IT and EO on net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry, the actual quantum efficiency of PSII, enzyme activities, aboveground biomass and root/shoot ratio (P < 0.05), respectively. These results suggested that during one growing season, IT mitigated the adverse effect of EO on the tested plants. In addition, we found that G. biloba was more sensitive than P. alba Berolinensis' to both IT and EO, suggesting that G. biloba may be a good indicator species for climate warming and air pollution, particularly under environmental conditions as they co-occur in urban areas.

AB  - As iron-bearing minerals-ferrimagnetic minerals in particular-are sensitive to stress, temperature, and presence of fluids in fault zones, their magnetic properties provide valuable insights into physical and chemical processes affecting fault rocks. Here, we review the advances made in magnetic studies of fault rocks in the past three decades. We provide a synthesis of the mechanisms that account for the magnetic changes in fault rocks and insights gained from magnetic research. We also integrate nonmagnetic approaches in the evaluation of the magnetic properties of fault rocks. Magnetic analysis unveils microscopic processes operating in the fault zones such as frictional heating, energy dissipation, and fluid percolation that are otherwise difficult to constrain. This makes magnetic properties suited as a "strain indicator," a "geothermometer," and a "fluid tracer" in fault zones. However, a full understanding of faulting-induced magnetic changes has not been accomplished yet. Future research should focus on detailed magnetic property analysis of fault zones including magnetic microscanning and magnetic fabric analysis. To calibrate the observations on natural fault zones, laboratory experiments should be carried out that enable to extract the exact physicochemical conditions that led to a certain magnetic signature. Potential avenues could include (1) magnetic investigations on natural and synthetic fault rocks after friction experiments, (2) laboratory simulation of fault fluid percolation, (3) paleomagnetic analysis of postkinematic remanence components associated with faulting processes, and (4) synergy of interdisciplinary approaches in mineral-magnetic studies. This would help to place our understanding of the microphysics of faulting on a much stronger footing.

AB  - Studying the historical facts of past wars and armed conflicts and natural and man-made emergencies, today in the Republic of Kazakhstan one of the most important security issues is the preparation and organization of the evacuation of the population from possible dangerous zones, taking into account the emergence of new threats to the country's security. The paper presents an algorithm for constructing universal scales of the distribution function of opportunities by types of support and rebuilding them into subject scales using display functions. The purpose of the paper is to determine the integral indicators characterizing the possibility of accommodation of the evacuated population and the impact on resources during relocation. On the subject scales of cities and districts of the region, indicators of the possibility of relocation of a certain amount of the evacuated population by types of support and indicators characterizing the impact on the district's resources during resettlement of a certain amount of the evacuated population are determined. It was concluded that the use of integrated indicators allows the selection of areas to accommodate the evacuated population without the use of statistical data, in conditions of incomplete and inaccurate information. The presented method does not replace traditional methods based on classical methods of territory assessment by the level of life sustenance, but also allows their reasonable combination with the experience of specialists in this field, taking into account the incompleteness, uncertainty, and inconsistency of the initial data of the study area, which does not allow the application of existing methods.

AB  - Noble gases have been used for oil field exploration due to their partitioning behavior in oil-water systems. However, their application to study sites contaminated with non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPL) has been limited, except for Rn-222, which has been traditionally used as a partitioning tracer for contaminated sites. This study applied natural noble gas components such as Rn-222, He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe to the characterization of a field site contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE) located in Wonju, Korea. Groundwater at the site showed a maximum level of TCE that exceeded 1000 mu g/L, with an approximate average of 400 mu g/L, indicating the presence of residual TCE in the subsurface system even after remediation. The traditional tracer (i.e., Rn-222) was first used to characterize residual TCE. However, its heterogeneous distribution throughout the fractured bedrock aquifer negated its usefulness as a TCE indicator. The use of radiogenic He-4 was also limited by the wide distribution of radiogenic sources on the site. By contrast, changes in the TCE level had clear effects on the conditions of other noble gases, such as Ne, Ar, and Xe, making them useful for characterization of the TCE-contaminated site. Furthermore, calculation of the TCE/water ratio including residual TCE was achieved, but identification of the TCE originating from the vadose zone was relatively hard. The results of this study indicate that based on their partitioning behavior, naturally-occurring noble gases can be used to delineate and quantify residual TCE.

AB  - In the present study, impact assessment of watershed interventions on bio-physical indicators was carried out using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System techniques in PMKSY WDC (erstwhile IWMP) Kotapadu watershed project, Ponnaluru mandal of Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh (India). The watershed program was implemented in the study area from the year 2011-2012 to 2018-19. Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques are used to detect land use land cover changes, in pre and post project period for impact assessment. Digital images are processed to delineate land use/land cover categories, by assigning necessary training sets and are identified based on tone, texture, size, shape pattern and indices of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The results indicated an increase of eight per cent in crop land area, while the area under wastelands decreased due to impact by watershed interventions, such as land development, soil and moisture conservation measures, water harvesting structures and horticulture development. The NDVI values show an overall improvement in vegetation index, especially in increase in dense vegetation with increased crop land area. The watershed interventions, such as water harvesting structures and other Natural Resource Management (NRM) works, were beneficial in improvement of soil moisture in watershed areas. The key indicators studied are positive in terms of growth in the crop area, vegetation vigour and water spread areas, against less favourable seasonal conditions such as deficit rainfall and depletion of ground water level due to over exploitation, than the recharge rates in all the years of project implementation period.

AB  - The air quality in cities in Kazakhstan has been poorly investigated despite the worsening conditions. This study evaluates national air pollution monitoring network data (Total Suspended Particle-TSP, NO2, SO2, and O-3) from Kazakhstan cities and provides estimates of excess mortality rates associated with PM(2.5)exposure using the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) concentration-response function. Morbidity rates associated with PM(10)exposure were also estimated. Annual average (2015-2017) population-weighted concentrations were Kazakhstan cities was 157, 51, 29, and 41 mu g m(-3)for TSP, NO2, SO2, and O(3)respectively. We estimated a total of 8134 adult deaths per year attributable to PM2.5(average over 2015-2017) in the selected 21 cities of Kazakhstan. The leading causes of death were ischemic heart disease (4080), stroke (1613), lower respiratory infections (662), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (434), lung cancer (332). The per capita mortality rate attributable to ambient air pollution (per 10(5)adults per year) was less than 150 in nine cities, between 150 and 204 in nine cities, and between 276 and 373 in three industrial cities (Zhezkazgan, Temirtau, and Balkhash). Implications: Quantitative information on the health impacts of air pollution can be useful for decision-makers in Kazakhstan to justify environmental policies and identify policy and funding priorities for addressing air pollution issues. This information can also be useful for policymakers by improving the quality of government-funded environmental reports and strategic documents, as they have many shortcomings in terms of the selection of air quality indicators, identification of priority pollutants, and identification of sources of pollution. This study has high significance due to the lack of data and knowledge in Central Asia, especially Kazakhstan.

AB  - Efforts toward the development of a straightforward greener Gram-scale synthesis of the antibiotic compound 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) have been developed. This beneficial procedure was accomplished through the Friedel-Crafts acylation of phloroglucinol over inexpensive heterogeneous silica sulphuric acid (SSA) catalystviaultrasound-assisted (US) synthesis under solvent-free condition. The influences of various parameters such as temperature, catalyst loading, and reaction time on the reaction performance were analysed using a multivariate statistical modelling response surface methodology (RSM). A high yield ofDAPG(95%) was achieved at 60 degrees C after 15-20 min reaction with the presence of 10% (w/w)SSAas the catalyst. Column chromatography-free and a Gram scale-up reaction also exhibited the practical applicability of this newly developed protocol. TheSSAcatalyst was recovered and recycled up to 10 consecutive runs with no appreciable loss of activity. A plausible mechanism for the Friedel-Crafts acylation of phloroglucinol is proposed. Moreover, an environmental assessment has been carried out over this present method and compared with several established literature using the EATOS software and the Andraos algorithm to assess the consumption of the substrates, solvents, catalysts, and the production of coupled products or by-products. In addition, their energy consumptions were also determined. The data collected showed that the present method is the most promising one, characterised by the highest environmental impact profile against all the other reported methods. The physicochemical properties of the synthesisedDAPGwere assessed and exhibited reasonable oral bioavailability drug property as determined by Lipinski's rules.

AB  - Community forest (Hutan Kemasyarakatan/HKm) is one of the social forestry scheme policies stipulated by the Indonesian government to give partial rights to the community to be able to manage the state forest area. This scheme has implemented for more than ten years, and that includes areas in Lombok Tengah Regency. This research aims to analyze the impact of social forestry scheme policies on the economy of communities around forests and conducted in May-August 2019. By the HKm scheme, the community can manage up to 0.5 ha forest area per person and expected to increase livelihood benefits as well as improve conservation outcomes such as decreasing illegal logging and planting more trees. Based on the study conducted, the community has experienced an increase in livelihoods as well as improvements in environmental conditions. Indicator used in measuring community welfare is per capita income, which noted in the study area is IDR3,609,603 annually and inequality (Gini coefficient), which noted less than 0.4 or in the 'low' category. This study shows that the Gini coefficient in the research location is high (0.530). When compared, the income gap in the group of respondents who got the HKm program was better than the group of respondents who did not. The Gini coefficient data shows that the HKm program quite succeeds in target to increase livelihood benefits. The HKm program expected to improve the level of income inequality (Gini coefficient) from 0.483 (HKm) compared to 0.566 (non-HKm). These findings are important messages to further the HKm scheme policies.

AB  - Non-exhaust particle (NEP) emissions from road traffic contribute significantly to Particulate Matter (PM) pollution in urban areas. The primary objective herein is to develop the knowledge required to move toward more sustainable mobility. NEP emissions are studied by means of complementary experiments on chassis dynamometers, on test tracks and at the roadside. Laboratory tests demonstrate that brake wear particles (BWP) emissions can change with braking force and frequency. A brake pad temperature threshold exists, above which the rate of ultrafine particle emissions is quite high. Below this threshold, the BWP emissions are dominant in the accumulation and coarse modes. Test track measurements have demonstrated that tire-road contact particle (TRCP) emissions considerably modify the atmospheric PM background especially for the supermicron fraction. Their number size distribution highlighted an ultrafine and accumulation modes centered at about 40 nm and 200 nm, respectively. The TRCP level increases with vehicle speed and during the acceleration and deceleration phases. Roadside measurements in the urban environment confirm the presence of NEP in significant proportions, in both the accumulation and coarse modes. The chemical composition of NEP differs depending on the size mode: BWP mainly stem from the degradation of brake pad lining materials, while TRCP are a mixture of tire tread wear and re-suspended dust. The presence of Fe-rich particles nevertheless serves as a good indicator of the NEP contribution to PM at the roadside. Lastly, in considering the parameters influencing NEP emissions, a series of recommendations are offered in order to achieve a more sustainable mobility.

AB  - In shallow marine sediments, cold seeps of methane fluid is a widely observed phenomenon, which will lead to a series of biogeochemical reactions. These processes will change the pore water environment and trigger the formation of authigenic minerals. In this study, based on the data from the site GC10 in the NE South China Sea, numerical simulation studies were conducted to investigate the relative biogeochemical processes induced by methane leakage. The results of simulations show that anaerobic methane oxidation is the dominant sulfate consuming process in methane leakage environment, and the typical sulfate-methane interface is indicative of methane leakage. The pore water chemistry conditions are closely related to methane flux. Methane flux was calibrated from GC10 site data, when methane leaks upwards at flux of 2.42. x 10(-3) mmol cm(-2) a(-1), the simulation results fit well with measured data. Some kinetic parameters of related reaction were calibrated during the fitting process. The microbially-mediated reactions in methane leakage environment trigger the precipitation of authigenic minerals, such as calcite and pyrite, which can sometimes be used as indicators of the occurrence of hydrate reservoirs. Through simulating the change of sulfate concentrations along the vertical column, the model was also used to estimate duration of active cold seeps at the study site. The results showed that the methane leakage in GC10 has been going on at least 5600 years. This study provided a new method to the study of cold seeps activities, and was significant for future investigations on the biogeochemical processes above the hydrate reservoirs.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Maintenance of regular development and maturation of the Central Neural System of neonates in the first year of life, associated to the environmental conditions in which they are inserted, justifies the scientific relevance of this research. Our objective is to describe the influence of stress factors on hospitalized neonates in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of a teaching hospital. Methods: Cross-sectional study with convenience sampling. The participants were observed in moments that were identified as being of highest and lowest exposition to stress factors, thus sound pressure, illuminance, quantity of procedures, presence of pain, and the indicators of vital signs expressed by the patients' monitors were registered. Results: Thirteen neonates, predominantly moderate premature babies of low weight, of c-section birth, average age of 8.0 +/- 5.9 days, mostly female and breathing room air, were evaluated. We noted that stress factors produced significant increase of the heart rate (sound pressure: p=0.001, illuminance: p<0.001, procedures: p=0.022), occurring the same with the respiratory rate (sound pressure: p<0.001, illuminance: p=0.022, procedures: p<0.001) and score obtained in the Neonatal Pain Evaluation Scale (sound pressure: p=0.001, illuminance: p=0.016, procedures: p<0.003), besides the reduction of peripheral oxygen saturation (sound pressure: p=0.011, illuminance: p=0.024, procedures: p<0.016), when comparing the periods of highest and lowest exposition. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the negative impact of environmental factors and its influence on the vital signs of hospitalized neonates.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to assess the effect of natural antioxidants (Tulsi, Lemon grass and Aloevera) on sensory and microbiological quality as well as on Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values of Redplum and Sahiwal-based milk smoothies stored under refrigeration. Design/methodology/approach The smoothies were developed by incorporating optimum level of natural antioxidants, fresh red plum and Sahiwal milk. They were aerobically packaged in low-density polyethylene pouches and stored under refrigeration (4 +/- 2 degrees C) till its spoilage. These smoothies were assessed for various storage quality parameters like sensory parameters, microbiological quality and TBA values at regular interval of two days. Findings Smoothies made without using natural antioxidants were in good condition for four days, and treated smoothies were stored well for six days. The microbial profile showed significant (p < 0.05) increase in SPC and psychrophilic counts on advancement of storage days. However, no coliform and yeast and mould were detected in all variants of smoothies during storage. TBA values were also increased during storage. But microbial counts and TBA both were under the prescribed limit as described by various organizations. Smoothies treated with Tulsi were found best followed by lemongrass- and aloevera-treated products.
   Originality/value The paper has demonstrated that the Sahiwal milk and red plum-based smoothies were of high acceptability. Their shelf life was found best when treated with Tulsi, Lemon grass and Aloevera natural antioxidants. It was better in all spectrums like lower microbial counts, higher sensory attributes and lower TBA counts as compared to untreated products.

AB  - Social scientists have been interested in measuring the prosperity, well-being, and quality of life of nations, which has resulted in a multiplicity of country-level indicators. However, little is known about the factor structure of these indicators. We explored the structure of quality of life, using country-level data on tens of subjective and objective indicators. Applying factor analysis, we identified three distinct factors that exhibited both overlap and complementarity. This structure was replicated in data from previous years and with a partially different set of variables. The first factor, 'socio-economic progress', is dominated by socio-political and economic indicators but also includes life satisfaction, which thus appears to reflect objective living conditions. The second factor, 'psycho-social functioning', consists of subjective indicators, such as eudaimonic well-being and positive affective states. The third, 'negative affectivity', comprises negatively-valenced affective states. The three macro-factors of societal quality of life demonstrated moderate intercorrelations and differential associations with cultural and ecological variables, providing support for their discriminant validity. Finally, country and regional rankings based on the three societal factors revealed a complex picture that cautions against over-reliance on any single indicator such as life satisfaction. The results underline the need for a broadly-based approach to the measurement of societal quality of life, and provide an empirically-derived multidimensional framework for conceptualizing and measuring quality of life and well-being at country level. This study is thus an initial empirical step towards systematizing the multiple approaches to societal quality of life.

AB  - Background: Quality is a powerful engine in rice value chain upgrading. However, there is no consensus on how "rice quality" should be defined and measured in the rice sector.
   Scope and approach: We adopt a Lancasterian definition of rice quality as a bundle of intrinsic and extrinsic attributes. We then review how rice quality is (i) perceived and defined by consumers and industry stakeholders in rice value chains in Southeast and South Asia; (ii) measured and defined by food technologists; and (iii) predicted through genetics.
   Key findings and conclusions: Consumers are heterogeneous with respect to their perceived differentiation of rice quality among regions, countries, cities, and urbanization levels. Premium quality is defined by nutritional benefits, softness and aroma in Southeast Asia, and by the physical appearance of the grains (uniformity, whiteness, slenderness), satiety, and aroma in South Asia. These trends are found to be consistent with industry perceptions and have important implications for regional and national breeding programs in terms of tailoring germplasm to regions and rice varieties to specific local market segments. Because rice is traded internationally, there is a need to standardize definitions of rice quality. However, food technologists have not reached unanimity on quality classes and measurement; routine indicators need to be complemented by descriptive profiles elicited through sensory evaluation panels. Finally, because rice quality is controlled by multiple interacting genes expressed through environmental conditions, predicting grain quality requires associating genetic information with grain quality phenotypes in different environments.

AB  - Project proponent- and government-led environmental monitoring are required to identify, understand, and manage cumulative effects (CE), yet such monitoring initiatives are rarely mutually supportive. Notwithstanding the need for a more integrated and complementary approach to monitoring, monitoring efforts are often less effective than intended for addressing CE. This paper examines current monitoring programs in the Mackenzie Valley, Northwest Territories, Canada, based on 7 attributes: consistency, compatibility, observability, detectability, adaptability, accessibility, and usability. Results indicate a tenuous link between and across proponent-led monitoring requirements under project-specific water licenses and government-led monitoring of regional baseline conditions. There is some consistency in what is monitored, but data are often incompatible, insufficient to understand baseline change, not transferable across projects or scales, inaccessible to end users, and ultimately unsuitable to understanding CE. Lessons from the Mackenzie Valley highlight the need for improved alignment of monitoring efforts across programs and scales, characterized by a set of common parameters that are most useful for early detection of cumulative change and supporting regulatory decisions at the project scale. This alignment must be accompanied by more open and accessible data for both proponents and regulators, while protecting the sensitivity of proprietary information. Importantly, there must be conceptual guidance for CE, such that the role of monitoring is clear, providing the types of CE questions to be asked, identifying the hypotheses to be tested, and ensuring timely and meaningful results to support regulatory decisions.

AB  - The present paper discusses a new methodology to assess stress-cycle fatigue design using meta-modelling. Research on its application is presented for offshore wind turbine towers. Kriging models are used to surrogate the complex time-domain stress-cycle fatigue assessment that demands multiple evaluations in the design phase.
   The presented development highlights the importance of having a notion of improvement for the problem of meta-modelling. Literature shows that, when meta-modelling complex engineering problems, the idea of improvement is not always considered. To tackle the problem of assessing fatigue in the design phase, a learning criterion is introduced. It has the particularity of relating to the physical description of the stress-cycle fatigue. Results of the proposed criterion are compared with meta-modelling using a Latin hypercube sampling, and with the standard design approach that bins environmental conditions for fatigue design calculations. A full 1 year validation sample is used to study convergence.
   As surrogate models for stress-cycle fatigue, Kriging models significantly decrease the efforts of the design procedure. Results showed that computational efforts can be reduced consistently by a factor of 5-8 without compromising accuracy. This may correspond to a reduction of up to approximately 85% of the effort needed to assess stress-cycle fatigue in the design phase.
   To conclude, it is important to highlight that the methodology presented has a universal character. It can be implemented to reduce computational time or assess the probabilistic response with only one requirement, the definition of a single representative indicator. In the case of fatigue, the short-term stress-cycle damage rate was considered.

AB  - Biomethane produced from waste-derived biomass (biowaste) is a clean and renewable fuel, which offers substantial reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and resource consumption. Biomethane is currently produced via the "biogas road", which includes the anaerobic digestion of wet biowaste and a successive upgrading of obtained biogas, with good environmental performance. An alternative production strategy is the "syngas road", which includes the gasification of dry or semi-dry biowaste followed by cleaning, conditioning, methanation, and final upgrading of obtained syngas. It is still at a demonstration level but appears of great interest for the highest values of energy efficiency and carbon utilisation. The study acquired technical data from existing plants of both these strategies, and developed a quantitative environmental assessment by means of holistic tools of sustainable engineering: material and substance flow analyses and an attributional life cycle assessment. The technical and environmental performance of the two biomethane roads have been then compared, in terms of energy and process efficiency as well as potential impacts in the main midpoint categories (global warming, respiratory inorganics, and non-renewable energy). The syngas road appears to have higher levels of carbon utilisation and better environmental performance, even though an extended sensitivity analysis shows different results if alternative plant configurations and energy mix are considered. This suggests that R&D studies and policies of economic incentives have to be further implemented for both the analysed strategies, even because they deal with different kind of biowaste, having different availability in different countries.

AB  - Potential for mitigating effects of heat stress through dietary Alchemilla vulgaris (AV) supplementation during the late laying period of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were investigated. A 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of environmental temperature (ET) regimes and levels of dietary supplementation with AV (0%, 1%, and 3%) was used in a 75-day experiment. Twenty-five quail were randomly assigned to each treatment with five replicate cages of five birds. The birds were housed in temperature-controlled rooms at 22 +/- 2 degrees C for 24 h/day (TN) or 34 +/- 2 degrees C between 09h00 and 17h00 followed by 22 +/- 2 degrees C for 16 h/day (HS). The interaction of ET and supplement regimes was rarely significant. In HS quail supplemented with 1% AV, egg production was reduced and FCR was increased compared with the other treatments. Dietary AV was found to reduce egg production in TN conditions, but 3% AV supplementation in the HS group prevented decreased egg production and improved FCR. Various indicators of egg quality were significantly affected by supplementation with AV at certain times during the experiment. Most effects of HS on egg quality were manifest in the first 15 days of ET regimes. Although HS significantly decreased eggshell weight until 31-45 days, AV supplementation improved it on the 45th day and then maintained it through the end of the experiment. Thus, AV may mitigate some effects of HS by partially preventing decreased egg production and increased FCR during the late laying period of Japanese quail.

AB  - The lower Miocene babouchite siliceous rocks from the Numidian Formation were widely deposited in the Northwestern of Tunisia, with a total thickness ranging from 20 to 50 m. The samples are principally composed of quartz and clay minerals (smectite, illite and kaolinite), with total lack of amorphous silica. The bulk chemical composition of the babouchite siliceous rocks is represented by high SiO2 (73.60-91.45%) and Al2O3 (5.78-10.55%) with negligible amounts of CaO, MgO, K2O and TiO2 . The enrichment of these cherts by Mn and Cu, and the low content of the other trace elements are indicators of oxic condition in the water column. The ratio of Al/(Al + Fe + Mn) (0.65-0.87) is > 0.6 which is typical of a biogenic origin. Furthermore, the high ratios of Si/(Si + Al + Fe) justify the biogenic origin. All the analyzed samples from Babouch member fall into the non-hydrothermal sediment field of the Al-Fe-Mn diagram. Moreover, according to the environment discriminating diagrams, such as Al2O3 /(100-SiO2) vs. Fe2O3 /(100-SiO2), Al2O3 /SiO2 vs. Fe2O3 /SiO2 and Al2O3/(Al2O3 + Fe2O3 ) vs. Fe2O3 /TiO2 , the babouchite siliceous rocks were deposited on a passive continental margin. The delta(18) O value of the chert, range from 24.9%o to 27.9%o. The forming temperature determined by oxygen isotopic composition indicates formation at a slightly high temperature, about 65 degrees C.

AB  - In the state of Para, the municipalities of Belem and Ananindeua stand out due to the high concentration of vehicles and consequently the large number of unusable tires produced. This paper aimed to elaborate a situational diagnosis of the reverse logistics of the unusable tire industry in the municipalities of Belem-PA and Ananindeua-PA applying the Pressure-State-Impact-Response (PSIR) framework. The methodology was developed through unstructured interviews with the main agents responsible for reverse logistics in both cities studied, among them: tire dealers, tire repair shops and municipal environmental agencies. Impacts, such as flooding, air and water pollution and soil contamination were identified, as well as the reduction of raw material that comes from reverse logistics. The study identified two distinct conditions for the municipalities of Ananindeua and Belem regarding the scenario of the reverse logistics of unusable tires. In the first one, Ananindeua, there is a management system for the unusable tires that receives and collects these tires, which allows the final consumers to dispense their unusable tires appropriately in an Ecoponto (Eco-point) which exists within the municipality area. In the second, Belem, the response of the public services was considered inefficient, as there is no Ecoponto for the collection of unusable tires in the municipality. We concluded that the PSIR methodology has elaborated responses to the municipal management with the potential to alter the environmental impact caused by the collection, disposal and irregular treatment of unusable tires, as well as ways to improve the reverse logistics process of unusable tires.

AB  - The traditional view of biogenic limitation in freshwater ecosystems considers phosphorus as the primary limiting element, but this concept has recently been challenged. There are a number of studies that suggest that photosynthetic indices may depend on the levels of nitrogen (especially, nitrate-nitrogen). To test the hypothesis about the possibility of nitrogen limitation in the lake ecosystem, the present study analysed the water in the littoral zone of a shallow model lake for the relationship between the content of phytoplankton pigments (chlorophyll a and carotenoids) and nitrate. The nitrate-nitrogen was selected because it is the most chemically stable nitrogen species. The study was conducted in a small lake with a pronounced autochthonous regime (as indicated by its small drainage ratio) during a vegetation season with contrasting hydrological conditions. The relationship with the nitrate concentration was not confirmed for chlorophyll a, but the levels of nitrate anion and carotenoids were shown to be related. Chlorophyll a, which is regarded as a metabolically active component of phytoplankton cells, shows a close correlation with air temperature. The corresponding prognostic regression models were created. The data on nominal availability of nitrate-nitrogen for primary production show possible nitrogen limitation on some of the observation dates. If the production potential represented by certain levels of nitrate is not realised by phytoplankton, it can be used by filamentous algae. The results of the study provide first steps toward prediction of one of the indicators of phytoplankton growth, the content of two main types of pigment (chlorophyll a and carotenoids)

AB  - Questions: Natural regeneration is increasingly recognized as a potentially cost-effective strategy to reach ambitious forest landscape restoration targets, but rates of recovery are notoriously variable. We asked how well initial habitat conditions after cessation of agriculture predict forest recovery after nearly a decade. We aimed to provide land managers with general rules of thumb to assess when it is necessary to invest resources in active restoration, such as tree planting, to accelerate forest recovery.
   Location: Coto Brus County, Puntarenas, Costa Rica.
   Methods: We compiled data on initial vegetation structure, soil nutrients, prior land-use history and surrounding forest cover at 13 sites. After 8.5 years, we measured vegetation indicators commonly used to assess forest recovery, namely amount of canopy closure and number and diversity of woody recruits.
   Results: Two variables, grass cover and canopy closure, measured 1.5 years after site abandonment, explained 47-87% of five of the six response variables after 8.5 years; recovery was faster in sites with lower grass cover and higher canopy closure initially. Waiting an additional year to measure initial vegetation variables did not improve model fit. Time since the original forest was cleared explained 62% of change in canopy cover, whereas percentage of surrounding forest cover, length of pasture use and soil variables explained minimal additional variation.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that two easily measurable vegetation variables can provide guidance to land managers and policy makers about where to invest scarce restoration resources to facilitate forest recovery.

AB  - The extraction and preconcentration of chiral beta-blockers in environmental water was evaluated by solidphase extraction (SPE) employing an SBA-15 ordered mesoporous silica functionalised with alkyl chains of different length. The materials were characterised by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements and elemental analysis. Important parameters influencing extraction efficiency, including the type and amount of sorbent and the breakthrough volume, were optimised. The results obtained showed that the organic chain length played an important role in the behaviour of these sorbents. Under optimised conditions, using 200 mg SBA-15-C8 as sorbent, a simple analytical method based on off-line SPE coupled to chiral capillary electrophoresis with diode array detection (SPE-chiral CE-DAD) was developed. Method detection and quantification limits were lower than 0.6 and 1.9 mu g L-1 respectively for all enantiomers, with a preconcentration factor of 500-fold. The method was successfully applied to the chiral analysis of atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol and propranolol in river and sewage water samples. Satisfactory recoveries (between 86 +/- 2 and 98 +/- 1 %) and repeatability (relative standard deviation (RSD) < 9 %, n = 3) were obtained. Metoprolol was detected in sewage water at a concentration of 10.7 and 9.9 mu g L-1 and an enantiomeric fraction of 0.52 and 0.48 for the first- and the second-migrating enantiomers respectively. These results emphasise the importance of enantioselective analysis for environmental risk assessment.

AB  - The aging of seeds is a major problem in the agricultural sector. It is also a complex biological question that remains unclear for many crop seeds. In this experiment, we investigated how different ageing levels influence seeds germination, storage components, structure, respiration metabolism, and whether respiration is a promising indicator that can non-destructively evaluate seed aging. First, we obtained non-heading Chinese cabbage seeds with varying ageing levels by applying artificial aging treatments over a period of six days (0 d-6 d). Subsequently, respiration related indexes and ultrastructural observations were conducted. Our results showed that the respiratory rate remains low when seeds have a low water content. With the increased water content, the activities of respiratory-related enzymes, phosphohexose isomerase (PGI) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH), reached maximum levels when seeds were aged for two days. Respiration rates peaked one day later, followed by a rapid decline with increasing age. The ageing process consumed a large amount of storage components (e.g. soluble sugar, sucrose, and starch), leading to the degradation of mitochondria, proteasomes, fat bodies and cell nuclei in the aged seeds, which resulted in the reduction of respiratory rates. This, in turn, negatively affected seed germination. When seeds germinated (1 h-6 h, 1 d-6 d) under standard germination condition, the germination rate and respiratory rate showed significant correlation. Especially for 5 h and 6 h, the correlation coefficients reached 0.954 and 0.976 respectively. Measured at those times, respiratory rate should be a promising indicator for seed aging.

AB  - Hydropeaking involves rapid changes in water flow, causing negative effects on aquatic organisms. To reduce these effects, hydropower licenses contain restrictions on hydropeaking. The owners of a hydropower plant are obliged to follow the requirements in the license. This study was conducted to understand the effect of environmental policies in small hydro licenses. We studied the occurrence of hydropeaking by analysing 256 high-head, small Norwegian hydropower plants in relation to a set of characteristics that define each plant. We selected plants that were online during 2005-2014 and chose 2015 as a year for hourly production patterns. We counted the number of starts, that is, the moment when the hydro facility starts to produce energy, as an indicator of hydropeaking. Among the analysed plants, 75.8% had restrictions to practice hydropeaking. Production typically showed daily, weekly, and annual cycles though shapes varied depending on turbine type and location. The number of starts was independent on having or not having a license to practice hydropeaking. The average duration of periods with production and the average production in these periods were higher for plants without restrictions. The number of starts varied widely among plants. The number of starts was lower for installed Pelton turbines than for Francis and Kaplan turbines, which was in agreement with the characteristics of the turbines. Overall, these results show that hydropeaking restrictions given in the licenses are rarely followed. The high number of starts may be explained by failure in the grid system, improper maintenance, and financial interests. Their relative importance should be subject to further investigation.

AB  - Hydrological indicators such as duration, frequency, magnitude, rate and timing of flow events are used to evaluate and, in models, predict the response of aquatic species to hydrological conditions. Hydrological models are generally optimized without considering specific species preferences by minimizing overall differences between observed and simulated flows using common hydrological objective functions. We hypothesize that hydrological models optimized to implicitly consider species' flow preferences will yield more reliable predictors.
   To test this hypothesis, we developed a flexible evaluation method in which the hydrological model was optimized for different objective functions. We tested this concept for benthic invertebrates and selected seven species-relevant hydrological indicators as well as four objective functions based on commonly used hydrological performance criteria. Model parameterization for these cases were assessed on their ability to reproduce an indicator-based performance criterion developed by applying feature scaling to the indicators. The results show that three indicator-based objective functions performed up to 14% better than the standard hydrological performance criterion KGE. When optimizing for individual or multiple indicators, we found that it is important to consider that other indicators are compromised. An evaluation of this trade-off showed a considerable range in indicator values and implausible indicator depictions.
   We conclude that optimizing hydrological models to depict species preferences most effectively requires consideration of different objective functions that are based on hydrological indicators. Doing so, instead of simply optimizing to standard hydrological objective functions, can yield a rewarding result in terms of a more species-tailored model parameterization and, ultimately, a better prediction of aquatic species.

AB  - This study investigated the association of genotype (CGG repeats in FMR1) and the health and well-being of 5,628 aging adults (mean age = 71) in a population-based study. Two groups were contrasted: aging parents who had adult children with developmental or mental health disabilities (n = 785; the high-stress parenting group) and aging parents of healthy children who did not have disabilities (n = 4843; the low-stress parenting group). There were significant curvilinear interaction effects between parenting stress group and CGG repeats for body mass index and indicators of health and functional limitations, and the results were suggestive of interactions for limitations in cognitive functioning. Parents who had adult children with disabilities and whose genotype was two standard deviations above or below the mean numbers of CGGs had poorer health and functional outcomes at age 71 than parents with average numbers of CGGs. In contrast, parents who had healthy adult children and who had similarly high or low numbers of CGG repeats had better health and functional outcomes than parents with average numbers of CGGs. This pattern of gene by environment interactions was consistent with differential susceptibility or the flip-flop phenomenon. This study illustrates how research that begins with a rare genetic condition (such as fragile X syndrome) can lead to insights about the general population and contributes to understanding of how genetic differences shape the way people respond to environments.

AB  - Loggerhead turtle is an endangered sea turtle species with a migratory lifestyle and worldwide distribution, experiencing markedly different habitats throughout its lifetime. Environmental conditions, especially food availability and temperature, constrain the acquisition and the use of available energy, thus affecting physiological processes such as growth, maturation, and reproduction. These physiological processes at the population level determine survival, fecundity, and ultimately the population growth rate a key indicator of the success of conservation efforts. As a first step towards the comprehensive understanding of how environment shapes the physiology and the life cycle of a loggerhead turtle, we constructed a full life cycle model based on the principles of energy acquisition and utilization embedded in the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory. We adapted the standard DEB model using data from published and unpublished sources to obtain parameter estimates and model predictions that could be compared with data. The outcome was a successful mathematical description of ontogeny and life history traits of the loggerhead turtle. Some deviations between the model and the data existed (such as an earlier age at sexual maturity and, faster growth of the post-hatchlings), yet probable causes for these deviations were found informative and discussed in great detail. Physiological traits such as the capacity to withstand starvation, trade-offs between reproduction and growth, and changes in the energy budget throughout the ontogeny were inferred from the model. The results offer new insights into physiology and ecology of loggerhead turtle with the potential to lead to novel approaches in conservation of this endangered species. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Social play varies among species and individuals and changes in frequency and duration during ontogeny. This type of play is modulated by environmental changes (e.g., resource availability). In captivity, cetaceans and their environment are managed by humans, and training sessions and/or public presentations punctuate the day as well as other frequent or occasional events. There is a lack of research on the effects of environmental events that occur in captivity and might affect dolphins' behavior. We studied the context in which nine bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) played socially and the events that could potentially impact this social interaction. The dolphins' social play behavior was significantly more frequent and lasted longer in the morning than in the afternoon and was present before and after interactions with their trainers with a non-significant tendency to be more frequent before and after a training session than a public presentation. In an experimental paradigm using familiar environmental enrichment, our results demonstrated that environmental enrichment tended to increase social play duration whereas temporary noisy construction work around the pool and display of agonistic behaviors by members of the group significantly decreased it. These results contribute to better understand the social play distribution in captive bottlenose dolphins and the impact of different events within their daily lives. Since play decreases or disappears when animals are facing unfavorable conditions, the evaluation of social play may relate to the animals' current well-being. We suggest that social play has potential to become an indicator of bottlenose dolphins' current welfare state.

AB  - Salivary glands produce a bicarbonate-rich fluid containing digestive and protective proteins and other components to be delivered into the gastrointestinal tract. Its function is under strict control of the autonomic nervous system. Salivary electrolyte and fluid secretion are primarily controlled by parasympathetic activity, while protein secretion is primaily triggered by sympathetic stimulation. Stress activates the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis. The peripheral limb of this axis is the efferent sympathetic/adrenomedullary system. Stress reaction, even if it is sustained for long, does not cause obvious damage to salivary glands. However, stress induces dramatic changes in the constituents of secreted saliva. Since salivary protein secretion is strongly dependent on sympathetic control, changes in saliva can be utilized as sensitive stress indicators. Some of the secreted compounds are known for their protective effect in the mouth and the gut, while others may just pass through the glands from blood plasma because of their chemical nature and the presence of transcellular salivary transporting systems. Indeed, most compounds that appear in blood circulation can also be identified in saliva, although at different concentrations. This work overviews the presently recognized salivary stress biosensors, such as amylase, cortisol, heat shock proteins and other compounds. It also demonstrates that saliva is widely recognised as a diagnostic tool for early and sensitive discovery of salivary and systemic conditions and disorders. At present it may be too early to introduce most of these biomarkers in daily routine diagnostic applications, but advances in salivary biomarker standardisation should permit their wide-range utilization in the future including safe, reliable and non-invasive estimation of acute and chronic stress levels in patients.

AB  - Lignocellulose biomass is a key source of bioenergy in the EU and in Poland. Therefore, this study analysed the effect of the method of storing chips obtained from short rotation willow on their thermophysical and chemical properties and on the biomass loss, depending on the method of storage and the type of cover, in the climatic conditions of Central-Eastern Europe. The experiment involved examination of five methods of storage of willow chips: with no cover (control), under permeable covers Toptex 200 and Toptex 300, under vapour-permeable foil and in a wooden shed. The chips were stored from March 2011 to March 2012. Use of cover made of permeable materials was found to improve the biomass quality: its moisture content decreased more than twice and its heating value increased more than twice. The energy content of the stored piles was also found to increase by 10% after a year of storage. The energy content was also found to increase in a roofed pile and to decrease in biomass covered with foil (-9%) and uncovered (-50%). Biomass loss for chips stored under permeable covers ranged from 3.8% to 5.1%. Similar findings were recorded for chips stored in a shed, while the effects were worse for the piles stored under vapour-permeable foil. The worst biomass parameters were recorded for an uncovered pile. Storage of willow chips in an open space under cover could be a cheaper alternative, which could improve the quality of willow chips compared to roofed warehouses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study we analysed fecal bacterial communities and parasites of three important Indonesian fish species, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus, Epinephelus sexfasciatus and Atule mate. We then compared the biodiversity of bacterial communities and parasites of these three fish species collected in highly polluted Jakarta Bay with those collected in less polluted Indonesian areas of Cilacap (E. sexfasciatus, A. mate) and Thousand Islands (E. fuscoguttatus). In addition, E. fuscoguttatus from net cages in an open water mariculture facility was compared with free living E. fuscoguttatus from its surroundings. Both core and shared microbiomes were investigated. Our results reveal that, while the core microbiomes of all three fish species were composed of fairly the same classes of bacteria, the proportions of these bacterial classes strongly varied. The microbial composition of phylogenetically distant fish species, i.e. A. mate and E. sexfasciatus from Jakarta Bay and Cilacap were more closely related than the microbial composition of more phylogentically closer species, i.e. E. fuscoguttatus, E. sexfasciatus from Jakarta Bay, Cilacap and Thousand Islands. In addition, we detected a weak negative correlation between the load of selected bacterial pathogens, i.e. Vibrio sp. and Photobacterium sp. and the number of endoparasites. In the case of Flavobacterium sp. the opposite was observed, i.e. a weak positive correlation. Of the three recorded pathogenic bacterial genera, Vibrio sp. was commonly found in E. fuscoguttatus from mariculture, and lessly in the vicinity of the net cages and rarely in the fishes from the heavily polluted waters from Jakarta Bay. Flavobacterium sp. showed higher counts in mariculture fish and Photobacteria sp. was the most prominent in fish inside and close to the net cages.

AB  - Background: Chloride is the major anion in cells, with many diseases arising from disordered Cl- regulation. For the non-invasive investigation of Cl- flux, YFP-H148Q and its derivatives chameleon and Cl-Sensor previously were introduced as genetically encoded chloride indicators. Neither the Cl- sensitivity nor the pH-susceptibility of these modifications to YFP is optimal for precise measurements of Cl- under physiological conditions. Furthermore, the relatively poor photostability of YFP derivatives hinders their application for dynamic and quantitative Cl- measurements. Dynamic and accurate measurement of physiological concentrations of chloride would significantly affect our ability to study effects of chloride on cellular events.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we developed a series of YFP derivatives to remove pH interference, increase photostability and enhance chloride sensitivity. The final product, EYFP-F46L/Q69K/H148Q/I152L/V163S/S175G/ S205V/A206K (monomeric Cl-YFP), has a chloride K-d of 14 mM and pK(a) of 5.9. The bleach time constant of 175 seconds is over 15-fold greater than wild-type EYFP. We have used the sensor fused to the transmembrane protein prestin (gerbil prestin, SLC26a5), and shown for the first time physiological (mM) chloride flux in HEK cells expressing this protein. This modified fluorescent protein will facilitate investigations of dynamics of chloride ions and their mediation of cell function.
   Conclusions: Modifications to YFP (EYFP-F46L/Q69K/H148Q/I152L/V163S/S175G/S205V/A206K (monomeric Cl-YFP) results in a photostable fluorescent protein that allows measurement of physiological changes in chloride concentration while remaining minimally affected by changes in pH.

AB  - Restoring jurisdictional wetland hydrology does not ensure that the hydrologic conditions of any specific natural forested wetland community are recreated. This is especially problematic for a state like North Carolina, which has roughly two dozen different forested wetland communities. Because forested wetland communities align themselves across edaphic and hydrologic gradients, we suggest exploiting these relationships to guide restoration design and set performance standards. However, methods to compare hydrology between multiple reference sites and restored wetlands are lacking. To address this, we studied three different forested wetlands across 13 reference sites to determine which measures of water table levels, based on correlation with plant community composition, would be useful to distinguish these three communities. We then used the best measures of water table levels to assess two restoration sites and compare them with the reference sites. Our results showed that monthly median water table levels encompassing the start of the growing season had the strongest correlation with plant community composition, whereas roughly five other measures also had strong correlations. On the basis of the best measures, both of the restoration sites had water table levels that generally fell within the natural range of the reference sites. Because there was variation in water table levels across each restoration site, the different measures where useful to identify which areas were least similar to the reference sites and might need further monitoring in the future. On the basis of our results, we recommend using community-specific measures of hydrology to guide and assess forested wetland restoration. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Taenia crassiceps is a cestode parasite that uses carnivores as definitive hosts and rodents and rabbits as main intermediate hosts, but other animal species and humans may also get infected. One adult male chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera) from an animal shelter in Switzerland presented widespread subcutaneous fluctuant swellings extended over the forehead, nose, face and thoracic regions with a progressive growth over 3 months. The thoracic swelling was surgically resected, and it consisted of numerous 3-4 mm small transparent vesicles, mainly confined to the subcutaneous tissue, which were morphologically identified as cysticerci of T. crassiceps. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequence analysis of fragments of the mitochondrial small subunit rRNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 genes. After 1.5 months, due to enlargement of the swollen areas and deterioration of the general health condition, the chinchilla was euthanized and a necropsy was performed. Thousands of small cysticerci were observed widespread in the subcutis, involving underlying musculature of the whole body, in the thoracic cavity, larynx, pharynx and in the retropharyngeal region. Additionally, three larger metacestodes were detected in the liver and morphologically and molecularly identified as Taenia taeniaeformis strobilocerci. The present case represents an indicator of the environmental contamination with Taenia eggs, highlighting the risk of infection for susceptible animals and humans. Besides the clinical relevance for pets, T. crassiceps is a zoonotic parasite and can be also cause of severe cysticercosis in humans. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Community-Based Environmental Monitoring (CBM) is a social practice that makes a valuable contribution to environmental management and construction of active societies for sustainable future. However, its documentation and analysis show deficiencies that hinder contrast and comparison of processes and effects. Based on systems approach, this article presents a model of CBM to orient assessment of programs, with heuristic or practical goals. In a focal level, the model comprises three components, the social subject, the object of monitoring, and the means of action, and five processes, data management, social learning, assimilation/decision making, direct action, and linking. Emergent properties were also identified in the focal and suprafocal levels considering community self-organization, response capacity, and autonomy for environmental management. The model was applied to the assessment of a CBM program of water quality implemented in rural areas in Mexico. Attributes and variables (indicators) for components, processes, and emergent properties were selected to measure changes that emerged since the program implementation. The assessment of the first 3 years (2010-2012) detected changes that indicated movement towards the expected results, but it revealed also the need to adjust the intervention strategy and procedures. Components and processes of the model reflected relevant aspects of the CBM in real world. The component called means of action as a key element to transit "from the data to the action." The CBM model offered a conceptual framework with advantages to understand CBM as a socioecological event and to strengthen its implementation under different conditions and contexts.

AB  - A numerical model based on the random walk particle tracking technique is developed to simulate the transport of the contaminants discharged into the coastal area of Guangxi, China from rivers. The model couples a 1D river flow module and a 2D coastal circulation module. Two transport timescales, i.e., the age and the arrival time, are introduced to characterize the contaminant transport process. The age is the time for a particle taken to enter the domain of interest after it left the place where the age is initially set to zero. The arrival time, on the other hand, is the age of the particle arriving at a particular place most quickly after release. It is useful for emergency responses to such an accident as toxic substance leakage. By the numerical model, the age and the arrival time under various conditions in the coastal area of Guangxi, China are studied in details. The age distribution and the arrival time of particles at a specific location are shown to closely rely on the coastal hydrodynamic environment in addition to the distance of the location from the source where particles are released. Particles released at spring tide and at ebb tide are found to spread more quickly than those released at neap tide and at flood tide, respectively. A large carrying discharge of river reduces the ages of the contaminants from the river concerned when transported to a place within the coastal area, while it has less influence on the arrival time, particularly in a place along the coast.

AB  - Four streams-Clear Fork, Lost Creek, Camp Creek and Still Creek-in northwestern Oregon's Sandy River Basin were monitored for temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, and fecal bacterial concentrations in a multi-year analysis examining stream health for recreational users and anchor habitat for Pacific Salmon. Temperatures were recorded using micro -T temperature loggers at 15 locations, during 22 July -5 September 2006, 2 July -4 September 2007, 20 June -7 September 2008, 23 June -9 September 2009, and 2 July -9 September 2010. The Seven-Day Average Maximum water temperature (7-DAM) of 13 degrees C was used as a reference value for the biological limit governing suitable salmonid spawning and egg incubation conditions. The maximum 7-DAM temperatures occurred on different dates and all streams neared or exceeded the 13 degrees C standard at least once each summer. Dissolved oxygen levels were measured at weekly or longer intervals in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. Dissolved oxygen levels fell below the 9.0 ppm standard for Clear Fork on almost half the sampling dates in 2006, 2007, and 2009. Concentrations of the bacterial genus Enterococcus were measured as an indicator of fecal contamination. Samples were collected at 15 sites along the four streams. Weekly samples were collected during a 9 week period from July -September 2007, an 11 week period from June -September 2008, and an 11 week period from June September 2009. Enterococcus counts exceeded the federal recommended national criterion value of 61 colony forming units (CFU) per 100 mL every year in Camp Creek and occasionally elsewhere, with exceedances trending towards late summer.

AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the balance between the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and phenol peroxidases (POD) and cowpea root growth in response to dehydration and salt stress. Root growth and indicators of oxidative response were markedly changed in response to salinity and dehydration. Salt treatment strongly inhibited root elongation, which was associated with an increase in lignin content and a significant decrease in the concentrations of apoplastic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ascorbate. In conditions of extreme salinity, cytosol-APX activity was significantly decreased. In contrast, cell-wall POD activity was greatly increased, whereas lipid peroxidation was unchanged. These results indicate that POD could be involved in both H2O2 scavenging and the inhibition of root elongation under high salinity. In contrast, dehydration stimulated primary root elongation and increased lipid peroxidation and apoplastic ascorbate content, but it did not change APX and POD activities or H2O2 concentration. When cowpea roots were subjected to salinity followed by dehydration, the water and pressure potentials were decreased, and lipid peroxidation was markedly increased, highlighting the additive nature of the inhibitory effects caused by salt and dehydration. The proline concentration was markedly increased by dehydration alone, as well as by salt followed by dehydration, suggesting a possible role for proline in osmotic adjustment. Salinity and dehydration induce contrasting responses in the growth and morphology of cowpea roots. These effects are associated with different types of oxidative modulation involving cytosolic-APX and cell-wall POD activities and apoplast H2O2 and ascorbate levels.

AB  - Under the European Union Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection, the European Commission Directorate-General for the Environment (DG Environment) and the European Environmental Agency (EEA) have identified decline in soil organic matter and soil losses by erosion as priorities for the collection of policy-relevant soil data at European scale. To support EU policies related to soil conditions the data collected on corresponding indicators requires establishing agreed datasets for the EU Member States on these themes.
   In 2010, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC), which is charged with the collection of soil data at European scale and hosts the European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC), conducted a project to collect data on soil organic carbon and soil erosion in Europe using the European Environment Information and Observation Network for soil (EIONET-SOIL). The data submitted by participating countries are their best estimate and represent an official point of view. The technical approach taken allows a country to easily update the records when new data become available.
   This paper presents the first results obtained from analyzing the soil organic carbon data submitted to EIONET-SOIL The collected data were compared with the modelled data of the European topsoil organic carbon content developed at the JRC. The modelled data follow the general pattern of the geographic distribution of collected data, but show higher values compared to the EIONET-SOIL data. The important role of soil organic carbon (SOC) as an indicator of soil quality underlines the need for using common methods of sampling, analysing and reporting soil organic carbon to provide a standard product, such as EIONET-SOIL (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Scientific analysis were undertaken within a research project concerning ivory objects from the Chalcolithic to Early Bronze Age of the Iberian Peninsula. In several of the analyses of objects from Portuguese Estremadura, especially V-perforated buttons, we could detect for the first time the presence of sperm whale ivory. This highlights the advantage and necessity of scientific analysis of ivory. It also clearly demonstrates that not all ivory used was ivory from African or Asian elephants, but we also did find ivory from the extinct Elephas antiquus, the hippopotamus and in this case sperm-whale. Thus, already in the Chalcolithic the raw material provenience was highly diverse, which in the absence of scientific analysis might lead to an erroneous interpretation of prehistoric exchange networks. Different methods, including optical microscopy, measurement of hardness and specific gravity, Micro-Raman Spectroscopy, elemental analysis and Isotopic Ratio Mass Spectrometry have been applied. In this paper we present these methods and the results, and we discuss about the implications of these results for the reconstruction of prehistoric economy and life in this region. Finally, taking into account the natural conditions as well as prehistoric and historic data of whale hunting and scavenging of beached animals, we conclude that the most plausible explanation for the presence of sperm whale ivory in Chalcolithic Portugal is the use of the teeth obtained from stranded animals. This interpretation is possible because of the human populations using this ivory are those living close to the sea and exploiting - among others- marine resources.

AB  - Information about rapidly changing slum areas may support the development of appropriate interventions by concerned authorities. Often, however, traditional data collection methods lack information on the spatial distribution of slum-dwellers. Remote sensing based methods could be used for a rapid inventory of the location and physical composition of slums. (Semi-)automatic detection of slums in image data is challenging, owing to the high variability in appearance and definitions across different contexts. This paper develops an ontological framework to conceptualize slums using input from 50 domain-experts covering 16 different countries. This generic slum ontology (GSO) comprises concepts identified at three levels that refer to the morphology of the built environment: the environs level, the settlement level and the object level. It serves as a comprehensive basis for image-based classification of slums, in particular, using object-oriented image analysis (OOA) techniques. This is demonstrated by with an example of local adaptation of GSO and OOA parameterization for a study area in Kisumu, Kenya. At the object level, building and road characteristics are major components of the ontology. At the settlement level, texture measures can be potentially used to represent the contrast between planned and unplanned settlements. At the environs level, factors which extend beyond the site itself are important indicators, e.g. hazards due to floods plains and marshy conditions. The GSO provides a comprehensive framework that includes all potentially relevant indicators that can be used for image-based slum identification. These characteristics may be different for other study areas, but show the applicability of the developed framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: There is a longstanding discussion that prolonged psychological stress can have negative somatic effects, especially in respect to endocrinological and immunological changes. Yet, the clinical significance of these findings is still unclear. Patients with prolonged stress should show more signs and symptoms of related illnesses. Aim: The question we like to answer in this study is: are laboratory measures of global health suited to assess, discriminate or predict chronic psychological stress effects on biological systems? Methods: Included were 50 inpatients who were suffering from post-traumatic embitterment disorder (PTED), a condition that causes persistent and intense psychological distress. They were compared with a group of 50 matched control patients with unselected psychosomatic disorders but no immediate stress and strain. Gender distribution and age were the same in both samples because of the matching (60% women; mean age: 49 years). PTED patients had an average duration of illness of 31.7 (+/- 35.5) months. In the SCL-90 they showed an average GSI score of 1.13 (+/- 0.55) compared with 0.74 (+/- 0.50) in the controls, as indicator of their increased psychological strain. Between groups, we compared the results of 24 laboratory tests, which can be seen as indicators of functioning of all important body systems. Results: There was no significant difference in the results of laboratory tests between groups and especially no indicators for different rates of immunological or inflammatory illnesses. Conclusion: Laboratory measures of global health may not be suited to assess, discriminate or predict psychological chronic stress effects on important biological systems.

AB  - A co-seismic viscoplastic sliding model, composed of two consequential behaviour phases, was realised in order to assess the co-seismic and post-seismic stability of natural slopes. The model takes into consideration the development and distribution of available strengths in pre-seismic conditions, as well as the viscoplastic behaviours manifested during monotonic and impulsive fast shearing tests on different clayey soils. In relation to the strength increase produced by the shear displacement rate, phase I is present during sliding on pre-existing failure surfaces at the residual state and/or in weak bands at the fully softened state. In this latter case, this is limited to small displacements. Conversely, phase II is characterised by strength decrease and occurs if and when the inertial dynamic load mobilises the "impulsive critical shear strength", which is greater than the shear strength available in the pre-seismic static field. This implies the development of a first failure or a new failure surface with high shear displacements along these surfaces. The simplified dynamic analysis for infinite slopes, integrated by the behaviour model introduced in this paper, highlights a less conservative nature in comparison to that of the classic Newmark approach with one single exception. This occurs on attainment of the "static break point" where the co-seismic displacements obtained are comparable or even greater than those attainable from the classic Newmark approach. Furthermore, in relation to the co-seismic development of shear strength, it is possible to estimate in the short term as well as in the long term the post-seismic instability after the main shock.

AB  - As human populations continue to grow, expanding energy needs enhance freshwater resource conservation challenges. Mining for coal has significantly altered the landscape in the United States' Appalachian region, with significant negative effects on downstream water quality and ecosystem function. With recent policy changes concerning the impacts of coal mining on aquatic ecosystems, many coal companies choose to restore sections of stream located on older coal mining areas as mandated compensatory mitigation for mining-related stream disturbances. We assessed such mitigation using measures of both structure and function in restored and unrestored streams affected by surface mining operations. Macroinvertebrate assemblages in streams affected by older mining and recent restoration practices were rated as "stressed" and "severely stressed," with streams varying from fair to optimal in terms of habitat. All streams were net heterotrophic with varying levels of ammonium uptake. No site differences were found for any measured physicochemical or functional variables, while invertebrate community metric scores were higher in unrestored streams. There were also no significant relationships found between structural and functional measurements in these streams. Principal components analysis implicated the importance of measuring physicochemical, structural, and functional variables in further analyses of restoration success. This study was unable to document pre-disturbance conditions, and as a result, we were unable to find evidence that restoration is currently having a significant effect on ecosystem processes within these systems. Further research is needed to understand the changes in ecosystem structure and function that come with time.

AB  - Caprine tuberculosis in Spain is mainly caused by Mycobacterium caprae although the progression of the disease and lesion severity is similar to that caused by Mycobacterium bovis. In this study, the sensitivity of the gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) assay using an antigen cock-tail containing early secretory antigenic target-6 kDa (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10) peptides for stimulation was determined and compared with those obtained in single intradermal tuberculin (SIT) and single intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin (SICCT) tests and IFN-gamma assay using purified protein derivative (PPD) in three different flocks infected with M. caprae under different epidemiological conditions. Correlation between specific IFN-gamma production and severity of lesions was also evaluated. Sensitivities of the diagnostic tests varied greatly in the three flocks studied, with higher values in those where higher lesion scores were observed. The results show that IFN-gamma assay applied in goats using PPD or the ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides cocktail for stimulation yielded similar sensitivity values. A significant yet weak positive correlation between specific IFN-gamma production and lesion scores was detected after the stimulation with PPDs (p = 0.004) whereas when the blood samples were stimulated with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides, the correlation was not significant (p > 0.05). Therefore, specific-IFN-gamma production after the stimulation with PPDs or ESAT-6/CFP-10 was not an accurate indicator of lesion severity in naturally tuberculosis infected goats with M. caprae.

AB  - PALAEOPEDOLOGICAL APPROACH OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF FOSSIL HOMINIDS FROM THE SANGIRAN DOME (CENTRAL JAVA, INDONESIA)
   The thick fossiliferous volcano-sedimentary series of the Sangiran dome area (Kalibeng, Pucangan, Grenzbank, Kabuh and Notopuro) from central Java (Indonesia) were deposited throughout the Quaternary and represent a succession of coastal, marine and finally continental terrestrial environments. Palaeosoils from these series of Southeast Asia are good indicators of the successive landscapes in which early hominids lived and migrated during the Lower and early Middle Pleistocene. This palaeopedological study deals with seven localities distributed over an area of ca. 50 km(2). Six palaeosoil orders (histosol, gleysol, vertisol, argillisol, protosol, oxisol) are characterised and include 19 pedotypes. We investigated the south-eastern and northwestern fossiliferous regions, which show very different sedimentary sequences. The characterisation of successive pedoclimatic contexts and toposequences enables us to reconstruct the local palaeogeography and informs about the climate (mainly influenced by south-eastern Asia monsoon cycles) that prevailed during the periods of palaeosoil development. The first fully terrestrial levels were identified at the base of the upper Pucangan unit, corresponding to the development of an open landscape on earlier sites of wide coastal swamps. Higher up in the series, environments are indicative of a contrasted seasonal climate with a long dry season, alternate with periods of more humid palustrine conditions. Recurrent aridity proxies are then found in the overlying Grenzbank and Kabuh series (both have yield the most abundant hominid fossils). Soils from these series reflect a long dry season and an open vegetation landscape, in agreement with stratigraphical and palynological observations.

AB  - Calcareous fens are wetlands fed by calcareous groundwater and with predominantly low (< 1 m) vegetation. They are critical habitat for rare species, and development of tall vegetation alters this habitat. Our purpose was to better understand how human activities influence the fen habitat. In 1997 in eastern New York and northwestern Connecticut we located 25 fens using soil maps and field surveys, and delimited these sites using 73 indicator plants classified a priori as fen species, disturbance species, or non-fen woody species. In three plots in each fen we measured species cover, water table depth, organic matter, total inorganic nitrogen, groundwater pH and conductivity, and described land use on and within 100 m of each fen to identify the conditions that may lead to fen degradation. Total inorganic nitrogen correlated most significantly with plant species composition. Fen-species richness was negatively correlated with nitrogen, whereas non-fen woody species richness and cover were positively correlated with nitrogen, suggesting that nitrogen inputs contribute to dominance of tall vegetation in fens. Richness of disturbance indicator species was negatively correlated with soil organic matter. Thus, fens with mineral soil layers may be more susceptible to dominance by non-fen species. Percent cover of disturbance indicator species was greater in fens near public roads. Cover of Lythrum salicaria, an invasive weed, was positively correlated with land-use intensity and was greater near public roads. The use of soil maps, indicator plant richness and cover, inorganic nitrogen, water table, and soil organic matter may be an efficient method for locating, delimiting, and assessing the ecological status of fens.

AB  - Aims:
   This study was to investigate the methanogenic community in a biogas reactor from start-up to acidification conditions. Furthermore, reliability and accuracy of the applied quantitative real-time PCR method (Q-PCR) was briefly evaluated.
   Methods and Results:
   A mesophilic (37 degrees C), maize silage fed, continuously stirred tank reactor was surveyed. It was operated semi-continuously with increasing daily organic loading rates (OLRs) to reach acidification. Gas production and organic acid composition were measured. Methanogenic community structure was determined by 16S rDNA-based Q-PCR to estimate the abundance of key methanogenic micro-organisms. 16S rDNA of hydrogenotrophic Methanobacteriales was most abundant at OLRs of >= 3 center dot 7 g dry organic matter (DOM) l-1 day-1. By contrast, that of aceticlastic Methanosaetaceae predominated at lower OLRs but disappeared at OLRs of >= 4 center dot 1 g DOM l-1 day-1. At the same OLR, the propionate concentration increased dramatically indicating the acidification of the digester. Application of internal standards to examine Q-PCR's accuracy revealed that the detected amount of 16S rDNA may vary within one log cycle.
   Conclusions:
   These results suggest that the absence of Methanosaetaceae might be taken as biological indicator for process' instability. Inhibitory effects on Q-PCR analyses could not be determined based on the spiking experiments.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   In this study, reactors' microbiology was observed over time using Q-PCR. Insights into the abundance of different methanogens might be used to improve the performance of biogas reactors.

AB  - Species differences in tolerance to environmental stressors can contribute to differences in species distribution and abundance along river gradients. Climate change and intensive agriculture are likely to have major effects on fish populations in temperate zones, yet understanding of the interactions between temperature and chemical stressors on fish physiology is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the stress responses of the Mountain Whitefish, (Prosopium williamsoni, a cold-water fish) and White Sucker (Catostomus commersoni, a cool-water fish), along a temperature and pesticide gradient in the Oldman River, Southern Alberta in spring and summer. Fish were seined, placed into an enclosure, and plasma cortisol, glucose, liver glycogen, and condition factor were measured. Plasma acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was used as an indicator of exposure to organophosphate and carbamates pesticides. Whitefish had lower plasma AChE activity and lower liver glycogen reserves compared to suckers at all sites and all sampling times but the differences in plasma cortisol were not species-specific and there were no differences in plasma glucose levels, except at one site. Plasma cortisol increased, and plasma glucose decreased along a downstream river gradient in whitefish in both spring and summer; in sucker only plasma cortisol fluctuated and only in the summer. Liver glycogen decreased along the river gradient in both species at both seasons. Our study detected important species-specific differences in AChE activities and responses of the physiological stress axis, suggesting that whitefish are more sensitive to temperature and pesticide stress than suckers.

AB  - Hydrology and management affect dipteran communities in wetlands and they, themselves, have the potential to influence prey communities.
   Turloughs are temporary lakes unique to Ireland. Their vegetation is ecotonal on a dry-wet continuum and, due to differing summer management practises, shows a diversity of vegetation lengths. Marsh flies (Sciomyzidae), a taxon that has potential as wetland bio-indicators, were chosen to investigate management, hydrological and prey effects on turloughs.
   Summer collections of Sciomyzidae were made on 24 homogeneous zones across ten turloughs. At each position that flies were collected, vegetation surveys were conducted to utilise Ellenberg indices as surrogate environmental variables. Winter collections of Molluscs were made on 21 zones.
   Sciomyzidae showed maximum total abundance and species richness at sites intermediate on the dry-wet gradient, supporting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.
   Indicator species analysis gave site-specific preferences: most species favoured the site with the longest vegetation, but the smallest species showed a significant preference for the site with the shortest vegetation. Across the full hydrological gradient, known terrestrial snail-killers were indicators of drier poor-grasslands and known hygrophilous species were indicators of the wettest zones.
   Generalised linear models for abundance of the dominant species consistently showed negative relationships with total prey abundance. However, sciomyzid communities showed no significant co-structure with prey communities, but did with sampling conditions, and management/hydrological variables.
   Sciomyzid communities change qualitatively and quantitatively with vegetation structure and hydrology and correlative evidence for predation pressure by the dominant species highlights the potential of Sciomyzidae to control the intermediate host of fascioliasis.

AB  - Analysis of presolar grains in primitive meteorites has shown isotopic ratios largely characteristic of the conditions thought to prevail in various astrophysical environments. A possible indicator for a grain of ONe nova origin is a large S-33 abundance: nucleosynthesis calculations predict as much as 150 times the solar abundance of S-33 in the ejecta of nova explosions on massive ONe white dwarfs. This overproduction factor may, however, vary by factors of at least 0.01-3 because of uncertainties of several orders of magnitude in the S-33(p,gamma)Cl-34 reaction rate at nova peak temperatures (T-peak similar to 0.1-0.4 GK). These uncertainties arise due to the lack of nuclear physics information for states within similar to 600 keV of the S-33+p threshold in Cl-34 (S-p(Cl-34) = 5143 keV). To better constrain this rate we have measured, for the first time, the S-34(He-3,t)Cl-34 reaction over the region E-x(Cl-34) = 4.9-6 MeV. We confirm previous states and find 15 new states in this energy region. New S-33(p,gamma)Cl-34 resonances at E-R=281(2), 301(2), and 342(2) keV may dominate this rate at relevant nova temperatures. Our results could affect predictions of sulphur isotopic ratios in nova ejecta (e.g., S-32/S-33) that may be used as diagnostic tools for the nova paternity of grains.

TI  - Effect of Turbidity Duration on Culture of Walleye Larvae
T2  - NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE
LA  - English
AB  - Although turbid water is an essential environmental requirement for intensive larviculture of walleyes Sander vitreus on formulated feed, research has not determined the duration of turbidity required to achieve optimal benefits for survival and growth while reducing cannibalism. We conducted a replicated, single-factor analysis to determine the effect duration of turbidity on these performance indicators at 28 d posthatch (dph). Four treatments, each with three replicate 150-L tanks, involved culture of larvae in turbid water (84-125 nephelometric turbidity units [NTU]) from 3 dph to 7, 14, 21, or 28 dph. After culture under turbid conditions for the specified period, the fish were then cultured in clear water until 28 dph (i.e., fish in the 28-dph treatment received no clear-water culture). At 28 dph, substantial differences were observed in survival and growth among treatments. Fish survival for the 7- and 14-dph treatments (1% and 2%, respectively) was significantly less than that for the 21- and 28-dph treatments (11% and 14%, respectively). There was a significant difference in total length at 28 dph among the 7-, 14-, and 21-dph treatments but not between the 21- and 28-dph treatments. Fish in the 28-dph treatment were 177% heavier than those in the 14-dph treatment. A shift in phototaxic response at about 20 dph further reduced the need for turbid-water culture to prevent clinging behavior in walleye larvae. Cannibalism (2-5%) was observed in all treatments between 7 and 13 dph but not thereafter. The study substantiates benefits of turbid-water culture for larval walleyes and demonstrates that duration of turbidity should extend through 28 dph to maximize survival and growth but that it is less important for preventing cannibalism after 13 dph and clinging behavior after 20 dph.

AB  - Advancing the understanding of spatiotemporal aspects of air pollution in the urban environment is an area where improved methods can be of great benefit to exposure assessment and policy support. This paper explores the potential of a technique known as kriging with external drift (KED) to provide high resolution maps of fine particulate matter for a downtown region of Cusco, Peru. There were three stages in this research. The first was to conduct a pilot level monitoring campaign to investigate ambient, regional, and street-level air pollutant concentrations for particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the Province of Cusco. The second was to compile observations within a geographic information system (GIS) in order to characterize the proximal effect of the local transportation network, elevation, and land use classifications on PM2.5. Third, regression, ordinary kriging and kriging with external drift were used to model PM2.5 for three select time periods during a 24-h day. Statistical evaluations indicate kriging with external drift resulted in the strongest models explaining 64% of variability seen with morning particle concentrations, 25% for afternoon particles, and 53% in evening particles. These models capture spatial and temporal variability for air pollution in Cusco. These variations seem to be influenced, to varying degrees, by elevation, meteorological conditions, spatial location, and transportation characteristics. In conclusion, combining GIS, meteorological data and geostatistics proved to be a complementary suite of tools for incorporating spatiotemporal analysis into the air quality assessment.

KW  - INJURY
KW  - TREES
AB  - Ambient, ground-level ozone is the most important air pollutant affecting vegetation in the US. However, ozone-sensitive bioindicators need to be identified for use in field surveys to detect ozone-induced symptoms. To identify such bioindicators, 28 plant selections were exposed to ozone within greenhouse chambers during 2003 and 2004. Plants most sensitive to ozone included Asclepias incarnata (swamp milkweed), Asclepias syriaca (common milkweed), Cephalanthus occidentalis (buttonbush), Platanus occidentalis (American sycamore), Salix x cotteti (Bankers dwarf willow), Salix lucida (shining willow), Salix nigra (black willow), Salix sericea (silky willow), and Symphoricarpos albus (snowberry). Plants moderately sensitive included Aster novae-angliae (New England aster), Monarda didyma (bee-balm), Rhus aromatica (aromatic sumac), Salix discolor (pussy willow), Salix exigua (sandbar willow), Salix purpurea (basket willow), Sambucus ebulus (European dwarf elderberry), and Symphoricarpos spp. (mixture of "snowberries"). Plants more tolerant to ozone included Aster macrophyllus (bigleaf aster), Aster novi-belgii (New York aster), Cercis canadensis (redbud), Populus maximowizii x trichocarpa (hybrid poplar), Rudbeckia laciniata (cutleaf, or tall green-headed coneflower), Salix amygdaloides (peach-leaved willow), Salix eriocephala (diamond willow), Sambucus canadensis (American elder), Sambucus nigra (European elder), Symphoricarpos orbiculatus (coralberry), and Viburnum trilobum (highbush-cranberry). The incidence and severity of ozone-induced symptoms varied with species, ozone concentration, and length of exposure. Pigmented adaxial leaf surface stipple, bifacial necrosis, and premature defoliation were common foliar symptoms induced by ozone; leaf reddening, bronzing, and chlorosis occurred less frequently. Species that produced classic ozone-induced stipple in this study may serve as useful bioindicators in field surveys to confirm that ozone injury occurs in many parts of the country. Such findings may have a positive impact on establishing more stringent air-quality standards to protect vegetation and the environment.

AB  - The increasing need for food, space and other conditions for human survival generate greater anthropic interferences with the environment. Intensively and improperly tilled soils are degraded and illegal civil construction in rural areas is causing problems. Different techniques are being used to ameliorate these soils, mainly by the addition of organic matter, but information on the time required for soil recovery, influence of the organic matter type and on indicators of soil alterations is still rare. Our study aimed to recover the properties of an Oxisol used for the leveling and implantation of the hydroelectric power station of Ilha Solteira, Sao Paulo. Bulk density and water infiltration rate were used as indicators of soil physical quality. The experiment was carried out in an, area where a layer of 8.60 m of soil had been removed. The experiment had a randomized, block design with five replicates and five treatments: control plot (open soil without amelioration); tree species Goncalo-alves (Astronium fraxinifolium Schott); Goncalo-alves + Canavalia ensiformis; Goncalo-alves + Raphanus sativus; and Goncalo-alues + Brachiaria decumbens + sewage sludge (60 Mg ha(-1)). Bulk density was evaluated before and 356 days after treatment installation, whereas soil water infiltration was determined 188 days after treatment installation. Improvements in the soil quality where obtained with tillage and sewage sludge and green manure application. Bulk density and soil water infiltration were useful as indicators of the improvements. Different sources of organic matter added to the soil and the action of soil tillage interact in a similar way in the recovery of soil quality, but the Goncalo-alves trees grew highest with the combination of sewage sludge and Brachiaria decumbens.

AB  - The Quaternary sediments of previously unstudied buried valleys and sections near Montreal are analyzed and other sites are revisited to further develop the stratigraphic framework of the St. Lawrence Lowland and to establish regional glacial and deglacial models. The southwest-trending buried valleys were investigated by stratigraphic drilling and high-resolution seismic profiling. The Quaternary succession consists, from base to top, of proximal glaciolacustrine sediments, two superposed till sheets (Argenteuil and Oka tills) of inferred Late Wisconsinan age, and Champlain Sea sediments. The glacial sediments of this sequence record an ice advance toward south (Argenteuil Till) followed by an abrupt ice-flow shift toward the southwest (Oka Till). Compositional and geomorphic data indicate that Oka Till is ubiquitous and is associated with a regional set of glacial landforms. The analysis of a regional digital elevation model in combination with published ice-flow indicators shows convergent flow patterns from the Ottawa-Montreal-Adirondack regions toward the Lake Ontario basin. Landforms produced by the inferred ice stream are locally crosscut by southward-trending ice-flow features. Hence southward flow in the upper St. Lawrence Valley seemingly took place in two distinct contexts: (1) during full glacial conditions, as ice margins stood at or near the late glacial maximum limits, and (2) during late deglaciation, as a post-ice stream reequilibration mechanism. Early deglacial events in the study area were also characterized by subglacial meltwater channelling and erosion along the valleys, subaquatic outwash deposition in glacial Lake Candona, and rapid infill of the valleys during the early stages of the ensuing Champlain Sea.

AB  - Two Philippine hornbill species, the Visayan writhed-billed hornbill (Aceros waldeni) and the Visayan tarictic hornbill (Penelopides panini panini), display on their heads multiple sexual ornaments in both sexes. An account is given of the maturation of these ornaments, except for the hood on the hind neck, from the nestling stage through age 5 years in the writhed-bill, and from fledgling stage through age 3+ years in the tarictic. Development proceeds in a staggered fashion, in that component traits of the compound ornament are added sequentially to a baseline already present in the nestling (bare facial skin) up until maturity. In same-aged pair mates of the writhed-bill, elements (dark grooves and wreaths in the red bill) were continually added until the reproductive age of 5 years, when observations ceased. Contrary to published accounts, only the writhed-bill passes through a male-like plumage in the nestling/fledgling stage, whilst the tarictic juveniles attain their sexually dimorphic appearance right away. Writhed-bill chicks exhibit a colour dimorphism of eye (= iris) colour irrespective of sex, in which the two phases pass through two stages, but in reverse order. At least part of the ornaments can be interpreted as honest indicators of condition. Based on the concept of honest signalling, the multiple nature of the ornamentation is functionally explained by the 'multiple message hypothesis'. A physiological colour change between white and blue within seconds/minutes occurs in the bare facial skin patches of the tarictic and thus adds to the arsenal of hornbill multiple ornaments. This constitutes the first evidence for this type of colour change in a bird.

AB  - Marine reptile fossils are common in the Cretaceous epicontinental and continental-margin marine deposits of Australia but much of the material is sparsely documented. A review of current localities indicates that the majority of remains are known from the Aptian-Albian epicontinental marine units of the Eromanga Basin in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. Fragmentary specimens have also been recovered from Berriasian, Hauterivian-Barremian, Albian-Cenomanian, Cenomanian-Turonian and Maastrichtian marine deposits of Western Australia, Aptian or Albian continental margin rocks of the Northern Territory and Aptian-Albian freshwater sediments of New South Wales and Victoria. Interestingly, many of these deposits represent Cretaceous high latitude-polar environments and some include palaeoclimatic indicators suggesting very cold to near freezing conditions. As currently known, the Australian Cretaceous marine reptile fauna comprises one family of ichthyosaurs (Ophthalmosauridae), as many as five families of plesiosaur (Rhomaleosauridae, Pliosauridae, Polycotylidae, Elasmosauridae and possibly Cryptoclididae or Cimoliasauridae sensu Acta Zool. Fenn. 213 (2001)), one family of chelonioid sea turtle (Protostegidae) and indeterminate mosasaurids. Although few named Australian species may be regarded as valid, the stratigraphic distribution of taxa correlates well with that from elsewhere. Plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs dominate Lower Cretaceous deposits with plesiosaurs showing a high taxonomic diversity (including the earliest known polycotylids), particularly in the Aptian. Albian faunas see the advent of chelonioid turtles with a corresponding reduction in plesiosaur diversity (through the loss of rhomaleosaurids) and a marked increase in the numbers of ichthyosaur remains. Upper Cretaceous units have produced only fragmentary specimens of primarily plesiosaurs and mosasaurs with ichthyosaurs limited to rocks of Cenomanian age. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cells of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 are equipped with a mechanosensitive ion channel MscL that is located in their plasma membrane. However, the exact function of the channel in this freshwater cyanobacterium is unknown. This study shows that cells of Synechocystis are capable of releasing Ca2+ in response to depolarization of the plasma membrane by the K+ ionophore valinomycin in the presence of K+ or by tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+). A fluorescent dye, diS-C-3-(5), sensitive to membrane potential and the metallochromic Ca2+ indicator arsenazo III were used to follow the plasma membrane depolarization and the Ca2+ release, respectively. The Ca2+ release from wild-type cells was temperature-dependent and it was strongly inhibited by the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil and by the mechanosensitive channel blocker amiloride. In MscL-deficient cells, Ca2+ release was about 50 %of that from the wild-type cells. The mutant cells had lost temperature sensitivity of Ca2+ release completely. However, verapamil and amiloride inhibited Ca2+ release from these cells in same manner as in the wild-type cells. This suggests the existence of additional Ca2+ transporters in Synechocystis, probably of a mechanosensitive nature. Evidence for the putative presence of intracellular Ca2+ stores in the cells was obtained by following the increase in fluorescence intensity of the Ca2+ indicator chlortetracycline. These results suggest that the MscL of Synechocystis might operate as a verapamil/amiloride-sensitive outward Ca2+ channel that is involved in the plasma-membrane depolarization-induced Ca2+ release from the cells under temperature stress conditions.

AB  - The history of natural fire since 37 kaBP and its relationship to climate for the northern part of the South China Sea are revealed from the statistic study of charcoal particles and associated pollen data from deep sea core 17940 (20 degrees 07'N, 117 degrees 23'E, 1 727 m in water depth). Our study indicates that, during the last glaciation, the concentration of charcoal and the ratio of concentration between charcoal and terrestrial pollen are much higher than that of the Holocene. This can be explained as the relatively high strength and frequency of natural fire during glaciation which is probably due to the drier climate; during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the substantial rising of the concentration of large and medium charcoal particles probably suggests the local source area of the natural fires, i.e. the exposed continental shelf; moreover, the correlation between charcoal concentration with different size and pollen percentage may elucidate different transport dynamics. During the glacial time, almost all the peak concentrations of small particles correspond with the peak pollen percentage of Artemisia, an indicator of comparatively dry climate, while for large particles, their concentrations always lag behind small particles and thus change with pollen percentage of montane conifers implying relatively cold and humid climate. So, it is possible to assume that small particles reflect regional emissions under drier climate and were brought over by strengthened winter monsoon. When the climate became relatively humid, the increasing precipitation carried the large particles accumulated on continental shelf before under arid condition to the studied area.

AB  - This paper discusses the archaeological value of small pollen sir:es which reflect patchy local vegetation conditions typical of prehistoric floodplains. It is argued that both floristics and vegetation structure can only reliably be gained from macrofossil analysis and/or local pollen assemblages where the problem of the mixing of pollen from different communities is minimised and site to site differences are maximised. This exploits the pollen recruitment characteristics of small sites and differences between the pollen transport curves between canopy and understorey/groundcover species, many of which are known to be reliable indicators of vegetation structure and management. The data used to illustrate this approach are taken from six archaeological and environmental sites in the Soar and Nene valleys. The data available at present suggests small-scale temporary clearances of the Neolithic floodplains with regeneration. It is not until the Bronze Age that larger scale deforestation occurs and it appears to be associated with ritual use of the floodplain. By the middle-late Iron Age the floodplains are almost total ly deforested and used for grazing. A common feature of the sites is an expansion of Pteridium (bracken) as clearance occurs and its use as bedding in the Iron Age is indicated by macrofossil finds at one site. Given the small scale of the Neolithic clearances (however caused), including permanent changes to the herb curves it is suggested that this may reflect a forest farming (grazing) system. The coincidence of the landscape-scale deforestation of the floodplain and the construction of funery monuments raises the question as to whether the deforestation was primarily a ritualization of the landscape, agriculturally driven,or both.

AB  - Contamination by organotins in areas of aquaculture and small boat activity about Ireland has generally decreased since legislation was introduced in 1987, but in many port areas contamination increased, The fishing port of Killybegs lies within a small sheltered inlet in Donegal Bay on the N-W Irish coast and is the main source of contamination for several kilometers, This area has been studied using imposer of dogwhelks, Nucella lapillus, since 1987, Dogwhelks are particularly sensitive to TBT and have become extinct within the Harbour, and remaining populations near the Harbour entrance are likely to die-out, Periwinkles, Littorina littorea, are less affected by TBT and have a condition, intersex, which was used to determine the relative levels of contamination within the Harbour in areas where dogwhelks no longer exist, Both indicator species compliment each other; but periwinkles, useful for areas where there is high contamination, can provide some unexpected results in areas of low contamination, For such areas dogwhelks are better indicators, Imposer and intersex values decline with distance from source; low levels of contamination were found 12 km from Killybegs port. Decrease of these biological indices with distance from source was generally consistent with TBT body burdens, Fishing vessels that are greater than 25 m are permitted to use organotin antifoulant paints and high levels of contamination are expected to remain in the immediate area of the Harbour for some years even if its use is discontinued.

AB  - The comparison of malaria indicators among populations that have different genetic backgrounds and are uniformly exposed to the same parasite strains is one approach to the study of human heterogeneities in the response to the infection. We report the results of comparative surveys on three sympatric West African ethnic groups, Fulani, Mossi, and Rimaibe, living in the same conditions of hyperendemic transmission in a Sudan savanna area northeast of Ouagadougou, Burkina Paso, The Mossi and Rimaibe are Sudanese negroid populations with a long tradition of sedentary farming, while the Fulani are nomadic pastoralists, partly settled and characterized by non-negroid features of possible caucasoid origin, Parasitological, clinical, and immunological investigations showed consistent interethnic differences in Plasmodium falciparum infection rates, malaria morbidity; and prevalence and levels of antibodies to various P. falciparum antigens,The data point to a remarkably similar response to malaria in the Mossi and Rimaibe, while the Fulani are clearly less parasitized, less affected by the disease, and more responsive to all antigens tested. No difference in the use of malaria protective measures was demonstrated that could account for these findings, and sociocultural or environmental factors do not seem to be involved, Known genetic factors of resistance to malaria did not show higher frequencies in the Fulani, The differences in the immune response were not explained by the entomological observations, which indicated substantially uniform exposure to infective bites, The available data support the existence of unknown genetic factors, possibly related to humoral immune responses, determining interethnic differences in the susceptibility to malaria.

AB  - The SimpleTreat model of Struijs et al, (1991a,b) for chemical fate in a generic activated sludge type wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) has been examined together with an improved model version (vers, 2.1 jm) which gives more flexibility in the specification of the WWTP design and operating conditions and which includes a more accurate description of the process of volatilization, Model predictions for 15 different organic chemicals have tentatively been compared with observed removals in three specific Danish WWTP's, all low loaded plants with nitrogen removal, Biodegradation rate constants were either default values for readily or inherently degradable chemicals proposed in the EU Technical Guidance Document on Environmental Risk Assessment of New and Existing Substances (EUTG), or were judged from literature data. The model predictions were generally in fair agreement with the observed removals although exceptions were noted. For 10 chemicals the data allowed estimations of ''full scale'' biodegradation rate constants by model calibration, Rate constants (extrapolated to 20 degrees C reference temperature) ranged from 0.07 L/(g SS . d) for pentachlorophenol to 12 L/(g SS . d) for the very readily degradable compound, p-cresol, Finally, example calculations with parameter values representing a generic Danish WWTP have been compared with example results stated in the EUTG, The predicted emissions in the generic EU WWTP were up to 3-4 times less to water and air and the emission with excess sludge up to 10 times higher than the corresponding figures for an average Danish WWTP.

AB  - New sedimentological and palynological data from the Tertiary sediments in the Upper Amazon River area suggest that these sediments are fluvio-lacustrine deposits of Middle to Late Miocene age. They were generated as a result of the uplift of the Eastern Cordillera (Andes) and constitute possibly the oldest relies of the Amazon River system. The palaeoenvironment in which these sediments were deposited is characterized by extensive wetlands environments formed by swamps, shallow lakes, crevasse splay channels and crevasse-delta lakes where the channel environment is poorly represented. The palaeovegetation was dominated by palms (e.g. Mauritia and Grimsdalea), riverine taxa (e.g. Bombacaceae, Amanoa and Alchornea), ferns and fern allies (e.g. Polypodiaceae and Selaginellaceae), floating meadows (Gramineae) and aquatic taxa (Ceraropteris, Botryococcus and Azolla). The relative abundance of Gramineae and the occurrence of Andean-type pollen taxa is related to the Andean origin of the fluvial system. The varzeas of the present Upper Amazon River flood-basin are probably the best analogue for the Middle to Late Miocene environment.
   Intervals rich in marine palynomorphs, mangrove pollen, brackish tolerant molluscs and ostracods, and ichnofossils of the Thalassinoides-Teichichnus association suggest that the palaeoenvironment was characterized by brackish conditions and marine influence. These marine incursions are possibly related to the Langhian and the Serravallian global sea-level rise. Although in the Middle Miocene a global cooling is known to have occurred, no indicators of a cooler climate have been observed in the Miocene palynoflora of the Upper Amazon River area.
   Finally, four new sporomorph species are described belonging to the form-genera Psilatriletes, Clavainaperturites and Psilaperiporites.

AB  - Porotic hyperostosis is a paleopathologic condition that has intrigued researchers for over a century and a half. It is now generally accepted that anemia, most probably an iron deficiency anemia, is the etiologic factor responsible for lesion production. Although there can be a number of factors involved in the development of iron deficiency anemia, a dietary explanation has often been invoked to explain the occurrence of porotic hyperostosis in past human skeletal populations. In fact, porotic hyperostosis has been referred to as a "nutritional" stress indicator. Traditionally those groups with a higher incidence of porotic hyperostosis have been considered to be less successful in adapting to their environment or more nutritionally disadvantaged than other groups.
   A new perspective is emerging that is challenging previous views of the role of iron in health and disease, thus having profound implications for the understanding of porotic hyperostosis. There is a new appreciation of the adaptability and flexibility of iron metabolism; as a result it has become apparent that diet plays a very minor role in the development of iron deficiency anemia. It is now understood that, rather than being detrimental, hypoferremia (deficiency of iron in the blood) is actually an adaptation to disease and microorganism invasion. When faced with chronic and/or heavy pathogen loads individuals become hypoferremic as part of their defense against these pathogens, thus increasing their susceptibility to iron deficiency anemia. Within the context of this new perspective porotic hyperostosis is seen not as a nutritional stress indicator, but as a indication that a population is attempting to adapt to the pathogen load in its environment.

AB  - An environmental reconstruction based on palynological evidence preserved in peat was carried out to examine late-Holocene alpine tree line dynamics in the context of past climatic changes on Galdhopiggen Jotunheimen, southern Norway). We analysed a peat core taken from a mire at the present-day tree line (1000m a.s.l.), c. 450m downslope from the lower limit of sporadic permafrost. We adopted a combination of commonly used indicators of species' local presence to reconstruct past vegetation assemblages, such as the relative pollen abundance (%), pollen accumulation rate (PAR), and presence of indicator species. Additionally, fossil pollen from the peat sequence was compared to modern pollen from a surface moss polster to establish a modern analogue. The results were compared with studies covering the late-Holocene climatic changes in the area. The reconstruction demonstrates that a pine-dominated woodland reached above the present-day tree line at c. 4300 cal. yr BP, suggesting a warmer climate suitable for Scots pine (Pines sylvestris) growth at this altitude. Scots pine retreated to lower altitudes between c. 3400 and 1700 cal. yr BP, accompanied by the descent of the low-alpine shrub-dominated belt, in response to cooling climatic conditions. The colder period covered c. 1700-170 cal. yr BP, and an open downy birch (Betula pubescens) woodland became widespread at 1000m a.s.l., whilst pine remained sparse at this altitude. From c. 170 cal. yr BP onwards, warming allowed pine to re-establish its local presence alongside downy birch at 1000 m a.s.l.

AB  - Thespecies composition of zooplankton in mineralized waterbodies located in the Ulug-Khem depression (Republic of Tuva) was studied. These lakes have the status of natural monuments of regional significance. In total 53 species of microscopic crustaceans and rotifers from 32 genera, 13 families, and eight orders were recorded. Cladocerans comprise 53% of the species. The dependence of the species diversity on the level of mineralization was revealed; 89% of the species were found in brackish water bodies. The zooplankton composition of the hyperhaline Dus-Khol (Svatikovo) and Cheder lakes has remained constant for many decades. The zooplankton includes some species known only from the Republic of Tuva in Russia: Microcyclops afganicus and Macrotrix tabrizensis. The species Metadiaptomus asiaticus and Alona irinae, rare for the fauna of Russia, live in Haak-Khol Lake. A decrease in the total numbers of zooplankton is observed in the lakes: in Dus-Khol Lake, it has decreased by a factor of four; in Khadyn Lake, by 10-19 times as compared to the middle of the last century. Despite the lack of intermediate information, this could be regarded as a consequence of the anthropogenic impact. The emergence of a species indicator of pollution (Brachionus nilsoni) in Khadyn Lake confirms this version. At the same time, the stable finding of species rare for the fauna of Russia indicates the presence of favorable conditions for their development and life, which increases the value of the waterbodies themselves, which are already unique natural objects.
