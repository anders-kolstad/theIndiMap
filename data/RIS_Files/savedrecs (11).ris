AB  - Reavie D. 2019. Paleolimnology supports aquatic management by providing early warnings of stressor impacts. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Recent, abrupt transitions to undesirable states have emerged as a common phenomenon in aquatic systems. Anthropogenic drivers such as climate change, species invasions, and pollution can push an aquatic system past a critical threshold for preservation of ecosystem services, resulting in a new condition. Recognizing these transitions is important for management because ecosystem function or services are typically altered or lost. A lack of aquatic monitoring data makes predictions about future conditions difficult. Evidence from sedimentary records can provide a replacement for these missing data. Paleolimnology is a valuable tool for management of aquatic systems because it can provide detailed records of recent changes that may serve as an early warning of future degradation if stressors remain unchecked. This review provides several examples of ways imminent environmental problems can be forecast using a variety of sedimentary indicators, including diatoms, pigments, aquatic insects, and the remains of invasive zooplankton. Using a case example of recent eutrophication, I recommend modeling approaches to make future projections of conditions to support aquatic management.

AB  - The degradation process of complex multi-component systems is highly stochastic in nature. A major side effect of this complexity is that components of such systems may have unexpected reduced life and faults and failures that decrease the reliability of multi-component systems in industrial environments. In this work, we provide maintenance practitioners with an explanation of the nature of some of these unpredictable events, namely, the degradation interactions that take place between components. We begin by presenting a general wear model where the degradation process of a component may be dependent on the operating conditions, the component's own state and the state of the other components. We then present our methodology for extracting accurate health indicators from multi-component systems by means of a time-frequency domain analysis. Finally, we present a multi-component system degradation analysis of experimental data generated by a gearbox-accelerated life testing platform. In doing so, we demonstrate the importance of modelling the interactions between the system components by showing their effect on component lifetime reduction.

AB  - Reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a reliable, rapid, and reproducible technique for measuring and evaluating changes in gene expression. To facilitate gene expression studies and obtain more accurate RT-qPCR data, normalization relative to stable reference genes is required. In this study, expression profiles of seven candidate reference genes, including beta-actin (Actin), elongation factor 1 a (EF1A), glyceralde hyde-3-phosphate dehydro-genase (GAPDH), cyclophilins A (CypA), vacuolartype H+-ATPase (ATPase), 28S ribosomal RNA (28S), and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S) from Hippodamia convergens were investigated. H. convergens is an abundant predatory species in the New World, and has been widely used as a biological control agent against sapsucking insect pests, primarily aphids. A total of four analytical methods, geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and the Delta Ct method, were employed to evaluate the performance of these seven genes as endogenous controls under diverse experimental conditions. Additionally, RefFinder, a comprehensive evaluation platform integrating the four above mentioned algorithms, ranked the overall stability of these candidate genes. A suite of reference genes were specifically recommended for each experimental condition. Among them, 28S, EF1A, and CypA were the best reference genes across different development stages; GAPDH, 28S, and CypA were most stable in different tissues. GAPDH and CypA were most stable in female and male adults and photoperiod conditions, 28S and EF1A were most stable under a range of temperatures, Actin and CypA were most stable under dietary RNAi condition. This work establishes a standardized RT-qPCR analysis in H. convergens. Additionally, this study lays a foundation for functional genomics research in H. convergens and sheds light on the ecological risk assessment of RNAi-based biopesticides on this non-target biological control agent.

AB  - Routine monitoring of the quality status of water bodies demands the best cost-benefit relation and sample-size reduction is therefore welcomed. However, great caution is needed because such reduction affects the accuracy and variation of the results. In the present study we tested the influence of sample size (number of replicate samples) on reference condition values and within-sample ecological quality ratio (EQR) variability of six commonly used ecological indices (taxa richness, ShannonWiener diversity, AMBI, Medocc index, Bentix and M-AMBI). Analysis of soft-bottom benthic invertebrate data from Slovenian coastal waters showed that sample size influenced the reference condition values of richness/diversity indices (taxa richness and ShannonWiener diversity) but not of the sensitivity/tolerance indices (AMBI, Medocc index, Bentix). Increased sample size decreased the within-sample EQR variability and, concomitantly, increased the accuracy of site ecological status classification for all indices. The size of EQR variability differed depending on the index used. EQR variability of M-AMBI, an index composed of metrics with different within-sample EQR variability, was statistically the same as that of the metric with the lowest within-sample EQR variability. Whether this is a common principle for multimetric indices remains to be confirmed. Based on these results, the use of at least three replicates is suggested to obtain reliable measures of reference condition and EQR for the assessment of ecological status. This level of replication is particularly necessary in areas with high diversity and environmental patchiness, and when richness/diversity measures and indices that include these measures are used.

AB  - Debris flows with a high concentration of solid materials and sediments can disturb sustainable environmental management, damage structures, and endanger human lives. Slit dams are one of the measures for debris flow control. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to estimate the discharge coefficient of slit dams' outlets in two flow conditions involving clear water flow (without sediment) and debris flows (sediment condition). A set of factors, e.g., flow discharge, sediment discharge, slit width, upstream flow depth of slit dam, and viscosity, was selected as influential variables on the discharge coefficient. The Buckingham method was applied to extract dimensionless factors. Then, the discharge coefficient was estimated using linear and power regression analyses. The best equations for clear water flow and debris flow were selected using statistical indicators. Moreover, an equation was derived as the correction coefficient to consider the effect of sediment concentration. The results demonstrated that the discharge coefficient decreases due to increasing sediment concentration in debris flow up to 35%. Moreover, comparing the results of linear and power equations for both debris flow and clear water flow conditions revealed that power equations estimate the discharge coefficient more accurately and physically correct. Based on the proposed equation for the debris flow condition, influential dimensionless factors on the discharge coefficient respectively are relative depth, sediment concentration, and Reynolds number. The finding of this research will help estimate the discharge coefficient of the slit dams and decrease debris flows' damages to natural and built environments.

AB  - A great individual variability of dairy cows and the diversity of conditions of their maintenance make it difficult to unequivocally interpret the animals' behaviour and, consequently, to assess their welfare objectively. Thus, technical support to cattle breeders seems increasingly important in this respect at the stage of data collection, the analysis of data and assessment of rearing conditions. Therefore, the aim of the project was to examine the possibility of using cluster analysis to assess physical activity of dairy cows milked in the Voluntary Milking System while taking into account environmental conditions. The research included ten Holstein-Friesian cows in June, September, and December of 2015. The data concerning the cows' physical activity were classified with Ward's method and the Kohonen's networks. In general, during individual months, the distribution of cows' average daily physical activity was similar and its variability small. Nevertheless, over the individual months, the following three groups for this feature were distinguished with the use of the cluster analysis: night-morning, morning before noon, and afternoon-evening. At the same time, it was observed that, in at least a few cases, the division could be associated with such environmental conditions as daytime light length changes, temperature, or relative humidity of the air. Therefore, in our opinion, cluster analysis can be helpful in classifying dairy cows physical activity, thus contribute to an objective assessment of behavioural indicators of their welfare.

AB  - Household levels of deprivation to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) and residential conditions in slum settlements of Lagos, Nigeria were assessed and mapped using slum deprivation index (SDI). A structured questionnaire was administered to 1,398 households in 16 settlements using a random sampling method. Descriptive statistics and SDI were employed to analyze the data while ArcMap was used to map the patterns of SDI. The results show that households live in poor dwelling conditions with limited access to WaSH facilities. The SDI indicates that 18.7% of the slums are highly deprived. Based on WaSH and dwelling and physical environment (DPE) components, 18.75 and 31.25% of the slums are highly deprived. Water, sanitation, and hygiene indicators show that 37.5, 12.5, and 56.25% of the slums are highly deprived respectively. About 50, 37.5, 43.75, and 31.25% of the slum are highly deprived based on dwelling, waste disposal, waste pile, and stagnant water respectively. The study concluded that six settlements live in deplorable WaSH and DPE conditions. The study recommends urgent intervention for planning and resources allocation, and sustained urban renewal programs at Oko-Baba, Ilaje, Oko-Agbon, Abule-Nla, and Badia for improved WaSH and living conditions for sustainable service delivery and healthy slum settlements.

AB  - The actual corporate environment, reflecting the concept of Industry 4.0, requires managers and leaders with specific leadership qualifies. These qualifies capture importance in a security environment, especially in the army. Paper deals with the topic of psychophysical condition identification of individual applicants in solving stress situations of the security environment. Research of the psychophysical condition was done in the simulated situation of increased psychophysical stress during courses with X-tream methodology application X-tream methodology helps to monitor the qualities and potentials of individuals in hard and dangerous contexts. The research sample consists of 286 of course participants, working on managerial and commander positions. The main aim of the paper is to define an indicator of the psychophysical condition by the usage of objective pacification parameters and organism regeneration. Due application of factor analysis two factors with the calming-down trend after physical drain were gained. From both factors, only one reached an acceptable value of Cronbach's alpha ratio. Monitoring and evaluation of the relationship between change trends of the psychophysical condition and human activities in stress situations could serve as a base for choice, preparing and personal development.

AB  - A trial was undertaken of two techniques for assessing the physical condition of walking tracks (trails) over extended distances. A distance-based technique, in which categorical measurements were made at regular spatial intervals, proved to be sufficiently reliable to warrant further development. A refined version of this technique was developed, incorporating an assessment of environmental conditions, and its efficiency and precision were assessed.
   The technique is likely to be suitable for use in any areas where walking track and environmental conditions are broadly similar to those that occur in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. It may also be suitable for use in other environments, but it would be prudent to conduct additional trials to assess its precision and reliability. Sampling at 20 m intervals, the technique can be used to assess typically 5-7 km of track per day in remote areas. Under western Tasmanian conditions, estimates of the spatial extent of specified categories of impact, derived from 100 sampling points, are accurate at a 95% confidence level to within 10%. The estimates can be applied in a Limits of Acceptable Change management framework and used as the basis for ongoing monitoring of track conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents an assessment of the ecological conditions of various small and medium-sized lowland watercourses of Lower Silesia, determined in part by using aquatic macrophytes as biological indicators of the health and condition of such watercourses. Research was based on the German PHYLIB system (The German Assessment for Macrophytes and Phytobenthos), which determines ecological status based on the RI index (Reference Index). Field studies were conducted during 2007-08 on various watercourses. Research included identifying the species of aquatic macrophytes found in the streambed, as well as determining the degree of coverage; on this basis the RI index was calculated. We found the ecological status of most of the tested sections to be defined either as poor (Class 4) or moderate (Class 3). Research found that the type of streambed had little effect on the number of aquatic macrophyte species or on the ecological condition of the watercourse. We observed that time played a critical role in affecting these indicators, especially over the period that elapsed from the moment when human technical interference was first observed.

AB  - In central Nigeria the Fluviovolcanic Series of the Jos Plateau are composed by deeply weathered volcanic rocks and sediments. The sequence is often capped by ferricretes. Ferricretes, remains of former soils, are also intercalated in the series. Profile sections between two ferricretes are deep (> 10 m). The repeated saprolite/solum sequence sometimes exceeds 100 m. It can be separated into a lower section without bauxitisation, but often with total bleaching of the saprolite, a middle section with bauxite and hematite in the saprolite and an upper kaolinitic section with hematite and goethite.
   Bleaching by total removal of Fe2+ and bauxitisation by total desilification are both indicators of wet and hot climates with a high biomass production. In the first case the groundwater was permanently high, in the latter a well drained fluctuating groundwater can be assumed. Changing groundwater conditions may be the result of plateau uplift.
   Paleoenvironmental changes are, thus, reflected in relatively datable paleosols. Undatable paleosoils with comparable characteristics on the planation surfaces of Central and Northeast Nigeria also result from paleoenvironmental conditions. Consequently, concepts of landscape evolution must take into account changing environments.

AB  - Underwater visual monitoring methods are used broadly to evaluate coral reef conditions in the natural environment, but quantitative measurements of the coral holobiont has been largely restricted to photophysiological assessment of the endosymbionts. An underwater respirometer has been designed to make routine, diver-operated, non-invasive measurements at coral surfaces, but the realistic in situ accuracy and precision capabilities of this device has not been critically assessed; an essential step if these measurements are to be useful for quantifying spatial and seasonal patterns of coral metabolism. We developed specific protocols for this system to survey shallow coral colonies and detect metabolic profiles (respiration, photosynthesis, and biocalcification), diel cycles (day and night), and photosynthesis-irradiance curves. Analysis of data from in situ and laboratory-controlled conditions showed good replication among coral colonies and high precision measurements of temperature, oxygen and pH fluxes over 15-min incubation times without noticeable detrimental effects on coral health. Moreover, marked differences were observed in coral calcification rates between estuarine-influenced and coastal marine conditions, despite the absence of significant differences in visual appearance or other health indicators, revealing the system's potential for early detection of marginally adverse conditions for coral metabolism. Its ease of operation and rapid quantification of the physiological status of the corals make this respirometer well suited for use by reef scientists, monitoring agencies, and stakeholders in biogenic reefs conservation efforts. Moreover, the high spatial and temporal resolution of these underwater respirometer data will have the potential to discriminate the effects of local stressors on coral health from those generated by broader changes associated with climate drivers.

AB  - In forest ecosystems, soil water availability is an important indicator and driver of biogeochemical transformations, pedogenesis, and surface water-groundwater linkages. Given the importance of soil moisture and shallow groundwater to ecosystem processes, field measurements are critical. We investigated the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of moisture conditions in a forested first-order watershed in northern Michigan. We measured soil volumetric water content (VWC, %) and water table levels across a range of glacial parent materials and landforms. We also assessed the utility of using two different spatial frameworks (Landscape Ecosystem classification, Topographic Wetness Index) to represent spatial patterns of soil moisture and water table levels across the watershed. At the lowest landscape position (outwash-lake plain swamp), saturation was perennial, with a median soil VWC of 53% and the water table 8 cm below ground surface. Among upland ecosystems, outwash landforms had consistently low VWC (16%) and showed no evidence of groundwater within 4 m of the surface; moraine ecosystems (till parent material) possessed mixed hydrologic conditions, with VWC ranging from 18 to 25% and water table levels 6 to 65 cm below the surface. In low-variability dry or wet areas with relatively homogenous soils, larger ecosystem classification map units provide good representations of moisture conditions. In the more heterogeneous till soils, a finer-scale spatial framework that accounts for local soil variation is optimal. A combination of both spatial frameworks is most appropriate for estimating moisture conditions in this glaciated landscape and can be used to identify biogeochemically important sites and to inform land management decisions.

AB  - The unifying nature of water on the preservation of organic archaeological and palaeoenvironmental source material within wet deposits is well recognized. It is also understood that, while the preservation of such deposits is fundamental towards our understanding of the past, in many areas de-watering through agricultural drainage and water abstraction is degrading them. Within the framework of preservation in situ such environments present considerable challenges. Fundamentally, the environmental dynamics of wetlands, not least of water, mean that they must be monitored carefully in order to understand the condition of the burial environment and thereby the likely preservation potential. This paper presents an approach to monitoring the saturation of the burial environment and modelling this data using a geographical information system (GIS). It demonstrates a method aimed at modelling the conditions of current preservation, and predictively modelling the conditions for long-term, in situ preservation in order to provide a baseline for resource management. It is shown that the quantification of saturation is possible and advantageous in the management of dynamic wetland environments.

AB  - Based on a set of reference indicators, a tool was designed for the evaluation "ex post" of sustainability of units of managed natural forests in Costa Rica. This set was developed using a hierarchical structure of principles, criteria and indicators of sustainability. The resulting reference list consists of 5 principles, 12 criteria and 30 indicators, classified as essential by a group of experts in forest management in Costa Rica. The set of indicators allows studying the dimensions and attributes that delimit the sustainability of the ecosystems. The selection procedure and the likely contribution of this set to forest management addresses, firstly, the economic, social, ecosystemic and institutional conditions of Costa Rica. However, the set of indicators is useful for other regions of the world, previous adaptation of the threshold values to the local conditions of the ecosystem. Additionally, the ecosystemic dimension (productivity, stability, adaptability) is ratified as a condition of first order for the sustainability, but the experts reinforce the idea that the institutional dimension (equity and governance) is a challenge for the evaluation of sustainability.

AB  - A model of canopy resistance r(c) is presented for the determination of actual crop evapotranspiration using the Penman-Monteith type of model at hourly and daily scales. Here r(c) is deduced from weather variables (net radiation, air temperature and humidity, and wind speed) and by an indicator of the crop water status measured on the plants: the predawn leaf water potential (i.e., measured before dawn). The model needs a calibration "per crop" and not "per site"; that is, once it is calibrated for a given crop in a certain locality, then it can be used anywhere without further calibration. The model was tested on sorghum crops in different water conditions at two sites in southern Italy for several years. The results showed that it performs well at hourly, daily, and seasonal scales. In fact, the difference between the cumulative values of the actual evapotranspiration measured and the one calculated by the model ranges between -9% and +11%. We concluded that it is not sensitive to climate and soil type or to crop species and variety.

AB  - [1] A threshold criterion for incipient motion of cohesive-adhesive sediments, based on moment balance and dimensional considerations, is here developed. The criterion discriminates between single particles and flocs critical conditions and induces a modification to the traditional Shields curve, commonly adopted for noncohesive particles. This modification is particularly effective for the smaller size particles but tending to vanish for the larger ones. The proposed approach is validated on the basis of experiments performed on sediment cores, sampled at different depths, from seven lakes with different trophic conditions and organic matter content. The incipient motion conditions are evaluated by means of an original procedure based on image analysis techniques, which enables the entrainment between single particles and flocs to be distinguished. The adhesion force, which is mainly due to the biological activity at the sediment water interface, is estimated following the proposed criterion and it is found to depend on the organic matter content. In particular the cores sampled in the littoral photic zone are characterized by a bell shaped dependence between adhesion coefficient and organic matter content, which is typical for indicators of biological activity of the littoral ecosystems.

AB  - Fatty acids (FAs) and theirmetrics have been used to detect and assess the impacts of urbanization and agriculture on aquatic ecosystems. Here, we investigated whether seston FAs are also useful to characterize and understand early-stage aquaculture impacts in a large tropical reservoir (Furnas Reservoir, SE Brazil). We tested the hypothesis that single FAs, as well as selected FA metrics in the seston fraction, are efficient markers of net-cage fish farming effects. In general, fish farming had only minor effects on standard water chemical variables, mainly small increases in ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations. By increasing concentrations of several polyunsaturated FAs, early-stage fish farming improved sestonic food quality in themore oligotrophic branch of the reservoir under drought conditions. However, in general, increases in concentrations of bacterial FAs, due to fish farming, suggested organicmatter (OM) subsidies from non-ingested and non-assimilated fish feed. In themore eutrophic reservoir branch, seston FA profiles suggested that fish farming caused an increase of low-quality food resources, such as cyanobacteria. Thus, background impact levels may determine the biochemical responses of tropical reservoirs to fish farming. Higher contributions of potentially sewage-derived and bacterial FAs during drought conditions, especially at reference sites of the more oligotrophic branch, suggested that drought shifted OM inputs towards anthropogenic sources, thereby overwriting land-use related differences between reservoir branches and homogenizing their environmental conditions. In conclusion, FA variables were useful to evaluate and understand environmental conditions, aswell as the effects of early-stage fish farming and drought, and should be considered in impact assessments in tropical lentic ecosystems.

AB  - Both earthworms and terrestrial isopods have been used to evaluate the quality of contaminated soil by NPs. However, most experiments have been conducted in the laboratory and under greenhouse conditions. Besides, little is known of Fe accumulation in earthworms from iron NPs (Fe NPs) under natural conditions. Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of manufactured NPs on the accumulation of Fe in macroinvertebrates from forest soil. Our results revealed that earthworms consume low amounts of Fe in a concentration of 1000 mg Fe NPs kg(-1) of dry soil, with a behavior constant over time. Besides, we observed that earthworms could not detect Fe at low concentrations (1 or 10 mg Fe NPs kg(-1)), so they do not limit soil consumption, which translates into high amounts of Fe in their bodies. By contrast, the content of Fe in organisms is inversely proportional to increasing concentrations in the soil (R-2 = -0.41, p < 0.05). Therefore, although studies are needed, in addition to considering environmental factors and the physicochemical properties of the soil, endogenous worms in the evaluated area could, under natural conditions, be useful to inform us of contamination of NP manufactured from Faith. Besides, for future research, a novel methodology should be considered to demonstrate more realistic avoidance behavior under field conditions.

AB  - Marine environmental legislation is increasingly expressing a need to consider the quality of pelagic habitats. This paper uses the European Union marine strategy framework to explore the concept of good environmental status (GES) of pelagic habitat with the aim to build a wider understanding of the issue. Pelagic ecosystems have static, persistent and ephemeral features, with manageable human activities primarily impacting the persistent features. The paper explores defining the meaning of "good", setting boundaries to assess pelagic habitat and the challenges of considering habitat biodiversity in a moving medium. It concludes that for pelagic habitats to be in GES and able to provide goods and services to humans, three conditions should be met: (i) all species present under current environmental conditions should be able to find the pelagic habitats essential to close their life cycles; (ii) biogeochemical regulation is maintained at normal levels; (iii) critical physical dynamics and movements of biota and water masses at multiple scales are not obstructed. Reference points for acceptable levels of each condition and how these may change over time in line with prevailing oceanographic conditions, should be discussed by knowledge brokers, managers and stakeholders. Managers should think about a habitat hydrography rather than a habitat geography. Setting the bounds of the habitats requires a consideration of dimension, scale and gradients. It is likely that to deal with the challenges caused by a dynamic environment and the relevance of differing spatial and temporal scales, we will need to integrate multidisciplinary empirical data sets with spatial and temporal models to assess and monitor progress towards, or displacement from GES of the pelagic habitat.

AB  - Floristic quality assessments (FQA) using floristic quality indices (FQIs) are useful tools for assessing and comparing vegetation communities and related habitat condition. However, intensive vegetation surveys requiring significant time and technical expertise are necessary, which limits the use of FQIs in environmental monitoring programs. This study modified standard FQI methods to develop a rapid assessment method for characterizing and modeling change in wetland habitat condition in the northern Everglades. Method modifications include limiting vegetation surveys to a subset of taxa selected as indicators of impact and eliminating richness and/or abundance factors from the equation. These modifications reduce the amount of time required to complete surveys and minimizes misidentification of species, which can skew results. The habitat characterization and assessment tool (HCAT) developed here is a FQA that uses a modified FQI to detect and model changes in habitat condition based on vegetation communities, characterize levels of impact as high, moderate, or low, provide predictive capabilities for assessing natural resource management or water management operation alternatives, and uniquely links a FQI with readily accessible environmental data. For application in the northern Everglades, surface water phosphorus concentrations, specific conductivity, distance from canal, and days since dry (5-year average) explained 67% of the variability in the dataset with > 99.9% confidence. The HCAT approach can be used to monitor, assess, and evaluate habitats with the objective of informing management decisions (e.g., as a screening tool) to maximize conservation and restoration of protected areas and is transferable to other wetlands with additional modification.

AB  - Land-use type under different topographic conditions and human activities affects soil development. We investigated the effects of land-use, topography and human activity on soil classification changes in the Toshan watershed in northern Iran. Seven representative pedons derived from loess parent materials were studied on different land-uses and topographic positions. The studied pedons in forest (FO) on backslopes and footslope were classified as Calcic Haploxeralfs and Typic Haploxeralfs, respectively. The soils in abandoned lands (AB) and orchards (OR), where formerly under natural forests, located on the shoulder and backslopes positions were classified as Calcic Haploxeralfs and Vertic Haploxeralfs, respectively. Well-developed argillic horizons as indicators for higher degrees of soil evolution were observed in more-stable areas under the natural forest or less disturbed areas. Clay lessivage through these soil profiles have led to formation of Typic or Calcic Haploxeralfs, while under croplands (CP) were classified as Typic Calcixerepts. Conversion of sloping deforested areas to CP along with inappropriate management have accelerated soil erosion, resulting in unstable conditions in which decalcification and formation of developed soils cannot occur. Paddy cultivation in flat areas has caused to reduced conditions and formation of Typic Haplaquepts. Because of unfavorable conditions for chemical weathering (e.g. lower water retention compared to more-stable areas) no vermiculite was detected in the CP. The results showed that evolution and classification of the studied soils were strongly affected by land-use type, topography and management.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM), leaf litter, and root material of an Ultisol from the tropical rainforest of Kakamega, Kenya, were analyzed for stable carbon (delta(13)C) and nitrogen (delta(15)N) isotopic values as well as total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents in order to determine trends in SOM decomposition within a very well-developed soil under tropical conditions. In addition, we quantified mineralogy and chemistry of the inorganic soil fraction. Clay mineralogical variation with depth was small and the abundance of kaolin indicates intense weathering and pedoturbation under humid tropical conditions. The soil chemistry was dominated by silica, aluminium, and iron with calcium, potassium, and magnesium as minor constituents. The relative depletion of base cations compared with silica and aluminium is an indicator for intense weathering and leaching conditions over long periods of time. Depth profiles of delta(13)C and delta(15)N showed a distinct enrichment trend down profile with a large (average (13)DeltaC = 5.0%. and average (15)DeltaN = 6.3%) and abrupt offset within the uppermost 1020 cm of the soil. Isotopic enrichment with depth is commonly observed in soil profiles and has been attributed to fractionation during decomposition. However, isotopic offsets within soil profiles that exceed 3% are usually interpreted as a recent change from C-4 to C-3 dominated vegetation, We argue that the observed isotopic depth profiles along with data from mineralogy and chemistry of the inorganic fraction from the Kakamega Forest soil are a result of intense weathering and high organic matter turnover rates under humid, tropical conditions.

AB  - Thewinter ecology of anadromous Arctic charr, an important fish species for Indigenous populations, has remained poorly detailed in the literature beyond descriptions of seasonal fasting and resulting declines in condition. However, prolonged periods of reduced feeding can have significant consequences for other variables, such as tissue contaminant levels. To more thoroughly detail seasonal changes, biological information (fork length, total weight, age, sex, somatic condition), stable isotopes (delta 13C, % carbon, delta 15N, % nitrogen), dorsal muscle % lipid, caloric densities, and totalmercury (THg) concentrationswere assessed in anadromous Arctic charr collected fromDeception Bay, Canada, during the summer and over-wintering periods. Significant reductions in somatic condition, total weight, and % nitrogen, consistent with prolonged periods of fasting, were found for post-winter captured Arctic charr, but % lipid and caloric densities were significantly higher in these fish. THg also varied seasonally and was significantly higher in summer collected tissue. When tested individually via linear regression, significant relationshipswere seasonally dependent, but limited in number. All previously mentioned parameterswere then incorporated intomulti-variablemodelswhich better explained variations in the data. While therewas no clear bestmodel for explaining the % lipid values, caloric densities, and THg, season, condition, and stable isotope values (% carbon and % nitrogen) were the best indicators of % lipid content and caloric densities. THg concentrations were best explained by total weight, somatic condition, and delta 13C. Seasonal variation in fish conditionmeasures and THgmay be indicative of condition selectivemortality that yields apparent improvement through the disproportionate removal of poorer conditioned fish fromthe population during the over-wintering period. This hypothesiswas further supported by mortality estimates and the results of the multi-predictor variable models. Collectively, this research highlights the importance of understanding seasonal dynamics for anadromous Arctic charr populations. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biological potential of conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove micropollutants mainly depends on process conditions and the predominant microbial community. To explore this dependence and to connect the occurrence of genera with operating conditions, five pilot-scale reactors with different process conditions were combined into two reactor cascades and fed with the effluent of the primary clarifier of a municipal WWTP. All reactors and the WWTP were analyzed for the removal of 33 micropollutants by LC-MS/MS and the presence of the microbial community using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The overall removal of the micropollutants was slightly improved (ca. 20%) by the reactor cascades in comparison to the WWTP while certain compounds such as diatrizoate, venlafaxine or diclofenac showed an enhanced removal (ca. 70% in one or both cascades). To explore the diverse bacteria in more detail, the general community was divided into a core and a specialized community. Despite their profoundly different operating parameters (especially redox conditions), the different treatments share a core community consisted of 143 genera (9% of the overall community). Furthermore, the alpha- and beta-biodiversity as well as the occurrence of several genera belonging to the specialized microbial community could be linked to the prevalent process conditions of the individual treatments. Members of the specialized community also correlated with the removal of certain groups of micro pollutants. Hence, the comparison of the specialized community with micropollutant removal and operating conditions via correlation analysis is a valuable tool for an extended evaluation of prevalent process conditions. Based on an extended data set this approach could also be used to identify organisms as indicators for operating conditions which are beneficial for an improved removal of specific micropollutants.

AB  - Across mammals, cues of developmental support, such as touching, licking or attentiveness, stimulate neural development, behavioural exploration and even overall body growth. Why should such fitness-related traits be so sensitive to developmental conditions? Here, we review what we term the 'developmental support hypothesis', a potential adaptive explanation of this plasticity. Neural development can be a costly process, in terms of time, energy and exposure. However, environmental variability may sometimes compromise parental care during this costly developmental period. We propose this environmental variation has led to the evolution of adaptive plasticity of neural and behavioural development in response to cues of developmental support, where neural development is stimulated in conditions that support associated costs. When parental care is compromised, offspring grow less and adopt a more resilient and stress-responsive strategy, improving their chances of survival in difficult conditions, similar to existing ideas on the adaptive value of early-life programming of stress. The developmental support hypothesis suggests new research directions, such as testing the adaptive value of reduced neural growth and metabolism in stressful conditions, and expanding the range of potential cues animals may attend to as indicators of developmental support. Considering evolutionary and ecologically appropriate cues of social support also has implications for promoting healthy neural development in humans.

AB  - A comprehensive approach to assess conditions in the Great Lakes nearshore has been lacking for decades. We conducted a pilot survey in Lake Erie (45 sites) in summer 2009. The US National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA) was then conducted across the Great Lakes in summer 2010. The NCCA survey design provided statistically based estimates with defined uncertainty bounds for a variety of ecological indicators. For example, water quality (WQ) was measured (233 sampled sites) in the US nearshore, a resource defined with criteria to include waters to 30 m depth and less than 5 km from shore. A sub-resource of the US nearshore (151 separate sample sites) was defined using geometric criteria along the shoreline to identify small to medium embayment areas. Statistical analyses showed that embayments had higher Total Phosphorus and were more turbid than the open nearshore. We explored spatial variability in WQ results (2009, 2010) through regression analyses at multiple scales (within and across lakes) for nearshore and embayment resources. Empirical modeling identified principal drivers of spatial variability as risk factors for enrichment: water column depth and a landscape disturbance metric representing agricultural intensity as an indicator of watershed nutrient loading. Eutrophic nearshore conditions occurred at the upper end of an associated landscape disturbance gradient across watersheds of the US basin, peaking in Lake Erie. Overall results were consistent with the principles of classical limnology theory and demonstrated that a statistical survey approach can contribute to Great Lakes nearshore assessment and research.

The development of this Great lakes coastal frame and survey design/analysis has been aided by a strong commitment to include the Great Lakes in the national assessment over almost a decade, of individuals in the EPA's Office of Research and Development (Tony Olsen and Tom Kinkaid, Western Ecology Division; John Macauley, Gulf Ecology Division; John Kiddon, Atlantic Ecology Division) and Office of Water (Barry Burgan and Greg Colianni). Others in EPA's Office of Water have been instrumental in supporting the Great Lakes development, including Sarah Lehmann, Treda Greyson-Smith, and at Region 5/GLNPO (Paul Horvatin, Mari Nord, Paul Bertram, Elizabeth Hinchey-Malloy). The survey design was done by Tony Olsen and Tom Kincaid, who each assisted with some statistical analyses. Numerous colleagues from the Mid-Continent Ecology Division assisted with fieldwork in 2009, including Jon Van Alstine, Tim Corry, Greg Peterson, Joel Hoffman, Mike Knuth, Sam Miller, David Miller, John Morrice, and summer students Andrew Just, Aisha Beaty, and Emily Bradshaw. We acknowledge especially Glenn Warren and Paul Horvatin (GLNPO) for providing time on the R/V Lake Guardian. Tom Hollenhorst of MED assisted with organizing the GLEI landscape stressor data sets.

AB  - Managing protected areas involves balancing the enjoyment of visitors with the protection of a variety of cultural and biophysical resources. Tourism pressures in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) are creating concerns about how to strike this balance in a marine environment. Terrestrial-based research has led to conceptual planning and management frameworks that address issues of human use and resource protection. The limits of acceptable change (LAC) framework was used as a conceptual basis for a study of snorkeling at reef sites in the GBRWHA. The intent was to determine if different settings existed among tourism operators traveling to the reef and, if so, to identify specific conditions relating to those settings. Snorkelers (N = 1475) traveling with tourism operations of different sizes who traveled to different sites completed surveys. Results indicated that snorkelers who traveled with larger operations (more people and infrastructure) differed from those traveling with smaller operations (few people and little on-site infrastructure) on benefits received and in the way that specific conditions influenced their enjoyment. Benefits related to nature, escape, and family helped to define reef experiences. Conditions related to coral, fish, and operator staff had a positive influence on the enjoyment of most visitors but, number of people on the trip and site infrastructure may have the greatest potential as setting indicators. Data support the potential usefulness of visitor input in applying the IAC concept to a marine environment where tourism and recreational uses are rapidly changing.

AB  - Enlightened forest management requires reliable information on the status and condition of each forest - interpreted from a broad context - and of change in forest conditions over time. The process of forest planning must begin with a clear statement of goals, from which detailed objectives and management plans follow. Goals and objectives for forest management should reflect the conservation value of a forest relative to other forests of the same general type. This paper reviews some recent assessments (with emphasis on North America), presents a framework for forest assessment and monitoring, and suggests some indicators of biodiversity in forests. Among the broad assessments of forest status and conservation value are a global 'forest frontiers' assessment by the World Resources Institute, gap analysis projects that assess the level of representation of forests and other communities in protected areas, and ecoregion-based conservation assessments conducted by the World Wildlife Fund. Also important is information on change in forest area and condition over time. Among the common changes in forests over the past two centuries are loss of old forests, simplification of forest structure, decreasing size of forest patches, increasing isolation of patches, disruption of natural fire regimes, and increased road building, all of which have had negative effects on native biodiversity. These trends can be reversed, or at least slowed, through better management. Progress toward forest recovery can be measured through the use of ecological indicators that correspond to the specific conditions and trends of concern. Although there is a wealth of indicators to choose from, most have been poorly tested and require rigorous validation in order to be interpreted with confidence. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - During last decades, the natural vegetation cover in southern Tunisia, mainly dominated by dwarf and sparse shrub, was continuously disturbed under various human activities especially on sandy soil (easily eroded). The ecological characteristics (soil structure and texture, vegetation, topography...) of sandy steppes, with Rhanterium suaveolens Desf., enhanced their sharp decline. This study aims to investigate the vegetation status of two R.suaveolens steppes (R: protected; r: degraded) under different conditions in five sites belonging to southern Tunisia using the quadrat point method and some ecological indicators. Main results show that vegetation cover is related to climatic conditions. Plant density is mainly affected by rainfall and human activities. The annual and perennial density and cover are high during the rainy season (spring) compared with the dry one (fall). The degraded steppes (r) are mainly dominated by annual plants but the protected steppes (R) contain more perennials. This work can be very useful for the sustainable sandy steppes management under different stress and human disturbances in dry area. It presents a great national and international importance (economic, social, nature conservation...) such as job creation and limiting rural exodus.

AB  - Aims The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of temperature, mixing and sunlight exposure on the 5-day survival of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp., F+/male-specific coliphages, somatic coliphages and Clostridium perfringens spores in an 80/20 blend of surface water and reclaimed water approved for potable reuse in North Carolina. Methods and Results Grab samples of tertiary treated, dual disinfected North Carolina 'Type 2' reclaimed water were collected and mixed with ambient surface waters to create the 80/20 mix and then spiked with naturally occurring organisms present in the blended water or organisms isolated from sewage. Organism survival over the 5-day period was evaluated at 4 and 20 degrees C, 0, 60 and 120 rev min(-1) mixing speeds and exposure to sunlight or darkness. The log(10) survival ratio was then calculated for each organism at each condition. Conclusions There were measurable differences between the log(10) survival ratios at 5 days for most organisms; indicating that storage can decrease microbial concentrations. Mixing conditions were not a significant factor in microbe survival over the 5-day storage period. Sunlight was the most effective treatment factor to decrease log(10) survival during 5-day storage.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: No previous studies have evaluated the survival of micro-organisms in the NC approved 80/20 blend of surface and reclaimed water over the 5-day storage. This study provides the first results on the survival of regulated faecal indicator organisms stored for 5 days in blended water under different environmental conditions.

AB  - Current regulatory protocols for assessing herbicide effects on plants rely heavily on the use of crops grown under controlled greenhouse conditions to indicate risks to wild vegetation. Guideline test protocols call for low levels of soil nutrients, approximately 3 % organic matter (OM), to test the worst-case scenario for non-target species growing in poor soils. However, species sensitivity to herbicides may be affected by growing conditions, especially soil nutrient levels. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of high and low soil OM content on the sensitivity of plants to several common agricultural herbicides (glyphosate, chlorimuron ethyl and dicamba). Ten plant species (wild and crop) with high (nitrophilous) or low (non-nitrophilous) affinity for nitrogen were grown under greenhouse conditions in soil with two levels of OM (3 and 9 %) and were exposed to seven doses of the three herbicides in concurrent experiments. Results showed that most species were more sensitive to glyphosate under high OM conditions while chlorimuron ethyl and dicamba results were mixed with respect to OM levels. Overall, 15 species-herbicide combinations were more sensitive in high OM soil, while 11 were more sensitive in low OM soil. No clear pattern in sensitivity emerged among nitrophilous and non-nitrophilous species. Several species showed a difference in response at herbicide levels expected to reach non-target habitats adjacent to crop fields through drift (5 % commonly and 25 % occasionally). In terms of regulatory testing, guidelines may need alteration to allow testing with nutrient levels that more accurately reflect natural environments.

AB  - The sensory, microbiological and physicochemical attributes of fresh meat stored at 5 and 15 degreesC were affected by the combined effect of volatile compounds of oregano essential oil and modified atmosphere packaging conditions (40% CO2/30% N-2/30% O-2, 100% CO2, 80% CO2/20% air, vacuum pack and air). It was found that the extension of shelf life of meat samples depended on the packaging conditions and augmented in the order: air< vacuum pack< 40% CO2/30%N-2/30% O-2<80% CO2/ 20% air< 100% CO2. Longer shelf life was observed in samples supplemented with the volatile compounds of oregano essential oil and stored under the same packaging conditions mentioned above. The extension of shelf life may be due to the synergistic effect of volatile compounds of oregano essential oil and the modified atmosphere packaging used on the microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of meat. Indeed, both these hurdles can prolong and delay microbial growth or suppress the final counts of the spoilage microorganisms in comparison with the 'control' samples. The effect of essential oil volatile compounds was even more pronounced on the physicochemical changes of meat samples caused by microbial association. Oregano essential oil delayed glucose and lactate consumption, both indicators of meat spoilage aerobically as well as under 40% CO2/30% N-2/30% O-2, and 100% CO2. Finally, changes in other metabolites such as formic acid were also observed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to which 196 countries including the UK are contracting parties, set out 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets to be met by 2020. Elements of Aichi Target 11 call for at least 17% of terrestrial land and inland water to be protected and effectively managed by 2020. Each national government is requested to report progress against this goal in national reports submitted at intervals to the CBD, and these are used as the basis of reporting towards the 17% target. Figures reported for the UK's protected area coverage are inclusive of a wide range of levels of designation, management and condition. Here, we examine the protection given to sites under UK legislation and designations as a case study. We find that although 28% of UK land is reported by the UK government to be protected, only 11.4% of land area falls within protected areas designated primarily for nature conservation. Condition monitoring indicates that at most 43-51% of protected areas in the UK are currently in favourable condition, which sug-gests as little as 4.9% of UK land area may be effectively protected for nature. However, estimates of protected area coverage vary greatly depending on the types of protected areas considered 'effectively protected' as measured by management category and site condition. Taking the UK as an example of a country that has reportedly met the target, we suggest that global progress may have been overestimated, and that future targets and indicators need to focus on the quality as well as quantity of protected areas.

AB  - Background: Low field NMR has been used to investigate water status in various plant tissues. In plants grown in controlled conditions, the method was shown to be able to monitor leaf development as it could detect slight variations in senescence associated with structural modifications in leaf tissues. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the potential of NMR to provide robust indicators of the leaf development stage in plants grown in the field, where leaves may develop less evenly due to environmental fluctuations. The study was largely motivated by the need to extend phenotyping investigations from laboratory experiments to plants in their natural environment.
   Methods: The mobile NMR laboratory was developed, enabling characterization of oilseed rape leaves throughout the canopy without uprooting the plant. The measurements made on the leaves of plants grown and analyzed in the field were compared to the measurements on plants grown in controlled conditions and analyzed in the laboratory.
   Results: The approach demonstrated the potential of the method to assess the physiological status of leaves of plants in their natural environment. Comparing changes in the patterns of NMR signal evolution in plants grown under well-controlled laboratory conditions and in plants grown in the field shows that NMR is an appropriate method to detect structural modifications in leaf tissues during senescence progress despite plant heterogeneity in natural conditions. Moreover, the specific effects of the environmental factors on the structural modifications were revealed.
   Conclusion: The present study is an important step toward the selection of genotypes with high tolerance to water or nitrogen depletion that will be enabled by further field applications of the method.

AB  - Reduction/oxidation (redox) conditions in 15 principal aquifer (PA) systems of the United States, and their impact on several water quality issues, were assessed from a large data base collected by the National Water-Quality Assessment Program of the USGS. The logic of these assessments was based on the observed ecological succession of electron acceptors such as dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate and threshold concentrations of these substrates needed to support active microbial metabolism. Similarly, the utilization of solid-phase electron acceptors such as Mn(IV) and Fe(III) is indicated by the production of dissolved manganese and iron. An internally consistent set of threshold concentration criteria was developed and applied to a large data set of 1692 water samples from the PAs to assess ambient redox conditions. The indicated redox conditions then were related to the occurrence of selected natural (arsenic) and anthropogenic (nitrate and volatile organic compounds) contaminants in ground water. For the natural and anthropogenic contaminants assessed in this study, considering redox conditions as defined by this framework of redox indicator species and threshold concentrations explained many water quality trends observed at a regional scale. An important finding of this study was that samples indicating mixed redox processes provide information on redox heterogeneity that is useful for assessing common water quality issues. Given the interpretive power of the redox framework and given that it is relatively inexpensive and easy to measure the chemical parameters included in the framework, those parameters should be included in routine water quality monitoring programs whenever possible.

AB  - Shallow coastal habitats are ruled by fluctuating environmental conditions, which lead to shifts in fish communities. Functional groups of habitat use and trophic strategy were used to address the responses of fish composition and diversity, since comparisons of rich tropical systems are often complex through species-based approaches. We hypothesized that fish groups will have specific affinities in response to the prevailing environmental conditions, especially those reflecting the prevalence of oceanic or estuarine conditions, where guilds of habitat use would perform better as indicators. Despite the importance of other environmental factors (i.e. temperature and transparency), salinity was the key structuring factor irrespective of the coastal lagoon. Although harbouring the greatest biomass of piscivores, the harsh environmental conditions at Araruama lagoon were related to low diversity. A great number of indicator species, typically of marine affinity, was found at the Saquarema lagoon, probably due to the continuous and broad connection to the sea leading to the predominance of euhaline conditions. Despite the presence of non-native species (i.e. Oreochromis niloticus), the Marica lagoon function as an important refuge for freshwater groups. Our results stressed the key role played by coastal lagoons of varied water conditions in supporting fish diversity at regional levels.

AB  - Length-weight relationships and relative condition factors were conducted to provide information on fish species' growth conditions and general well-being in the freshwater habitat. This study was conducted using fish as a bioindicator for the health of the ecosystem. Cyclocheilithys apogon (Beardless barb) and Notopterus notopterus (Bronze featherback) are the most dominant species in Subang Lake. A four-month sampling was conducted to collect the sample of Beardless barb and Bronze featherback. A total of 422 individuals of Beardless barb and 344 individuals of Bronze featherback were measured and weighed. The mean total length of Breadless barb was 13.11 +/- 1.31 cm with the mean weight of 31.88 +/- 9.93 g. The mean of the total length and weight of Bronze featherback was 16.05 +/- 2.07 cm and 30.38 +/- 15.63 g. Both fish species showed negative allometric growth with the exponent b value 2.884 and 2.886, respectively. The condition factor of Beardless barb (1.184 +/- 0.134) and Bronze featherback (1.010 +/- 0.163) obtained from this study reflects a fair growth condition based on K value by Barnham & Baxter (2003). Further studies need to be conducted to determine the significant impacts that affect fish species' growth conditions.

AB  - It has been proposed that, within flood-pulse systems, seasonally dynamic conditions promote extremely high levels of biodiversity. In this paper, we aim to understand how variation in environmental conditions and habitat availability, across space and time, influences the structure and composition of plankton diatom communities within the Tonle-Sap Lake (Cambodia) during two flood-pulse cycles. We hypothesize that (i) communities vary considerably across space and time, (ii) environmental filtering accounts for a substantial portion of the variation in community composition, and (iii) shifts in meta-community structure occur seasonally, due to variation in both environmental conditions and habitat availability. A principal component analysis and a permutational multivariate analysis of variance were used to characterize spatio-temporal variations in environmental conditions, community structure and composition. Determinants of community variations across space were identified by redundancy analyses and variation partitioning, while seasonal changes in meta-community structure were assessed by investigating temporal changes in beta-diversity. Our results indicate that (i) spatial variations in community structure and composition are largely influenced by the seasonal flood-pulse, (ii) environmental filtering is the most likely process driving the compositional changes, and (iii) changes in diatom life-form community provide insights into the hydrological functioning of the Tonle Sap. We conclude that the survey of diatom communities may constitute a relevant sensor of hydrological change in the system and could be used to derive regionally specific hypotheses about how global climate change is impacting the lake's functioning.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has caused drastic declines in the area and species richness of semi-natural grasslands across Europe. Novel habitats, such as power line clearings, provide alternative habitats and niches for grassland species, and might therefore mitigate these declines. However, it is not fully understood which environmental factors determine the occurrence of grassland species in the clearings. Identifying the most important drivers for grassland species occurrence would help understand the value of the clearings for grassland conservation and target enhanced management into clearings with most potential as grassland habitat. We studied the effects of local environmental conditions, and past and present connectivity to semi-natural grasslands, on the species richness of grassland plants and butterflies in 43 power line clearings in Finland. The results of generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning showed that increasing time since clear-cut and amount of clearing residue decreased the species richness of both species groups, while the cover of mesic habitats increased it. However, the two species groups showed also divergent responses. Present-day local environmental conditions appeared to be the sole driver of grassland butterfly species richness, whereas the richness of grassland plants was related both to current conditions and historical connectivity to grasslands in 1870-1880s. This suggests the presence of an extinction debt in the studied grassland plant communities, emphasizing the need for enhanced management to increase suitable grassland habitat in the clearings. This would diminish the potential future losses of grassland plant species in the clearings and create valuable habitat for grassland butterflies as well.

AB  - There is a growing interest in monitoring body condition of marine organisms in the context of the ecosystem approach to fisheries and global change. Fish condition is under the influence of environmental variability on seasonal scale, but also on longer timescales. It represents a good indicator of habitat quality or individual fitness, and is also a relevant parameter to evaluate energy transfer through the trophic chain. However, the sources of variability in fish condition need to be accurately understood and the significance of existing indices has to be correctly assessed. Here, we measured the energy density, a precise and global indicator of fish bioenergetic condition, for anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) in the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel, based on an extensive sampling design in 2014. First, we investigated the well documented relationship between percent dry mass and energy density, and showed that such relationship is species specific. Second, we observed distinct patterns in bioenergetic condition between anchovy and sardine. Both species display similar minimum values at size or age but maximum are significantly higher for sardine, reflecting a higher energy storage capacity that scales more strongly with size. Third, we confirmed the large seasonal variability in energy density of both species. In the Bay of Biscay, energy density values for anchovy and sardine (age 1 +) are 5.7 and 5.9 kJ g(-1) (wet weight) in spring and 6.8 and 7.9 kJ g(-1) in autumn, respectively. Our results revealed that fish from the English Channel display significantly higher energy density values in autumn (9.8 kJ g(-1) for anchovy and 10.5 kJ g(-1) for sardine) than those from the Bay of Biscay. When combined with size and weight at age it appears clearly that, after age 1, fish from the northern region display larger growth and energy reserves. This likely results from a higher zooplankton productivity in the English Channel or/and a selection pressure towards faster growing and faster reserve building individuals, to be able to survive a longer winter than in the Bay of Biscay. Finally, we described a dome shaped evolution of energy density with body size in case of sardine. Increase with size has been well documented but not the decrease at largest sizes. Several mechanisms may explain such a pattern, i.e. increasing investment in spawning, shift in diet or a metabolic trade-off between temperature and food availability, with regard to maintenance requirements.

AB  - Fluorimetric cell-based sensing methods have attracted increasing interest in toxicity testing of pharmaceuticals, pathogens, environmental pollutants, and other chemicals. The objective of this review is to summarise the variety of approaches reported up to now and to present recent developments in this area. The different approaches are described in relation to their underlying mechanism and, especially, to the role of the fluorophore involved. The methods discussed include the use of fluorescent or fluorogenic indicators, fluorescence-based testing for membrane integrity, approaches based on fluorescence labelling, inducible fluorescent protein expression, and analysis of cellular autofluorescence. Several of these approaches have been shown to be advantageous in comparison with non-fluorescence methods and have potential in high-throughput screening, for example in drug discovery and safety pharmacology.

AB  - The "Structural Health Monitoring" is a project supported by National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (Grant No. 50725828). To meet the urgent requirements of analysis and assessment of mass monitoring data of bridge environmental actions and structural responses, the monitoring of environmental actions and action effect modeling methods, dynamic performance monitoring and early warning methods, condition assessment and operation maintenance methods of key members are systematically studied in close combination with structural characteristics of long-span cablestayed bridges and suspension bridges. The paper reports the progress of the project as follows. (1) The environmental action modeling methods of long-span bridges are established based on monitoring data of temperature, sustained wind and typhoon. The action effect modeling methods are further developed in combination with the multi-scale baseline finite element modeling method for long-span bridges. (2) The identification methods of global dynamic characteristics and internal forces of cables and hangers for long-span cable-stayed bridges and suspension bridges are proposed using the vibration monitoring data, on the basis of which the condition monitoring and early warning methods of bridges are developed using the environmental-condition-normalization technique. (3) The analysis methods for fatigue loading effect of welded details of steel box girder, temperature and traffic loading effect of expansion joint are presented based on long-term monitoring data of strain and beam-end displacement, on the basis of which the service performance assessment and remaining life prediction methods are developed.

AB  - Vegetation Science is a scientific discipline devoted to the study of vegetation at all levels of complexity spanning populations, plant communities and biomes. It attempts to explain vegetation patterns and the processes governing vegetation assembly and dynamics in all temporal and spatial scales. Vegetation analysis serves to record anthropo-zoogenic effects and portrays similarly structured vegetation formations with characteristic vegetation complexes and plant communities. These plant communities consist of recognisable and reproducible associations of plant types which are subject to natural laws under the same ecological conditions. Wherever one finds similar habitat conditions in comparable bioregions or floristic zones on the planet, similar communities exist and can be typified. Such determinative plant community-habitat-type systems possess high bioindicator value for different biotic and abiotic habitat conditions. The floristic compositions and structure of plant communities and biotope-types can be categorised, and such vegetation units can be abstracted as elementary types, marked by their characteristic species combination under certain habitat-dependent conditions. Phytosociology provides the scientific background and method to address these questions. It was established by Josias Braun-Blanquet (Braun-Blanquet J. 1918. Eine pflanzengeographische Exkursion durch Unterengadin und in den schweizerischen Nationalpark. Beitr Geobot Landesaufnahme 4: 1-80.) and promoted for example in Germany by Reinhold Tuxen (Tuxen R. 1937. Die Pflanzengesellschaften Nord-Westdeutschlands. Mitt. Flor. Soz. Arbeitsgemein. Nieders. 3, Hannover, 170 p.). The Flora-Fauna-Habitat-Guideline (FFH-Natura 2000), enacted on 21 May 1992 established homogenous criteria for endangered biotypes throughout Europe, founded on a modern phytosociological basis. Phytosociological terminology also forms the basis of biotype-differentiation in the UNESCO Convention on Biodiversity (COP9). Vegetation science is a socially and politically critical discipline, serving to benefit and progress human society and sustainable usage of its natural resources.

AB  - The effect of the quality of two microalgal species on select biological and biochemical responses used as indicators of pollution were assessed. Mussels were conditioned for 6 weeks with the diatom Chaetoceros neogracile and the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa triquetra, chosen for being two clearly different types of primary production quality that differ in both biometric and biochemical characteristics. After dietary conditioning, the mussels were exposed to a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, fluoranthene (FLU), for 1 week followed by 1 week of depuration. Results showed higher FLU accumulation in mussels fed on C neogracile compared to those fed on H. triquetra. Concomitantly, a greater impact of this toxicant was observed in the biomarker responses of mussels fed on C. neogracile. These mussels showed an increase in the percentage of dead hemocytes, an activation of phagocytosis and ROS production of hemocytes after exposure. Some enzymatic activities also increased upon FLU exposure (superoxide dismutase -SOD-, catalase -CAT-, and glutathione reductases -GR-) and after depuration (glutathione-s-transferase -GST-). Results suggest that FLU exposure as well as food quality influence biomarker responses, with higher values of SOD, CAT and GR in non-exposed mussels fed on C. neogracile. In addition, upon exposure to the same FLU concentration, GR response varied according to dietary conditioning, suggesting that diet could act as a confounding factor in biomarker responses to pollution. Consequently, trophic conditions should be considered in marine pollution monitoring programs for a better interpretation of biomarker responses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work presents a methodology to assess the environmental potential risk of soils when submitted to different conditions. The potentially toxic element (PTE) behaviour was evaluated by single chemical extractions in order to simulate four conditions: PTEs leaching under actual rainfall conditions; acid mine drainage; and an anoxic and an oxic environment. Soil pollution assessment was carried out using the contamination factor (CF) and the pollution load index (PLI) for total contents and indicators of mobility were established for each extraction: natural mobility indicator (NMI), acid mine drainage mobility indicator (AMI), oxic mobility indicator (OMI) and anoxic mobility indicator (ANMI). The total PTE content in the samples was high, and this content decreased when the distance of the sampling site to the source of contamination increased. The results obtained after the extractions suggested that the highest PTE content was extracted in the acidic medium. The mineralogical composition is an important factor that should be taken into account in the evaluation of PTE mobility, firstly because the mineral phases react differently in the proposed situations depending on their chemical nature, and secondly, because the presence of a particular phase (with different degree of reactivity) depends on the degree of weathering. The most reactive materials under oxic conditions are, in the study area, the most modern. The proposed indices may constitute a first attempt to define areas with high potential environmental risk, where urgent action is needed. In addition, the proposed methodology could be a valuable tool to prioritise these interventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Molecular methods of taxonomy and phylogeny have changed the way in which life on earth is viewed; they have allowed us to transition from a eukaryote-centric (five-kingdoms) view of the planet to one that is peculiarly prokarote-centric, containing three kingdoms, two of which are prokaryotic unicells. These prokaryotes are distinguished from their eukaryotic counterparts by their toughness, tenacity and metabolic diversity Realization of these features has, in many ways, changed the way we feel about life on earth, about the nature of life past and about the possibility of finding life elsewhere. In essence, the limits of life on this planet have expanded to such a degree that our thoughts of both past and future life have been altered. The abilities of prokaryotes to withstand many extreme conditions has led to the term extremophiles, used to describe the organisms that thrive under conditions thought just a few years ago, to be inconsistent with life. Perhaps the most extensive adaptation to extreme conditions, however, is represented by the ability of many bacteria to survive nutrient conditions not compatible with eukaryotic life. Prokaryotes have evolved to use nearly every redox couple that is in abundance on earth, filling the metabolic niches left behind by the oxygen-using, carbon-eating eukaryotes. This metabolic plasticity leads to a common feature in physically stratified environments of layered microbial communities, chemical indicators of the metabolic diversity of the prokaryotes. Such 'metabolic extremophily' forms a backdrop by which we can view the energy flow of life on this planet, think about what the evolutionary past of the planet might have been, and plan ways to look for life elsewhere, using the knowledge of energy flow on earth.

AB  - The geno-, and eco-toxicity of nonlyphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) were investigated in Daphnia magna, and Chironomus riparius. BPA may exert a genotoxicity on both species, whereas NP-induced DNA damage occurred only in C. riparius. In NP-exposed D. magna, increased mortality, without effect on DNA integrity was observed, an example of a false-negative result from the biomarkers perspective. False-positive results from the genotoxicity were observed in BPA-exposed D. magna and in NP-exposed C. riparius. Considering the importance of genotoxic biomarkers in ecotoxicity monitoring, DNA damage in these species could provide useful information.

AB  - Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF) management is a concept aimed at the conservation and sustainable use of the entire ecosystem. While EAF is a noble approach, its implementation has been challenging. Although Namibia has committed to the implementation of EAF, only limited assessment has been done of Namibian fisheries management processes and instruments concerning EAF. A qualitative assesment was done to ascertain if the Namibian fisheries management processes and instruments conform to the EAF principles. Namibian fisheries management processes and instruments largely conform to the EAF principles, although there are notable areas needing improvements. The conformities were pronounced in the total allowable catch setting, rebuilding depleted stocks, minimizing bycatch, and fishing impact minimization. The polluter pays, and user pays principles were also applied. Areas that were found lacking in this study included setting the indicators for EAF and ecosystem integrity. The assessment also noted the absence of guidelines for the precautionary approach principle and a transparent policy for quota and right allocation processes. The strategies for managing transboundary fish species are also not formulated. Overall, this assessment showed the complexities and challenges that Namibia and other countries need to overcome to implement EAF successfully.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between living conditions (microclimate, aerial contaminations, box dimension, access to the paddock/pasture) of horses kept in 3 stables and physiological indicators (protein and its fractions in serum, haptoglobin).
   The study was carried out for 4 months during autumn and winter in 3 stables. Blood samples were collected from 10 clinically healthy adult horses from each stable (30 in total) in 4 terms every 4 weeks. Environmental conditions were evaluated according to zoohygiene methodology and current law regulation. In the blood serum, the analyzed parameters were: total protein (g/L) with the biuret test, the contribution of individual serum protein fractions (%) (albumin and alpha 1-, alpha 2-, beta- and gamma-globulin) set to serum protein electrophoresis on agarose gels in an SAS-MX electrophoresis chamber; haptoglobin concentration (g/L) immunoturbidimetric test.
   Living conditions meeting the requirements of welfare were provided in stable 3 in terms of both microclimatic parameters as well as the dimensions of the boxes and access to paddock and pasture. Slightly worse conditions were recorded in stable 2, while stable 1 was characterized by not only the worst microclimatic parameters, but also the surface of the boxes was too small. The different living conditions of horses in different stables were reflected in the diverse values of the blood indicators. Although the obtained ratios of protein indicators corresponded to the values of normal adult healthy horses, it was demonstrated that in the serum of horses in stables 1 and 2, as compared to the stable 3, a significantly lower fraction of albumin and higher alpha 2-globulin and a higher concentration of Hp was found - suggesting the effect of different living conditions on organism homeostasis indicators. It may be stated that living conditions significantly influence the physiological condition of the horse.

AB  - 1. The efficacy of leaf-litter decomposition, sediment respiration, biofilm biomass, growth, chlorophyll a concentration and the autotrophic index (biofilm ash-free dry mass/chlorophyll a) and fungal biomass for detecting human-induced change was evaluated using 24 references and 15 disturbed stream sites located in central Portugal.
   2. Decomposition rates of alder (Alnus glutinosa) and oak (Quercus robur) leaves and sediment respiration rates were effective in discriminating impairment. Decomposition was negatively correlated with abiotic factors, such as ammonium and nitrite concentrations, connectivity and alterations in the hydrological regime, and positively correlated with nitrate concentration and oxygen concentration. Sediment respiration rates were correlated with organic contamination, land use and morphological changes.
   3. Growth rates of biofilm, concentration of chlorophyll a and the autotrophic index, although 41-73% higher at disturbed compared to reference sites, were not significantly different. These three variables were significantly correlated with total organic carbon, oxygen concentration, pH, nitrite and the presence of dams. Fungal biomass on leaves and biofilm biomass on natural substrata did not differ between reference and disturbed sites.
   4. Our findings lend support to the use of functional variables like decomposition and sediment respiration in monitoring and when used together with structural variables should give a more holistic measure of stream health.

AB  - Fungal and bacterial denitrification rates were determined under a range of redox conditions in sediment from a Louisiana swamp forest used for wastewater treatment. Sediment was incubated in microcosms at 6 Eh levels (-200, -100, 0, +100, +250 and +400 mV) ranging from strongly reducing to moderately oxidizing conditions. Denitrification was determined using the substrate-induced respiration (SIR) inhibition and acetylene inhibition methods. Cycloheximide (C15H23NO4) was used as the fungal inhibitor and streptomycin (C21F139N7O12) as the bacterial inhibitor. At Eh values of +250 my and +400 mV, denitrification rates by fungi and bacteria were 34.3-35.1% and 1.46-1.59% of total denitrification, respectively, indicating that fungi were responsible for most of the denitrification under aerobic or weakly reducing conditions. On the other hand, at Eh -200 mV, denitrification rates of fungi and bacteria were 17.6% and 64.9% of total denitrification, respectively, indicating that bacteria were responsible for most of the denitrification under strongly reducing conditions. Results show fungal denitrification was dominant under moderately reducing to weakly oxidizing conditions (Eh > +250 mV), whereas bacterial denitrification was dominant under strongly reducing condition (Eh < -100 mV). At Eh values between -100 to +100 mV, denitrification by fungi and bacteria were 37.9-43.2% and 53.0-51.1% of total denitrification, respectively, indicating that both bacteria and fungi contributed significantly to denitrification under these redox conditions. Because N2O is an important gaseous denitrification product in sediment, fungal denitrification could be of greater ecological significance under aerobic or moderately reducing conditions contributing to greenhouse gas emission and global warming potential (GWP).

AB  - Social structures emerge in primate groups mainly as a response to environmental pressures. Social structure impacts significantly on predator detection, food gathering and reproduction, and it is also an indicator of social condition and age and sex categories within the group. Differentiated activities which depend on social status, sex and age have been described in established social groups of primates. Dominance patterns influence the behavior of some species. It seems that the night-time spatial arrangement of members of a primate group is an anti-predation strategy, either by increasing detection and defensive capabilities in the case of large sleeping groups, or by emphasizing inconspicuousness in the case of more solitary sleepers. The persistence of social organization during rest-activity, cycles in primate groups allows for the prediction that individuals in a group having the same monitoring needs may alternate their rest-activity condition to assure vigilance. In this study, we examined the rest aand activity conditions of two peripheral individuals in an established social group of M. arctoides. Each subject was videorecorded twice for two continous periods of 24 hours each, totaling a videorecording of 96 hours. The rest and activity conditions observed in both subjects were grouped in the four possible conditions:
   Condition 1. Subject A resting, subject B resting; Condition 2. Subject A resting, subject B active; Condition 3. Subject A active, subject B resting; Condition 4. Subject A active, subject B active.
   These were compared with a concordance test. Results revealed that peripheral males alternated their rest-activity cycles. That is, while one subject was resting, the other remained active. The possibility that rest-activity alternation is an adaptation to maintain constant vigilance is discussed.

AB  - An understanding of the extent of land degradation and recovery is necessary to guide land-use policy and management, yet currently available land-quality assessments are widely known to be inadequate. Here, we present the results of the first statistically based application of a new approach to national assessments that integrates scientific and local knowledge. Qualitative observations completed at over 10 000 plots in the United States showed that while soil degradation remains an issue, loss of biotic integrity is more wide-spread. Quantitative soil and vegetation data collected at the same locations support the assessments and serve as a baseline for monitoring the effectiveness of policy and management initiatives, including responses to climate change. These results provide the information necessary to support strategic decisions by land managers and policy makers.

AB  - Based on the French survey Sante et Itineraire professionnel (SIP), which follows the career paths of employees between 2006 and 2010, this article deals with the relationships between the quality of working and employment conditions and the nature of job mobility, i.e. voluntary, negotiated or enforced. On the one hand, French working conditions surveys show that work intensity remains high, repetitive work has increased and the autonomy of employees has decreased. On the other, the success of the rupture conventionnelle-termination of the permanent contract by mutual agreement, introduced in 2008-and the "plans for voluntary departures" in firms in economic difficulties, raises questions in a recently depressed economic context. One of the factors that can lead an employee to decide or accept to leave his/her job can be linked to the nature of the employment relationship and, primarily, to the quality of working conditions.
   To test this hypothesis, using multinomial logistic models, the article estimates correlations between several indicators of working conditions and employment characteristics, and five types of mobility (end of contract, dismissal, resignation, rupture conventionnelle, others).
   Results show a positive correlation between difficult working conditions and negotiated departures via the rupture conventionnelle, as well as enforced departures through dismissals and end of contract. In addition, low wages or part-time work are employment characteristics positively correlated with voluntary mobility. This suggests three conclusion: 1- the rupture conventionnelle would be an additional "exit" for employees dissatisfied with their working conditions; 2- bad employment conditions would encourage employees to resign; and finally, 3- some firms would develop human resource management practices that are not concerned with employee loyalty, combining precarious working conditions and job insecurity through the type of mobility and not only the employment contracts.

AB  - Long-distance migration is energetically costly and often has a significant impact on bird health and condition. Therefore. understanding the health status of birds during long-distance migration is of ecological interest; however. obtaining invasive health measures is not always feasible or practical. Bird feathers can provide information about individual bird condition independent of invasive and expensive blood tests and have been used previously as indicators of condition, even long after the season of feather growth. Here, we investigated this question using 2 migratory songbirds in North America, Western Palm Warblers (Setophaga palmarum palmarum), which have conspicuous white patches on their tail feathers, and Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis), which have prominent daily growth bars on their tail feathers. Feathers were collected from birds captured on Jekyll Island, Georgia, during their fall migration. From the feathers we quantified the size of white patches on warbler rectrices and estimated growth bar length (as an index of feather growth rate) on catbird rectrices using image analysis. We also obtained 2 measures of bird health for each species: estimates of white blood cell abundance from blood smears (immune status) and size-corrected body mass (body condition). Analyses of feather traits and how they relate to bird health indicated that warblers (n = 42) with larger white patches had significantly higher body condition indices, although no association with white blood cell abundance, and catbirds (n = 27) with faster feather growth had significantly lower white blood cell abundance, but no association with body condition. Given the utility of these feather characteristics, our results suggest these metrics can be used to provide some insights into the biology of songbirds during one of the most critical portions of the annual cycle, migration.

AB  - Since its discovery in the early 1980s, the nineteenth-century Australian colonial-built schooner Clarence has undergone more extensive research and investigation than any other historic vessel located within Victoria's jurisdictional waters. Although early managerial approaches were well intentioned, those in-situ preservation methods employed proved ineffective and in some circumstances had an adverse effect, resulting in a significant loss of the archaeological integrity in a short 30-year period. As such, this paper outlines the knowledge gained due to both managerial successes and failures over the last 30 years, discusses the long-term applications of the applied methodologies and highlights the importance of environmental assessments, ongoing active management and the application of pro-active in-situ preservation methods.

AB  - In fish community assessment, measures of functional integrity have shown to be the most suited to detect anthropogenic impacts in a background of natural variation. However, minimising background noise involves the establishment of homogeneous areas, which is still mostly done based on taxonomic approaches or by relying on abiotic factors. The present study proposes a framework to identify functional homogeneity in demersal soft-substrate fish assemblages along the Portuguese coast, by relying on functional metrics such as trophic guild composition. Using metric pairwise constrained k-means (MPCK-means), sampling stations were clustered based on individual categories of functional metrics, while taking into account the minimum achievable homogeneity contained in 5 years of bottom trawl surveys. All individual clustering solutions resulting from different functional categories were ultimately combined into a final set of seven assemblage types using an ensemble clustering algorithm. Clustering patterns found were linked to depth, substrate type and latitudinal variation. Biomass-based metrics performed better in comparison to abundance-based metrics, but the combination of both achieved the best results in the definition of a final set of seven assemblage types along the coast.

AB  - Hydrologic regimes play a major role in determining the biotic composition, structure, and function of aquatic, wetland, and riparian ecosystems. But human land and water uses are substantially altering hydrologic regimes around the world. Improved quantitative evaluations of human-induced hydrologic changes are needed to advance research on the biotic implications of hydrologic alteration and to support ecosystem management and restoration plans. We propose a method for assessing the degree of hydrologic alteration attributable to human influence within an ecosystem. This method, referred to as the ''indicators of Hydrologic Alteration'' is based upon an analysis of hydrologic data available either from existing measurement points within an ecosystem (such as at stream gauges or wells) or model-generated data. We use 32 parameters provide information on ecologically significant features of surface and ground water regimes influencing aquatic, wetland, and riparian ecosystems. We then assess the hydrologic perturbations associated with activities such as dam operations, flow diversion, groundwater pumping, or intensive land-use conversion by comparing measures of central tendency and dispersion for each parameter between user-defined ''pre-impact'' and ''post-impact'' time frames, generating 64 Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. This method is intended for use with other ecosystem metrics in inventories of ecosystem integrity, in planning ecosystem management activities, and in setting and measuring progress toward conservation or restoration goals.

AB  - Dam construction and water diversions along the Colorado River during the twentieth century have altered the downstream estuarine ecosystem. Although it is clear that the ecosystem has changed, a lack of pre-impact studies has made it challenging to determine the magnitude and direction of change. By using a paleontological approach, we can retrospectively estimate ecological conditions in the estuary from before dam construction, particularly for benthic organisms with preservable hard parts, such as the shells of bivalve mollusks. Here, for the first time, we quantify differences in evenness, richness, taxonomic similarity, and rank-order abundance between the bivalve community living in the estuary today and two potential geohistorical baselines, the accumulated dead shells on the tidal flat and an older accumulation - known to pre-date dam construction on the river - in nearby shell-rich beach ridges called cheniers.
   Analysis of more than 12,000 live and dead bivalves distributed among 18 species collected from the tidal flat and cheniers on Isla Montague - an island at the mouth of the Colorado River - indicates that the pre-dam bivalve community was dominated by Mulinia modesta and was characterized by low ratified species richness and evenness (indexed by Hurlbert's Probability of Interspecific Encounter). The increase in these metrics in the live relative to the chenier assemblage reflects a shift in the estuary from brackish to full marine conditions after damming and water diversions reduced freshwater flow to the estuary during the twentieth century. The tidal flat death assemblage was more similar to the live assemblage, which suggests that it represents post-dam construction conditions due to a large input of recent shells, whereas the chenier assemblage is an appropriate pre-impact baseline. Taxonomic similarity and rank-order abundance, indexed by Jaccard-Chao and Spearman's Rho metrics, respectively, were too conservative to detect these differences.
   These baseline data, most notably the documented changes between the live and chenier assemblages, can be used to assess the efficacy of restoration efforts in the estuary, such as the Minute 319 environmental pulse flows. If restoration efforts stimulate a response in the bivalve community, metric values for evenness and richness are expected to decrease and become more similar to those we report here for the pre-impact chenier assemblage.

AB  - Riparian forests regulate stream ecosystems and biodiversity. Therefore, changes to riparian structure may threaten stream ecosystem function by triggering taxonomic and functional changes to aquatic communities. Because macroinvertebrate assemblages are sensitive to environmental changes, they can be effective indicators of stream integrity in disturbed landscapes. To assess the role of riparian forests in maintaining tropical stream communities in areas experiencing large-scale watershed disturbance, we quantified the taxonomic and functional response of stream macroinvertebrate communities to forest clearing in the southeastern Amazon's agricultural frontier, a region experiencing widespread deforestation. Our results show that watershed deforestation can lead to significant changes in macroinvertebrate richness and community composition. We found a predominance of shredders in forested watersheds; scrapers in cropland watersheds with riparian forests; and collector-filterers in cropland watersheds without riparian forest buffers. Taxonomic composition was controlled by available organic material in forested watersheds and by periphyton in cropland sites regardless of whether they had a riparian buffer. Our results show that the clearing of riparian forests alters food sources supporting aquatic food webs, leading to ecosystem-level shifts through changes in light and temperature dynamics that affect aquatic communities in areas with intense land-use change such as the southeastern Amazon.

AB  - Biomonitoring of surface waters using benthic macroinvertebrates is a common practice in developed countries. However, the use of biomonitoring metrics as part of regular monitoring programs in developing countries is scarce. This study is aimed at identifying the macroinvertebrate-based monitoring approaches which can be potentially applied to assess the ecological status of Mexican streams, and to provide guidelines and practical tools to implement such approaches. In this study, a total of 35 biomonitoring metrics were selected, divided into the following classes: 5 metrics of richness, 11 metrics to list the macroinvertebrates organisms (enumeration metrics), 6 diversity and similarity indices, 7 biotic indices, 5 functional feeding metrics and 1 multimetric approach. This selection was made using the a posteriori approach. Characteristics such as: sensitivity, ecological relevance, representativity, feasibility, metric interpretation, performance, and geographical suitability were also taken into consideration during the selection process. A description of the sampling and analytical procedures necessary to compute the selected metrics are also described. We provide an inventory of macroinvertebrate metrics that could be used in Mexico and nearby areas. However, further work is required to determine the accuracy and performance of these metrics for ecological assessment of Mexican streams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The characterization of ecosystem functional types (EFTs) and the construction of ecosystem functional patterns are critical for understanding and preserving the integrity of biological communities, ecosystem services, and the climate. The western part of Songnen Plain, one of the typical regions in Northeast China, is sensitive to global changes. Based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data for the period of 2003 to 2012, five indices, namely land surface water index, land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index, net photosynthesis, albedo, and their derived variables, including the average, the maximum value, and the difference between the maximum and minimum values during the growing season, are selected as the ecosystem functioning indicators in the western Songnen Plain. The fuzzy C-means clustering method is used to identify the EFTs. The correspondence analysis method is utilized to discriminate the consistency and heterogeneity between EFTs and land cover types. The selected variables indicating carbon, energy, and water flux of the regional ecosystem could be involved in the ecosystem functional classification. EFT could be associated with multiple land cover types, and the heterogeneity pattern of ecosystem functions and structures may be dissimilar.

AB  - Nowadays, Turkish forest management philosophy has changed from timber management to ecosystem-based multiple-use forest planning (EBMUFM) with the principles of "sustainable forest management" criteria and indicators drafted in a few national and international agreements. This study analyzed the temporal changes in forest ecosystem structure and a few forest values such as tree species, distribution of age class, development stage, canopy closure, species mixture, timber volume and increment, carbon storage and oxygen production in Sacinka Forest Planning Unit in the northeast corner of Turkey. To assess the patterns during a 21-year period (1985-2006), the necessary data were obtained from forest stand maps and evaluated with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Results showed that the decrease of agricultural and settlement areas caused the increase of productive forests and the decrease of degraded forests. Bark beetles, which have common effect in Artvin, had less effect on the vitality of Sacinka Forest Planning Unit forests compared to the neighboring forest ecosystems. This forest ecosystem vitality and integrity level was a result of the mechanic and biological interventions against the beetle damages and appropriate silvicultural prescriptions.

AB  - Urbanization dramatically affects hydrology, water quality and aquatic ecosystem composition. Here we characterized changes in diatom assemblages along an urban-to-rural gradient to assess impacts of urbanization on stream conditions in Beijing, China. Diatoms, water chemistry, and physical variables were measured at 22 urban (6 in upstream and 16 in downstream) and 7 rural reference stream sites during July and August of 2013. One-way ANOVA showed that water physical and chemical variables were significantly different (p < 0.05) between urban downstream and both reference and urban upstream sites, but not between reference and urban upstream sites (p > 0.05). Similarly, structural metrics, including species richness (S), Shannon diversity (H'), species evenness (J') and Simpson diversity (D'), were significantly different (p <0.05) between urban downstream and both reference and urban upstream sites, but not (p > 0.05) between reference and urban upstream sites. However, diatom assemblages were very different among all sites. Achnanthidium minutissima was a consistent dominant species in reference sites; Staurosira construens var. venter and Pseudostaurosira brevistriata were the dominant species in urban upstream sites; and Nitzschia palea was the dominant species in urban downstream sites. Clustering analyses based on the relative abundance of diatom species, showed all the samples fit into three groups: reference sites, urban upstream sites, and urban downstream sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Monte Carlo permutation tests showed that concentration of K+, EC, TN, Cl- and pH were positively correlated with relative abundance of dominant diatom species in urban downstream samples; WT and F- were correlated with reference and urban stream diatom composition. Our results demonstrate that the composition of diatom species was more sensitive to urbanization than the water physical and chemical parameters, and that diatom assemblage structure metrics more accurately assessed water quality. Some species, such as Amphora pediculus and Cocconeis placentula were among the dominant species in low nutrients stream sites; however, they were considered to be high nutrient indicators in some streams in USA. We suggest using caution in applying indicator indices based on species composition from other regions. It is necessary to build a complete set of diatom species data and their co-ordinate environment data for specific regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Peatlands represent globally-important ecosystems and carbon stores. However, large areas of peat land have been drained for agriculture, or peat has been harvested for use as fuel or in horticulture. Increasingly, these landscapes are being restored through ditch blocking and rewetting primarily to improve biodiversity and promote peat accumulation. To date we have little knowledge of how these interventions influence the microbial communities in peatlands. We compared the responses of dominant microbial consumers (testate amoebae) to drainage ditch restoration relative to unblocked ditches in a UK upland blanket peatland (Migneint, North Wales). Two techniques were used for restoration: (i) dammed ditches with re-profiling; and (ii) dammed ditches with pools of open water behind each dam. Testate communities in the inter-ditch areas changed markedly over time and between treatments illustrating the potential of this group of organisms as indicators of blanket peatland restoration status. However, the responses of testate amoebae to peat rewetting associated with restoration were partially obscured by inter-annual variability in weather conditions through the course of the experiment. Although there was considerable variability in the response of testate amoebae communities to peatland drain blocking, there were clearly more pronounced changes in samples from the dammed and reprofiled treatments including an increase in diversity, and the appearance of unambiguous wet-indicator species in relatively high abundances (includingAmphitrema stenostoma, Archerella flavum, Arcella discoides type, Difflugia bacillifera and Difflugia bacillarium). This reflects a shift towards overall wetter conditions across the site and the creation of new habitats. However, water-table was not a significant control on testate amoebae in this case, suggesting a poor relationship between water table and surface moisture in this sloping blanket peatland. Our findings highlight the potential of testate amoebae as bioindicators of peatland restoration success; however, there is a need for caution as mechanisms driving change in the microbial communities may be more complex than-first assumed. Several factors need to be taken into account when implementing biomonitoring studies in peatlands including: (i) the natural variability of the peatland ecosystem under changing weather conditions; (ii) any disturbance connected with the restoration procedures; and (iii) the timescales over which the ecosystem responds to the management intervention. Our results also suggest an indicator species approach based on population dynamics may be more appropriate for biomonitoring peatland restoration than examining changes at the community level.

AB  - In this work, we analyzed and studied the Ukrainian typical hydrotechnical structures of the ameliorative complex on soil materials. On the examples of such objects in Dnipropetrovsk oblast, we carried out research and determined the technical condition of the transporting (main irrigation canals) and regulating (retention ponds) hydrotechnical structures (HTS). The main factors and the reasons for the negative engineering-geological processes occurring in those structures and affecting the ecological balance of adjacent territories were determined. The study revealed that the long period of exploitation and absence of corresponding technical care have led to significant losses of irrigation water from the canals and retention ponds. Due to the systemic absence and low use of monitoring researchers, we have proposed the use of prompt and low-cost methods and means of technical diagnostics. The article presents the possibility of using a complex of geophysical methods of natural impulse magnetic field of the Earth and vertical electrical sounding for the purposes of technical diagnostics. The possibility of recording plots and parameters of zones of seepage deformations in the body and at the base of the structures was visually determined and instrumentally proven. This allows identifying the amounts of technical and material resources, stages and order of implementation of repair-restoration works. It was determined that share of the damaged zones accounts for 20 to 35% of the total length of the hydrotechnical structures depending on their type and parameters of the constructions. In such conditions, the estimated losses of water equal 17-22% of the total amount of the delivery. The surveys showed that further operation of HC poses an ecological threat because of significant worsening of quality of water resources. The article presents disturbing dynamics of change in the irrigated areas involving the danger of secondary salinization, sodification, alkalinization, and toxitication as a result of watering. We indicated threatening changes in the structures of the areas irrigated with low-quality water, which, according to various indicators of danger, increased by 1.4 times regarding threat of secondary salinization and by 2 times regarding threat of sodification. We proposed and substantiated approaches to improving the general technical and technological level of functioning of ameliorative structures in the context of maintaining ecological balance and economic practicability of their further use, based on the principles of systemic optimization of complex technical-natural ecosystems.

AB  - The trophic ecology, energy and reproductive states of the deep-water shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea, widely distributed along the slopes of the Mediterranean Sea Basins, were analysed in eight areas spread along ca. 3000 km in order to identify patterns in the habitat conditions supporting the species. From W to E the areas were situated between the north side of Eivissa (39 12'N, 1 degrees 20'E, in the Balearic Basin) and off Mersin, Turkey (36 degrees 15'N, 34 degrees 19'E, in the Levantine Sea). Trends identified mainly as a function of longitude from west to east were: (i) higher delta N-15, parallel to delta N-15 shifts in the top 200 m of the water column for particulate organic N (Pantoja et al., 2002). The delta 15N trend indicates that the deep trophic web, i.e. A. foliacea at 400-600 m, reflects the delta N-15 signal of the photic zone; (ii) a similar significant trend of delta C-13, related with exploitation of pelagic versus benthic resources by A. foliacea in each area (i.e. by local variability of terrigenous inputs via submarine canyons). More depleted delta C-13 was found at mid-longitudes (Tyrrhenian Sea and Sicily Channel) linked to higher consumption of macroplankton prey (Pasiphaea spp., euphausiids and mesopelagic fishes). The feeding intensity (gut fullness, F) and prey diversity U) of A. foliacea were related, according to generalized linear models, with the temperature and salinity of intermediate waters, variables in turn associated with latitude and longitude. Both F and J were higher in areas with greater shrimp density. The optimal ecological habitat of A. foliacea appears to be located in the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Sicily Channel, where we found the highest F, the greatest trophic diversity and A. foliacea in the best biological condition (i.e. with higher hepato-somatic index, HSI). These are also the areas with the highest densities of A. foliacea. In contrast, in the western Mediterranean Sea (Balearic Basin and the southern Balearic Islands), where A. foliacea has low densities, the shrimp showed generally lower values of trophic indicators and biological condition.(c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The behaviour of concrete at elevated temperatures is important for an assessment of integrity (strength and durability) of structures exposed to a high-temperature environment, in applications such as fire exposure, smelting plants and nuclear installations. In modelling terms, a coupled thermomechanical analysis represents a generalization of the computational mechanics of fracture and damage. Here, we develop a fully coupled anisotropic thermomechanical damage model for concrete under high stress and transient temperature, with emphasis on the adherence of the model to the laws of thermodynamics. Specific analytical results are given, deduced from thermodynamics, of a novel interpretation on specific heat, evolution of entropy and the identification of the complete anisotropic, thermomechanical damage surface. The Model is also shown to be stable in a computational sense, and to satisfy the laws of thermodynamics.

AB  - Evaluating changes in the collective behavior of a population can be an indirect method for inferring organismal responses to changing environmental conditions. Apex predators, such as the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), can provide valuable insights into the ecosystem processes of the deep sea, where little direct observation can be made. Sperm whales are often difficult to observe at sea, as they inhabit deep, offshore waters and spend most of their lives beneath the surface. However, sperm whales are extremely amenable to passive acoustic monitoring, as their vocalizations are well-studied, highly distinguishable, produced regularly, and can be detected at relatively long ranges (>10 km). Sperm whales produce distinct clicks in two behavioral contexts (social interaction or foraging/prey capture); thus, we can use acoustic detection of these vocalizations to infer patterns of large-scale, collective behavior, which is similar to studying calling frogs or insects indicating their reproductive phonology. We recorded behaviorally-specific sperm whale vocalizations at three sites in the Northern Gulf of Mexico in July 2010 and 2011. We used these recordings to construct population-level time budgets, an empirical collective metric of behavior, based on the ratio of hours in a day with social clicks to the hours in a day with foraging clicks, and represented this as an "acoustic activity index." Our index showed significant differences in the proportions of social and foraging behavior across the range of sperm whales in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, and the proportion of social activity increased by more than a factor of two from 2010 to 2011. These differences support previous evidence of differential habitat use by sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico, and suggest possible changes in environmental conditions between years. Thus, the acoustic activity index may provide a powerful way to evaluate changes in behavior and link them to changing ecological conditions. This novel application of bioacoustics to constructing time budgets and creating a behaviorally-based index at the population scale can serve as an indicator of ecological change, and greatly enhance our ability to understand the behavior and ecology of many acoustically active species.

AB  - This paper constructs a Good Society Index for 45 African countries, termed the Good African Society Index (GASI). The GASI consists of nine main indexes: (1) economic sustainability, (2) democracy and freedom, (3) child well-being, (4) environment and infrastructure, (5) safety and security, (6) health and health systems, (7) integrity and justice, (8) education, and (9) social sustainability and social cohesion. Each component is split into four sub-components for a total of 36 indicators. Tunisia ranks highest on the GASI, followed by Cape Verde and Botswana. Chad has the lowest GASI score, followed by Central African Republic and Cote d'Ivoire. The GASI is strongly related to the 2012 Human Development Index and Fragile States Index, to a lesser extent, GNI per capita.

AB  - Recognizing Cigerenzer's (1991) dictum that scientists' tools are not neutral (tools-in-use influence theory formulation as well as data interpretation), this article reports theory and examines data in ways that transcend the dominant logics for variable-based and case-based analyses. The theory and data analysis tests key propositions in complexity theory: (1) no single antecedent condition is a sufficient or necessary indicator of a high score in an outcome condition; (2) a few of many available complex configurations of antecedent conditions are sufficient indicators of high scores in an outcome condition; (3) contrarian cases occur, that is, low scores in a single antecedent condition associates with both high and low scores for an outcome condition for different cases; (4) causal asymmetry occurs, that is, accurate causal models for high scores for an outcome condition are not the mirror opposites of causal models for low scores for the same outcome condition. The study tests and supports these propositions in the context of customer assessments (n = 436) of service facets and service outcome evaluations for assisted temporary-transformations of self via beauty salon and spa treatments. The findings contribute to advancing a nuanced theory of how customers' service evaluations relate to their assessments of overall service quality and intentions to use the service. The findings support the need for service managers to be vigilant in fine-tuning service facets and service enactment to achieve the objective of high customer retention. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Soil abiotic properties represent important framing conditions of ecosystems and soil microbiological biomass and microbial activity are the biological driving forces that respond sensitive to environmental impacts. In environmental research and monitoring programmes, approaches for spatial classification were elaborated poorly. Therefore, soil abiotic and microbiological indicators were clustered for a 2965 km(2) region in northern Italy with the aim to identify the key spatial characteristics. Forty one sampling points for 30 cm soil depth were selected at the European Grid of the Land Use Cover Area frame Statistical survey (LUCAS). Soil abiotic indicators included physical (clay content and soil bulk density) and chemical (Cd, Pb and Hg content, organic carbon and total nitrogen) properties. The values varied between 3-47 g clay 100 g(-1) soil, 1.27-1.62 Mg m(-3), 0.69-3.47 g organic C 100 g(-1) soil and 0.07-0.31 g total N 100 g(-1) soil. Our cluster analysis with the abiotic characteristics separated two core classes derived from four clusters. In contrast, soil microbiological indicators including microbial carbon, respiration values and microbial energetic quotients, separated three well-defined core classes derived from five clusters. The microbial properties values ranged between 24-431 mu g microbial C g(-1) soil and 0.08-1.82 mu g CO2-C g(-1) soil h(-1) and corresponded to those in other European agricultural soils. The three soil microbiological classes separated low, typical and high ranges for soil microbial biomass (values < 120, 50-250 and > 320 mu g microbial C g(-1) soil), for soil respiration rates (values < 0.4, 0.4-0.7, and > 1.4 mu g CO2-C g(-1) soil h(-1)) for metabolic quotient (values < 3.5, 3.5-5.0, > 5.0, mg CO2-C g(-1) C-mic h(-1)) and for microbial C to organic C ratio (values < 0.7, 0.5-1.7 and > 1.0%). The soil microbiological indicators responded more evidently to land cover and soil management practices while soil abiotic indicators that referred mainly to the framing conditions such as geology and climatic conditions.

AB  - Background and aims - Biomonitoring is an important tool for assessing river water quality, but is not routinely applied in tropical rivers. Marked hydrological changes can occur between wet and dry season conditions in the tropics. Thus. a prerequisite for ecological assessment is that the influence of 'natural' hydrological change on biota can be distinguished from variability driven by water quality parameters of interest. Here we aimed to (a) assess seasonal changes in water quality, diatoms and algal assemblages from river phytoplankton and artificial substrates through the dry-wet season transition (February-July 2018) in the Red River close to Hanoi and (b) evaluate the potential for microscopic counts and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments for biomonitoring in large tropical rivers.
   Methods - River water (phytoplankton) and biofilms grown on artificial glass substrates were sampled monthly through the dry (February-April) to wet (May-August) season transition and analysed via microscopic and HPLC techniques.
   Key results - All phototrophic communities shifted markedly between the dry and wet seasons. Phytoplankton concentrations were low (c. thousands of cells/mL) and declined as the wet season progressed. The dominant phytoplankton taxa were centric diatoms (Aulacoseira granulata and Aulacoseira distans) and chlorophytes (Scenedesmus and Pediastrum spp.). with chlorophytes becoming more dominant in the wet season. Biofilm diatoms were dominated by Melosira varians. and areal densities declined in the wet season when fast-growing pioneer diatom taxa (e.g. Achnanthidium minutissimum, Planothidium lanceolatum) and non-degraded Chlorophyll a concentrations increased, suggesting active phytobenthos growth in response to scour damage. Otherwise, a-phoroins were very abundant in river seston and biofilms indicating in situ Chlorophyll a degradation which may be typical of tropical river environments. The very large range of total suspended solids (reaching > 120 mg/L) and turbidity appears to be a key driver of photoautotrophs through control of light availability.
   Conclusions - Hydrological change and associated turbidity conditions exceed nutrient influences on photoautotrophs at inter-seasonal scales in this part of the Red River. Inter-seasonal differences might be a useful measure for biomonitoring to help track how changes in suspended solids, a major water quality issue in tropical rivers, interact with other variables of interest.

AB  - Earthworms are important organisms in soil communities and so are used as model organisms in environmental risk assessments of chemicals. However current risk assessments of soil invertebrates are based on short-term laboratory studies, of limited ecological relevance, supplemented if necessary by site-specific field trials, which sometimes are challenging to apply across the whole agricultural landscape. Here, we investigate whether population responses to environmental stressors and pesticide exposure can be accurately predicted by combining energy budget and agent-based models (ABMs), based on knowledge of how individuals respond to their local circumstances. A simple energy budget model was implemented within each earthworm Eisenia fetida in the ABM, based on a priori parameter estimates. From broadly accepted physiological principles, simple algorithms specify how energy acquisition and expenditure drive life cycle processes. Each individual allocates energy between maintenance, growth and/or reproduction under varying conditions of food density, soil temperature and soil moisture. When simulating published experiments, good model fits were obtained to experimental data on individual growth, reproduction and starvation. Using the energy budget model as a platform we developed methods to identify which of the physiological parameters in the energy budget model (rates of ingestion, maintenance, growth or reproduction) are primarily affected by pesticide applications, producing four hypotheses about how toxicity acts. We tested these hypotheses by comparing model outputs with published toxicity data on the effects of copper oxychloride and chlorpyrifos on E. fetida. Both growth and reproduction were directly affected in experiments in which sufficient food was provided, whilst maintenance was targeted under food limitation. Although we only incorporate toxic effects at the individual level we show how ABMs can readily extrapolate to larger scales by providing good model fits to field population data. The ability of the presented model to fit the available field and laboratory data for E. fetida demonstrates the promise of the agent-based approach in ecology, by showing how biological knowledge can be used to make ecological inferences. Further work is required to extend the approach to populations of more ecologically relevant species studied at the field scale. Such a model could help extrapolate from laboratory to field conditions and from one set of field conditions to another or from species to species. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The unique hydrologic conditions characterizing riparian ecosystems in dryland (arid and semi-arid) areas help maintain high biodiversity and support high levels of primary productivity compared to associated uplands. In western North America, many riparian ecosystems have been damaged by altered flow regimes (e.g., impoundments and diversions) and over utilization of water resources (e.g., groundwater pumping for agriculture and human consumption). This has led some state and national governments to provide occasional environmental flows to address the declining condition of such riparian systems. In a historic agreement between the United States and Mexico, 130 million cubic meters (mcm) of water was released to the lower Colorado River Delta in Mexico, with the intent to evaluate the hydrological and biological response of the ecosystem. We used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to estimate long term (2000-2014) and short term (pre- and post-pulse; 2013 and 2014) evapotranspiration (ET; used herein as an indicator of plant health) of the delta's riparian corridor. We found the pulse flow helped reverse a decline in ET from 2011 to 2013, with a small, but statistically significant increase in 2014 (P < 0.05). ET was greater than 100 mcm in all years analyzed (even in years without surface flows) and exceeded surface flows in all years except 2000 (result of excess flows following an El Nino cycle in 1997) and 2014 (year of the pulse flow). Based on groundwater salinities and MODIS ET estimates, we estimated groundwater flow into the delta to be 103 mcm. Shallow groundwater salinities in the riparian zone increased from 1.30 g L-1 in the most upstream reach to 2.77 g L-1 in the most downstream reach we measured, partly due to uptake of water by riparian vegetation and partly to intrusion of saline agricultural return flows. The disparity between surface flows and ET can likely be explained by the predominantly phreatophytic plants characterizing the area, which draw water from the aquifer. These results also suggest that the deteriorated condition of vegetation within the riparian zone might not be reversed by a single pulse event and could instead require subsequent pulse flows as a long term strategy to restore vegetation in this riparian ecosystem.

AB  - Marine catfishes use estuaries and bays as part of their life cycle for spawning and feeding purposes, respectively. We compared three species of the family Ariidae in two different environmental conditions: a relatively stable bay site and an estuarine site, which differ in their magnitudes of environmental fluctuation to investigate effects of spawning on condition. We found differences in the parameter b(slope) and in the y-intercept(a) among species and sexes. The parameter a varied inversely with b, and thus is not a good indicator to express fish condition. Condition factor did not differ between the two sites for species and sexes when we consider the pooled data. Overall condition was associated with reproductive process, and was high before the reproductive season, decreasing during the spawning period in the estuary, then increasing when fish move to the bay (April-August). Temporal segregation in the reproductive period and small-scale movements between the estuary and the bay are the probable mechanisms to optimize the use of the area by the three species.

AB  - During the latest Miocene and Early Pliocene (similar to 5.5. MaBP), the collision of the Australian and Eurasian plates resulted in proto-foreland development and significant structural reactivation in the Timer Sea, north-western Australia. Flexural extension, resulting from the down-warping of the Australian plate into the developing Timer Trough, resulted in the dilatation of the major Jurassic and older extensional faults and the formation of shallow Mio-Pliocene fault arrays. An integrated, multidisciplinary study of hydrocarbon traps from this region using 2-D and 3-D seismic data, stable isotope geochemistry, fluid inclusion measurements and apatite fission track data has revealed that this fault reactivation produced three categories of traps: high (HIT), moderate (MIT) and low (LIT) integrity traps. These have characteristic hydrocarbon fill-spill, fluid flow and thermal histories. In MITs and LITs, the dilatation was moderate to intense respectively, and allowed hot (90-130 degrees C), highly saline (200,000(+) ppm salinity) brines from deep Palaeozoic evaporites to migrate up the reactivated faults and chemically and thermally affect the reservoir and shallower intervals. Apatite fission track data suggest that fluid migration lasted for between 100,000 and one million years in the case of the MITs, but for only 10,000-100,000 years in the LITs. This major fluid flow event resulted in the development of a prominent, localised Late Tertiary heating 'spike' in the MITs, which can significantly affect the accuracy of modelled thermal histories. In the LITs, the thermal effect is less marked, due to the more transient nature of the fluid flow event. HITs were largely unreactivated and hence conduits for brine migration from depth were absent. Consequently, these traps are the most representative of the thermal histories of the source rock depocentres. Where MITS or LITs were charged, the associated loss of fault seal integrity facilitated hydrocarbon loss from the Mesozoic reservoirs, which co-migrated with the brines up through the Mio-Pliocene fault network. Upon entering a shallow, elastic aquifer system (the Eocene Grebe Formation), bacterial oxidation of the hydrocarbons liberated CO2 which, in turn, resulted in significant and very isotopically light carbonate cementation. This cementation produces sufficient acoustic impedance with the surrounding uncemented sands that it allows these hydrocarbon-related diagenetic zones (HRDZs) to be mapped seismically. Since both the size and acoustic response of the HRDZs are directly proportional to the amount of hydrocarbons that have leaked from the traps, their presence or absence provides a powerful indicator, predrill, of both trap integrity and the likely thermal regime that that traps have experienced. An important observation is that the leaky fault segments over partially breached traps typically only extended for 200-1000 m, whereas over the breached traps, leaky segments extended for 3000-5000 m. Consequently, exploration programs acquiring remote sensing geochemical data (such as geochemical sniffer and airborne laser fluorosensor (ALF) techniques), should have closely spaced line spacings if leaky, potentially commercial fields are to be detected reliably. Potential analogues exist between the processes documented during HRDZ formation, namely the mixing at shallow depths of basinal brines, hydrocarbons and connate waters, and processes occurring during the formation of Pb-Zn and other, low temperature ore deposits.

AB  - Analytical proteomics has experienced exponential progress in the last decade and can be expected to lead research studies on diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in the near future. Because the development of this type of analysis requires the use of a large number of human samples with a minimum of quality requirements, our objective was to identify appropriate indicators for quality control of plasma samples stored in biobanks for research in proteomics. To accomplish this, plasma samples from 100 healthy donors were obtained and processed according to the pre-analytical variables of: a) time delay for the first centrifugation of the original blood sample (4 or 24 h) and b) number of freeze/thaw cycles (1, 2 or 3) of the processed plasma samples. The analyses of samples were performed by different and complementary methods such as SPE MALDI-TOF, DICE, shotgun (iTRAQ, nLC MALDI TOF/TOF) and targeted nLC MS/MS proteomic techniques (SRM). In general, because the distribution of proteins in all samples was found to be very similar, the results shown that delayed processing of blood samples and the number of freeze/thaw cycles has little or no effect on the integrity of proteins in the plasma samples.
   Significance: The results of the present work indicate that blood proteins in plasma are broadly insensitive to such preanalytical variables as delayed processing or freeze/thaw cycles when analyzed at the peptide level. Although there are other studies related to protein stability of clinical samples with similar results, what is remarkable about our work is the large number of plasma samples examined and that our analyses assessed protein integrity by combining a wide set of complementary proteomic approaches performed at different proteomic platform participating laboratories that all yielded similar results. We believe our study is the most comprehensive performed to date to determine the changes in proteins induced by delayed sample processing and plasma freeze/thaw cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The monitoring of aquatic ecosystems including important rivers, often limited in the African setting, is essential for the sustainable provision of aquatic resources. Mohokare River, a major tributary of the Senqu-Orange River, is under threat of pollution from Maseru City, the most industrialised area in Lesotho. This study investigated the impact of Maseru City on Mohokare River by assessing the situational physico-chemical, biochemical and microbiological quality of the river. The study employed standard methods to assess nitrate and phosphate concentrations, total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, turbidity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen content, biochemical oxygen demand and coliforms. Overall, all water quality indicators, except pH, changed significantly along the river. Turbidity, phosphate and coliforms were above the expected levels. The findings indicate that the water quality is affected by anthropogenic activities associated with industries, agriculture and settlements of the Maseru City. Water from the assessed segment and downstream of the river can be a potential threat to human health, animals and aquatic life. To protect the ecosystem integrity of Mohokare River, the implementation of environmental policies should be strengthened. This study can provide valuable information to municipal water providers in the riparian communities, policy makers, aquatic ecosystem researchers and public health researchers.

AB  - Currently, the methods used to assess the veld condition of the Lambert's Bay Strandveld along the West Coast of South Africa require that the operator knows all the plants encountered in the survey area. In this study data were collected from several farms in the Lambert's Bay Strandveld to establish a degradation gradient from which a minimum number of species necessary to monitor trends in the condition of the veld were determined, making it user-friendly for land-users, extension officers and others. The key indicators were also tested using a second set of data.

AB  - In assessing environmental change, butterflies have been proven as replicable indicators of biodiversity and functional integrity that can be monitored at a range of scales. Butterflies have been identified as important bio-indicators for assessing biodiversity and monitoring ecosystem responses to environmental perturbations. The objectives of this study were to determine changes in the butterfly fauna of differing sites in the Sango Bay Area (SBA) and Iriiri (Karamoja) in comparison with data collected 10 years ago, and to investigate the impact of different degrees of habitat disturbance on butterflies. The general butterfly diversity was determined by trapping and sweep netting along transect lines and by random sweeping. The impact of human-induced disturbance was assessed by comparing species richness and composition between the sites and regressing the weighted disturbances against species diversity per Site. There was a marked decrease in species diversity and varied species composition between the two studies and between the habitat types. Charcoal burning and grazing had significant negative correlations with diversity within forest sites (r(2) = 0.825, P < 0.05). whereas cultivation and tree cutting/logging had significant negative correlations with diversity of open savannas (r(2) = 0.718, P < 0.05 and r(2) = 0.999, P < 0.05, respectively).

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled and environmental variables measured at Langeni Forest and Kambi Valley, two sites of varying degrees of human impact in the upper Mthatha River, South Africa, in 2010-2011. Four species, Simulium adersi Pomeroy, Baetis harrisoni Barnard, Pseudocloeon sp. and Tricorythus sp., occurred at all site sampling units. Specimen counts increased from the rainy months of January to April/May, and higher numbers of individuals occurred at Langeni. Species occurrences per site were directly or indirectly affected by season, substrate and habitat heterogeneity. Canonical correspondence analysis results showed that conductivity, pH, flow, substrate and marginal vegetation were important in determining species distribution patterns. Both rare/habitat-restricted and common/widespread benthic macroinvertebrates identified in this study can be used as indicators for assessing the ecological integrity of the Mthatha River. Habitat management along the river should aim at preserving indigenous vegetation, especially during the summer season when habitat requirements are optimal for growth stages of most benthic macroinvertebrate fauna. The practicality of using species-level surveys on a routine basis can be challenging, given the lack of taxonomic expertise and time constraints. It might be advisable to select a few indicator species and to monitor them as surrogates for the whole community.

AB  - Genotoxic effects were evaluated in the somatic and gonadal cells of bivalve and gastropod molluscs inhabiting different sites of Klaipeda port area in Lithuania. The occurrence of aneuploidy and polyploidy of cells, meiotic injures, centromere dissociation and fragmented polyploid nuclei as cytogenetic indicators of environmental stressors was assessed in snails Lymnaea ovata. The highest level of environmental genotoxicity (in 43.2 and 46.2% of studied cells) was observed in the tissues of snails inhabiting Malku Bay in 1995 and 1996. Dredging and thus removal of contaminated sediments from Malku Bay resulted in significant decrease (up to 27.2% in 1999) of cytogenetic injures in molluscs studied over the period from 1997 to 1999. However, the frequency of cytogenetic disturbances in molluscs from Vilhelmo Channel was increasing (1.8 times) from 1995 to 1999. Therefore, the ecological safety of the biggest drinking water supply for Klaipeda population became questionable. Assessment of cytogenetic damage in Mytilus edulis (MN test) and the crustacean, Balanus improvisus, (aneugenic effects) inhabiting the Baltic Sea at Butinge oil terminal has shown the highest genotoxicity level in the zone of sewage effluents from Palanga town and Mazeikiai oil refinery plant. Extensive cytogenetic injuries in gonadal cells indicated the potential long-term hazards of pollutants to ecological health and integrity of aquatic species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Concrete is an extreme but common environment and is home to microbial communities adapted to alkaline, saline, and oligotrophic conditions. Microbes inside the concrete that makes up buildings or roads have received little attention despite their ubiquity and capacity to interact with the concrete. Because concrete is a composite of materials which have their own microbial communities, we hypothesized that the microbial communities of concrete reflect those of the concrete components and that these communities change as the concrete ages. Here, we used a 16S amplicon study to show how microbial communities change over 2 years of outdoor weathering in two sets of concrete cylinders, one prone to the concrete-degrading alkali-silica reaction (ASR) and the other having the risk of the ASR mitigated. After identifying and removing taxa that were likely laboratory or reagent contaminants, we found that precursor materials, particularly the large aggregate (gravel), were the probable source of similar to 50 to 60% of the bacteria observed in the first cylinders from each series. Overall, community diversity decreased over 2 years, with temporarily increased diversity in warmer summer months. We found that most of the concrete microbiome was composed of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, although community composition changed seasonally and over multiyear time scales and was likely influenced by environmental deposition. Although the community composition between the two series was not significantly different overall, several taxa, including Arcobacter, Modestobacter, Salinicoccus, Rheinheimera, Lawsonella, and Bryobacter, appear to be associated with ASR.
   IMPORTANCE Concrete is the most-used building material in the world and a biologically extreme environment, with a microbiome composed of bacteria that likely come from concrete precursor materials, aerosols, and environmental deposition. These microbes, though seeded from a variety of materials, are all subject to desiccation, heating, starvation, high salinity, and very high pH. Microbes that survive and even thrive under these conditions can potentially either degrade concrete or contribute to its repair. Thus, understanding which microbes survive in concrete, under what conditions, and for how long has potential implications for biorepair of concrete. Further, methodological pipelines for analyzing concrete microbial communities can be applied to concrete from a variety of structures or with different types of damage to identify bioindicator species that can be used for structural health monitoring and service life prediction.

AB  - Small streams are a high priority for conservation and an important target for biomonitoring. Stream salamanders are a useful indicator for biotic integrity of headwater streams; however, assessing stream salamanders is a challenging endeavor and existing methods can cause habitat disturbance or require expensive equipment. Our goal was to develop an artificial habitat that mimics the natural habitat that salamanders prefer, leading to rapid colonization and that also (1) represents a standardized area and (2) is easy to handle for rapid assessment. After developing a new artificial habitat (the Maloney Salamander Hotel), we tested the device in a variety of streams and compared our method with other techniques. After a series of field tests in a variety of streams through multiple seasons, we found that stream salamanders will colonize the apparatus and that this method yielded results similar or superior to other methods. For efficient and relatively simple assessment, our results indicate that three devices, left in streams for 3 d, should provide a reliable assessment of salamander presence. The device is relatively inexpensive, simple to build, easily handled for efficient deployment and collection, and does not harm the salamanders. We hope the development of this device provides a useful innovation for biological consultants, land managers, and researchers interested in assessing salamander presence in streams.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of stress and nutritional state (fed vs food deprived) on the generalized stress response and intestinal integrity in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L). Cod in feeding or food deprived states were subjected to 15 min of acute stress (exhaustive exercise). Blood was collected at 9 intervals from before stress (t = 0), to t = 48 h post stress and analysed for blood haematocrit and haemoglobin, and plasma cortisol, lactate, glucose, osmolality, chloride, as well as the tissue damage indicators glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Intestinal segments were prepared for histology with the same intervals, while assessment of intestinal integrity and microbiology was performed at t = 0, 4 and 48 h post stress.
   Subjecting cod to exhaustive stress initiated a standard stress response including increased blood Hct and plasma cortisol, glucose, chloride, osmolality and lactate. Food deprived fish did in general have reduced stress resistance compared to fed fish. For many parameters, cod returned slowly to basal levels. Cellular indicators of tissue damage and oxidative stress increased in a biphasic manner following stress. Stress did not affect gut histology but did transiently increase gut permeability. Furthermore, stress had no effect on the adherent bacterial population level in midgut, but did cause a small decrease in hindgut(non-significant) and hindgut chamber (p < 0.05). Isolates belonging to Carnobacterium were predominant but not affected by stress.
   In conclusion, food deprived cod are less resistant to stress than fed cod. The magnitude of the response is less than in salmonids, but the effects are persistent (including tissue damage indicators and oxidative stress) and may have negative long term consequences. The gut is relatively resistant to stress, there is however a transient increase in the intestinal permeability and alterations in microbiota that may indicate lower protection against invading pathogens.

AB  - Protected area management effectiveness (PAME) evaluation is increasingly undertaken to evaluate governance, assess conservation outcomes and inform evidence-based management of protected areas (PAs). Within PAME, quantitative approaches to assess biodiversity outcomes are now emerging, where biological monitoring data are directly assessed against quantitative (numerically defined) condition categories (termed quantitative condition assessments). However, more commonly qualitative condition assessments are employed in PAME, which use descriptive condition categories and are evaluated largely with expert judgement that can be subject to a range of biases, such as linguistic uncertainty and overconfidence. Despite the benefits of increased transparency and repeatability of evaluations, quantitative condition assessments are rarely used in PAME. To understand why, we interviewed practitioners from all Australian marine protected area (MPA) networks, which have access to long-term biological monitoring data and are developing or conducting PAME evaluations. Our research revealed that there is a desire within management agencies to implement quantitative condition assessment of biodiversity outcomes in Australian MPAs. However, practitioners report many challenges in transitioning from undertaking qualitative to quantitative condition assessments of biodiversity outcomes, which are hampering progress. Challenges include a lack of agency capacity (staff numbers and money), knowledge gaps, and diminishing public and political support for PAs. We point to opportunities to target strategies that will assist agencies overcome these challenges, including new decision support tools, approaches to better finance conservation efforts, and to promote more management relevant science. While a single solution is unlikely to achieve full evidence-based conservation, we suggest ways for agencies to target strategies and advance PAME evaluations toward best practice.

AB  - Total blood haemoglobin concentration is increasingly being used to assess physiological condition in wild birds, although it has not been explicitly recognized how reliably this parameter reflects different components of individual quality. Thus, I reviewed over 120 published studies linking variation in haemoglobin concentrations to different measures of condition and other phenotypic or ecological traits. In most of the studied avian species, haemoglobin concentrations were positively correlated with other commonly used indices of condition, such as body mass and fat loads, as well as with quality of the diet. Also, chick haemoglobin concentrations reliably reflected the intensity of nest infestation by parasitic arthropods, and haemoglobin was suggested to reflect parasitism by haematophagous ectoparasites much more precisely than haematocrit. There was also some evidence for the negative effect of helminths on haemoglobin levels in adult birds. Finally, haemoglobin concentrations were found to correlate with such fitness-related traits as timing of arrival at breeding grounds, timing of breeding, egg size, developmental stability and habitat quality, although these relationships were not always consistent between species. In consequence, I recommend the total blood haemoglobin concentration as a relatively robust indicator of physiological condition in birds, although this parameter is also strongly affected by age, season and the process of moult. Thus, researchers are advised to control fully for these confounding effects while using haemoglobin concentrations as a proxy of physiological condition in both experimental and field studies on birds.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) play an important role in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem integrity. However, human development has threatened and affected the function and effectiveness of PAs. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) night-time stable light (NTL) data have proven to be an effective indicator of the intensity and change of human-induced urban development over a long time span and at a larger spatial scale. We used the NTL data from 1992 to 2013 to characterize the human-induced urban development and studied the spatial and temporal variation of the NTL of global terrestrial PAs. We selected seven types of PAs defined by the International Union for Conversation of Nature (IUCN), including strict nature reserve (Ia), wilderness area (Ib), national park (II), natural monument or feature (III), habitat/species management area (IV), protected landscape/seascape (V), and protected area with sustainable use of natural resources (VI). We evaluated the NTL digital number (DN) in PAs and their surrounding buffer zones, i.e., 0-1 km, 1-5 km, 5-10 km, 10-25 km, 25-50 km, and 50-100 km. The results revealed the level, growth rate, trend, and distribution pattern of NTL in PAs. Within PAs, areas of types V and Ib had the highest and lowest NTL levels, respectively. In the surrounding 1-100 km buffer zones, type V PAs also had the highest NTL level, but type VI PAs had the lowest NTL level. The NTL level in the areas surrounding PAs was higher than that within PAs. Types Ia and III PAs showed the highest and lowest NTL growth rate from 1992 to 2013, respectively, both inside and outside of PAs. The NTL distributions surrounding the Ib and VI PAs were different from other types. The areas close to Ib and VI boundaries, i.e., in the 0-25 km buffer zones, showed lower NTL levels, for which the highest NTL level was observed within the 25-100 km buffer zone. However, other types of PAs showed the opposite NTL patterns. The NTL level was lower in the distant buffer zones, and the lowest night light was within the 1-25 km buffer zones. Globally, 6.9% of PAs are being affected by NTL. Conditions of wilderness areas, e.g., high latitude regions, Tibetan Plateau, Amazon, and Caribbean, are the least affected by NTL. The PAs in Europe, Asia, and North America are more affected by NTL than South America, Africa, and Oceania.

AB  - We investigated the ability of the North Carolina Biotic Index (NCBI) and the Ephemeroptera + Plecoptera + Trichoptera (EPT) index to track an experimental manipulation of the invertebrate community and resultant alteration of several ecosystem-level processes in a headwater stream at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in western North Carolina. Indices were calculated from quantitative monthly or bimonthly benthic samples of moss-covered rockface and mixed substrate habitats, as well as habitat-weighted values based on the proportion of each habitat in the two streams. One stream (C 55) served as a reference stream over the 6-yr period of late 1984 through 1990, whereas the other (C 54) received seasonal treatments with an insecticide for 3 yr (1986-1988). Throughout pretreatment, treatment, and recovery, both the NCBI and EPT indices tracked the disturbance regime of the treatment stream. Indices for the reference stream varied little during the 6-yr period. Both the NCBI and EPT suggested strong changes in the treatment stream during treatment relative to both pretreatment and the reference stream. Following cessation of insecticide treatments, both indices reflected improved biotic conditions during first and second years of recovery in C 54. Compared with fauna of mixed substrates, rockface fauna had lower (better) NCBI values during pretreatment, and exhibited a greater proportional increase in tolerant taxa during treatment than mixed substrates, emphasizing the importance of including rockface communities in environmental monitoring programs.
   Changes in both the EPT and NCBI indices closely corresponded to changes in ecosystem-level processes observed in C 54 from pretreatment to treatment, and recovery periods, These processes include: leaf litter processing rates, organic matter storage, fine particulate organic matter generation and export, and secondary production. With the exception of organic matter storage, all of these processes declined during treatment of C 54, and subsequently increased during recovery. Our results demonstrate the potential of such indices to detect and monitor stream ecosystem changes during and following disturbance.
   The EPT index was by far the easiest to use from both the standpoint of time required for sample processing and ease of application. Compared with the labor-intensive sample processing, specimen identification and measurement, and data entry required for secondary production calculations, the EPT index was relatively simple and displayed a remarkable ability to track secondary production of invertebrates in the treatment stream. Our data strongly support the inclusion of the EPT and NCBI indices in these southern Appalachian headwater streams as indicators of both degradation and recovery of stream ecosystem processes from chemical-induced disturbance.

AB  - Body size influences the effect of individuals and assemblages on ecosystem functioning and defines how they respond to ecosystem changes. We evaluated how body size structure of fish assemblages and functional groups respond to human modifications at catchment, riparian and local scales in 40 streams of the Pampa grasslands, southern Brazil. To describe body size structure, we calculated the mean, coefficient of variation, skewness, and kurtosis, using individual biomass data for the entire fish assemblages and separately by functional group. The results suggested that body size response depends on body size metrics, functional group, and the spatial scale of land use. From 11 functional groups, only five showed a clear response to land use. In general, most functional groups had a higher concentration of small sizes (left-skewed) in response to increased land use measured at distinct spatial scales (local, riparian, and catchment), and a greater concentration of sizes in a narrow and central distribution (higher kurtosis). However, the responses were complex and varied between the functional groups. We conclude that considering ecomorphological and trophic features separately by functional group and assessing multiple body size metrics contributed greatly to detecting the influence of land use on fish body size.

AB  - Standing dead trees are known to house diverse assemblages of vertebrates in temperate forests worldwide. In temperate austral forests of South America, however, the functional role of dead trees has been mostly focused on cavity provision, but other functions remain poorly understood. Thus, we conducted a preliminary study examining the effect of dead trees on the taxonomic diversity of vertebrates in South American temperate forests. Diversity metrics estimated from rarefaction curves and community data augmentation showed that taxonomic diversity of vertebrate species was equal between dead and living trees. Habitat variables equally affected species diversity of vertebrates in dead and living trees. Tree height and elevation had a positive effect while forest cover negatively affected species diversity. The similar diversity and composition of vertebrates found in living and dead trees suggests dead trees are equally valuable for conservation. In austral forests dominated by long-living tree species, the death of a tree is a long process involving the retention of several microhabitats once the tree dies and the enrichment of deadwood structures attracting saproxylic organisms. These findings highlight the need of establishing minimum stocks of dying and senescent trees for achieving ecosystem integrity.

The incorporation of AP and natural phosphate was conducted in a greenhouse, and we investigated its effects on plant total dry matter, phosphorus absorption, microbial biomass carbon and phosphorus, total organic carbon, soil basal respiration, enzymatic activities (acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and urease) and the soil microbial structure community.ResultsThe application of natural thermophosphate phosphates with AP is an efficient management strategy for maize cultivation, with increases of more than 124% in maize dry matter, more than 300% in P uptake and 62% in soil microbial biomass carbon.ConclusionsThe use of Arachis pintoi as green manure, combined with natural phosphate sources, represents an alternative fertilisation approach for maize cultivated on Entisols, enhancing the bioavailability of P from natural rock phosphate. It is a sustainable and financially attractive option to ensure the environmental integrity of cultivation, food and soil security.

AB  - Ageing infrastructure, budgetary constraints, economic downturns, regulatory requirements, the high level of service requirements and a declining rate of reinvestment require effective asset management of sewer collection systems. Inspection and condition assessment is one of the core and costly elements of effective asset management. The availability of many sophisticated condition assessment technologies and lack of common understanding of them in the municipal environment require formalising the knowledge related to these technologies using an ontological approach to support the development of applications for effective selection of the most appropriate technology for sewer condition assessment. The purpose of this research work is to develop an ontology of condition assessment technologies for sewer networks - Cats_Onto - using the Ontology Web Language following a seven-step methodology. The outcome of this research work is a comprehensive knowledge representation in the form of an ontology that will be used to develop applications (beyond the scope of this paper) for the selection of the most appropriate technology for sewer condition assessment. The knowledge representation is verified using automated built-in reasoners in the Protege ontology editor and validated by industry experts.

AB  - Mappings of land use priority can be used to balance the ecology and economy to achieve sustainable development. This paper, taking the city of Wu'an as a study area, focuses on the land itself to establish prioritized protected areas. The land use change law over the entire study area, the importance of the ecological land, and the results of an ecological interference analysis of the road networks are all indicators presented by the land itself that constitute a basic framework for the delineation of protected areas. Via a cumulative analysis of these factors, the core patches of the protected areas can be obtained. These areas are further combined with the regional human activity distance to create a buffer zone, and finally, the prioritized protected areas are mapped based on the land use. The results show that the core patches have good integrity and that there is more ecological land and less land for construction in the established protected areas. This may reduce conflicts when land is used in different ways. Following this idea when we formulate the land use policy, it is possible to replace multiple indicators with land-based factors to reduce or even avoid the mutual interference of various indicators.

AB  - Common decision support tools and a growing body of knowledge about ecological recovery can help inform and guide large state and federal restoration programs affecting thousands of impaired waters. Under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA), waters not meeting state Water Quality Standards due to impairment by pollutants are placed on the CWA Section 303(d) list, scheduled for Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) development, and ultimately restored. Tens of thousands of 303(d)-listed waters, many with completed TMDLs, represent a restoration workload of many years. State TMDL scheduling and implementation decisions influence the choice of waters and the sequence of restoration. Strategies that compare these waters' recovery potential could optimize the gain of ecological resources by restoring promising sites earlier. We explored ways for states to use recovery potential in restoration priority setting with landscape analysis methods, geographic data, and impaired waters monitoring data. From the literature and practice we identified measurable, recovery-relevant ecological, stressor, and social context metrics and developed a restorability screening approach adaptable to widely different environments and program goals. In this paper we describe the indicators, the methodology, and three statewide, recovery-based targeting and prioritization projects. We also call for refining the scientific basis for estimating recovery potential.

AB  - Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of bearings in high-speed rail have attracted considerable attention in recent years, however, it's still a hard work due to harsh environments with high speeds and high loads. A statistical condition monitoring and fault diagnosis method based on tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) is developed in this study. The core idea of this method is that the TQWT can extract oscillatory behaviors of bearing faults. The vibration data under the normal condition are first decomposed by the TQWT into different wavelet coefficients. Two health indicators are then formulated by the dominant wavelet coefficients and the remaining coefficients for condition monitoring. The upper control limits are established using the one-sided confidence limit of the indicators by using the non-parametric bootstrap scheme. The Shewhart control charts on multiscale wavelet coefficients are constructed for fault diagnosis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by monitoring and diagnosing single and multiple railway axle bearing defects. Furthermore, the comparison studies show that the proposed method outperforms a traditional time-frequency method, the Wigner-Ville distribution method.

AB  - Progressive growth of bush cover in dry savannahs is responsible for declines in range conditions. In southern Ethiopia, the Booran pastoralists assisted our understanding of spatial patterns of bush cover and range conditions in 54 landscape patch types grouped into six landscape units within an area of 30 000 km(2). The size of landscape patches sampled was 625 m(2). We assessed the relationships between bush cover, grass cover and bare soil and grazing pressure and soil erosion and changes in range condition. Externally, political conflicts and internally, break down of land use, and official bans on the use of fire promoted bush cover and the decline in range conditions. Bush cover was negatively correlated with grass cover, and positively correlated with bare soil. Grass cover was negatively correlated with bare soil and grazing pressure in most landscape patch types. Grazing pressure was not significantly correlated with bush cover or bare soil, while soil erosion was directly related to bare soil. Soil erosion was absent in 64% of the landscape patch types, and seemingly not a threat to the rangelands. The relationship between bush cover, grass cover, bare soil and soil erosion is complex and related to climate, landscape geology, and patterns of land use. Main threats to range conditions are bush climax, loss of grass cover and unpalatable forbs. Currently, > 70% of the landscape patch types are in poor to fair range conditions. Decline in range conditions, unless reversed, will jeopardise the pastoral production system in southern Ethiopia.

AB  - There are a number of challenges in developing better tools for the detection and diagnosis of pathological change in ecosystems.  The use of indicators can be improved by adopting a pluralistic approach, rather than relying on any one type of measure of ecosystem health.  This approach would best meet the need for three functions that indicators should serve in the context of ecosystem health:  (1) utility in diagnosis of pathological changes in ecosystems; (2) utility as an early warning indicator of ecosystem breakdown; and (3) utility in reflecting ecosystem integrity.  Understanding ecosystem breakdown and rehabilitation processes is enhanced by correlating, over space and time, the appearance of symptoms of pathological change with changes in stress loadings.  Such analyses, as illustrated by a case study of Kyronjoki estuary (Baltic Sea), are complex owing to both discontinuities in the response of ecosystems to stress, and lags between the onset of stress and ecosystem response.  As the practice of "ecosystem medicine" evolves, much is to be gained by shifting the emphasis from "curative" to "preventive" aspects.  Here a "salutogenic" approach, one that is focused on understanding the origins of health and mechanisms that promote "healthiness" might find ready applications.  Such an approach would suggest bolstering ecosystem coping responses to stress, thereby promoting greater immunity to the negative impacts of cultural disturbance.

AB  - Condition monitoring of planetary gearboxes in time-varying speed service is an important and actual engineering requirement, however, also an intractable task. The traditional sideband energy ratio (SER) method limits its application to complex operational conditions due to the frequency spectrum based and manual bandwidth selection. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive order-band energy ratio (AOER) method, an enhanced version of the SER, to quantitatively and intelligently diagnose gear faults under different operational conditions. First, a signal model based on angular increment and order components is proposed to properly describe the vibrations for both stationary and non-stationary conditions. The proposed model provides the theoretical source and reliance for the order spectrum analysis and the diagnostic mechanism of the OER. Second, the OER is theoretically proved to be a reliable fault indicator by analyzing the proposed signal model. The offset of the uncertainty terms highlighting the fault symptoms demonstrates the potential success of using OER for the fault diagnosis. Finally, OERs generated from the vibration data and three typical machine learning algorithms are used to adaptively obtain the optimal bandwidth and thus the AOER. The AOER can be directly used for the remaining vibration data of the corresponding operational condition. Comparing with SER and the convolutional neural network, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and outperformance of AOER for both stationary and non stationary operational conditions. More importantly, since AOER can cope with diagnostic tasks for different operational conditions, it enables an improved ability to monitor a PG's health in the actual complex environment.

AB  - The study involved 117 people aged 23 to 45 years, the staff of the Ministry of internal Affairs of Russia across the Belgorod region, as well as employees of territorial police departments, serving in units: patrol service of the police, traffic police and local policeman. Their examination was carried out by a complex of three psychodiagnostic methods. Based on the results obtained, it is concluded that in everyday conditions of service employees using adaptive mechanisms of coping behavior have a high level of expression of a number of indicators of psychological health, namely: self-acceptance", "acceptance of others", "adaptation" and "emotional comfort". In special conditions of service, they are characterized by high rates of "goals in life", "adaptation", "environmental management" and "self-acceptance". Employees who use non-adaptive mechanisms of coping with stress in everyday conditions of service have low values of indicators of "life goals", "personal growth"and" positive relationships". In special conditions of official activity low values of indicators of "autonomy", "personal growth" and "internality"are peculiar to them.

AB  - The paper detailed a water quality modelling study of a hyper-tidal estuary, undertaken to assess the impact of various bacteria input loads on the receiving waters in a coastal basin in the UK, by using the model developed in previous study of the same authors enterococci, used as the indicators for bathing water quality under the new European Union (EU) Bathing Water Directive, were numerically modelled using a hydro-environmental model. In particular, the numerical model used in this study includes the effects of sediment on bacteria transport processes in surface water. Finally, the importance of sediment bacteria inputs on the bathing water quality was also investigated under different weather and tidal condition. During spring tide, the bacteria input from the bed sediments are dominant for both wet and dry weather conditions. During neap tides and during dry weather conditions the inputs of bacteria from the bed sediment were still dominant, but during wet weather conditions the inputs from river were dominant. Under different tidal flow conditions some parameters had a more significant role than others. During high flow conditions the sediment re-suspensions processes were dominant, therefore the bed bacteria concentrations played a dominant role on the overall bacteria concentration levels in the water column. In contrast, during low flow conditions sediment deposition prevails and bacteria are removed from the water column. The partition coefficient was found to be more important than the bed bacteria concentrations, during low flow conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Systemic neonicotinoids are commonly used in forest pest management programs. Senescent leaves containing neonicotinoids may, however, fall from treated trees into nearby streams. There, leaf-shredding invertebrates are particularly exposed due to their diet (feeding on neonicotinoid-contaminated leaves) or collaterally via the water phase (leaching of a neonicotinoid from leaves) - a fact not considered during aquatic environmental risk assessment. To unravel the relevance of these pathways we used leaves from trees treated with the neonicotinoid thiacloprid to subject the amphipod shredder Gammarus fossarum for 21 days (n = 40) either to dietary, waterborne or a combined (dietary + waterborne) exposure. Dietary exposure caused - relative to the control - similar reductions in gammarids' leaf consumption (similar to 35%) and lipid content (similar to 20%) as observed for the waterborne exposure pathway (30 and 22%). The effect sizes observed under combined exposure suggested additivity of effects being largely predictable using the reference model "independent action". Since gammarids accumulated - independent of the exposure pathway - up to 280 ng thiacloprid/g, dietary exposure may also be relevant for predators which prey on Gammarus. Consequently, neglecting dietary exposure might underestimate the environmental risk systemic insecticides pose for ecosystem integrity calling for its consideration during the evaluation and registration of chemical stressors.

AB  - In coastal areas of the globe, open shell matrix sites are commonly used to establish regional chronologies of human occupation and identify patterns of cultural change, particularly for the Holocene, post-sea-level stabilisation period. Despite this, many basic sedimentary analyses that are routinely applied to rockshelter deposits (e.g. geophysical characterisation, particle size etc) are rarely applied to these sites. Magnetic susceptibility, occasionally used in rockshelters, has never been used to investigate shell matrix sites in Australia, despite several international studies identifying its efficacy for other types of open sites. This paper reports a pilot project applying a range of conventional sedimentary and archaeological analyses, as well as magnetic susceptibility at three anthropogenic shell mounds on Mornington Island, Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. Results are compared to, firstly, assess site integrity and, secondly, to ascertain whether magnetic signatures are related to cultural or natural site formation processes. The results establish that the mounds were repeatedly visited, despite the archaeological evidence, including radiocarbon ages, suggesting effectively 'instantaneous' deposition. This has important implications for studies of other shell mounds where the limitations of radiocarbon dating precision may also mask multiple deposition events. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - All of the plants and animals that make up freshwater aquatic communities are affected by salinity. Many taxa possess morphological, physiological and life- history characteristics that provide some capacity for tolerance, acclimatisation or avoidance. These characteristics impart a level of resilience to freshwater communities.
   To maintain biodiversity in aquatic systems it is important to manage the rate, timing, pattern, frequency and duration of increases in salinity in terms of lethal and sublethal effects, sensitive life stages, the capacity of freshwater biota to acclimatise to salinity and long- term impacts on community structure.
   We have limited understanding of the impacts of saline water management on species interactions, food- web structures and how elevated salinity levels affect the integrity of communities. Little is known about the effect of salinity on complex ecosystem processes involving microbes and microalgae, or the salinity thresholds that prevent semi- aquatic and terrestrial species from using aquatic resources. Compounding effects of salinity and other stressors are also poorly understood.
   Our current understanding needs to be reinterpreted in a form that is accessible and useful for water managers. Because of their complexity, many of the remaining knowledge gaps can only be addressed through a multidisciplinary approach carried out in an adaptive management framework, utilising decision- making and ecological risk assessment tools.

AB  - Although a large number of fish species have been introduced into Guangdong Province in Southern China, a few species, such as tilapia (Tilapia spp.), North African catfish Clarias gariepinus Burchell, mrigal carp, Cirrhinus mrigala (Bloch) and the sucker mouth catfish (Hypostomus sp.), have established natural populations and can be considered successful invaders in large rivers. The specific mechanisms underlying these contrasting results among different introduced fish species remain understudied. The relationship between multiple abiotic-biotic factors and the success of four invasive species was investigated using survey data for the Guangdong Province river ecosystem. In contrast to previous studies that have considered species-specific traits, the focus was on economic, ecological and anthropogenic factors to predict invasion success. Four main predictive indicators were found: (1) successful invaders were of low or no commercial value; (2) successful invaders tolerated a wide range of environmental conditions, including poor water quality; (3) biodiversity loss accelerated the growth of non-native populations; (4) human disturbance facilitated population growth and spread of invasive fish species. To lessen the impacts of invasive fish species, the selection of breeding species and breeding areas, maintenance of water quality and reduction in water pollution, protection of the diversity of fish species and reduction of human interference should be addressed.

AB  - One of the most crucial issues of recent environmental sciences is the topic of background concentrations of elements and organic compounds in various abiotic and biotic systems. The relationship between natural and anthropogenically altered concentrations of chemical species is a question that involves many implications in the geosciences, environmental and biological sciences, toxicology, and other related disciplines. This is especially important when interpreting geochemical and biogeochemical anomalies of toxic elements and/or organic compounds in various media. To better understand the potential impact of hazardous substances in the environment, we must become more familiar with their spatial and temporal distribution and with their behavior under different physico-chemical and biotic conditions. This review presents an assessment of the geochemical background concept as used by various authors. Different assumptions and approaches to this topic are presented, including direct, statistical, and integrated methods. Based on the results derived from geochemical and biogeochemical studies performed in selected forest ecosystems of Poland, an integrated method is presented. As a consequence of data processing, a normal distribution of data points was obtained using an iterative 2 sigma-technique. This method of estimating geochemical background is feasible and can be used for setting environmental quality standards or for studying the impact of anthropogenic pollution sources on the environment.

AB  - Degraded electrodes in a resistance spot welding system should be replaced to ensure that weld quality is maintained. Welding electrodes are subjected to different environmental and operational loading conditions during use. When they are replaced with a fixed interval, replacement may occur too early (raising maintenance costs) or too late (leading to quality issues). This motivates condition monitoring strategies for resistance spot welding electrode tips. Thus, this paper proposes a modified recurrence plot (RP) for robust condition monitoring of welding electrode tips in resistance spot welding systems. The overall procedure for the proposed condition monitoring approach consists of three steps: (1) transformation of a one-dimensional signal to a two-dimensional image, (2) unsupervised feature extraction with LeNet architecture-based convolutional neural networks, and (3) health indicator calculation. RP methods convert dynamic resistance waveforms to RPs. The original RP method provides an image with binary-colored pixels (i.e., black or white) that makes this method insensitive to the change of the waveform signal. The proposed RP method is devised to be sensitive to the change of the waveform signal, while enhancing robustness to external noise. The performance of the proposed RP method is evaluated by examining simulated aperiodic waveform signals with and without external noise. A case study is presented to examine the proposed method's ability to monitor the condition of resistance spot welding electrodes. The results show that the proposed method outperforms handcrafted, feature-based condition monitoring methods. This study can be used to accurately determine the lifetime of welding electrodes in real time during the spot welding process.

AB  - Suburban forest tourism is becoming the primary type of tourism throughout China. Unfortunately, little research on the interaction between forest landscape elements and eye movement behavior under audio-visual integrated conditions exists. Relevant audio-visual materials were collected from a field investigation in national forest parks in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, China. Based on these data, eye-tracking experiments were conducted to investigate participants' visual attention in audio-visual integrated conditions. The results revealed that participants' attention areas under silent conditions were smaller than those under audio-visual integrated conditions. Bird twittering, insect chirping, and water flowing tended to expand the visual attention areas on immediate woody plants, humans and traffic sounds tended to expand the visual attention areas on buildings and structures, whereas domestic animal sounds promoted larger attention areas on herbaceous plants. In addition, the landscape elements affecting participants' eye tracker indicators and subjective evaluation indicators were different in different acoustic environments. Therefore, the relationships between landscape elements and tourists' perceptual evaluation needs to be examined in different situations.

AB  - Pasture user groups have become an important tool by which development agencies have sought to improve rangeland condition and resolve inter-herder conflict. However the ability of these groups to improve rangeland condition in the Gobi Desert is rarely examined. In this paper, three and twelve year old pasture user group areas were compared with non-group areas. Herders and local officials in both group and non-group areas were interviewed to compare activities and institutions that may contribute to degradation through overgrazing. Soil and vegetation based indicators of rangeland condition were also assessed. There were some differences in indicators of rangeland condition between pasture user group and non-group areas, but little evidence of institutions or activities specific to the group that could explain this difference. Herders did not seek to manage grazing pressures for natural resource management aims, nor did they enforce or sanction the external spatial boundaries of pasture user groups. These results suggest that the ability of pasture user group to improve rangeland condition in the Mongolian Gobi Desert may have been overstated. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The breeding success, foraging strategies and abundance of penguin species are thought to vary according to the quality of near-shore marine environments. Little blue penguins (LBP), Eudyptula minor, in particular, are considered a candidate species for assessing near-shore marine productivity and integrity due to their limited foraging ranges and reliance on local resources, particularly during breeding. However, to assess their ability to be near-shore ecosystem indicators an understanding of what their "normal" dive patterns and population parameters from across New Zealand are needed. This research investigates diving behaviours and feather stable isotope values (as indicators of diet) of LBPs from southern (Pearl Island, Stewart Island/Rakiura, Nov. 2011) and central (Adele Island, Abel Tasman, Nov. 2012) New Zealand (NZ), two areas not previously studied, and compares them with LBPs from other areas of NZ. The diving behaviours of LBPs across NZ, are highly variable, not obviously linked with local geography and bathometry. These results and the NZ wide comparison indicates that LBPs are environmentally adaptable, which may make them difficult to use as ecosystem indicators across sites. However, with increasing knowledge of diving behaviours and population parameters of LBPs within a region, they are likely to be indicators of local changing marine environment.

AB  - We investigated the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2)-ambient (350 A mu mol CO2 mol(-1)) and CO2-enriched (1500 A mu mol CO2 mol(-1)) conditions of in vitro photoautotrophic system on two cultivars, 'RRIM600' and 'RRIT413' of rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) in an acclimatization process of 45 days. Survival percentage of in vitro rubber tree plantlets derived from somatic embryos under ambient CO2 was better than those under CO2-enriched conditions, especially in cv. 'RRIT413'. Subsequently, the survival rate of ex vitro transplanted plantlets was similar to the in vitro plantlets and abnormal morphological characters such as light-green leaves (SPAD), small leaves in cv. 'RRIT413' acclimatized under CO2-enriched conditions were demonstrated 30 days after the plantlets were transferred into the soil. Maximum quantum yield of PSII, photon yield of PSII, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate in cv. 'RRIT413' acclimatized under CO2-enriched conditions were sharply declined by 39.0, 50.6, 47.1 and 45.8%, respectively as compared to those acclimatized under ambient CO2 conditions. In contrast, the in vitro acclimatized plantlets of cv. 'RRIM600' were un-responsive under both ambient- and enriched-CO2 conditions. In conclusion, genotypic dependent in response to CO2 enriched conditions in in-vitro acclimatization of rubber tree plantlets was evidently demonstrated as a key result to regulate plant growth and development in ex vitro environments. Interestingly, soluble sugar contents (sucrose, glucose and fructose) were increased after transplanting the plantlets of cv. 'RRIM600' acclimatized under CO2-enriched condition into the soil and thus, can be considered as an adaptive indicator of ex vitro adaptation.

AB  - One of the most important bioindicators of change in habitat conditions, especially in tropical Africa, is change in insect diversity. In line with that, the dynamics of Orthoptera and Hymenoptera insect orders were studied and used as evidence of change in ecosystem health after a similar study on Lepidopteran groups revealed some level of degradation in the Tarkwa Gold Mine (TGM). Orthopteran and Hymenopteran species assemblages were sampled within the mine and characterised based on family diversity. Transect counts, sweep netting, malaise trapping and flight interception trapping methods were employed to sample abundance and diversity of insect assemblages of the above-mentioned insect orders. Results showed that few species belonging to these two orders were recorded within the mine, although the records were dominated by more aggressive and habitat degradation tolerant members as reported for the Lepidopteran group in a previous study. We conclude that records of diversity of these insect orders in this study shows a reduction in the ecosystem health within TGM. This finding is further proof that there is a general decline in biodiversity within the concession and hence care must be taken to encourage environmentally-friendly mining practices to avoid further degradation. Recommendations are made for environmental management to maintain more natural vegetation to serve as refugia for impacted animals within the concession.

AB  - Epigean ant communities in Atlantic Forest remnants of Sao Paulo: a comparative study using the guild concept. The guilds constitute a valuable ecological tool, because they allow conducting comparisons among environments under different conditions. The ants can be used as ecological indicators, mainly for the monitoring of degraded forest areas. The aim of this research was to study guild organization among the epigeous Formicidae living in Atlantic forest remnants of the State of Sao Patio, Brazil. Ant collections were performed in three distinct Atlantic forest biome areas: arboreal littoral vegetation ("restinga") (Cananeia), semideciduous seasonal forest (Piracicaba) and dense ombrophylous forest (Pariquera-Acu). After identification, the ant; were grouped into guilds, based on the ecological attributes of behavior and habit, according to the literature. Nine guilds were found: the semideciduous seasonal forest ecosystem presented eight of them, followed by the arboreal sandbank (7) and dense ombrophylous forest (6). The guilds found were: litter omnivorous and scavengers, granivorous species, specialist predators living in litter and soil, litter generalist predators, subterranean mealybug-dependent species, army ants, dominant or subdominants arboreal, that occasionally forage on the ground, soil or litter dominant and fungus-growers, using feces and insect body fragments. The guilds found can be used in the monitoring of the mirmecofauna in the Atlantic Forest biome, supplying insights for further ecological studies.

AB  - Species traits of 57 Odonata species occurring in the Austrian bioregion Eastern Ridges and Lowlands (ecoregion Hungarian Lowlands; Illies, ) were defined by factor loadings of 12 habitat parameters: stream sections crenon, rhithron and potamon; flow velocity; standing water; temporary water; size of water body; open water; open banks; submerged macrophytes; reed; and riparian trees. On the basis of the species-specific configurations of these habitat parameters, cluster analysis revealed seven dragonfly associations with different habitat needs: association of open waters, association of sparsely vegetated banks, association of reed and riparian trees, association of reed and submerged macrophytes, association of temporary waters, rhithron association and potamon association. Correlations between the associations' habitat requirements and the habitat parameters of the seven (near-)natural river types, which are present in this bioregion were performed to define river type-specific association compositions. From these results, a dragonfly association index was created to assess the ecological status of these rivers within the five-tiered system of the European Union Water Framework Directive, emphasizing hydro-morphological aspects by comparing the type-specific reference situation with the actual status quo of dragonfly colonization. The method was applied at different rivers, particularly for the purpose of evaluating restoration measures. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The study is an attempt to design a watershed scorecard by identifying and evaluating selected set of indicators, such as surface water quality, ground water quality, soil condition, agriculture condition, and forest condition, which accurately reflect the health of the watershed. Ur River Watershed in Tikamgarh District, Madhya Pradesh was taken as a case study to assess the watershed health. Evaluation was done by calculating different indices for the selected set of indicators and comparing them with the National standards and guidelines. Based on the performance of each indicator, the grades were assigned to the indicators which helped in designing the watershed scorecard. The results revealed that within the watershed, the forest and soil conditions need a considerable plan for improvement in order to maintain the ecosystem whereas the surface water quality, groundwater quality and the agricultural conditions requires protection as well as enhancement in certain areas.

AB  - The level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA), defined as random deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry, is assumed to reflect the developmental instability (DI) of an organism. Because environmental and genetic stress may increase DI, FA has been used to assess the level of stress experienced by, for example, fish. In this study, left-right asymmetry of lapillar otoliths was related to nutritional condition as estimated from RNA/DNA ratios, in order to investigate the utility of FA to detect feeding-related stress in Baltic cod, Gadus morhua L., larvae. Cod larvae in intermediate and good nutritional condition showed similar values of FA, and these were more symmetric than for larvae in poor condition. As increased levels of FA were restricted to larvae in a condition comparable to that of larvae experiencing at least 3 days of starvation in laboratory experiments, it is suggested that FA is an insensitive indicator of short-term feeding success of larval cod. However, FA can be used to reveal severely starved larva populations and probably also populations that have been subjected to prolonged sub-optimal feeding conditions.

TI  - Consensus processes in land use planning in British Columbia: the nature of success
T2  - PROGRESS IN PLANNING
LA  - English
AB  - The general goal of this research was to address the broad question, does consensus work in resource management decision-making? Its purpose was to identify success factors for employing the consensus decision-making model specifically in land use planning; to examine the models incepted by the government of British Columbia during the period 1992-1995; and to investigate the application and effectiveness of the models as actually employed in integrated resource planning in British Columbia. The specific objective was to develop a general diagnostic framework for evaluation, based on indicators and success factors derived from a review of pertinent literature; from interviews with stakeholder participants in these processes; through review of government documentation, and through interviews with government officials who design and manage those processes.
   Success factors to be tested and explored were compiled from the literature, through a pilot study, government reports, and previous evaluations, such as the CORE Vancouver Island survey. In-depth interviews were conducted with 50 managers and participants of consensus processes at all three levels, in eight planning regions of the province. As interviews of participants proceeded, any new factors which emerged were also added to the list below.
   Integrity of process Commitment of participants Openness Explicit objectives Early stakeholder identification Strategic communication Facilitator Solid information Clear policy guidelines Prescreening participants Training Neutral chair/process mgr. Interpersonal dynamic Clear operating principles Relationships Representative of constituency Funding Continuity of participants Local participants Meeting facility Plain language Size of group Budget, support of ministry
   Respondents rated, defined and discussed these factors, and answered general questions regarding success of consensus processes. From qualitative and quantitative analysis, using the spreadsheet program Excel, the following indicators (the top quartile) were determined to be 'critical' to the success of a consensus planning process: Integrity; Solid Information; Facilitator; Commitment of Participants; Explicit Objectives; Training; Strategic Communication; and Government Support. Based on an analysis of the definitions and comments of participants, an evaluation framework was developed for consensus processes in land use planning. This includes diagnostic questions, followed by further considerations and recommendations for some critical indicators. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rewilding is gaining importance across Europe, as agricultural abandonment trajectories provide opportunities for large-scale ecosystem restoration. However, its effective implementation is hitherto limited, in part due to a lack of monitoring of rewilding interventions and their interactions. Here, we provide a first assessment of rewilding progress across seven European sites. Using an iterative and participatory Delphi technique to standardize and analyze expert-based knowledge of these sites, we 1) map rewilding interventions onto the three central components of the rewilding framework (i.e. stochastic disturbances, trophic complexity and dispersal), 2) assess rewilding progress by quantifying 19 indicators spanning human forcing and ecological integrity and 3) compile key success and threat factors for rewilding progress. We find that the most common interventions were keystone species reintroductions, whereas the least common targeted stochastic disturbances. We find that rewilding scores have improved in five sites, but declined in two, partly due to competing socio-economic trends. Major threats for rewilding progress are related to land-use intensification policies and persecution of keystone species. Major determinants of rewilding success are its societal appeal and socio-economic benefits to local people. We provide an assessment of rewilding that is crucial in improving its restoration outcomes and informed implementation at scale across Europe in this decade of ecosystem restoration.

AB  - The conditions under which animals for scientific experiments are kept are essentially determined by hygiene and financial considerations.  The biological requirements of the animals are not always taken into account, particularly behavioural aspects.  The individual species and its ethological requirements demand appropriate ethical and scientific consideration, and the functional behavioural organisation provides the necessary basis for this.  Restrictive conditions result in physiological changes and therefore behavioural disturbances, which in turn cause suffering.  Neuroses in laboratory mice kept under standard conditions, in macrolon cages are described.  Suggestions for practical improvements in the conditions under which animals are kept, which acknowledge behavioural needs, are provided.

KW  - IDENTIFICATION
AB  - There is a large risk of damage, triggered by harsh ocean environments, associated with offshore structures, so structural health monitoring plays an important role in preventing the occurrence of critical and global structural failure from such damage. However, obstacles, such as applicability in the field and increasing calculation costs with increasing structural complexity, remain for real-time structure monitoring offshore. Therefore, this study proposes the comparison of cosine similarity with sensor data to overcome such challenges. As the comparison target, this method uses the rate of changes of natural frequencies before and after the occurrence of various damage scenarios, including not only single but multiple damages, which are organized by the experiment technique design. The comparison method alerts to the occurrence of damage using a normalized warning index, which enables workers to manage the risk of damage. By comparison, moreover, the case most similar with the current status is directly figured out without any additional analysis between monitoring and damage identification, which renders the damage identification process simpler. Plus, the averaged rate of errors in detection is suggested to evaluate the damage level more precisely, if needed. Therefore, this method contributes to the application of real-time structural health monitoring for offshore structures by providing an approach to improve the usability of the proposed technique.

AB  - Ecological vulnerability assessment is essential to environmental and resource management, especially given recent global warming concerns. However, evaluation of ecological vulnerability over large areas is difficult and complex because it is affected by many variables, including natural factors and human activities. Here, we propose a novel method to evaluate the vulnerability of an eco-environment with a typical ecologically fragile region, the northern and southern foothills of the Yinshan Mountains of Inner Mongolia, China (NSFYM), as a case study. The proposed method is based on the definition of the IPCC framework and remote sensing. The results showed that the ecological vulnerability in the NSFYM was moderate or high and had distinct regional variations in spatial distribution. Overall, 29% of the seriously and highly vulnerable areas appeared mainly in the highlands, where the natural conditions are poor and human activities have been developing rapidly. Additionally, 31% of the medium vulnerable levels occurred in the low lands, probably in response to agricultural practices. The areas that were found to have high ecological vulnerability exhibited high degrees of exposure and sensitivity and weak adaptive capacity and vice versa, consistent with the current understanding of the characteristics of ecological vulnerability. The integrated method proposed here will be useful for protection of eco-environments under climate change and proper planning for land use in the future.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi are major ecological players in temperate forests, but they are rarely used in measures of forest condition because large-scale, high-resolution, standardized and replicated belowground data are scarce. We carried out an analysis of ectomycorrhizas at 22 intensively monitored long-term oak plots, across nine European countries, covering complex natural and anthropogenic environmental gradients. We found that at large scales, mycorrhizal richness and evenness declined with decreasing soil pH and root density, and with increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Shifts in mycorrhizas with different functional traits were detected; mycorrhizas with structures specialized for long-distance transport related differently to most environmental variables than those without. The dominant oak-specialist Lactarius quietus, with limited soil exploration abilities, responds positively to increasing nitrogen inputs and decreasing pH. In contrast, Tricholoma, Cortinarius and Piloderma species, with medium-distance soil exploration abilities, show a consistently negative response. We also determined nitrogen critical loads for moderate (9.5-13.5kg N/ha/year) and drastic (17kg N/ha/year) changes in belowground mycorrhizal root communities in temperate oak forests. Overall, we generated the first baseline data for ectomycorrhizal fungi in the oak forests sampled, identified nitrogen pollution as one of their major drivers at large scales and revealed fungi that individually and/or in combination with others can be used as belowground indicators of environmental characteristics.

AB  - The presence of DDT and derivatives in the food web of freshwater ecosystems of Rangsit agricultural area, Pathum Thani province, Thailand were investigated from June 2004 to May 2007. By using gas chromatography (GC) with microelectron capture detector (mu ECD), DDT and derivatives in water, sediment, and 15 indicator species i.e., 2 producers; Eichhornia crassipes and plankton (phyto- and zoo-plankton), an herbivore; Trichogaster microlepis (3) 3 omnivores; Trichogaster trichopterus, Oreochromis niloticus, and Puntius gonionotus, 6 carnivores; Channa striatus, Oxyeleotris marmoratus, Macrognathus siamensis, Parambassis siamensis, Anabas testudineus, and Pristolepis fasciatus, and 3 detritivores; Macrobrachium lanchesteri, Pomacea sp., and Filopaludina mertensi were measured. Results show low concentration levels (part per billion) of DDT and derivatives in each food web compartment i.e. water, sediment, aquatic plant, plankton, fish, and invertebrates. Magnification patterns, i.e. bioconcentration, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification, based on habitat and foraging behavior of selected freshwater species indicates that DDT and derivatives can accumulate and be magnified through the food chain from the lowest up to the highest trophic level. Therefore, the presence of residues and the evidence of magnification patterns can be observed as ecological indicators for evaluating ecological health risk. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pipe elbows (bends) are considered critical pressurized components in the piping systems and pipelines due to their stress intensification and the effect of bend curvature. They are prone and hence more exposed to different corrosion failure modes than straight pipes. Late detection of such elbow damages can lead to different dangerous and emergency situations which cause environmental disasters, pollution, substantial consumer losses and a serious threat to human life. A comprehensive safety and reliability assessment of pipe elbows, including usage of prediction models, can provide significant increases in the service life of pipelines. It is well known that the limit pressure is an important parameter to assess the piping integrity. In this paper, the integrity assessment of damaged pipeline elbows made of API 5L X52 steel was done within the framework of numerical modeling using the finite element method (FEM) and finite element analysis (FEA). The evaluation of numerically FEM modeled limit pressure in the corroded elbow containing a rectangular parallelepiped-shaped corrosion defect with rounded corners at the intrados section was done and compared to different codes for calculating limit pressure. Moreover, the area with the corrosion defects with different relative defect depth to wall thickness ratios was FEM modeled at the intrados section of the pipe elbow where the highest hoop stress exists. The results showed that the codes for straight pipes could not be applied for the pipe elbows due to the significantly higher error in the obtained limit pressure value compared with numerically FEM obtained results. However, the results for modified codes, adapted for the pipe elbow case using the Goodall formula for calculation of the hoop stress in pipe elbows with defects are pretty consistent with the numerical FEA results. The notch failure assessment diagram (NFAD) was also used for the straight pipe and pipe bends with different corrosion defect depth ratios, while the obtained critical defect depth ratios further highlighted the criticality of pipe elbows as an essential pipeline component.

AB  - Membrane depolarization and ion fluxes are events that have been studied extensively in biological systems due to their ability to profoundly impact cellular functions, including energetics and signal transductions. While both fluorescent and electrophysiological methods, including electrode usage and patch-clamping, have been well developed for measuring these events in eukaryotic cells, methodology for measuring similar events in microorganisms have proven more challenging to develop given their small size in combination with the more complex outer surface of bacteria shielding the membrane. During our studies of death-initiation in Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), we wanted to elucidate the role of membrane events, including changes in polarity, integrity, and intracellular ion concentrations. Searching the literature, we found that very few studies exist. Other investigators had monitored radioisotope uptake or equilibrium to measure ion fluxes and membrane potential and a limited number of studies, mostly in Gram-negative organisms, had seen some success using carbocyanine or oxonol fluorescent dyes to measure membrane potential, or loading bacteria with cell-permeant acetoxymethyl (AM) ester versions of ion-sensitive fluorescent indicator dyes. We therefore established and optimized protocols for measuring membrane potential, rupture, and ion-transport in the Gram-positive organism S. pneumoniae. We developed protocols using the bis-oxonol dye DiBAC(4)(3) and the cell-impermeant dye propidium iodide to measure membrane depolarization and rupture, respectively, as well as methods to optimally load the pneumococci with the AM esters of the ratiometric dyes Fura-2, PBFI, and BCECF to detect changes in intracellular concentrations of Ca2+, K+, and H+, respectively, using a fluorescence-detection plate reader. These protocols are the first of their kind for the pneumococcus and the majority of these dyes have not been used in any other bacterial species. Though our protocols have been optimized for S. pneumoniae, we believe these approaches should form an excellent starting-point for similar studies in other bacterial species.

AB  - Metal oxide varistors (MOVs) are widely used to protect electrical and electronic devices that are very vulnerable to surges due to the low insulation level of the equipment. MOVs deteriorate gradually due to manufacturing defects, mechanical and thermal stress, or repeated protective operations against surges. These defects result in the thermal runaway of MOV and finally lead to the explosion and electric fire of electrical and electronic devices due to a short circuit and a line-to-ground fault. Therefore, the reliable assessment of the condition of MOV deterioration is required for electrical and electronic equipment. However, when most accelerated degradation tests for the MOV have been performed to date, an 8/20 mu s standard surge current is applied under de-energized conditions, which is unlike the actual operating environment. In this study, a surge generator was designed to apply a surge current to MOVs to monitor their deterioration. Three different types of leakage currents were measured to analyze the change rates of their electrical characteristics of MOVs by comparing them with the reference voltage variation. Furthermore, the condition assessment of MOV deterioration under energized and de-energized conditions was investigated.

AB  - The efficiency of long-distance acoustic signalling of insects in their natural habitat is constrained in several ways. Acoustic signals are not only subjected to changes imposed by the physical structure of the habitat such as attenuation and degradation but also to masking interference from co-occurring signals of other acoustically communicating species. Masking interference is likely to be a ubiquitous problem in multi-species assemblages, but successful communication in natural environments under noisy conditions suggests powerful strategies to deal with the detection and recognition of relevant signals. In this review we present recent work on the role of the habitat as a driving force in shaping insect signal structures. In the context of acoustic masking interference, we discuss the ecological niche concept and examine the role of acoustic resource partitioning in the temporal, spatial and spectral domains as sender strategies to counter masking. We then examine the efficacy of different receiver strategies: physiological mechanisms such as frequency tuning, spatial release from masking and gain control as useful strategies to counteract acoustic masking. We also review recent work on the effects of anthropogenic noise on insect acoustic communication and the importance of insect sounds as indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem health.

AB  - Use of indicator species as a measure of ecosystem conditions is an established science application in environmental management. Because of its role in shaping wetland systems, the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is one of the ecological indicators for wetland restoration in south Florida, USA. We conducted landscape-level aerial surveys of alligator holes in two different habitats in a wetland where anthropogenic modification of surface hydrology has altered the natural system. Alligator holes were scarcer in an area where modified hydrology caused draining and frequent dry-clowns compared to another area that maintains a functional wetland system. Lower abundance of alligator holes indicates lack of alligator activities, lower overall species diversity, and lack of dry-season aquatic refugia for other organisms. The occupancy rate of alligator holes was lower than the current restoration target for the Everglades, and was variable by size class with large size-class alligators predominantly occupying alligator holes. This may indicate unequal size-class distribution, different habitat selection by size classes, or possibly a lack of recruitment. Our study provides pre-restoration baseline information about one indicator species for the Everglades. Success of the restoration can be assessed via effective synthesis of information derived by collective research efforts on the entire suite of selected ecological indicators. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - At present, the European Union legislation facilitates the use of similar pesticides among European Member States, thereby assuming that biodiversity and ecosystems have equal sensitivities to contaminants throughout the whole of Europe. However, with this assumption, fundamental environmental and biological differences between climatic zones are being ignored in Environmental Risk Assessment. Such differences may strongly influence the behaviour of contaminants, their effects on biodiversity and on the natural functioning of ecosystems. Furthermore, toxicity testing in European ecoregions other than cold-temperate has largely depended on standardized tests using cold-temperate species and conditions, which may lead to a false estimation of risks to organisms from other ecoregions. The present study aim was to determine the response of freshwater macroinvertebrate communities to the fungicide pyrimethanil by conducting aquatic mesocosm experiments in two different ecoregions with different climates: cold-temperate (Frankfurt, Germany) and warm-temperate (Coimbra, Portugal). The results indicate that the community in the cold-temperate climate was more sensitive to the fungicide in comparison to the warm-temperate community. This difference was most likely related to a different rate of fungicide disappearance, which was slower in the colder climate. Based upon our results we discuss important implications for improving Environmental Risk Assessment across climate zones and under present-day global climate change scenarios. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Trophic level (TL)-based indicators have been widely used to examine fishing impacts in aquatic ecosystems and the induced biodiversity changes. However, much debate has ensued regarding discrepancies and challenges arising from the use of landings data from commercial fisheries to calculate TL indicators. Subsequent studies have started to examine survey-based and model-based indicators. In this paper, we undertake an extensive evaluation of a variety of TL indicators across 9 well-studied marine ecosystems by making use of model-as well as surveyand catch-based TL indicators. Using detailed regional information and data on fishing history, fishing intensity, and environmental conditions, we evaluate how well TL indicators are capturing fishing effects at the community level of marine ecosystems. Our results highlight that the differences observed between TL indicator values and trends is dependent on the data source and the TL cut-off point used in the calculations and is not attributable to an intrinsic problem with TL-based indicators. All 3 data sources provide useful information about the structural changes in the ecosystem as a result of fishing, but our results indicate that only model-based indicators represent fishing impacts at the whole ecosystem level.

AB  - The destruction of natural habitats and the associated loss of Ecosystem Services (ES) are rarely jointly assessed and quantified in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Based on a terrestrial transport infrastructure project, the objective of this paper is to quantify the potential loss of ES associated with direct and indirect impacts, and illustrate their contribution to decision-making for route options. We first quantify how much of each type of ES is generated by different land units in the absence of the infrastructure (baseline conditions). We then estimate ES loss caused by infrastructure construction in a way that discriminates among different types of ES and losses because some ES, in addition to losses that are directly proportional to the surface impacted, can show additional indirect losses associated with landscape connectivity. In addition, we illustrate how the assessment of threshold effects in particular ecosystem types that may be most sensitive to their occurrence can affect the estimation of ES loss. We compare implementation options to provide an example of how choices can be improved by assessing ES loss associated with a combination of direct and indirect impacts. This kind of analysis could be used more generally to assess development projects simply by adapting the framework of analysis to the type of project and the ecosystems concerned.

AB  - The management of marine fisheries needs to undergo dramatic change in the new millennium, in response to the well-documented evidence of global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks. The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless underlie current approaches to the management of living marine resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While open-access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have access to the resource year-round throughout its range. Despite quotas, the nominal control of capacity and technical measures protecting juveniles, top-down management has generally been unable to prevent stock depletion, particularly of the older spawners that for demersal stocks often support recruitment.
   An integrated solution to the complexity of managing wild resources seems not to have been achieved. Any new paradigm should assert the basic unpredictability of fisheries at the system level and require a broader range of performance indicators to be incorporated into the decisional framework. This must reflect the non-equilibrium nature of marine systems, and give greater importance to resource (as opposed to harvest) continuity in the face of regime shifts, and promote habitat restoration and conservation of genetic resources.
   The new management framework requires co-management and collective decision-making to be incorporated within a precautionary and pre-negotiated management framework. This must explicitly recognize that decision-making occurs in conditions of model-based uncertainty and precautionary approaches should be incorporated at all levels, not least of which is to avoid the assumption that all resources can be harvested in a sustainable fashion through time. Redundancy in data inputs to management are needed to avoid the surprises that model-based sampling occasionally leads to, for example, when regime changes reduce productivity in response to climatic fluctuations. Emergency frameworks imposing non-discretionary rules must be invoked when overfishing and/or regime change trigger reference points indicating stock depletion. Non-discretionary recovery plans should then override rights-based systems and persist until fish populations recover to pre-established healthy levels, which may in turn need to await the return of a favourable regime.
   In fact, some stocks may require periodic rebuilding after regime-induced collapses or because of a combination of ecological or economic impacts, hence a constant harvest policy may not always be possible. It will probably also be necessary to discard the axiom that a stock should be available to harvesting throughout its range and seasonal cycle. Technological advances mean that time- and area-specific access rights are now practical options, through satellite monitoring of vessel operations, even offshore.
   More fundamentally, the basic axiom of 'enlightened self interest' underlying current methods of management will need to be tempered by an increased ethical concern for the fragility of natural ecosystems.

AB  - Very few studies to date have exploited Drosophilids as potential bio-indicators of biodiversity or ecological integrity. Here we investigate the Drosophila assemblage as a bioindication system especially for the management of tropical areas with high rates of habitat destruction and biodiversity loss. Several sampling surveys were carried out for more than a year along an altitudinal gradient at six stations in the Garhwal region to provide information about the composition of the drosophilid community. Various diversity indices, constancy method and cluster analysis were used to analyse species occurrence. The ecological indices showed a possible positive association between species abundance and environmental heterogeneity of the studied areas. Mandal (1600 m asl) being a transition area between sub-tropical and temperate zones, with a high degree of heterogeneity in climate and vegetation, proved to be most diverse of all stations studied. Consistent with the fact that the corridor from Mandal via Kanchula-Kharak upto Chopta is already advocated as a protected zone, our study proposes usage of drosophilid assemblage composition as a very efficient and accurate tool for future selection and design of protected areas in the region.

AB  - The quality of the day-old broiler chick is foremost in the minds of many poultry managers. From fertilised ovum to the placement at the broiler farm, some factors such as the characteristics of the incubating eggs, the egg holding conditions, the incubation conditions and the conditions that exist between hatching and placement at the farm and their interactions may affect chick quality. It may be questioned if maximal hatchability is the best indicator for chick quality and/or post-hatching viability, even if optimal hatchability is considered a prerequisite for successful incubation. The environmental conditions during incubation (e.g. the temperature, humidity and ventilation rate (carbon dioxide concentration)) are not set independently from each other, although each may have its own optimum for hatchability and chick quality. These optima for each incubation factor may alter differentially according to the characteristics of the incubating egg. It is concluded that more independent control as well as more control of the variability of the classical physical conditions in the incubator are required in order to improve hatchability and chick quality.

AB  - The root disease take-all, caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, can be managed by monoculture-induced take-all decline (TAD). This natural biocontrol mechanism typically occurs after a take-all outbreak and is believed to arise from an enrichment of antagonistic populations in the rhizosphere. However, it is not known whether these changes are induced by the monoculture or by ecological rhizosphere conditions due to a disease outbreak and subsequent attenuation. This question was addressed by comparing the rhizosphere microflora of barley, either inoculated with the pathogen or noninoculated, in a microcosm experiment in five consecutive vegetation cycles. TAD occurred in soil inoculated with the pathogen but not in noninoculated soil. Bacterial community analysis using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S rRNA showed pronounced population shifts in the successive vegetation cycles, but pathogen inoculation had little effect. To elucidate rhizobacterial dynamics during TAD development, a 16S rRNA-based taxonomic microarray was used. Actinobacteria were the prevailing indicators in the first vegetation cycle, whereas the third cycle-affected most severely by take-all-was characterized by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, and Acidobacteria. Indicator taxa for the last cycle (TAD) belonged exclusively to Proteobacteria, including several genera with known biocontrol traits. Our results suggest that TAD involves monoculture-induced enrichment of plant-beneficial taxa.

A state-of-the-art framework for implementing an integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA), the NOAA IEA approach, is used as an example to demonstrate whether and how assessment in ecosystem-based management (EBM), as often implemented in fisheries, can be expected to facilitate planned adaptation. Using comparisons with another assessment framework developed for implementing a climate change adaptation project, the United Nations Development Programme-Global Environment Facility Adaptation Policy Framework (UNDP-GEF APF), this paper expands and operationalizes the concepts of managing for resilience versus change in EBM as presented by West et al.(). It first introduces a variety of terms from climate change adaptation literature to help institutionalize "planned adaptation" as a useful concept within fisheries, then presents an expanded map of adaptive management processes in EBM. Finally, it proposes steps for enhancing processes supporting planned adaptation in individual applications of EBM in fisheries. Steps include (i) recognizing interest and funding for adaptation planning as prerequisites, (ii) evaluating what information or actors are lacking to implement better planning, and (iii) determining what institutional processes within an adaptive management cycle need augmentation.

AB  - Dormancy is a bet-hedging strategy used by a variety of organisms to overcome unfavorable environmental conditions. By entering a reversible state of low metabolic activity, dormant individuals become members of a seed bank, which can determine community dynamics in future generations. Although microbiologists have documented dormancy in both clinical and natural settings, the importance of seed banks for the diversity and functioning of microbial communities remains untested. Here, we develop a theoretical model demonstrating that microbial communities are structured by environmental cues that trigger dormancy. A molecular survey of lake ecosystems revealed that dormancy plays a more important role in shaping bacterial communities than eukaryotic microbial communities. The proportion of dormant bacteria was relatively low in productive ecosystems but accounted for up to 40% of taxon richness in nutrient-poor systems. Our simulations and empirical data suggest that regional environmental cues and dormancy synchronize the composition of active communities across the landscape while decoupling active microbes from the total community at local scales. Furthermore, we observed that rare bacterial taxa were disproportionately active relative to common bacterial taxa, suggesting that microbial rank-abundance curves are more dynamic than previously considered. We propose that repeated transitions to and from the seed bank may help maintain the high levels of microbial biodiversity that are observed in nearly all ecosystems.

AB  - Diatom ecology and species compositional patterns across current arctic treeline can provide important paleoecological information associated with climatic and environmental change. In this paper we examine the relationships between measured environmental variables and modem diatom assemblage composition from 77 lakes across the treeline ecozones of the Central Canadian Arctic. The weighted-average optima for selected environmental variables were calculated for 74 of the most common diatoms, and photographic plates of these taxa are included. Our results indicated that both forest-tundra and arctic tundra lakes differed significantly in diatom assemblage composition from boreal forest lakes. In general, planktonic diatom taxa (e.g., Cyclotella species) were more common in forested lakes, which may be due to ecological conditions related to climate. Small, benthic, alkaliphilic Fragilaria taxa reached their highest abundances in forested lakes, likely because of the more alkaline nature of these lakes. Arctic tundra lakes were characterized by higher abundances of circumneutral to acidophilic taxa. Heavily silicified Aulacoseira taxa (e.g., Aulacoseira lirata, Aulacoseira perglabra) were more common in deeper tundra lakes, likely because of the less alkaline nature of these lakes and greater wind-induced turbulence in this zone. These trends provide important information on the variability of aquatic ecosystems across this climatically sensitive vegetational gradient.

AB  - Watersheds are useful templates for wetland protection and land use planning because they integrate cumulative effects that better inform site-specific management decisions. The goal of this study was to demonstrate application of a three-tiered assessment paradigm in the San Gabriel watershed (Los Angeles County, California) that incorporates monitoring at varying spatial scales and intensities. Data on wetland extent and distribution, habitat condition using rapid assessment, and intensive site monitoring were used to show how different levels of assessment can be used together to provide a deeper contextual understanding of overall wetland condition. Wetland sites in the less developed portions of the watershed were of higher overall condition compared to sites located in the more urbanized portions of the watershed. GIS analysis revealed that percent impervious surface is a useful landscape-scale indicator of riverine wetland condition. Furthermore, rapid assessment metrics were significantly correlated with stressors found at sites. Significant correlations also existed between riverine habitat condition, water chemistry, and benthic macroinvertebrate communities across streams in this watershed. This study highlights the following key concepts: (1) application of a multiple indicator approach at different spatial scales and sampling intensities promotes a better understanding of the causal relationships between land use, wetland condition, and anthropogenic stress, (2) a multi-tiered monitoring approach can provide a cost-effective means of integrating wetland status and trends assessments into routine watershed monitoring programs, and (3) a three tiered approach to monitoring provides wetland managers with an effective organizational tool that can be used to prioritize management activities.

AB  - Physiological indicators of fitness present a measure of an organism's response to a changing environment. An analysis of how these organisms allocate and store their energy resources provides an understanding of how they cope with such environmental changes. Each individual has to balance the investment necessary to acquire a certain resource with the energy gained by it. This trade-off can be monitored by measuring several physiological indicators of fitness such as energy storage components, metabolic state or RNA/DNA ratio. Because environmental adaptations and ecological strategies of survival are best examined within the natural environment, our research has to rely on the physiological indicators that are easily accessible in the field. The physiological indicators presented here are significant for an individual's fitness and in turn lead to reliable values in field-collected samples. Based on our own expertise and on a literature survey, the physiological relevance of the presented indicators is explained. Furthermore, some consideration to the analytical methods used to obtain the physiological indicators is given, and possible errors introduced at the sampling site and during the laboratory procedures are discussed. This work demonstrates that the integration of ecological and physiological expertise facilitates the identification of future ecological problems much earlier than separate approaches of both disciplines alone.

AB  - It is generally expected that the three dimensions of the economy, society and the environment must be included in any measurable sustainability pathway. However, these do not provide much guidance as to how to prioritize impacts within and between the dimensions. A conceptualized approach to sustainability based on the nested model is therefore presented seeking to provide an alternative approach to sustainable transportation assessment, namely the SUSTAIN Decision Support System (DSS) model. This model is based on a review of basic notions of sustainability presented by the Brundtland Commission report, which is used to validate the nested model of sustainability for countries operating under the paradox of affluence. This provides a theoretical rationale for prioritising longer-term ecological integrity over shorter-term economic concerns, in line with the stronger conceptualisation of sustainability supported by ecological economists. This conceptualisation is operationalized by the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and a multiplicative version of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The planning and decision-making process related to a new connection across the Roskilde Fjord in Frederikssund, Denmark, is used as a case study. It is found that the SUSTAIN DSS model results provide a type of benchmark for connecting to the essence of sustainable development as well as to integrate sustainability more explicitly into the planning and assessment practice.

AB  - Paleolimnological techniques are important for determining background ecological conditions and ecosystem responses to stressors when long- term data sets are absent. Research at the Dorset Environmental Sciences Centre (Ontario, Canada) has included paleolimnological studies to determine the effects of anthropogenic stressors on shield lakes, including eutrophication, acidic deposition, and climate change. Diatom- based total phosphorus (TP) inferences suggest that [TP] has declined in some lakes, despite increased inputs from anthropogenic sources. When coupled with siliceous algae- based pH inferences that suggest landscape- scale long- term acidification, these results indicate that the ecological effects of anthropogenic P inputs are being masked by the cumulative effects of multiple stressors. Detailed stratigraphic analyses of lakes that have experienced severe anthropogenic disturbances indicate that despite measured and inferred recovery in epilimnetic [TP] to predisturbance concentrations, pelagic communities have not recovered to predisturbance community composition; profundal communities and the variables associated with water quality (e. g., hypolimnetic oxygen) have also not recorded recovery. This suggests that (i) typical modeling approaches to quantify the effects of anthropogenic inputs on lake water [TP] should be used with caution and (ii) lake management approaches that follow the paradigm of "water quality recovery = biological recovery" may not be applicable to ecosystems being affected by multiple anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - We evaluated the distribution of Chironomidae larvae (Diptera: Insecta) during four periods of the flood pulse. and the possibility of using them as bioindicators of ecological conditions in at, Amazonian lake impacted by bauxite tailings. The taxonomic composition was related to the presence of bauxite tailings comparing the natural area with the transition and impacted areas of Batata lake. Sediment samples (n = 5) were collected with a 50 cm(2) area corer sampler at each sampling station. during the four periods of water level fluctuation (filling. flood. drawdown. dry). from 1994 to 1996. Chironomidae larvae were identified under a microscope. using a 10 % lactophenol solution. Natural. transition and impacted areas were distinct when the physical and chemical parameters of the water column and sediment were compared. The functional feeding groups found were: 1 - predators. which swallow their prey in pieces or entirely (Ablabesmyia, Coelotanypus, Djalmabatista pulcher. D. sp. 1. Labrundinia. Tanypus and Cryptochironomus): 2 - collectors, typical taxa of depositional areas in lentic ecosystems (Chironomus. Cladopelma, Goeldichironomus, Fissimentum and Tanytarsini genera varia): 3 phytophylous fauna typically associated with aquatic macrophytes (Beardius, Harnischia and Polypedilum fallax): 4 - adapted to water level fluctuations (Fissimentum): 5 - detritivorous, adapted to high organic matter content (Chironomus and Polypedilum sp. 1). The low number of taxa and density of chironomids in the impacted area corroborated to the role of these organisms as bioindicators of anthropic influence in freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Pteropods have been a key focus of ocean acidification studies during the last decade due to their fragile aragonite shells and key role they play in polar ecosystems. Pteropods collected at sea are typically preserved before analysis at onshore laboratories. Despite the importance placed on pteropods as a sentinel for the impact of ocean acidification on marine calcifiers, there has never been a systematic study assessing how different preservation techniques affect the condition of pteropod shells. In this study we perform an experiment to assess the impact of six preservation techniques on the shell condition of Limacina retroversa pteropods. Using five shell condition-assessment methods, we find shells that were air dried were the least altered relative to the time of collection. Of the solution-based preservation techniques, shells were least altered when preserved in 70% buffered ethanol and most altered in a solution of sodium chloride buffered formalin. Our results have implications for the interpretation of pteropod shell condition in samples which have been stored in solution, and provide guidelines for the preservation of future pteropod collections.

AB  - Background and aims Functional traits are promising indicators of global changes and ecosystem processes. Trait responses to environmental conditions have been examined widely in vascular plants. In contrast, few studies have focused on soil lichens and mosses composing biocrusts. We aimed to evaluate the potential of biocrust tissue traits as indicators of changes in climate and soil properties.
   Methods Isotope ratios and nutrient content in biocrust tissue were analyzed in 13 Mediterranean shrublands along an aridity gradient. Differences in tissue traits between biocrust groups (lichens and mosses), and relationships between tissue traits and climatic and soil variables were examined.
   Results Lichens and mosses differed in delta C-13, delta N-15 and N content, indicating distinct physical and physiological attributes. Tissue traits correlated strongly with numerous climatic variables, likely due to a modulator effect on biocrust water relations and metabolism. We found contrasting responses of lichen and moss traits to climate, although they responded similarly to soil properties. Overall, the most responsive trait was delta N-15, suggesting this trait is the best to reflect integrated processes occurring in the atmosphere and soil.
   Conclusion Biocrust tissue traits arise as cost-effective, integrative ecological indicators of global change drivers in Mediterranean ecosystems, with potential applications in response-effect trait frameworks.

AB  - The nature of spatial autocorrelation of biota may reveal much about underlying ecological and biological factors responsible for producing those patterns, especially dispersal processes (drift, adult flight, etc.). We report here on assemblage-level autocorrelation in the benthic-invertebrate assemblages (retained in sieves of 300 mu m mesh) of riffles in two adjacent, relatively pristine rivers in southeastern Victoria, Australia (40-km reaches of the Wellington and Wonnangatta Rivers). These are related to patterns of autocorrelation in physical and catchment conditions ('environmental variables') in the vicinity of the sampling points. Both the invertebrate assemblages and environmental variables were autocorrelated at small scales (= 8 km) in the Wellington River in one of the sampling years (1996). Dissimilarities of invertebrate assemblages were correlated with dissimilarities of environmental variables in both sampling years (1996 and 1997) in that river. Environmental variables were autocorrelated in the Wonnangatta River, but this was not expressed as autocorrelation in the assemblages of invertebrates, which were not autocorrelated at any scale studied. Individual environmental variables showed different spatial patterns between the two rivers. These results suggest that individual rivers have their own idiosyncratic patterns and one cannot assume that even similar, geographically adjacent rivers will have the same patterns, which is a difficulty for ecological assessment and restoration.

AB  - Trophic structure of fish assemblages is one of the most sensitive indicators of changes in streams environments. Since it is crucial to understand the response of trophic groups to habitat alteration, our study aimed to address this research gap by assessing the influence of substrate composition, meso-habitat variability, and bank stability, on the richness, biomass, and number of individuals of carnivores, invertivores, omnivores, and herbivorous-detritivores. Using an electrofishing device, we sampled 13 Atlantic rainforest streams reaches in a degradation gradient, located in the upper Paranapanema river basin. Sample points were ranked using a physical habitat index. More pristine streams had high availability of twigs, trunks, rocks and boulders in the substrate, great meso-habitat variability, and the presence of roots, trunks, and rocks in the margins. Canonical correlations between habitat characteristics and trophic groups explained more than 90% of data variability. Richness and number of individuals of individuals increased in more preserved stream reaches, while richness of carnivores and number of individuals of omnivores decreased. These results demonstrate that trophic structure varies according to level of degradation, and that invertivore richness represents the best indicator of fish trophic structure responses to physical habitat alterations in streams.

AB  - Assessment of ecological status is crucial for establishing well-defined reference conditions for a lake. In this study, a model based on System Dynamics was developed to simulate the production, transport and distribution of the nutrients in Lake Chenghai, Yunnan Province, China. Application of the proposed model with a system retrieval technique yielded the variations in nutrient concentrations and eutrophication levels under different hydraulic conditions during the past several decades. Results showed that the proposed model is capable of describing the historical process of the lake's eutrophication after calibrating with the experimental data. The reference conditions for Lake Chenghai were proposed as follows: 0.0074-0.0091 mg/L for the total phosphorus concentration, 0.112-0.128 mg/L for the total nitrogen concentration, 0.859-1.081 ug/L for the chlorophyll a concentration, and 6.327-5.557 m for the Secci depth transparency. It provided an effective way to establish the nutrient reference conditions for the foundation of a lake's nutrient criteria, as well as the eutrophication control standards in China.

AB  - A key issue faced by land management in China involves finding ways to prevent the degradation of the farmland system, which includes not only the scale and quality but also the ecological function of farmlands. This study uses a classification model of farmland landscapes that categorizes farmlands as core, boundary, perforation, corridor, edge patches, and discrete patches to propose a prime farmland protection zone delineation model that layer-by-layer excludes single factors based on a 'function, quality, ownership, and environmental identification' basis. Prime farmland protection zones are delineated based on the quality division of farmland, spatial ownership indicators, and geographic environmental determination. Finally, the spatial regulation of farmland boundaries from a 'two lines, two zones' perspective is determined based on conflict and coordination analysis between the prime farmland protection zones and built-up land. The spatial regulation method for farmland protection proposed by this study is based on the strict protection of prime farmland and the maintenance of its structural integrity, which can benefit farmland protection around the cities of China and achieve the goal of orderly urban expansion. This study provides theoretical guidance for protecting productive farmland resources, limiting disorderly urban expansion, and maintaining the heterogeneity of regional landscapes.

AB  - The concentration of heavy metals in fishes is an important indicator of geomorphological or environmental integrity in aquatic habitats. Aiming to evaluate metal concentration in the muscles of fish native to the Apa River, Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB), we analyzed 124 individuals of eight fish species from the Cachoeira do Apa district (Porto Murtinho) from 2013 to 2014, including Brycon hilarii, Leporinus friderici, Megaleporinus macrocephalus, Megaleporinus obtusidens, Piaractus mesopotamicus, Prochilodus lineatus, Pterodoras granulosus and Salminus brasiliensis. The samples were frozen; in the laboratory, the musculature was removed, and the samples were digested using tri-acid etch solution. Later, the concentration of heavy metals was quantified in a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. A significant difference was observed in the concentration of metals in fish (F=27.79, p<0.001). Considering the multivariate comparison of studied species, we observed that P. lineatus had a much different pattern of metal concentration. P. granulosus also presented a pattern different from that of other species. No species presented a concentration of metals above the limit defined by Brazilian legislation; however, species differed in their metal concentrations according to position in the water column and feeding, suggesting that an integrated assessment of metal concentration may be an indicator of ecological differences in the obtaining of resources by species in aquatic communities.

AB  - Eisenia andrei was exposed, for 56 days, to a contaminated soil from an abandoned uranium mine and to the natural reference soil LUFA 2.2. The organisms were sampled after 0, 1, 2, 7, 14 and 56 days of exposure, to assess metals bioaccumulation, coelomocytes DNA integrity and cytotoxicity. Radionuclides bioaccumulation and growth were also determined at 0 h, 14 and 56 days of exposure. Results have shown the bioaccumulation of metals and radionuclides, as well as, growth reduction, DNA damages and cytotoxicity in earthworms exposed to contaminated soil. The usefulness of the comet assay and flow cytometry, to evaluate the toxicity of contaminants such as metals and radionuclides in earthworms are herein reported. We also demonstrated that DNA strand breakage and immune cells frequency are important endpoints to be employed in the earthworm reproduction assay, for the evaluation of soil geno and cytotoxicity, as part of the risk assessment of contaminated areas. This is the first study that integrates DNA damage and cytotoxicity evaluation, growth and bioaccumulation of metals and radionuclides in a sub lethal assay, for earthworms exposed to soil contaminated with metals and radionuclides.

AB  - Indicators of environmental impact and financial performance are compared for case studies of tropical forest logging from the Brazilian Amazon, Guyana, and Ecuador. Each case study presents parameters obtained from monitoring initial harvest entries into primary forests for planned, reduced-impact logging (RIL) and unplanned, conventional logging (CL) operations. Differences in cost definitions and data collection protocols complicate the comparative analysis, and suggest that caution is necessary in interpreting results. Given this caveat, it appears that RIL can generate competitive or superior profits relative to CL if the financial costs of wood wasted in the harvesting operation are fully accounted for. Increased operational efficiency is an important benefit of RIL, one that largely determines its cost-effectiveness relative to conventional practices. Uncertainties concerning the marginal benefits of RIL relative to familiar, profitable conventional practices pose an obstacle to broader adoption. Moreover, CL firms face few incentives to alter their operations unless they face dramatic changes in market signals. Adoption of RIL techniques as part of a long-term forest management regime faces additional challenges related to the opportunity cost of silvicultural prescriptions and timber set-asides to maintain productivity and ecosystem integrity.

AB  - This work introduces a semi-natural wetland biomonitoring framework for heavy metal concentrations based on a robust dynamic integration between biological assemblages and relevant biosensors. The cooperative/synergistic scheme developed minimizes uncertainty and monitoring costs and increases reliability of pollution control and abatement. Attention is given to establishing a fully functioning and reliable network approach for monitoring inflows and achieving dose-response relations and calibration of biomonitoring species. The biomonitoring network initially consists of both, biosensors and species, its a validation phase in each wetland of the surveillance area once the species monitoring efficiency is verified by the biosensors, the biosensor network moves to the next wetland and so on, following a circular Pattern until all area wetlands have a fully functional natural monitoring scheme. By means of species recalibration with periodic revisiting of the biosensors, the scheme progressively reaches a quasi steady-state (including seasonality), thus ensuring reliability and robustness. This framework, currently pilot-tested in Voiotia, Greece, for assessing chromium levels, has been built to cover short-, -medium and long-term monitoring requirements. The results gathered so far, support the employment of the proposed scheme in heavy metal monitoring, and. further, arise the need for volunteer involvement to achieve long-term viability.

AB  - This article examines the ecology of germination and the features of ontogenesis of the floating mat-forming hygrogelophyte Calla palustris L. in the territory of some regions in the central part of European Russia and the Republic of Belarus under laboratory conditions. It has been found that in the surveyed territory in the dense ear-like collective fruit of C. palustris, 40.7 +/- 6.4 fruits, juicy berries, are formed and the number of seeds produced (actual seed productivity), averages 164.0 +/- 89.3. Widely varying data on the number of berries in the collective fruit, as well as a variable number of ovules in them, shows that the seed productivity of C. palustris depends on a whole range of endogenous and exogenous factors, including the effectiveness of pollination of flowers by insects. In laboratory experiments, various storage periods (2 and 12 months) and methods of presowing seed treatment (stratification, drying, ice-freezing) were applied to simulate the ecological conditions of the growth of white alder. It is shown that freshly harvested seeds do not germinate at once, and wet cold stratification makes it possible to achieve maximum values of laboratory germination (from 84.4 to 99.0) and germination energy (from 66.6 to 88.3). Given that the features of germination are indicators of dormancy, it is demonstrated that seeds of C. palustris are in a state of shallow physiological dormancy, conditioned by the physiological mechanism of inhibition. Along with dry storage, wet cold stratification is the main way for seeds to enter a non-dormant state. Such mechanisms are consistent with the climatic features of the regions in which the species grows. It is found that C. palustris seeds, in common with many other species of hygrogelophytes, can float on the water surface for a long time (more than 30 days), spreading with water flow (hydrochoria). Seeds of C. palustris are photosensitive, germination is observed in a wide range of temperatures from 10-14 to 30 degrees C (at constant humidity), type of germination - underground (hypogeal). It is found that ontogeny of individuals of generative origin of C. palustris in the laboratory is terminated (the plants died after passing the juvenile ontogenetic state). The formation of C. palustris seedlings under laboratory conditions lasts 23-25 days and is characterized by the appearance of the main organs of the plant and the anisotropic growth of the shoot axis. At the final stage of development, the seedling is represented by a uniaxial monopodial and anisotropic growing rosette shoot with shortened internodes. The juvenile ontogenetic state in laboratory conditions lasts up to 7 months, after which the plants die off. In the framework of ontomorphogenesis, the stages of ontogenetic development under study (the seedling and the juvenile plant) correspond to the phase of the primary uniaxial rosette shoot. The plant in this period is represented by a uniaxial monopodially growing anchorage shoot. The detection of virgin plants in natural conditions indicates the possibility of their further development from the rudiments of generative origin. The main way of the species reproduction is vegetative, characteristic of most aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. In the course of ontogenesis, progressive features of development such as cotyledon greening and early death of the radicle root have been revealed.

AB  - A key issue in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive is the classification of streams and rivers using biological quality parameters and type-specific reference conditions. Four groups of stream types were defined in NE Spain on the basis of 152 diatom samples by means of detrended correspondence analysis and classification techniques. Diatom analysis was restricted to epilithic taxa. and the sites included gradients ranging from near-natural streams to sites with poor ecological quality. The main gradient shows a clear separation of sites in relation to the degree of human influence: polluted streams (mainly located in the lowlands) differ from streams in mountainous areas and in the Pyrenees. A second gradient is related to physiographical features. Headwater streams can be distinguished by their catchment geology. The type-specific diatom taxa for the stream types studied were determined by using indicator species analysis (IndVal). The type-specific taxa from near-natural streams are coincident with the indicator taxa for high ecological status. Human impact reduced the typological heterogeneity of the diatom community composition. Overall, the diatom communities in NE Spain exhibit a regional distribution pattern that closely corresponds with that observed in river systems elsewhere. Physiographical differences are only evident in undisturbed sites, while nutrient enrichment and other human disturbances may mask the regional differences in the distribution of diatom communities.

AB  - The Miankaleh wetland, one of the richest ecosystems in the north of Iran, has experienced an unprecedented environmental degradation caused by overexploitation of the water resources and climatic changes in recent years. This research aims to estimate the environmental water requirement (EWR) for the rivers that drain into the wetland. For this purpose, comprehensive data were collected through physiographic, climatic, hydrologic, ecologic, and field studies of the wetland and its drainage basin. To estimate the EWR, we applied several methods including the Tenant, the Eco-deficit, the flow duration curve, the Wetted-Perimeter method, and the physical habitat simulation model (PHABSIM) and the results were evaluated based on the natural discharge of the rivers before retrogression of the Miankaleh wetland. Further, the results showed that the consideration should be given to the Wetted-Perimeter and the PHABSIM Model for estimation of the EWR for the rivers of the Miankaleh wetland given the seasonality of the rivers and hydroclimatic condition of the study area. The mean annual EWR of the rivers was estimated between 0.12 and 2.03 m(3)/s, which is close to the values of the bank full flows. The current discharge of the rivers are less than the estimated EWR, showing the discharge rates do not meet the water requirement for aquatic species of the Miankaleh wetland

AB  - An emerging approach to ecosystem monitoring involves the use of physiological biomarker analyses in combination with gene transcription assays. For the first time, we employed these tools to evaluate the Pacific razor clam (Siliqua patula), which is important both economically and ecologically, as a bioindicator species in the northeast Pacific. Our objectives were to (1) develop biomarker and gene transcription assays with which to monitor the health of the Pacific razor clam, (2) acquire baseline biomarker and gene transcription reference ranges for razor clams, (3) assess the relationship between physiological and gene transcription assays and (4) determine if site-level differences were present. Pacific razor clams were collected in July 2015 and 2016 at three sites within each of two national parks in southcentral Alaska. In addition to determining reference ranges, we found differences in biomarker assay and gene transcription results between parks and sites which indicate variation in both large-scale and local environmental conditions. Our intent is to employ these methods to evaluate Pacific razor clams as a bioindicator of nearshore ecosystem health. Links between the results of the biomarker and gene transcription assays were observed that support the applicability of both assays in ecosystem monitoring. However, we recognize the need for controlled studies to examine the range of responses in physiology and gene transcripts to different stressors.

AB  - Uranium (U) presents a unique challenge for ecological risk assessments (ERA) because it induces both chemical and radiological toxicity, and the relative importance of these two toxicities differs among the various U source terms (i.e., natural, enriched, depleted). We present a method for the conversion between chemical concentrations (mu g L(-1)) and radiological dose rates (mu Gy h(-1)) for a defined set of reference organisms, and apply this conversion method to previously derived chemical and radiological benchmarks to determine the extent to which these benchmarks ensure radiological and chemical protection, respectively, for U in freshwater ecosystems. Results show that the percentage of species radiologically protected by the chemical benchmark decreases with increasing degrees of 0 enrichment and with increasing periods of radioactive decay. In contrast, the freshwater ecosystem is almost never chemically protected by the radiological benchmark, regardless of the source term or decay period considered, confirming that the risks to the environment from uranium's chemical toxicity generally outweigh those of its radiological toxicity. These results are relevant to developing water quality criteria that protect freshwater ecosystems from the various risks associated with the nuclear applications of U exploitation, and highlight the need for (1) further research on the speciation, bioavailability, and toxicity of U-series radionuclides under different environmental conditions, and (2) the adoption of both chemical and radiological benchmarks for coherent ERAS to be conducted in U-contaminated freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Protected areas are a cornerstone strategy for terrestrial and increasingly marine biodiversity conservation, but their use for conserving inland waters has received comparatively scant attention. In 2010, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) included a target of 17% protection for inland waters, yet there has been no meaningful way of measuring progress toward that target. Defining and evaluating "protection" is especially complicated for rivers because their integrity is intimately linked to impacts in their upstream catchments. A new generation of global hydrographic data now enables a high-resolution, standardized assessment of how upland activities may be propagated downstream. Here, we develop and apply, globally, a river protection metric that integrates both local and upstream catchment protection. We found that "integrated" river protection is highly variable across geographies and river size classes and in most basins falls short of the 17% CBD target. Around the world, about 70% of river reaches (by length) have no protected areas in their upstream catchments, and only 11.1% (by length) achieve full integrated protection. The average level of integrated protection is 13.5% globally, yet the majority of the world's largest basins show averages below 10%. Within basins, gaps are particularly severe for larger rivers.

AB  - The present study describes the spatial and temporal structure of the estuarine fish community in the internal sector of the Amazon Estuary. Samples were obtained in the main channels and tidal creeks of Guajara and Marajo Bays and Guama River. A total of 41,516 fish specimens were collected, representing 136 taxa, 38 families and 12 orders. In the dry season, the mean salinity of the main channel increased along a limnic-marine gradient, between the Guama River and the Marajo Bay. Species richness was lowest in the mouth of the Guama River and in the right margin of the Guajara Bay. Fish species composition and environmental guilds differed markedly among areas: Migrants and Freshwater Stragglers were dominant in the Guama River and the Guajara Bay, while Estuarine, Marine Stragglers and Migrants predominated in the Marajo Bay. However, the trophic guilds were still relatively well balanced, in functional terms. Piscivores and Zoobenthivores were the dominant feeding functional groups in all the studied areas. In this study, the assessment of the community and the use of the guild approach were efficient to describe the structure and functioning of the assemblages of estuarine fish also helping to assess the anthropogenic pressures in the area.

AB  - The search for generalities in ecology has often been thwarted by contingency and ecological complexity that limit the development of predictive rules. We present a set of concepts that we believe succinctly expresses some of the fundamental ideas in conservation biology. (1) Successful conservation management requires explicit goals and objectives. (2) The overall goal of biodiversity management will usually be to maintain or restore biodiversity, not to maximize species richness. (3) A holistic approach is needed to solve conservation problems. (4) Diverse approaches to management can provide diverse environmental conditions and mitigate risk. (5) Using nature's template is important for guiding conservation management, but it is not a panacea. (6) Focusing on causes not symptoms enhances efficacy and efficiency of conservation actions. (7) Every species and ecosystem is unique, to some degree. (8) Threshold responses are important but not ubiquitous. (9) Multiple stressors often exert critical effects on species and ecosystems. (10) Human values are variable and dynamic and significantly shape conservation efforts. We believe most conservation biologists will broadly agree these concepts are important. That said, an important part of the maturation of conservation biology as a discipline is constructive debate about additional or alternative concepts to those we have proposed here. Therefore, we have established a web-based, online process for further discussion of the concepts outlined in this paper and developing additional ones.

AB  - Advances in ocean observing technologies and modeling provide the capacity to revolutionize the management of living marine resources. While traditional fisheries management approaches like single-species stock assessments are still common, a global effort is underway to adopt ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) approaches. These approaches consider changes in the physical environment and interactions between ecosystem elements, including human uses, holistically. For example, integrated ecosystem assessments aim to synthesize a suite of observations (physical, biological, socioeconomic) and modeling platforms [ocean circulation models, ecological models, short-term forecasts, management strategy evaluations (MSEs)] to assess the current status and recent and future trends of ecosystem components. This information provides guidance for better management strategies. A common thread in EBFM approaches is the need for high-quality observations of ocean conditions, at scales that resolve critical physical-biological processes and are timely for management needs. Here we explore options for a future observing system that meets the needs of EBFM by (i) identifying observing needs for different user groups, (ii) reviewing relevant datasets and existing technologies, (iii) showcasing regional case studies, and (iv) recommending observational approaches required to implement EBFM. We recommend linking ocean observing within the context of Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and other regional ocean observing efforts with fisheries observations, new forecasting methods, and capacity development, in a comprehensive ocean observing framework.

AB  - Legislation in Europe has been adopted to determine and improve the ecological integrity of inland and coastal waters. Assessment is based on four biotic groups, including benthic macroinvertebrate communities. For lakes, benthic invertebrates have been recognized as one of the most difficult organism groups to use in ecological assessment, and hitherto their use in ecological assessment has been limited. In this study, we review and intercalibrate 13 benthic invertebrate-based tools across Europe. These assessment tools address different human impacts: acidification (3 methods), eutrophication (3 methods), morphological alterations (2 methods), and a combination of the last two (5 methods). For intercalibration, the methods were grouped into four intercalibration groups, according to the habitat sampled and putative pressure. Boundaries of the 'good ecological status' were compared and harmonized using direct or indirect comparison approaches. To enable comparison of the methods, three common pressure indices and two common biological multimetric were developed for larger geographical areas. Additionally, we identified the best-performing methods on their responsiveness to different human impacts. Based on these experiences, we provide practical mendations for the development and harmonization of benthic invertebrate assessment methods in lakes similar habitats. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Stressor (or human activity) gradients that quantify variation in the magnitude and type of human activity among sites are an important and widely applicable tool for aquatic monitoring and assessment. These gradients are typically determined from regional land cover data. We predicted that their performance could be improved by incorporating less generalized depictions of human activities. Using data from 479 rural, headwater basins we calculated four human activity gradients (HAGs) that differed in the level of detail (coarse, fine) and spatial explicitness (aspatial, spatial) used to describe human activity. Results demonstrated that the addition of fine detailed information was valuable as it resulted in a HAG that captured subtle differences in the extent of human activity among study units. In comparison, the addition of spatially explicit data added little novel information to the HAG. Analysis of fish and benthic macroinvertebrate samples from 160 of the 479 basins indicated that the addition of fine detailed and spatially explicit information significantly increased the ability of the HAG to predict variation in aquatic assemblages. We concluded that HAGs can better meet the requirements of monitoring and assessment programs if detailed and spatially explicit descriptions of human activity are used along with more typically available land cover data.

AB  - Ecological indicators are used for monitoring in marine habitats the world over. With the advent of Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM), the need for cost effective indicators of environmental impacts and ecosystem condition has intensified. Here, we review the development, utilisation and analysis of indicators for monitoring in marine benthic habitats, and outline important advances made in recent years. We use the unique, speciose benthic system of Western Australia (WA) as a detailed case study, as the development of indicators for EBFM in this region is presently ongoing, and major environmental drivers (e.g. climate change) and fishing practices are currently influencing WA marine systems. As such, the work is biased towards, but not restricted to, indicators that may be important tools for EBFM, such as biodiversity surrogates and indicators of fishing pressure. The review aimed to: (1) provide a concise, up-to-date account of the use of ecological indicators in marine systems; (2) discuss the current, and potential, applications of indicators for ecological monitoring in WA; and (3) highlight priority areas for research and pressing knowledge gaps. We examined indicators derived from benthic primary producers, benthic invertebrates and fish to achieve these goals.

AB  - The quality of life in our cities critically depends on the intelligent planning and shaping of urban living space, in particular urban nature. By providing a wide range of ecosystem services (ES), urban nature essentially contributes to the well-being of city dwellers and plays a major role in avoiding common diseases through its positive impact on physical and mental health. Health is one of the most important factors underlying human welfare and is, thus, vital to sustainable development. The ES of urban green space provide other social-cultural functions alongside public health, for example by fostering environmental justice and citizenship participation. Thus, they should always be considered when searching for solutions to urban problems. The aim of this research was to determine the impact of green areas in three selected cities on the health and well-being of people by self-reporting of green areas' visitors. To this end, we posed the research question: which types and characteristics of urban green space are most appreciated by city dwellers? Based on our findings, we have drawn up recommendations for practices to promote better living conditions. We have also pinpointed obstacles to and opportunities for leisure time activities as well as ways of supporting the public health of citizens.

AB  - Cleanup of Great Lakes Areas of Concern (ADCs) restores environmental benefits to waterfront communities and is an essential condition for revitalization. We define waterfront revitalization as policies or actions in terrestrial waterfront or adjacent aquatic areas that promote improvements in human socioeconomic well-being while protecting or improving the natural capital (the stocks of natural assets, biodiversity) that underlies all environmental, social, and economic benefits. Except for economic measures such as development investments, visitation rates, or commercial activity, evidence of waterfront revitalization in the Great Lakes is mostly anecdotal. We offer a perspective on waterfront revitalization that links indicators and metrics of sustainable revitalization to community goals and human beneficiaries. We compiled environmental, social, economic, and governance indicators and metrics of revitalization, many of which are based on or inspired by Great Lakes AOC case studies and community revitilization or sustainability plans. We highlight the role of indicators in avoiding unintended consequences of revitalization including environmental degradation and social inequity. Revitalization indicators can be used in planning for comparing alternative designs, and to track restoration progress. The relevancy of specific indicators and metrics will always depend on the local context. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.

AB  - The need to carry out monitoring programs for environmental pollution of coastal ecosystems makes it necessary to increase the number of indicator species in order to have a wide range of suitable organisms for most of the possible toxic substances and ways of exposure. With the purpose of analyzing the suitability of limpets (Patella spp.) for their use in biomonitoring programs, a literature review was performed on 88 cases found in the Web of Science online platform. The capacity of limpets to accumulate metals and hydrocarbons has been examined in several field studies. In most cases there is a clear relationship between body content of a pollutant in soft tissues of limpets and the corresponding environmental level. Likewise, different responses to pollutants have been reported in limpets, including induction of DNA damage, induction of metallothioneins, oxidative stress, decrease of Neutral Red retention or variations in heart rate. Regarding the study of changes in community structure, an uneven response to disturbances (e.g. oil spills, wastewater discharge) by species of the genus Patella has been documented. Moreover, generally limpets respond to pollutants similarly to, or even more effectively than, mussels; therefore, their inclusion as sentinel organisms in regional monitoring plans seems appropriate.

AB  - Testate amoebae are free-living shelled protists that build a wide range of shells with various sizes, shapes, and compositions. Recent studies showed that xenosomic testate amoebae shells could be indicators of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) deposition. However, no study has yet been conducted to assess the intra-specific mineral, organic, and biologic grain diversity of a single xenosomic species in a natural undisturbed environment. This study aims at providing new information about grain selection to develop the potential use of xenosomic testate amoebae shells as bioindicators of the multiple-origin mineral/organic diversity of their proximal environment. To fulfil these objectives, we analysed the shell content of 38 Bullinularia indica individuals, a single xenosomic testate amoeba species living in Sphagnum capillifolium, by scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with X-ray spectroscopy. The shells exhibited high diversities of mineral, organic, and biomineral grains, which confirms their capability to recycle xenosomes. Mineral grain diversity and size of B. indica matched those of the atmospheric natural mineral PM deposited in the peatbog. Calculation of grain size sorting revealed a discrete selection of grains agglutinated by B. indica. These results are a first step towards understanding the mechanisms of particle selection by xenosomic testate amoebae in natural conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Blackflies are important macroinvertebrate groups from a public health as well as ecological point of view. Determining the biological and environmental factors favouring or inhibiting the existence of blackflies could facilitate biomonitoring of rivers as well as control of disease vectors. The combined use of different predictive modelling techniques is known to improve identification of presence/absence and abundance of taxa in a given habitat. This approach enables better identification of the suitable habitat conditions or environmental constraints of a given taxon. Simuliidae larvae are important biological indicators as they are abundant in tropical aquatic ecosystems. Some of the blackfly groups are also important disease vectors in poor tropical countries. Our investigations aim to establish a combination of models able to identify the environmental factors and macroinvertebrate organisms that are favourable or inhibiting blackfly larvae existence in aquatic ecosystems. The models developed using macroinvertebrate predictors showed better performance than those based on environmental predictors. The identified environmental and macroinvertebrate parameters can be used to determine the distribution of blackflies, which in turn can help control river blindness in endemic tropical places. Through a combination of modelling techniques, a reliable method has been developed that explains environmental and biological relationships with the target organism, and, thus, can serve as a decision support tool for ecological management strategies.

AB  - This paper aims to assess the relative importance of the type of built-up area in structuring plant species composition and richness in urbanised environments. The study was carried out in the city of Brussels where all vascular plant species were recorded in 189 grid cells of 1 km(2) each. The effect of urban land use type on species composition was investigated using first Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Densely built-up area was the most powerful predictor for species composition, followed by industrial built-up areas, half open or open built-up areas with plantations, and open built-up areas with much natural vegetation in the surroundings. Indicator species were found for each type of built-up area and a response curve to the amount of built land was produced using Generalised Additive Modelling. Various types of built-up areas had different effects on environmental conditions as inferred by Ellenberg's indicator values, as well as on the species richness, species rarity, number of exotic species and proportion of extinction-prone species. It is concluded that future ecological studies should not treat urban areas as homogeneous areas by combining all anthropogenic factors into one aggregated variable. Instead, the urban matrix should be categorised in subsystems as it is multidimensional and highly variable across space.

AB  - Mangrove forests are coastal wetland that can be sinks for material derived from terrestrial and marine settings. This study aims to establish the abundance, distribution, and enrichment of rare earth elements (REE) to track the sediment sources and infer biogeochemical processes occurring in the mangrove wetlands. Five sediment cores were collected throughout the Pichavaram mangroves in November 2010. The sampling sites were chosen based on vegetation cover, land-use pattern, and human interference. The vertical profile of the retrieved sediment cores were subsectioned, air dried, and homogenized into a powder before analysis. Higher REE concentration in Pichavaram sediments indicates dominance of input from the natural sources like weathering. Preferential REE enrichment was attributed to the alkaline pH (7-8.5) and reducing conditions prevailing in the mangrove environment allowing removal of MREE and LREE by adsorption and precipitation as Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides in sediments. Post Archean Australian Shale (PAAS)-normalized plots depicted convex subparallel shale-like patterns with similar enrichment. Pichavaram sediments showed strongly positive Eu anomalies, similar to that observed in Kaveri River sediments, validating the origin of REE in Pichavaram sediments as an outcome of natural weathering of post-Archean charnockitic and gneissic terrane. Also positive Eu anomalies indicated the prevalence of reducing conditions in Pichavaram. Cores near the estuarine mouth showed highly mixed vertical profile as compared to the undisturbed mangrove sites. Principal-component analysis delineated three main processes controlling REE distribution in Pichavaram, namely natural weathering, inherent physicochemical processes, and in situ biogeochemical processes occurring in this mangrove environment.

AB  - Despite the great importance of shallow rocky communities (<30 m deep) due to their contribution to the biodiversity of coastal waters, most efforts in ecological status assessment of marine waters have been carried out in the implementation of soft bottom biotic indices. Therefore, in this paper, a methodology for the environmental evaluation of coastal rocky communities for the Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic), the CFR index (Quality of Rocky Bottoms), is presented. This index is based on the analysis of seaweed communities throughout the depth gradient, from the intertidal to the shallow subtidal, through the combination of a multimetric approach, which combines the richness of characteristic macroalgae populations, their total cover, the presence of opportunistic species and the physiological condition of the whole macroalgae community. Quality thresholds for these indicators are based on both ecological data and expert judgment. Finally, a preliminary application of this metric to sites with theoretically good and bad environmental conditions is used to analyze the suitability of the index. As a result, the four selected indicators responded in a significant way to the pressure gradient tested, proving to be appropriate for the type of pressure analysed and obtaining coherent results in the final quality assessment with the CFR index. In conclusion, the CFR index has proved to be an effective tool for the assessment of the ecological quality of coastal rocky communities, based on the analysis of macroalgae assemblages.

AB  - We compared heavy metal levels (manganese, iron, zinc, cadmium, copper, chromium, and lead) in tissues and shells of juveniles (13 +/- 2.2 mm), medium-size organisms with mature gonads (25 +/- 4.1 mm), and adults (35 +/- 1.2 mm) of the clam Tivela mactroides from three different locations along the Venezuelan coast: Playa Guiria, on the northeastern coast, was not affected by environmental pollution, but Rio Chico and Boca de Paparo, influenced by the Tuy River on the central coast, were. Heavy metal concentrations were related to shelf size, with significant differences among populations and shell sizes. Specimens from Boca de Paparo and Rio Chico had the highest heavy metal concentrations in tissues and shells, in contrast with the levels found in specimens from Playa Guiria, in which chromium and lead were absent. The high heavy metal concentrations found in tissues from specimens collected at Boca de Paparo and Rio Chico were possibly of anthropogenic origin and generated by the Tuy River. The environmental conditions at Boca de Paparo may have favored the bioaccumulation of most heavy metals in specimen tissues. At Playa Guiria, however, the heavy metal concentrations were found to be within a natural range. Our results show that T mactroides is a good biological indicator of the presence of heavy metals in the littoral waters they inhabit.

AB  - Microplastics are now synonymous with human impacts on the environment and as a threat to marine organisms. Numerous taxa are at risk from microplastics including commercially valuable bivalves as seafood, which are also disproportionately important as biogenic reef-forming species that enhance biodiversity such that they are commonly protected under conservation actions. As a sessile filter-feeding organism, bivalves are highly susceptible to microplastic ingestion but despite their socio-economic and ecological importance, no research has been undertaken to assess how a reef's structural arrangement might affect plastic ingestion. Here, using a series of flume experiments, we examined how change in spatial arrangement of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, interacts with different flow speeds to effect retention of microplastic over reef surfaces and ingestion risk by individual mussels. Our results show that clumped spatial arrangements reduce boundary layer velocities, and increase turbulence, boundary layer thickness and plastic retention over reef surfaces under faster flow conditions, increasing plastic ingestion by 3-fold. Our findings suggest that the structural arrangement and rugosity of natural reef structures may create natural sinks of anthropogenic pollution, and species like Mytilus that are also important species for human consumption, while disproportionately susceptible to microplastic pollution, may be useful bioindicators of microplastic pollution.

AB  - To detect when changes in response to stressors are occurring, biomonitoring programs require an understanding of shifts in biota that occur in response to anthropogenic and natural effects. Aquatic plants are expected to reflect the environmental conditions of ponds and, according to the European Water Framework Directive, macrophytes should be considered in ecological status assessments of inland surface waters. We assessed the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic impacts on submerged, emergent and floating-leaved macrophytes in 44 ponds in Duero river basin (North Iberian Plateau). Constrained canonical ordinations included 15 taxa of submerged macrophytes and 24 species of emergent and floating-leaved macrophytes. Although the proportion of variation explained by all selected variables was relatively low (37%), we found that submerged community composition reflected the influence of natural (habitat and biotic variables) and anthropogenic effects. However, emergent and floating-leaved macrophytes were not influenced by biotic variables. Variance partitioning showed that degradation category was the best predictor of both submerged macrophytes and emergent and floating-leaved macrophyte composition. However, submerged macrophytes were more affected by chemical variables, whereas emergent and floating-leaved macrophyte composition was best explained by land-use variables. The results of this study support the use of macrophyte communities as effective indicators of the ecological status of Mediterranean ponds.

AB  - A complex co-management system exists across Inuit Nunangat, whereby federal, provincial, territorial governments and Inuit organizations manage natural resources cooperatively. Under Inuit land claim agreements, Inuit knowledge, western science, and co-produced knowledge are to be used side by side to support decision-making. However, the mechanisms of effectively integrating these knowledge systems to inform decisionmakers remain poorly understood. This limits Inuit self-determination, hinders knowledge production, impedes resource governance improvements, and exacerbates communication barriers leading to tensions in marine resource management. It is also a barrier for scientists to utilize Inuit knowledge that exists in a different capacity, and vice versa. We discuss marine resource management indicators, positioning them as potential "boundary objects" around which different knowledge systems converge. We explore their role for not only monitoring ecosystems, but also for integrating knowledge in co-management. We summarize efforts at developing indicators and explore the extent to which they can take on information from different knowledge systems in support of improved co-management decision- making. Finally, we identify how indicators can be used as a facilitation tool for integrating knowledge systems while also generating new research questions and bringing forward management challenges that would otherwise remain out of the scope of researchers and resource managers.

AB  - The technological components regarding building cladding are designed for ensuring thermo-hygrometric comfort conditions within habitable spaces and realising smart buildings. Often the solutions adopted are identified referring only to the characteristics of mechanical and energy materials without considering the ecological-environmental properties in an urban context. Thus, it is appropriate to choose technological components not only according to material type, but also ecological aspects pursued through presence and/or structured integration of natural elements. The technical-design forms based on building-nature integration allows, on one hand, the sustainable soil use with multiple benefits (ecosystem services) that natural systems produce, on the other hand, the identification of technological solutions sized referring environmental quality levels achieved through appropriate natural species use. In this way, it can be obtained lower buildings investment and maintenance costs, and greater energetic-environmental benefits. So, it is proposed an evaluation protocol for settlement transformation interventions structured considering environmental effects obtained with Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs) into the project. According to ecological-environmental quality level achieved with NBSs, the technological component is sized according to preliminary design parameters (noise reduction and solar irradiation degree) obtained through NBSs. The total performance level of technological solutions is expressed using Economic-Environmental Indicators. The protocol is tested on social housing case in Anagnina district of Rome (Italy).

AB  - Mountain vegetation is considered highly sensitive to changes in land use, especially grazing regime and forest management. The aim of this study was to assess shifts in plant species composition in the Western Tatra Mts over the past 92 years and to determine environmental drivers that have caused changes in species composition. We resurveyed 47 vegetation plots assigned to three different types of vegetation, which were originally sampled in 1922. For each plot we recorded all vascular plant species, using the same methodology as in the original survey. For interpretation of the vegetation changes we used a set of ecological indicator values. The species composition of resampled grasslands was characterized by a higher proportion of nitrogen-demanding species on areas abandoned from livestock grazing. This reflects the higher susceptibility of grasslands located below natural treeline to changes in land use in comparison to those occurring on areas above the treeline, which may constitute a large threat to biological diversity of the Tatra Mts grasslands at the lower limit of their elevational range. Catastrophic windthrow constituted an important factor driving compositional dynamics in mountain spruce forests, creating a high diversity of microhabitats with suitable conditions for natural regeneration and development of the forest.

AB  - We exploit the pronounced and persistent low salinity layer in Doubtful Sound, southwest New Zealand, as a natural experimental system with sharp environmental gradients in which to study physical versus biological control of element incorporation into biogenic carbonate. Mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis transplanted to cages in the low salinity layer and saline layer in inner, mid and outer fjord habitats were used as biological integrators of physico-chemical conditions in each water mass over a period of several months. We used solution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to measure the concentrations of 15 elements (Li, B, Mg, P, S, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Cd, Ba, Pb) in the experimental shell growth and relate spatial trends to those in salinity and elemental sources. S concentrations were consistently below detection limits while Zn and Rb showed no spatial variability. The majority of elements were subject to environmental control, likely reflecting ambient concentrations and salinity. Sr incorporation showed evidence of strong biological mediation of environmental signals via the crystal shell growth rate. These findings are a valuable addition to the growing body of literature seeking to resolve physical versus biological controls of individual trace element incorporation into biogenic carbonates, and have important consequences for their use as environmental indicators or tracers for ecological studies.

AB  - Sediments have a major role in ecosystem functioning but can also act as physical or chemical stressors Anthropogenic activities may change the chemical constituency of sediments and the rate frequency and extent of sediment transport deposition and resuspension The importance of sediments as stressors will depend on site ecosystem attributes and the magnitude and preponderance of co occurring stressors Contaminants are usually of greater ecological consequence in human modified depositional environments where other anthropogenic stressors often co occur Risk assessments and restoration strategies should better consider the role of chemical contamination in the context of multiple stressors There have been numerous advances in the temporal and spatial characterization of stressor exposures and quantification of biological responses Contaminated sediments causing biological impair ment tend to be patchy, whereas more pervasive anthropogenic stressors such as alterations to habitat and flow physical disturbance and nutrient addition may drive large scale ecosystem responses A systematic assessment of relevant ecosystem attributes and referent e conditions can assist in understanding the importance of sediments in the context of other stressors Experimental manipulations then allow for the controlled study of dominant stressors and the establishment of causal links This approach will result in more effective management of watersheds and waterways Environ Toxicol Chem 2010 29 2625-2643 (C) 2010 SETAC

AB  - To assess possible environmental loads by neccessary agricultural inputs reproducable investigations are needed. Field measurements on the fate and the transfer of agrochemicals are difficult to perform under the strongly varying natural conditions. Therefore, a model ecosystem was created with lysimeter containers in a wind tunnel to have controlled parameters like wind, radiation, rain and soil temperature. Besides of experiments on the transfer and decay processes in agro-ecosystems the well controlled environment of the model ecosystem is also suited for testing, improving, and calibrating sensors. So measuring environmental loads, developing new sensor systems and verifying models is the three fold objective of the model ecosystem.

AB  - Surfactants and phenolic compounds are common organic pollutants in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. However, the ecological risks of their combination are still unknown. This study investigated the effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), phenol and their mixture on the growth and physiological responses of Ceratophyllum demersum L. Antagonistic effects were elicited with Phenol-SDS mixtures (<= 10 + 20 mg l(-1)). The results showed that photosynthetic pigments were sensitive to these toxins. The chlorophyll a, b and total chlorophyll of the plant significantly decreased under individual or the combined stress of SDS and phenol. Soluble protein content declined obviously in high stress conditions ( >= 1.0 mg l(-1) Phenol, >= 10 mg l(-1) SDS, >= 0.5 + 1.0 mg l(-1) Phenol + SDS). To cope with oxidant stress, C. demersum can activate antioxidant defense systems, such as the increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD). Moreover, under combined stress, the activities of catalase (CAT), SOD and POD significantly increased relative to a single stress. Our results showed that the toxicity of SDS and phenol may be antagonistic in C. demersum in its natural environment, and their mixture did not produce more severe effects on the growth of C. demersum than each toxin individually. Furthermore, the chlorophyll content can be considered an indicator of the combined toxicity of SDS and phenol.

AB  - Two species of fishes common to the Great Plains of North America (the western mosquitoftsh [Gambusia affinis] and the sand shiner [Notropis ludibundus]) were used to examine the relationship between individual time-to-death (TTD) in 96-h toxicity tests and average fluctuating asymmetry (FA). Previous studies have indicated that FA, the random deviation from bilateral symmetry in metric traits, is increased in organisms that develop in stressful and/or marginal environments. This association has led to the prediction that FA may be useful as a bioindicator. For example, if an individual's FA is negatively related to stress resistance, a population that has comparatively high values of FA may be more susceptible to further stressors. Adult fish used in these experiments were captured from natural populations in Kansas and acclimated to laboratory conditions for 1 month before use in toxicity tests. Each species was separately exposed to two insecticides: parathion, an organophosphate, and lindane, an organochlorine. For each TTD test, 200 individuals were exposed over a 96-h period to an LC70 concentration. Dead individuals were removed every 3 h. Individuals that survived the test were sacrificed for comparison to those that died. Measurements for seven external morphologic characters were obtained for each individual and used to estimate average FA. Three of four statistical tests showed a significant negative regression between TTD and average FA, indicating that individuals with smaller FA survived longer in the test conditions. These results support the use of FA as an indicator of susceptibility to pesticides.

AB  - River valley floodplains are physically-dynamic environments where fluvial processes determine habitat gradients for riparian vegetation. These zones support trees and shrubs whose life stages are adapted to specific habitat types and consequently forest composition and successional stage reflect the underlying hydrogeomorphic processes and history. In this study we investigated woodland vegetation composition, successional stage and habitat properties, and compared these with physically-based indicators of hydraulic processes. We thus sought to develop a hydrogeomorphic model to evaluate riparian woodland condition based on the spatial mosaic of successional phases of the floodplain forest The study investigated free-flowing and dam-impacted reaches of the Kootenai and Flathead Rivers, in Idaho and Montana, USA and British Columbia, Canada. The analyses revealed strong correspondence between vegetation assessments and metrics of fluvial processes indicating morphodynamics (erosion and shear stress), inundation and depth to groundwater. The results indicated that common successional stages generally occupied similar hydraulic environments along the different river segments. Comparison of the spatial patterns between the free-flowing and regulated reaches revealed greater deviation from the natural condition for the braided channel segment than for the meandering segment. This demonstrates the utility of the hydrogeomorphic approach and suggests that riparian woodlands along braided channels could have lower resilience than those along meandering channels and might be more vulnerable to influences such as from river damming or climate change.

AB  - Fatty acids, especially those from phospholipids (PLFA), are essential membrane components that are present in relatively constant proportions in biological membranes under natural conditions. However, under harmful growth conditions, such as diseases, environmental changes, and chemical exposure, the fatty acid proportions might vary. If such changes could be identified and revealed to be specific for adverse situations, they could be used as biomarkers. Such biomarkers could facilitate the identification of virulence and resistance mechanisms to particular chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, specific biomarkers could lead to better therapeutic decisions that would, in turn, enhance treatment effectiveness. The objective of this study was to compare the fatty acid profiles of trivalent antimony and nitric oxide (NO)-resistant and -sensitive Leishmania chagasi and Leishmania amazonensis isolates. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were obtained from total lipids (MIDI), ester-linked lipids (ELFA), and ester-linked phospholipids (PLFA). FAMEs were analyzed by chromatography and mass spectrometry. Species- or resistance-associated differences in FAME profiles were assessed by nonmetric multidimensional scaling, multiresponse permutation procedures, and indicator species analyses. The isolate groups had different MIDI-FAME profiles. However, neither the ELFA nor PLFA profiles differed between the sensitive and resistant isolates. Levels of the fatty acid 18:1 Delta 9c were increased in sensitive isolates (p < 0,001), whereas the fatty acid 20:4 Delta 5,8,11,14 showed the opposite trend (p < 0.01). We conclude that these two fatty acids are potential biomarkers for NO and antimony resistance in L. chagasi and L. amazonensis and that they could be helpful in therapeutic diagnoses.

AB  - Toxicity caused by exposure to pollutants from marine sediments is a consequence of the interaction between biota and xenobiotics most frequently released by anthropogenic activities. The present work intended to characterize the toxicity of natural sediments putatively impacted by distinct human activities, collected at several sites located in the south of the Gulf of Gabes, Zarzis area, Tunisia. The selected toxicity criteria were analysed following ecologically relevant test conditions. Organisms of the polychaete species Hediste diversicolor were chronically exposed (28 days) to the mentioned sediments. Toxicity endpoints were biomarkers involved in the toxic response to common anthropogenic chemicals, namely neurotoxic (acetylcholinesterase), anti-oxidant (catalase, glutathione peroxidase), metabolic (glutathione S-transferases) enzymatic activities, and oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation, TBARS assay). The chemical characterization of sediments showed that the samples collected from the site near an aquaculture facility were highly contaminated by heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Cr, Hg, Pb, and Zn) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene and pyrene). H. diversicolor individuals exposed to the sediments from this specific site showed the highest values among all tested biomarkers, suggesting that these organisms were possibly under a pro-oxidative stress condition potentially promoted by anthropogenic pollution. Moreover, it was possible to conclude that individuals of the polychaete species H. diversicolor responded to the chronic exposure to potentially contaminated sediments from the southeast coast of Tunisia, eliciting adaptive responses of significant biological meaning.

AB  - The Yellow River is an important ecological shelter zone and economic belt in China. However, rapid urbanization and industrialization has produced a fragile ecological environment conditions and unbalanced economic development in the Yellow River Basin (YRB). Ecological protection and high-quality development of the YRB has been China's national strategy since 2019. As the only coastal province with the largest economy and population in the YRB, the sustainable development of Shandong Province is of great importance in the region. This study evaluated the dynamic trend of sustainability levels of the nine cities in Shandong Province in the YRB through emergy analysis. Emergy-based indicators were established and analyzed from 2010 to 2019, taking account of the ecological service emergy (ESE) needed to dilute pollutants and emergy equivalent loss (EEL) on ecosystem quality and human health damage. Results showed that emergy sustainable indicators (ESI) in Tai'an, Heze, Dezhou, and Liaocheng ranged from 1 to 10, which had the potential for sustainable development. The ESI value of Jinan, Jining, Zibo, Dongying, and Binzhou was less than 1, which indicated that these cities were under great ecological pressure. The value of emergy indicators for sustainable development (EISD) of the nine cities all declined from 2010 to 2016, but remained stable from 2017 to 2019. Based on findings from the emergy analysis regarding policy implications and local conditions, the study concludes by providing proposals to improve regional sustainability.

AB  - Dissolved oxygen is a key indicator in aquatic ecosystems, reflecting changes in water quality. Low levels of dissolved oxygen may lead to oxygen depletion (called hypoxia), putting at high risk the survival of aquatic organisms. Identifying the environmental conditions inducing hypoxia is therefore a topic of high ecological importance. In this study, we used four machine learning algorithms (Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Extremely Randomized Trees (EXT), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression) to forecast hypoxia in a lagoon, considering different time lags (2,5,10 and 20-days). To do so, we used data on dissolved oxygen and a total of nine physicochemical and meteorological variables from Papas lagoon, Greece during 2015-2018. Key drivers and synergies that increase the risk of hypoxia were identified using the Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) methodology. EXT was slightly superior to the other algorithms in forecasting hypoxia, achieving a success between 89% and 94% with pH, water temperature, chlorophyll and salinity as top explanatory variables. SHAP showed that the synergistic effect of low pH and chlorophyll, and elevated water temperature and salinity tended to favor conditions leading to hypoxia. SHAP also illustrated that diverse synergies of the explanatory variables can induce hypoxia, indicating the complex and nonlinear relationships between environmental factors and hypoxia. Overall, the present approach may be proved useful for the development of a reliable forecasting tool for alarming hypoxia and, ultimately, the effective monitoring of the lagoon.

AB  - Fish harbor a high diversity of parasites that play an important role for the ecosystem. Because these parasites have different life-cycle traits, changes in their populations or communities may provide useful information related to ecosystem health. Highly stressful conditions may reduce parasite communities or populations. However, it is not a rule since host-parasite interactions are hardly predictable. In this study, macroparasites of the fish sailfin molly (Poecilia velifera) from three sites (conserved, degraded and under restoration) located within a mangrove wetland area, in the Terminos Lagoon (southern Gulf of Mexico), were analyzed in order to determine their potential use as bioindicators. A total of 198 fish were examined for parasites. Six parasite species were found: two crustaceans (Argulus sp. and Ergasilus aff. cerastes), one trematode (Centrocestus formosanus), one monogenean (Gyrodactylus sp.) and two nematodes (Contracaecum sp. and Cuculanus sp.). There were no significant differences in the structure of parasite infracommunities as well as in prevalence and intensity of parasite populations between degraded and conserved sites. However, the site under restoration had poorer infracommunities and smaller populations ofcrustaceans and trematodes, which suggests that restoration efforts have not improved the ecological conditions. Based on these results, it is conjectured that parasites of P. velifera did not show useful information to provide a diagnosis related to ecosystem health. Beyond this ecological subject, the present study represents new host record for most parasite species found.

AB  - Zoning protected areas is essential for ecological protection and environmental management. However, the protected areas generated via bottom-up processes depend highly on the attitudes of local authorities. Moreover, the performance of protected areas will inevitably be weakened by human activities if there exists an inconsistency between protection and land development. To reveal and solve these problems through top-down approaches, a novel framework for the improvement of protected areas (ERL) is presented in this study. First, the ecological conditions of both the previously-established ERL and land use status quo were assessed through morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and a set of graph-based indicators (e.g., connectivity indices). Second, the low-quality parts of the ERL were improved based on a comparison with the observed land use condition. The results indicated that the ecologically important areas that were excluded from the previouslyestablished ERL can be effectively identified by the combination of MSPA and graph-based indicators. The percentages of high-quality components moderately increased after the improvement. Specifically, low-level core patches can be upgraded by incorporating the ecologically important pixels that were previously neglected. Moreover, many low-quality small islets can be enhanced to better serve the function of temporary habitats. In summary, these results are expected to provide practical guidance for ecological conservation planning and management. More importantly, our proposed zoning framework can be further generalized to the analysis in many other fast-growing regions.

TI  - A framework for a Delaware inland bays environmental classification
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
LA  - English
CP  - 3rd Symposium on the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program
AB  - Since Delaware's coastal bays have been highly eutrophied for at least twenty years and Maryland's coastal bays are not nutrient stressed, dominance of the fish community in Delaware's coastal bays by Fundulus sp. may be an indicator of nutrient stress. Maryland's coastal bays are menhaden, spot, and anchovy dominated. The dominance of Fundulus sp. in a nutrient-stressed system relates to the hardy nature of these fishes, especially in low-oxygen conditions. Submerged aquatic vegetation as seagrasses (SAV) has been absent from the highly nutrient-stressed Delaware coastal bays for about twenty-five years. In contrast, SAV is still found in Maryland's coastal bays. The loss of SAV as a habitat for young fish may also be contributing to the apparent species shift in Delaware's coastal bays.
   Indian River Bay is less hospitable to macroalgae (seaweeds) than Rehoboth Bay. Dominane of Ulva in Indian River Bay reflects its tolerance to varying salinities, higher nutrient levels, and increased turbidities, and indicates a stressed system. The total volume of macroalgae, especially in Rehoboth Bay, tends to follow the seasonal cycle for phosphorus.
   Based on an assessment of the ecological condition of the Delaware and Maryland coastal bays conducted by EMAP in 1993 and other related studies, the author offers a conceptual framework for Delaware's inland bays environmental classification, considering the water quality parameters of turbidity, TSS, Chi,, DIN, DIP, and O-2 as they relate to presence of SAV, seaweed abundance and diversity, benthic invertebrate diversity, and fish sensitivity to low oxygen.

AB  - - The aims of this paper were to describe seasonal changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of diatom taxa and the potential application of benthic diatoms for ecological status evaluation. Diatom indices (IPS and TI) were calculated from data from three different locations along a longitudinal profile of the Bunica, a small karstic river in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A total of 147 taxa were recorded in 12 samples. The most common taxa were Meridion circulare (Greville) C.Agardh and Ulnaria ulna (Nitzsch) Compere. Physical and chemical analyses showed low concentrations of nutrients, good oxygenation, typical pH for carbonate bed/origin and generally oligotrophic conditions and high ecological status. All sites had similar physico-chemical conditions and there were only few sea-sonal differences. Ordination of the diatom data showed that samples showed neither longitudinal nor seasonal pat- terns. Median value for IPS (16.8) and for TI (7.3) can be possible "expected" values for ecological status assessment for small karstic rivers in the Mediterranean region. We propose the use of the phytobenthos Intercalibration Common Metric (pICM - an index that combines the IPS and TI) as a national metric for countries developing WFD diatom methods at a late stage. One situation is described, and a solution, which is potentially transferable to other locations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and also to other countries facing similar challenges.

AB  - Abiotic factors constitute one of the most important drivers shaping soil ecosystems. Although being a strongly buffered environment, soil heterogeneous nature combined with the limited mobility of its organisms can make them highly sensitive to unfavourable conditions. A thorough knowledge of these relationships is thus a critical starting point to understand the challenges posed to edaphic organisms in a context of global environmental changes and the implications arising therefrom. In this study we evaluated the influence of temperature, soil moisture and UV radiation on the performance of the terrestrial isopod Porcellionides pruinosus using several endpoints: survival, locomotor activity, feeding parameters and avoidance behaviour. At the range assessed, temperature did not affect isopods' survival but showed marked effects on sublethal endpoints. Both feeding parameters and locomotor activity showed a right-shifted response with gradual temperature-induced optimisation in isopods' performance until reaching an optimum temperature and abruptly declining thereafter. On the contrary, soil moisture was found to significantly affect isopods' survival but the effects on the feeding parameters were not clear. Although exhibiting a clear preference for intermediate soil moistures, isopods were particularly sensitive to drier environments since higher percentages of avoidance were found. UV radiation affected survival, body weight and locomotor performance. Abiotic factors affect soil organisms at relevant conditions and must therefore be considered while developing tools for edaphic ecosystems' protection such as ecotoxicological testing and further environmental risk assessment.

AB  - The ecological legacy of the Huizache-Caimanero lagoon system has long been known as a trophically rich and productive ecosystem that supported artisanal fisheries of local and regional importance; however, a decline in fisheries' yields has been observed in recent decades. Mangroves are a fundamental component of this ecosystem, though data records and field studies are lacking in describing their structure and seasonal characteristics. Mangrove litterfall production was monitored during 2012-13 and described for the dominant species, Avicennia germinans (L.) Steam and Laguncularia racemosa (L.) C.F. Gaertn. Forest surveys and monthly litter collections were obtained along a latitudinal gradient within the larger lagoon system to characterize the forest structure, leaf biomass, and related biological indicators (chlorophyll a concentration and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI] estimated on leaf tissues). Results showed that structural characteristics (diameter at breast height, basal area, height, and crown diameter) were greater in Huizache, corresponding to patches with a dominance of A. germinans, while higher stem density was recorded for L. racemosa in Caimanero, comparatively similar to other mangrove habitat in NW Mexico. Litterfall was highest from May to October for both species. Litterfall production was also higher overall in 2012 in comparison to 2013, possibly corresponding with meteorological differences, most notably wind conditions. Annual litterfall production was similar by species across northern and southern Sinaloa. A contrast of the NDVI by site and species showed a wide interval, including low values for A. germinans, suggesting stress conditions for this species.

AB  - Given the arid climatic conditions and the frequent long dry episodes in southwestern Tunisia, the sustainability of agricultural activities in this region depends entirely on the presence of sufficient quantities of accessible groundwater of suitable quality for agriculture. Hence, preserving the agrosystems that cover more than 7% of the fertile area of this region, which are of huge socioeconomic value, requires a critical assessment of the groundwater available to these systems. In this context, the present study was performed to determine whether deep groundwater resources are suitable for irrigating more than 54,000 ha of the Nefzaoua Oasis in southern Tunisia. The calculated values of ionic indices (SAR: 3.83-23.6; TH: 17.39-147.65; PI: 35.57-74.81; PS: 5.-79.29) and quality indices (IWQI: 17.14-83.39; CWQI: 17.64-63.96) for these highly mineralized waters indicate that they are unsuitable for irrigation purposes. The risk of land degradation in the Nefzaoua Oasis due to the use of unsuitable irrigation water are being amplified by inappropriate agricultural practices (inefficient drainage and excessive irrigation), mismanagement (the utilization of traditional irrigation techniques, irregular water distribution, and uncontrolled expansion of irrigated lands and water exploitation), and the harsh natural conditions present. The combined impact of these natural and anthropogenic constraints on the local environment necessitate the implementation of a detailed management scheme that utilizes detailed and flexible planning of rehabilitation activities to preserve the ecological and economic value of the agrosystems in this region.

AB  - Assessing the quantity and quality of water available in water stressed environments under various potential climate and land-use changes is necessary for good water and environmental resources management and governance. We present a novel approach with which to assess water quantity in the Luanginga basin, a subbasin of the upper Zambezi River, using existing results of hydrological modelling based on climate change scenarios, hydrological indicators, and multicriteria decision analysis. Flexible input criteria and open-source software are used to the greatest degree possible. Scenarios are represented through a combination of model input data and parameter settings in the hydrological model, and preferences are represented through criteria weighting in the multicriteria decision analysis. The resulting methodology, combining hydrological indicators with MCDA, is thus adaptable, in terms of both application platform and subject matter. The method results were largely as expected. When a decision maker expressed a preference for wetter conditions, the RCP 4.5 scenarios were generally deemed most suitable, and thus ranked highest. When drier conditions where preferred, the RCP 8.5 scenarios, resulting in less streamflow and less frequent flood events, were ranked highest. Validation of the results is not possible, due to the methodologically exploratory nature of the research being undertaken. The promising results do, however, allow for further research that builds upon the work undertaken here, to be envisaged.

AB  - The variability in species number and abundance of the soft-sediment benthic animal Communities of the Archipelago Sea and western Gulf of Finland (SW Finland) is described in relation to environmental variables using multivariate analysis. The results show assemblages along the Outer archipelago zone, facing the open sea, illustrating the importance of local conditions for the functioning of the zoobenthos. Based on clustering and multidimensional scaling of species abundance, the sampling sites formed distinct groups (benthic assemblages) linked to different geographical sub-areas. The main group, dominated by the amphipod Monoporeia affinis, was mainly found between the outer islands and skerries of the Archipelago Sea. Five additional groups were identified, which were geographically scattered and dominated either by the bivalve Macoma balthica, by M. affinis, or by oligochaetes. Based on rank correlation between the (dis)similarity matrices of species composition and environmental characteristics, the combination of dissolved oxygen saturation, temperature and sediment organic matter content best explained the species distribution and community structure of benthic fauna. The groups could also be positioned along an environmental gradient with increasing distance from the mainland, increasing depth and salinity, decreasing organic content (i.e. food availability), and declining temperature. The results are discussed in relation to environmental properties, highlighting the need for a baseline survey for future coastal monitoring, and in relation to the EC Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), stressing the relationship between environmental typology and biological (ecological) indicators of environmental health.

AB  - Emerging organic pollutants (EOPs) in urban rivers have raised concerns regarding their eco-toxicological effects. However, the bacterioplankton community disturbances caused by EOPs in urban rivers and the associated ecological mechanisms remain unclear. This study provided profiles of the spatial distribution of a bacterioplankton community disturbed by human activity along an urban river. The results showed that EOP concentration and composition were differently distributed in residential and industrial areas, which significantly influenced bacterioplankton community structure. Based on redundancy analysis, parabens (methylparaben and propylparaben) were the major factors driving bacterioplankton community changes. Parabens inhibited gram-positive bacteria and promoted oxidative stress-tolerant bacteria in the river ecosystem. Parabens also disturbed ecological processes of bacterioplankton community assembly, shifting from a homogeneous selection (consistent selection pressure under similar environmental condition) to stochastic processes (random changes due to birth, death, immigration, and emigration) with changing in paraben concentrations. Heterogeneous selection was predicted to dominate microbial community assembly with paraben concentration changes exceeding 61.6 ng/L, which could deteriorate the river ecosystem. Furthermore, specific bacterial genera were identified as potential bioindicators to assess the condition of EOP contaminants in the river. Overall, this study highlights significant disturbances in bacterioplankton communities by EOPs at environmental concentrations, and our re-sults could facilitate generation of appropriate management strategies aimed at EOPs in urban rivers.

AB  - Nowadays a popular research field is the use of indicators, especially landscape indicators for the analysis of landscape functions. We have elaborated 13 complex indicators in 6 groups to compare the level of different landscape services and explore the relation between landscape use and economic situation in two rural regions of Hungary. We have chosen rural regions with different natural and economic conditions. The level of regulation and supporting functions are reflected by the group of indicators of environment and biodiversity. Habitat function was analyzed by the rate of protected areas. For the assessment of the visual and cultural value we analyzed the naturalness and diversity of the landscape and cultural heritage. The provisioning services cover mostly the cultivation of the landscape; we assessed intensity of agriculture, forestry and tourism. As an additional analysis we assessed the availability and economic conditions of the pilot regions. The results have shown interesting correlation between the level of landscape functions, availability and economic situation of the analyzed regions. Based on our researches we found that in course of landscape function analysis as a base of rural development it is important to analyze not just the relevant functions but the connections between them, since they may act differently on each other in different situations. While in case of regulation, supporting and habitat function values of Gonc micro-region exceeds Csorna, the values of availability and economic situation Csorna has higher values.

AB  - Impacts of forest fragmentation and edge effect on plant-herbivores interactions are relatively unknown, and the relationships between galling insects and their host plants are very susceptible to environmental variations. The goal of our study was to test the edge effect hypothesis for galling insects associated with Stymy pohlii (Styracaceae) host plant. Samplings were conducted at a fragment of semi-deciduous forest in Goiania, Goias, Brazil. Thirty host plant individuals (15 at fragment edge and 15 in its interior) were sampled in July of 2007; in each plant, 10 apical branches were collected at the top, middle and bottom crown levels. Our results supported the prediction of greater richness of gall morphotypes in the edge habitat compared with remnant interior. In a similar way, gall abundance and frequency of attacked leaves were also greater in the fragment edge. These findings consequently suggest a positive response of galling insect diversity to edge effect; in the Saint-Hilaire forest, this effect probably operates through the changes in microclimatic conditions of edge habitats, which results in an increased hygrothermal stress, a determinant factor to distribution patterns of galling insects. We also concluded that these organisms could be employed as biological indicators (i) because of their host-specificity, (ii) they are sensitive to changes in plant quality, and (iii) present dissimilar and specific responses to local variation in habitat conditions.

AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship between ecological landscape structure and local development regulations over time. Comparison analysis was conducted between two areas that had similar pre-development ecological conditions but were developed under vastly different regulatory environments. The Woodlands (regulated to protect ecological condition) and the North Houston area (which followed traditional subdivision regulations) were examined at three different developmental time periods: pre-development, early development (after 10 years), and matured development (after 30 years). Aerial photos of each site from the three time periods were classified into forested and non-forested classes and the landscape structure was quantified with a number of landscape metrics related to fragmentation - an indicator of habitat degradation. Two factors, the ecological approach to landscape planning and the adoption of more restrictive landscape regulations and guidelines, are discussed on the premise that they exert influence in developing and maintaining the long-term sustainability of ecosystems.
   This study provides quantified landscape configuration and composition of the effects of development regulations on landscape structure. The ecologically planned community shows that a less fragmented forest pattern and more restrictive development guidelines result in more ecologically structured environments. Understanding how elements of local development regulations affect ecological landscape patterns is important for landscape architects, planners, and administrators because it can lead to better strategies for planning and designing sustainable communities.

AB  - Economic sustainability or intergenerational equity entails maintaining social well-being by decisions about investments in different types of assets. Under certain conditions, consumption can be sustained by depleting resources, or various kinds of natural capital, while building up other kinds of capital. Theoretically, the choices involve the use of a set of accounting prices. The question becomes one of finding and implementing accounting prices that express the roles of the various capital goods in achieving the objective of the economy.
   Hartwick's rule holds that an economy can be sustained if the value of the total, net investment in the economy, evaluated at those accounting prices, is zero. The rule applies to a special, abstract economic model which expresses a social objective different from the discounted-utilitarian objective on which national accounting is based. Different objectives give rise to different accounting prices. Because the prices may not be right, the zero net-investment rule using available national-accounting prices cannot generate a condition for sustaining an economy.
   Still, environmental accounting is a tool which, used prudently, can make an important contribution to social decision-making. This paper expands upon these ideas by discussing the incorporation of natural resource and intangible environmental costs and benefits into green accounting at the firm as well as the economy level. Common techniques of mine valuation and standard corporate accounting are the bases for this extension to the valuation of and accounting for decisions concerning the environment.

AB  - The IPCC in its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) described the Himalayan Region as data-deficient in terms of climate monitoring. This is a serious impediment to global research initiatives and thus necessitates long-term ecological monitoring (LTEM) across the Himalaya. Being governed by low temperature conditions, the high-altitude regions in Himalaya are more responsive to changing environmental conditions and hence serve as better indicators. We identified few Protected Areas (PAs) and selected forest core area and ecotones along the temperate, sub-alpine, alpine and cold desert ecosystems in Himachal Pradesh to establish a network of permanent monitoring plots (PMPs). Land and vegetation cover map of three selected PAs has been prepared using Landsat TM satellite data. Among the 10 PMPs, the temperate and tree line forests in the GHNP were found to have the highest tree diversity with Taxus wallichiana showing good stand density and regeneration. The soil pH was found to be higher for cold desert and lower for tree line forests and alpine meadows. Soil total carbon and nitrogen contents ranged from 1.08% to 13.37% and 0.094% to 1.14% respectively. It was observed that the herbs diversity showed a positive trend with increasing soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Satellite remote sensing proves to be a useful tool in an LTEM study, including biodiversity assessment and climate change research in complex terrains such as the Himalaya.

AB  - To inform management, baseline ecological studies in estuaries must be implemented at spatial scales that accommodate both environmental gradients and likely anthropogenic pressures. We describe fine-scale spatial patterns in the abundances and size structure of large infaunal bivalves inhabiting shallow sand habitats in the lower reaches of a relatively undisturbed, permanently open, temperate estuary. Sampling over 3 years at 19 sites during the autumn, when freshwater influence was minimal, revealed that Soletellina alba, Wallucina assimilis and Paphies elongata were consistently the most abundant of nine species present. Although most abundant near the ocean entrance, S. alba was distributed widely and shells of differing lengths, and presumably ages, were present at most sites, suggesting that this species recruited continuously throughout the study area when conditions were appropriate. In contrast, W. assimilis and P. elongata occurred only near or in the entrance channel of the Nornalup Inlet in areas where seagrass rhizomes may grow and where oceanic influences caused relatively turbulent conditions respectively. Sediment structure appeared to exert only a moderate and intermittent influence on the bivalve assemblage at some sites where particularly large grain sizes occurred. This study provides important baseline information on the distribution and abundance of large bivalves in this estuary. These species are likely to be important in the trophic ecology of this system and are potential indicators of disturbance and ecosystem health.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the article is to substantiate theoretically the relationship between migration and human development in the system of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, to reveal a modern understanding environment of the opportunities as a factor in shaping the migration potential, to formulate recommendations for the implementation of the state policy for human development under conditions of high migration activity of the population, relevant for Ukraine.
   Methodology / approach. The general scientific methods (analysis, synthesis, generalization, systematization, graphic method) and special ones (statistical analysis, comparison, organizational and managerial modeling) were the basis of the methodological approach. Current ideas in determining the competitive conditions of environment of opportunities for human development were systematized in order to generalize the theoretical foundations of the study. Statistical analysis was performed on the example of Ukraine as a migration-active country using data from international statistical platforms UNDP, IOM, ILO, Eurostat, Worldometer. Interstate comparative analysis made it possible to substantiate the need for the formation and implementation of the state policy for human development under conditions of high migration activity of the population. Ishikawa diagram specifying the target areas and the measures algorithm of their achievement was used to determine the catalyze priorities of such a policy.
   Results. In the article there were made the theoretical and applied justifications for the modern understanding of migration, human development and their interaction in terms of the formation of the internal environment of opportunities in the global mobile space of competitive redistribution of human potential. The interstate comparative analysis of the main socio-economic indicators on the example of Ukraine to identify applied problems of human development of a migration-active society was conducted. The excessive gaps indicated the priority spheres of state policy for human development as a measures' set of demographic, valeological, educational, economic, environmental and security nature, aimed at ensuring decent, socially just and active living conditions with respect for choice and movement freedom. The priorities of the state policy for human development under the conditions of high migration activity of the population were offered. They provide an opportunity to substantiate management focuses on the implementation of monitoring of human development and migration, improving the efficiency of migration capital and the welfare of the population, stimulating demographic reproduction, the formation of social unity and legal culture.
   Originality / scientific novelty. There were improved the theoretical and applied bases of research of relationship between human development and population migration in the context of realization of choice right and movement freedom. The methodical bases of the comparative analysis of the internal opportunities' environment of human development of migration-active society were further developed. The method of Ishikawa diagram (Constructing a Fishbone) to specify the priorities of the state policy for human development under the conditions of high migration activity of the population was used for the first time.
   Practical value / implications. The content, purpose, spheres and priorities of the state policy for human development under the conditions of high migration activity of the population were substantiated. The applied recommendations for the implementation of such a policy for migration-active Ukrainian society were formulated.

AB  - Managing rivers in society's best interest requires data on river condition. However, the complexity of river ecosystems, combined with finite budgets for river monitoring and modeling, mean difficult choices are necessary regarding what information will be available. Typically, decisions of "what to measure" are left to natural scientists. However, knowledge of public appetite for different types of information helps ensure river data is useful to society. We investigated public interest in rivers directly, engaging nearly one hundred urban and rural participants in a combination of focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Drawing on concepts of "final" ecosystem services developed in environmental economics, we moved discussions past commonly mentioned stressors, such as pollution, to actual river features important in and of themselves. Participant feedback reflected extensive thought on river issues, in contrast to a stereotype that the public is ambivalent about environmental conditions. Interests were also broad, encompassing water quality and quantity, fish and wildlife, vegetation, and human features. Results show consolidation around relatively few themes despite diverse sociodemographics. Themes were interpreted into distilled, specific metrics to make public feedback as useful as possible for water resources monitoring, modeling, and management. Our research provides detailed, methodically generated hypotheses regarding river themes and metrics of public interest that should be considered as part of the tradeoffs inherent in river monitoring design. Results compared reasonably well to river attributes emphasized in river restoration environmental valuation reviews, with some differences. Future research could test our hypotheses with large-sample surveys.

AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) are generally triggered by eutrophic conditions due to anthropogenic nutrient inputs to local waters (wastewater or contaminated waters). During the bloom, some species produce toxic secondary metabolites (cyanotoxins) that are dangerous for humans and animals. Here, a multidisciplinary strategy for an early detection and constant monitoring is proposed. This strategy combines remote/proximal sensing technology with analytical/biotechnological analyses. To demonstrate the applicability of this strategy, four anthropogenically-impacted sites were selected along the Campania coast of southwestern Italy, in the so called 'Land of Fires'. The sites were observed using satellite and aircraft images during summer, 2015. Algal community composition was determined using spectrophotometric analysis for the detection of the cyanobacterial pigment phycocyanin (PC). Complementary metagenomic analysis revealed the taxonomic presence of cyanobacteria belonging to genera associated with strong eutrophic conditions. Key elements of this strategy are the combination and integration of applying different methodological approaches such as the parallel and combined use of satellite, aerial and in-situ data, the simplified multispectral image indexing and classification for a truly efficient method in detecting early blooms of cyanobacteria. The effectiveness of the strategy has been validated also by the specific taxa of cyanobacteria found in the examined areas that confirm the assumption that cyanobacterial blooms may serve as useful bioindicators of degraded water quality in coastal ecosystems. To our knowledge this is the first time that the presence of cyanobacteria has been observed in water bodies along the Campania coast.

AB  - Historically, in river ecosystems close attention has been paid to aquatic vascular macrophytes, but recent literature shows the important role of bryophytes, especially in undisturbed conditions. For this reason, we explore whether aquatic bryophyte patterns change in altered physical habitats and in eutrophication along highly seasonal streams in Bulgaria. Specifically, we hypothesize that: (i) bryophyte assemblage patterns change in conditions of hydromorphological degradation and eutrophication; and (ii) bryophyte assemblage patterns can serve as a signal in assessing effects of nutrient enrichment and hydromorphological degradation. Biological data were collected for 30 river sites together with catchment land use, hydromorphological alterations (e.g. channelization, alteration of habitat and riparian vegetation, dykes), main abiotic characteristics of each site (flow velocity, substrate type, shading and mean depth) and water chemistry parameters. The data set mentioned above was used to describe the responses of bryophyte communities to two major pressures in rivers resulting in habitat destruction: hydromorphological alterations and eutrophication. The results clearly reflected that habitat degradation led to particular changes in the species-abundance patterns of bryophyte communities. Both studied pressure types resulted in loss of species and decreased bryophyte abundance. Hydromorphological degradation could be distinguished by morphological growth forms: presence of mosses of a more plastic shape (creeping pleurocarps), whereas eutrophication favours only the mesotrophic preferential Leptodictyum riparium. This moss should be applied as a conceptual signal species, the abundance of which indicates ranges of hydromorphological and nutrient pressure in seasonal rivers.

AB  - Acervulinid encrusting Foraminifera are rarely reported in present day reef studies of reefs and have never been used as ecologic indicators in fossil reef reconstructions. Comparative sedimentological and ecological analysis of acervulinid facies in reefs and other biogenic formations of various ages and geographical locations (early Eocene Pyrenean region, south France and north Spain, Plio-Quaternary Loyalty Islands, northeast New Caledonia and Quaternary Mururoa atoll, French Polynesia) demonstrates their role in reef construction since the Paleocene and their ecological significance in relation to their growth forms. In fossil and recent reefs, the biological framework built by acervulinid Foraminifera is best developed in environments where ecological conditions lead to the reduction of competition for substrate encrustation. These ecological factors may have different origins but are frequently related to a decrease of light intensity, light deficiency being a discriminating factor between encrusting Foraminifera and major reef building organisms like hermatypic corals and red algae. The contribution of acervulinid Foraminifera to organic build-ups is generally limited in shallow, external environments of reefs, where the acervulinids are associated with various other encrusting organisms. On the other hand, these Foraminifera become a major constituent of the reef framework or in formations made of macroids where ecological factors involve the decrease of competitor organisms. During early Eocene times, in the Pyrenean region, acervulinids were able to build monospecific kilometre sized reefs, the excessive development of these original build-ups being probably favoured by local conditions and especially the subtropical climate.

AB  - Here presented for the first time is the enantioselective biodegradation of amphetamine and methamphetamine in river microcosm bioreactors. The aim of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that mechanisms governing the fate of amphetamine and methamphetamine in the environment are mostly stereoselective and biological in nature. Several bioreactors were studied over the duration of 15 days (i) in both biotic and abiotic conditions, (ii) in the dark or exposed to light and (iii) in the presence or absence of suspended particulate matter. Bioreactor samples were analysed using SPE-chiral-LC-(QTOF) MS methodology. This investigation has elucidated the fundamental mechanism for degradation of amphetamine and methamphetamine as being predominantly biological in origin. Furthermore, stereoselectivity and changes in enantiomeric fraction (EF) were only observed under biotic conditions. Neither amphetamine nor methamphetamine appeared to demonstrate adsorption to suspended particulate matter. Our experiments also demonstrated that amphetamine and methamphetamine were photo-stable. Illicit drugs are present in the environment at low concentrations but due to their pseudo-persistence and non-racemic behaviour, with two enantiomers revealing significantly different potency (and potentially different toxicity towards aquatic organisms) the risk posed by illicit drugs in the environment should not be under- or over-estimated. The above results demonstrate the need for re-evaluation of the procedures utilised in environmental risk assessment, which currently do not recognise the importance of the phenomenon of chirality in pharmacologically active compounds.

AB  - The Southern Ocean has been disproportionately affected by climate change and is therefore an ideal place to study the influence of changing environmental conditions on ecosystems. Changes in the demography of predator populations are indicators of broader shifts in food web structure, but long-term data are required to study these effects. Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) from Macquarie Island have consistently decreased in population size while all other major populations across the Southern Ocean have recently stabilized or are increasing. Two long-term mark-recapture studies (1956-1967 and 1993-2009) have monitored this population, which provides an opportunity to investigate demographic performance over a range of climatic conditions. Using a 9-state matrix population model, we estimated climate influences on female survival by incorporating two major climatic indices into our model: The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Our best model included a 1 year lagged effect of SAM and an unlagged SOI as covariates. A positive relationship with SAM1 (lagged) related the previous year's SAM with juvenile survival, potentially due to changes in local prey availability surrounding Macquarie Island. The unlagged SOI had a negative effect on both juvenile and adult seals, indicating that sea ice dynamics and access to foraging grounds on the East Antarctic continental shelf could explain the different contributions of ENSO events on the survival of females in this population.

AB  - NEOM (short for Neo-Mustaqbal) is a $500 billion coastal city megaproject, currently under construction in the northwestern part of the Red Sea, off the coast of Tabuk province in Saudi Arabia, and its success will rely on the preservation of biodiverse marine ecosystems. Monitoring the variability of ecological indicators, such as phytoplankton, in relation to regional environmental conditions, is the foundation for such a goal. We provide a detailed description of the phytoplankton seasonal cycle of surface waters surrounding NEOM using satellite-derived chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) observations, based on a regionally-tuned product of the European Space Agency's Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative, at 1 km resolution, from 1997 to 2018. The analysis is also supported with in situ cruise datasets and outputs of a state-of-the-art high-resolution hydrodynamic model. The open waters of NEOM follow the oligotrophic character of the Northern Red Sea (NRS), with a peak during late winter and a minimum during late summer. Coral reef-bound regions, such as Sindala and Sharma, are characterised by higher Chl-a concentrations that peak during late summer. Most of the open waters around NEOM are influenced by the general cyclonic circulation of the NRS and local circulation features, while shallow reef-bound regions are more isolated. Our analysis provides the first description of the phytoplankton seasonality and the oceanographic conditions in NEOM, which may support the development of a regional marine conservation strategy.

AB  - Aquaculture is a rapidly expanding industry and is now one of the primary sources of all consumed seafood. Intensive aquaculture production is associated with organic enrichment, which occurs as organic material settles onto the seafloor, creating anoxic conditions which disrupt ecological processes. Bacteria are sensitive bioindicators of organic enrichment, and supervised classifiers using features derived from 16s rRNA gene sequences have shown potential to become useful in aquaculture environmental monitoring. Current taxonomy-based approaches, however, are time intensive and built upon emergent features which cannot easily be condensed into a monitoring pipeline. Here, we used a taxonomy-free approach to examine 16s rRNA gene sequences derived from flocculent matter underneath and in proximity to hard-bottom salmon aquaculture sites in Newfoundland, Canada. Tetranucleotide frequencies (k = 4) were tabulated from sample sequences and included as features in a machine learning pipeline using the random forest algorithm to predict 4 levels of benthic disturbance; resulting classifications were compared to those obtained using a published taxonomy-based approach. Our results show that k-mer count features can effectively be used to create highly accurate predictions of benthic disturbance and can resolve intermediate changes in seafloor condition. In addition, we present a robust assessment of model performance which accounts for the effect of randomness in model creation. This work outlines a flexible framework for environmental assessments at aquaculture sites that is highly reproducible and free of taxonomy-assignment bias.

AB  - The vertical migration trend of cyanobacterial cells with gas vesicles in water ecosystems can reflect the changes in the natural environment, such as temperature, nutrients, light conditions, etc. The static pressure treatment is one of the most important approaches to study the properties of the cyanobacterial cell and its gas vesicles. In this paper, a polarized light scattering method is used to probe the collapse and regeneration of the cyanobacterial gas vesicles exposed to different static pressures. During the course, both the axenic and wild type strain of cyanobacterialMicrocystiswere first treated with different static pressures and then recovered on the normal light conditions. Combining the observation of transmission electron microscopy and floating-sinking photos, the results showed that the collapse and regeneration of the cyanobacterial gas vesicles exposed to different static pressures can be characterized by the polarization parameters. The turbidity as a traditional indicator of gas vesicles but subjected to the concentration of the sample was also measured and found to be correlated with the polarization parameters. More analysis indicated that the polarization parameters are more sensitive and characteristic. The polarized light scattering method can be used to probe the cyanobacterial gas vesicles exposed to different static pressures, which has the potential to provide an in situ rapid and damage-free monitoring tool for observing the vertical migration of cyanobacterial cells and forecasting cyanobacterial blooms.

AB  - Forest cover has important functions for streams. Consequently, deforestation and forest degradation due to agricultural activities tend to have negative impacts on stream ecosystems. We related forest cover to stream variables, expecting to find better habitat and water quality conditions in catchments with better forest cover conditions in order to evaluate forest cover as indicator of stream health in agricultural landscapes. We sampled stream variables and quantified forest cover and physical variables in 60 small agricultural catchments in Southeast Brazil. We used redundancy and regression analysis to relate the landscape predictors to the channel responses. Percent forest cover had low to intermediate values in the spatial scales evaluated. Forest cover was fragmented and mostly located in riparian and steep slope areas. Redundancy analysis showed little influence of forest cover on the response variables, which were more influenced by catchment physical variables. Regression analysis showed that forest cover in the reach and forests located closer to the sampled reach are positively related to wood, habitat diversity, and dissolved oxygen, and negatively related to channel depth, volume, and temperature. We also found that forest cover fragmentation is negatively related to pH, potassium, water acidity, and temperature. Although many of these relationships were fairly weak, it appears that naturally regenerated forest cover is at least moderately effective in protecting streams in agricultural landscapes in the region.

AB  - A new disturbance automated reference toolset (DART) was developed to monitor human land surface impacts using soil-type and ecological context. DART identifies reference areas with similar soils, topography, and geology; and compares the disturbance condition to the reference area condition using a quantile-based approach based on a satellite vegetation index. DART was able to represent 26-55% of variation of relative differences in bare ground and 26-41% of variation in total foliar cover when comparing sites with nearby ecological reference areas using the Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI). Assessment of ecological recovery at oil and gas pads on the Colorado Plateau with DART revealed that more than half of well-pads were below the 25th percentile of reference areas. Machine learning trend analysis of poorly recovering well-pads (quantile < 0.23) had out of-bag error rates between 37 and 40% indicating moderate association with environmental and management variables hypothesized to influence recovery. Well-pads in grasslands (median quantile (MQ] = 13%), blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) shrublands (MQ = 18%), arid canyon complexes (MQ = 18%), warmer areas with more summer-dominated precipitation, and state administered areas (MQ = 12%) had low recovery rates. Results showcase the usefulness of DART for assessing discrete surface land disturbances, and highlight the need for more targeted rehabilitation efforts at oil and gas well-pads in the arid southwest US.

AB  - The WED/60/2000/EC establishes the use of different biological indicators to assess the ecological status of rivers, in addition to chemical, physical and bacteriological parameters. At this purpose, the present study concerning the river Tenna, a central Apennine watercourse (Italy), aimed to analyse and discuss the information given by two biological indices: the Extended Biotic Index or E.B.I. that uses benthic macroinvertebrates, in the version adapted to the Italian rivers (IRE.), and the diatom-based Eutrophication and/or Pollution Index (EPI-D). Sampling has been carried out twice, in May (deep water conditions) and October 2006 (low water conditions), in ten stations along the hydrographic basin of the river. Chemical parameters have been determined monthly during a year because they present a higher variability than biotic indicators. The correlations between the biological and abiotic data obtained have been statistically analysed by means of the Spearman's test. The statistical data, in general, showed a direct correlation between the two biotic indices, and an inverse correlation between these and the chemical-physical and bacteriological parameters. Some of the differences of judgement emerging from the application of the two biotic indices showed a complementary response of the diatoms and macroinvertebrates to various environmental stresses. These results suggest the usefulness of an integrated multidisciplinary approach, in order to obtain a more accurate diagnosis of the health status of the watercourses. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a comparative spatial analysis of the regions of the Russian Federation in the context of the concept of a green economy with the use of two quantitative factors that characterize the well-being of the population: the payroll fund and the total wage fund and own revenues of the regional budgets per capita. The key environmental and economic indicators used in this study are the indicators of eco-intensity for regional economic systems. They show the particular negative impact on the environment "produced" by the regional economy per unit of economic result. The following characteristics of the region's socio-ecological system are considered: the volume of atmospheric pollutant emissions in terms of 1000 rubles of the regional payroll fund and in terms of 1000 rubles of own income to regional budgets. The study revealed a high degree of heterogeneity of Russia's regions in socio-environmental characteristics. It is shown that not only does the population of many natural resource and industrial regions live in conditions of increased anthropogenic pressure (both total and specific), but it also is not provided with additional resources of "collective well-being" through its own budget income, in spite of the unfavorable ecological and natural conditions. It is concluded that carbon regulation aimed at developing a low-carbon economy should not focus on identical quantitative indicators for the whole country.

AB  - Infralittoral sponge fauna was studied as part of a multidisciplinary investigation of benthic communities in Algeciras Bay. On a monthly basis over 1 year, a series of environmental variables were measured (hydrodynamism, silting, suspended solids, dissolved organic matter, % organic matter in silt). The only abiotic variable that was significantly correlated with beta diversity was hydrodynamism, with a linear regression model between the 2 variables showing a correlation coefficient of 0.66. The distributional pattern of the sponges (based on the relative abundance matrix) was correlated with the environmental variables by matching sample similarities using the Spearman rank correlation, thus showing that the variable combination that best explains the patterns of distribution is hydrodynamism/organic matter in silt (rho(s) = 0.6). Of the species considered, Phorbas fictitius, Cliona celata, Cliona vinidis, Crella elegans, Oscarella lobularis, Dysidea fragilis were among those showing the greatest adaptive plasticity in their relationship to environmental variables, depth, and selection by substrate, and are categorized as eurytopic species present in areas subject to great environmental stress. Other species such as Phorbas tenacior, Reniera fulva, Reniera mucosa, Cliona rhodensis proved to be much more sensitive to these variables, and were categorized as stenotopic species, indicators of normal conditions. Due to the particular environmental conditions where it is located, Mycale micracanthoxea was categorized as a good indicator species in port environments. Others such as Dysidea avara, Halichondria bowerbanki or Crella elegans presented morphological differentiations which have permitted them to adapt to sedimentary environments.

AB  - Climate variability in the western Mediterranean is reconstructed for the last 4000 yr using marine sediments recovered in the west Algerian-Balearic Basin, near the Alboran Basin. Fluctuations in chemical and mineralogical sediment composition as well as grain size distribution are linked to fluvial-eolian oscillations, changes in redox conditions and paleocurrent intensity. Multivariate analyses allowed us to characterize three main groups of geochemical and mineralogical proxies determining the sedimentary record of this region. These three statistical groups were applied to reconstruct paleoclimate conditions at high resolution during the Late Holocene. An increase in riverine input (fluvial-derived elements - Rb/Al, Ba/Al, REE/Al, Si/Al, Ti/Al, Mg/Al and K/Al ratios), and a decrease in Saharan eolian input (Zr/Al ratio) depict the Roman Humid Period and the Little Ice Age, while drier environmental conditions are recognized during the Late Bronze Age-Iron Age, the Dark Ages and the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Additionally, faster bottom currents and more energetic hydrodynamic conditions for the former periods are evidenced by enhanced sortable silt (10-63 mu m) and quartz content, and by better oxygenated bottom waters - as reflected by decreasing redox-sensitive elements (V/Al, Cr/Al, Ni/Al and Zn/Al ratios). In contrast, opposite paleoceanographic conditions are distinguished during the latter periods, i.e. the Late Bronze Age-Iron Age, the Dark Ages and the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Although no Ba excess was registered, other paleoproductivity indicators (total organic carbon content, Br/Al ratio, and organometallic ligands such as U and Cu) display the highest values during the Roman Humid Period, and together with increasing preservation of organic matter, this period exhibits by far the most intense productivity of the last 4000 yr. Fluctuations in detrital input into the basin as the main process managing deposition, reflected by the first eigenvector defined by the Principal Component Analyses, point to solar irradiance and the North Atlantic Oscillation variability as the main driving mechanisms behind natural climate variability over decadal to centennial time-scales for the last 4000 yr.

AB  - Holocene sediments of Lake Steisslingen record sedimentation under different redox conditions. This is proven by the changing depth of the chemocline and the resulting varying extension of laminated sediments from the deepest part of the lake to shallower water depths. Redox fluctuations are additionally reflected by colour changes between red and green and the quality of the nonglacial varves. Major and trace elements were analysed on bulk sediment samples (period between 8200-6200 and 2650-2000 cal a BP) to test their response to the observed changes in past depositional environments. Mn, Mo, U, Fe and S were found to be redox-sensitive elements in Lake Steisslingen. Fe and S are almost entirely fixed in pyrite, because pyrite formation is limited by Fe availability. A parallel distribution of Me, U, Fe and S between 8200-7200 cal a BP is interpreted as a signal for syngenetic pyrite formation from anoxic and sulfidic hypolimnetic waters. Since bioproductivity was low this must have been caused by conditions favouring a longterm stable stratification of the lake (i.e. high water level, high summer temperatures, ice cover, wind protection and/or low storm activity). Between 6000-2000 cal a BP frequently changing redox conditions from anoxic to dysoxic are assumed. Mo and U curves are mirror images of the Fe, S and Mn variations. This is interpreted as showing diagenetic pyrite formation from pore waters, which is enhanced during times of high Fe availability under rather oxygenated conditions, i.e. when high input of Fe oxy-bydroxides is possible, but when U and Mo cannot necessarily be fixed in the sediments. Changes from slightly disturbed lamination (dysoxic, restricted mixis) to homogenous sediments (oxic conditions, holomixis) cannot be traced within the geochemical record. The observed redox fluctuations between 6000 and 2000 cal a BP are not correlated to changes in bioproductivity, detrital input or cultural influences and must therefore be of a natural, probably climatic origin. The North Atlantic Oscillation is discussed as a possible cause. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - Late Jurassic organic-rich shales from Shabwah sub-basin of western Yemen were analysed based on a combined investigations of organic geochemistry and petrology to define the origin, type of organic matter and the paleoenvironment conditions during deposition. The organic-rich shales have high total sulphur content values in the range of 1.49-4.92 wt. %, and excellent source rock potential is expected based on the high values of TOC (>7%), high extractable organic matter content and hydrocarbon yield exceeding 7000 ppm. The high total sulphur content and its relation with high organic carbon content indicate that the Late Jurassic organic-rich shales of the Shabwah sub-basin were deposited in a marine environment under suboxic-anoxic conditions. This has been evidenced from kerogen microscopy and their biomarker distributions. The kerogen microscopy investigation indicated that the Late Jurassic organic-rich shales contain an abundant liptinitic organic matter (i.e., alginite, structureless (amorphous organic matters)). The presence of alginite with morphology similar to the Lamalginite alga and amorphous organic matter in these shale samples, further suggests a marine origin. The biomarker distributions also provide evidence for a major contribution by aquatic algae and microorganisms with a minor terrigenous organic matter input. The biomarkers are characterized by unimodal distribution of nalkanes, low acyclic isoprenoids compared to normal alkanes, relatively high tricyclic terpanes compared to tetracyclic terpanes, and high proportion of C-27 and C-29 regular steranes compared to C-28 regular sterane. Moreover, the suboxic to anoxic bottom water conditions as evidenced in these Late Jurassic shales is also supported based on relatively low pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratios in the range of 0.80-1.14. Therefore, it is envisaged here that the high content of organic matter (TOC > 7 wt.%) in the analysed Late Jurassic shales is attributed to good organic matter (OM) preservation under suboxic to anoxic bottom water conditions during deposition.

AB  - The accurate and timely identification of soil morphological indicators of anaerobic conditions is critical for the proper documentation of hydric soils and prolonged soil saturation. Iron monosulfide (FeS) forms under anaerobic conditions following complexation of Fe and reduced S to form insoluble, black to very dark gray (value <= 4, chroma <= 1) concentrations and/or soil coatings. These features are observable as soft masses or pore linings or are dispersed throughout the soil matrix in the form of concentrated zones of FeS. Variation in soil and environmental conditions result in a wide range of FeS expression from <1 to 100% coverage of the soil matrix. We seek to explain the environmental conditions required for FeS formation and describe diagnostic methods to document FeS in a field setting. Field identification of FeS can be performed through an oxidized color change test (either ambient air or the application of 3% H2O2) and via the evolution of H2S after the application of 1 M HCl. The use of Indicator of Reduction in Soil (IRIS) devices provides additional supporting evidence of S reducing conditions in soils and thus environmental conditions conducive to FeS formation when other necessary constituents are present. The concepts and techniques outlined in this review can serve as useful resources to inform our understanding of belowground redox chemistry and facilitate the accurate identification of FeS in wet soil environments.

AB  - The Pampean region, an extensive area of South America is continuously impacted by agricultural activities and the pesticides related to them like chlorpyrifos and glyphosate. Both pesticides have been registered in freshwater bodies of the region. One of the most abundant and widely distributed fish species in Pampean streams is Cnesterodon decemmaculatus, which have to cope with this altered scenario.
   In the present study the toxicity of Clorfox (R) and Roundup Max (R), the commercial formulations of chlorpyrifos and glyphosate, respectively, and their mixture where evaluated using a set of biomarkers at different biological organization levels in fish exposed to relevant environmentally pesticides concentrations. Somatic indexes such as the condition factor (K), and the hepato-somatic index (HSI), the locomotor activity through the distance traveled and the average speed, the enzymatic activities of acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) in brain and muscle, catalase (CAT) in muscle and liver, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in brain, liver, muscle and gills, aspartate amino-transferase (AST), alanine amino-transferase (ALT), AST/ALT ratio and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in liver were measured on C decemmaculatus. Adult females were exposed during 6 weeks to the following concentrations: 0.0084 mu l/l and 0.00084 mu l/l of Clorfox (CF), 0.2 and 2 mg/1 of Roundup Max (RM) and all the combinations of these concentrations. The CF exposure caused a decrease in the condition factor and in the locomotor activity parameters and induced an increase brain AChE, liver CAT activity and AST/ALT ratio. On the other hand, the exposure to RM produced a decrease in liver GST, AST/ALT ratio and ALP activity. Finally, some pesticide combinations decrease general condition and liver GST activities, and increase brain GST and liver ALP activities. Different responses in biomarkers were observed in mixtures treatments, reflecting the complex interactions between these toxics and suggesting a suppressive action of RM on CF effects.
   Since the concentrations we tested are environmentally relevant and the overall fish health condition was affected, the presence of these pesticides in freshwater systems could impose a risk for populations by causing deleterious effects on C. decemmaculatus in Pampean region.

AB  - The effects of livestock grazing on composition and structure of ant communities were examined in the eastern Mojave Desert, USA for the purpose of evaluating ant communities as potential indicators of rangeland condition. Metrics for ant communities, vegetation, and other ground-cover elements were evaluated as a function of distance from livestock water tanks, which represents a gradient in level of livestock activity in desert settings. Data were collected at six isolated water tanks used by cattle during early summer, with seven plots (90 m x 90 m; 100 pitfall traps) per tank.
   Thirty-eight species of ants were recorded, with an average of 14 ant species per plot. Ant species richness did not differ as a function of distance from the water tank. Also, overall species composition, as measured by a similarity index for species presence/absence for paired-comparisons of plots, did not show differences attributable to the gradient in grazing impact. In contrast, the relative abundance of several taxa and functional groups was significantly related to distance from the water tank. The predominant pattern was for the greatest abundance to occur at the water tank, with little difference in ant abundance among plots away from the water tank. This pattern was shown by the abundant ants species, Conomyrma bicolor and Pheidole tucsonica, and the groups Conomyrma spp., Pheidole spp., homopteran tenders, and plant foragers. However, two species, Aphaenogaster megommata and Monomorium wheelerorum showed the greatest relative abundance at a distance away from the water tank. A number of ant metrics were significantly related to ground-cover metrics (R-2 > 0.5). Organic debris was the variable most frequently related significantly to ant abundance metrics, always in a positive direction, followed by cover for perennial grasses, annual forbs, and shrubs, and bare patch size. Ant community metrics in the study region appear to have little potential to serve as indicators of rangeland condition because differences were evident primarily in severely degraded localized conditions rather than in intermediate widespread conditions.

AB  - The semi-enclosed nature and estuarine characteristics, together with its strongly alternating bathymetry, make the Baltic Sea prone to much stronger interannual variations in the abiotic environment, than other spawning habitats of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Processes determining salinity and oxygen conditions in the basins are influenced both by long term gradual climate change, e.g. global warming, but also by short-term meteorological variations and events. Specifically one main factor influencing cod spawning conditions, the advection of highly saline and well-oxygenated water masses from the North Sea, is observed in irregular frequencies and causes strong interannual variations in stock productivity. This study investigates the possibility to use the available hydrographic process knowledge to predict the annual spawning conditions for Eastern Baltic cod in its most important spawning ground, the Bornholm Basin, only by salinity measurements from a specific location in the western Baltic. Such a prediction could serve as an environmental early warning indicator to inform stock assessment and management. Here we used a hydrodynamic model to hindcast hydrographic property fields for the last 40+ years. High and significant correlations were found for months early in the year between the 33m salinity level in the Arkona Basin and the oxygen-dependent cod spawning environment in the Bornholm Basin. Direct prediction of the Eastern Baltic cod egg survival in the Bornholm Basin based on salinity values in the Arkona Basin at the 33 m depth level is shown to be possible for eggs spawned by mid-age and young females, which currently predominate the stock structure. We recommend to routinely perform short-term predictions of the Eastern Baltic cod spawning environment, in order to generate environmental information highly relevant for stock dynamics. Our statistical approach offers the opportunity to make best use of permanently existing infrastructure in the western Baltic to timely provide scientific knowledge on the spawning conditions of Eastern Baltic cod. Furthermore it could be a tool to assist eco-system-based fisheries management with a cost-effective implementation by including the short term predictions as a simple indicator in the annual assessments.

AB  - Coral reef degradation resulting from nutrient enrichment of coastal waters is of increasing global concern. Although effects of nutrients on coral reef organisms have been demonstrated in the laboratory, there is little direct evidence of nutrient effects on coral reef biota in situ. The ENCORE experiment investigated responses of coral reef organisms and processes to controlled additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) on an offshore reef(One Tree Island) at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. A multi-disciplinary team assessed a variety of factors focusing on nutrient dynamics and biotic responses. A controlled and replicated experiment was conducted over two years using twelve small patch reefs ponded at low tide by a coral rim. Treatments included three control reefs (no nutrient addition) and three + N reefs (NH4Cl added), three + P reefs (KH2PO4 added), and three + N + P reefs. Nutrients were added as pulses at each low tide (ca twice per day) by remotely operated units. There were two phases of nutrient additions. During the initial, low-loading phase of the experiment nutrient pulses (mean dose = 11.5 muM NH4+; 2.3 muM PO4-3) rapidly declined, reaching near-background levels (mean = 0.9 muM NH4+; 0.5 muM PO4-3) within 2-3 h. A variety of biotic processes, assessed over a year during this initial nutrient loading phase, were not significantly affected, with the exception of coral reproduction, which was affected in all nutrient treatments. In Acropora longicyathus and A. aspera, fewer successfully developed embryos were formed, and in A. longicyathus fertilization rates and lipid levels decreased. In the second, high-loading, phase of ENCORE an increased nutrient dosage (mean dose = 36.2 muM NH4+; 5.1 muM PO4-3 declining to means of 11.3 muM NH4+ and 2.4 muM PO4-3 at the end of low tide) was used for a further year, and a variety of significant biotic responses occurred. Encrusting algae incorporated virtually none of the added nutrients. Organisms containing endosymbiotic zooxanthellae (corals and giant clams) assimilated dissolved nutrients rapidly and were responsive to added nutrients. Coral mortality, not detected during the initial low-loading phase, became evident with increased nutrient dosage, particularly in Pocillopora damicornis. Nitrogen additions stunted coral growth, and phosphorus additions had a variable effect. Coral calcification rate and linear extension increased in the presence of added phosphorus but skeletal density was reduced, making corals more susceptible to breakage. Settlement of all coral larvae was reduced in nitrogen treatments, yet settlement of larvae from brooded species was enhanced in phosphorus treatments. Recruitment of stomatopods, benthic crustaceans living in coral rubble, was reduced in nitrogen and nitrogen plus phosphorus treatments. Grazing rates and reproductive effort of various fish species were not affected by the nutrient treatments. Microbial nitrogen transformations in sediments,were responsive to nutrient loading with nitrogen fixation significantly increased in phosphorus treatments and denitrification increased in all treatments to which nitrogen had been added. Rates of bioerosion and grazing showed no significant effects of added nutrients,
   ENCORE has shown that reef organisms and processes investigated ill situ were impacted by elevated nutrients. Impacts mere dependent on dose level, whether nitrogen and/or phosphorus mere elevated and were often species-specific. The impacts were generally sub-lethal and subtle and the treated reefs at the end of the experiment mere visually similar to control reefs. Rapid nutrient uptake indicates that nutrient concentrations alone are not adequate to assess nutrient condition of reefs. Sensitive and quantifiable biological indicators need to be developed for coral reef ecosystems. The potential bioindicators identified in ENCORE should be tested in future research on coral reef/nutrient interactions. Synergistic and cumulative effects of elevated nutrients and other environmental parameters, comparative studies of intact vs. disturbed reefs, offshore vs, inshore reefs, or the ability of a nutrient-stressed reef to respond to natural disturbances require elucidation. An expanded understanding of coral reef responses to anthropogenic impacts is necessary, particularly regarding the subtle, sub-lethal effects detected in the ENCORE studies.

AB  - : Pore water pressure and water content are important indicators to both deposition and consolidation of debris flows, enabling a direct assessment of consolidation degree. This article gained a more comprehensive understanding about the entire consolidation process and focused on exploring pore water pressure and volumetric water content variations of the deposit body during natural consolidation under different conditions taking the viscous debris flow mass as a study subject and by flume experiments. The results indicate that, as the color of the debris changed from initial dark green to grayish-white color, the initial deposit thickness declined by 3% and 2.8% over a permeable and impermeable sand bed, respectively. A positive correlation was observed between pore water pressure and depth in the deposit for both scenarios, with deeper depths being related to greater pore water pressure. For the permeable environment, the average dissipation rate of pore water pressure measured at depths of 0.10 m and 0.05 m were 0.0172 Pa/d and 0.0144 Pa/d, respectively, showing a positive changing trend with increasing depth. Under impermeable conditions, the average dissipation rates at different depths were similar, while the volumetric water content in the deposit had a positive correlation with depth. The reduction of water content in the deposit accelerated with depth under impermeable sand bed boundary conditions, but was not considerably correlated with depth under permeable sand bed boundary conditions. However, the amount of discharged water from the deposit was greater and consolidation occurred faster in permeable conditions. This indicates that the permeability of the boundary sand bed has a significant impact on the progress of consolidation. This research demonstrates that pore water and pressure dissipations are present during the entire viscous debris consolidation process. Contrasting with dilute flows, pore pressure dissipation in viscous flows cannot be completed in a matter of minutes or even hours, requiring longer completion time - 3 to 5 days and even more. Additionally, the dissipation of the pore water pressure lagged the reduction of the water content. During the experiment, the dissipation rate fluctuated substantially, indicating a close relationship between the dissipation process and the physical properties of broadly graded soils.

AB  - Previous work has shown that herbivores successfully learn to associate food sensory characteristics with postingestive consequences when the conditioning procedure is simple, whereas this ability breaks down when the learning task is made more complex. We hypothesized that sensory characteristics could act as indicators of postingestive consequences and that the presence of preingestive cues would improve the food learning of sheep in situations varying in complexity. Sixteen sheep were subjected to a first conditioning phase to associate 2 flavors added to alfalfa hay with either a positive or a negative consequence, induced by intraruminal administration of starch (330 mg/g of DMI) or LiCl (5 mg/g of DMI). Sheep progressively decreased their choice of the flavored hay associated with the negative consequence (P < 0.05). This procedure provided sheep with experience with postingestive consequences associated with the different flavors. In a second conditioning phase, the experienced sheep and 16 naive sheep were divided into groups of 8 and subjected to either a simple or a complex conditioning procedure [i.e., the 2 flavors were offered on separate days (simple conditioning) or simultaneously within a day (complex conditioning)]. The 2 flavors applied to grass hay were associated with either positive (starch, 330 mg/g of DMI) or negative (LiCl, 10 mg/g of DMI) consequences. As hypothesized, sheep in the simple conditioning group expressed a greater aversion to the flavored hay associated with the negative consequence than did those in the complex conditioning group (0.303 +/- 0.035 vs. 0.474 +/- 0.035 respectively; P < 0.01). Experienced sheep rejected the flavor associated with the negative consequence more strongly than did naive sheep, regardless of the conditioning procedure (0.304 +/- 0.029 vs. 0.470 +/- 0.041 respectively; P < 0.05). The initial increased preference for aniseed (0.80 +/- 0.04), however, greatly influenced food learning because sheep negatively conditioned on this flavor expressed less avoidance than those negatively conditioned on orange (0.53 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.03 respectively; P < 0.01). In conclusion, the simultaneous scenario was actually perceived as complex by all sheep, and experienced sheep were more efficient in food learning than naive sheep in both the simple and complex learning contexts. The sheep were thus able to generalize the association between sensory cues and postingestive consequences, especially in a complex environment, and then to use these sensory cues as indicators of postingestive consequences.

AB  - Forecasting vineyard yield with accuracy is one of the most important trends of research in viticulture today. Conventional methods for yield forecasting are manual, require a lot of labour and resources and are often destructive. Recently, image-analysis approaches have been explored to address this issue. Many of these approaches encompass cameras deployed on ground platforms that collect images in proximal range, on-the-go. As the platform moves, yield components and other image-based indicators are detected and counted to perform yield estimations. However, in most situations, when image acquisition is done in non-disturbed canopies, a high fraction of yield components is occluded. The present work's goal is twofold. Firstly, to evaluate yield components' visibility in natural conditions throughout the grapevine's phenological stages. Secondly, to explore single bunch images taken in lab conditions to obtain the best visible bunch attributes to use as yield indicators.
   In three vineyard plots of red (Syrah) and white varieties (Arinto and Encruzado), several canopy 1 m segments were imaged using the robotic platform Vinbot. Images were collected from winter bud stage until harvest and yield components were counted in the images as well as in the field. At pea-sized berries, veraison and full maturation stages, a bunch sample was collected and brought to lab conditions for detailed assessments at a bunch scale.
   At early stages, all varieties showed good visibility of spurs and shoots, however, the number of shoots was only highly and significantly correlated with the yield for the variety Syrah. Inflorescence and bunch occlusion reached high percentages, above 50 %. In lab conditions, among the several bunch attributes studied, bunch volume and bunch projected area showed the highest correlation coefficients with yield. In field conditions, using non-defoliated vines, the bunch projected area of visible bunches presented high and significant correlation coefficients with yield, regardless of the fruit's occlusion.
   Our results show that counting yield components with image analysis in non-defoliated vines may be insufficient for accurate yield estimation. On the other hand, using bunch projected area as a predictor can be the best option to achieve that goal, even with high levels of occlusion.

AB  - Female mate choice decisions are often based on a variety of male characteristics, some of which may reflect male quality via condition-dependent trait expression. Here, we explore the condition dependence of a male secondary sexual trait in a wolf spider and examine its influence on female mate choice. In the wolf spider Schizocosa uetzi, mature males possess a multimodal courtship display (visual + seismic) in which they slowly raise and lower their dark colored forelegs. Foreleg color is highly variable among S. uetzi males with respect to both total amount and darkness. Using diet manipulations in conjunction with color quantifications, we demonstrate condition-dependent foreleg color. High-nutrient diet males had significantly higher body condition indices and possessed more and darker foreleg color than low-nutrient diet males. However, using multiple mate choice designs, we were unable to demonstrate a female preference for male foreleg color. Using both single and 2-choice mating designs as well as using females from a range of ages, we found that copulation success was consistently independent of male foreleg color. Instead, we found courtship intensity to be the only aspect of male courtship that influenced copulation success-males that copulated displayed more leg raises per second than those that did not copulate.

AB  - Integrating the effects of multiple stressors and predicting their consequences for the species' survival and distribution is an important problem in ecological physiology. This review applies the concept of energy-limited tolerance to stress to develop bioenergetic markers that can assist in integrating the effects of multiple stressors and distinguishing between the moderate stress compatible with long-term survival of populations and bioenergetically unsustainable extreme stress. These markers reflect the progressive decline of the aerobic scope of an organism (defined as the fraction of the energy flux and metabolic power supporting this flux available after the basal maintenance costs of an organism are met) with increasing levels of the environmental stress. During the exposure to moderate stress (i.e., in the pejus range of the environmental conditions), the aerobic scope is positive but reduced compared with the optimum conditions. The reduction of the metabolic scope can be due to the (1) elevated costs of basal metabolism, (2) activation of the mechanisms for protection and damage repair, (3) reduced assimilation of food, and/or (4) stress-induced impacts on the aerobic pathways producing ATP. This leads to suboptimal growth and reproductive rates in the pejus range of environmental conditions and is commonly observed in food-limited and energy-limited wild populations. The tolerance windows of the organisms are delimited by the pessimum range(s) of environmental conditions in which the aerobic scope of the organism disappears (so that all available energy and metabolic capacity are used in support of basal metabolism), energy resources are depleted, and partial anaerobiosis and/or metabolic rate depression set in. The habitats where environmental conditions remain in the pessimum zone long enough to prevent consistent growth and reproduction often coincide with the species' distributional limits. Thus, focus on the bioenergetic effects of environmental stressors and their immediate consequences for fitness provides a suitable framework for integrating physiology and functional ecology and can assist in understanding the driving forces and limitations of environmental adaptation and improving assessment of ecological risk as well as environmental management in field populations facing multiple stressors.

AB  - Assessment of stream ecosystem 'health' traditionally uses structural indicators (e.g., invertebrate community composition) but often neglects indicators of ecosystem processes (e.g., decomposition rates), providing an incomplete picture of overall ecosystem condition. Given a lack of standardized process-based indicators, we present a protocol for measuring organic-matter decomposition, represented by the breakdown of cellulose in the form of woven cotton fabric. The material, used more conventionally as artists' fabric, has been suggested as a replacement for a standard cotton material (Shirley Burial Test Fabric) that had been widely used in decomposition studies for decades but is no longer manufactured. In field trials, we incubated cotton strips made of artists' fabric in 49 streams in the Midwest (USA), northern Michigan (USA), and in New Zealand to: (I) test the assay under field conditions, (2) provide an initial population of data to which future studies can be compared, and (3) assess some environmental conditions that might influence cotton-strip decay. Decomposition of the strips, as loss of tensile strength, differed among regions and, in some cases, among streams within regions, suggesting that the assay is sensitive to differences in environmental conditions at regional and watershed scales. Mean rates (and standard deviation) of tensile-strength loss across streams of tensile-strength loss were 2.3%/d (0.4), 1.8%/d (0.7), and 1.5%/d (1.0) for the midwestern, Michigan, and New Zealand streams, and 1.7%/d (0.8) overall. Principal components analysis indicated that stream water ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus explained a small but significant amount of variation (R-2 = 0.12) in tensile-strength loss among streams. Rates of respiration of cotton strips incubated in Michigan streams were positively related to tensile-strength loss (R-2 = 0.70). When streams were classified by substrate size, cotton-strip tensile strength (but not respiration) differed among substrate size classes. We conclude that a cotton-strip assay based on the artists' fabric holds promise for replacing the assay based on the Shirley material, and as a process-based indicator for assessing the condition of stream ecosystems.

AB  - The major species of fungi responsible for ochratoxin production (OTA) in a range of commodities are Penicillium verrucosum, Aspergillus ochraceus and Aspergillus section Nigri, especially A. carbonarius. P verrucosum is particularly important in northern Europe where damp cooler conditions occur and where drying regimes need to be efficient and effective for preventing post-harvest contamination with OTA. A. ochraceus can infect cereals including barley, maize, coffee, cocoa and edible nuts. A. carbonarius has been identified as the key species responsible for OTA contamination of grapes, wine and vine fruits. Recent studies have identified the environmental regimes, especially of temperature and humidity, which are conducive to growth and OTA production by these species pre- and post-harvest and during transport. The optimum and marginal interacting conditions for growth and OTA contamination often vary considerably. This has to be borne in mind when effective preventative management strategies are being implemented. Recent studies with cereals have suggested that isolation frequency can be related to OTA contamination of cereals. A logistical model has been developed and identified that 1000 CFUs g(-1) grain of P verrucosum (CFUs) is the threshold limit at which the probability of exceeding the EU legislative limit of 5 mu g kg(-1) in cereal grain can be predicted under different storage regimes. Controlled atmospheres > 50% CO2 is required to effectively prevent OTA accumulation in damp cereals. With regard to grapes, preharvest contamination with A. carbonarius has been shown to be a good indicator for regional risk in southern Europe from OTA contamination. The ecological conditions for optimum growth and OTA production have been shown to differ with the optima being 30-35 degrees C and 15-25 degrees C and 0.98-0.99 and 0.93-0.95 water activity, respectively. Studies on vine fruits (drying currants) suggest that OTA contamination and increase contamination levels occur during this drying process of 7-14 days. This will be influenced by prevailing weather conditions and drying rates. Minimizing OTA contamination in these and other commodities including coffee and cocoa require clear guidelines on safe moisture and temperature regimes pre- and post-harvest for the development of effective management strategies based on ecological criteria.

AB  - One of the primary motivations for the GLOBEC NEP program was the apparent inverse relationship between the increase in salmon populations in the Gulf of Alaska since the mid-1970s and concurrent declines in salmon populations in the California Current. The increase in abundance of some salmon species in the Gulf of Alaska can be plausibly explained based on mechanisms involving changes in physical structure, biological productivity, and salmon survival. To assess concurrent changes in salmon populations in the California Current and their possible physical and biological bases we examined temporal and spatial patterns of co-variability between biological variables and physical descriptors along the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California, from 1950 to 1990. The biological variables were catch records of coho salmon, chinook salmon and an ecologically related species, Dungeness crab. The physical variables were sea surface temperature, sea surface height (SSH) and the upwelling index (UWI). We found that while California Current coho salmon declined uniformly in the mid-1970s, consistent with the proposed inverse relationship, chinook salmon did not. All three species appear to be driven by the dominant mode of co-variability in the three physical variables, an indicator of warm/cool water conditions, but in different ways. In general, warm conditions have a negative effect on salmon at the age of ocean entry and spawning return, and Dungeness crab during the larval stage, while cool conditions have a positive effect. Differences in spatio-temporal variability between the two salmon species suggest they may respond to ocean conditions differently: coho salmon vary synchronously along the coast on annual time scales, while chinook salmon vary on slightly longer time scales in a specific spatial pattern. Dungeness crab vary on 10-year time scales, synchronously along the coast, except for the most southern areas (central California) where populations collapsed in the late 1950s. The dominant, warm/cool mode of physical co-variability, which drives these populations regionally, is related to basin-scale indices; it appeared to follow these indices in the 1950s arid 19751990, but differs from them 1960-1975, in ways that may be biologically important.

AB  - This paper presents an effective approach for wind turbine (WT) condition assessment based on the data collected from wind farm supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. Three types of assessment indices are determined based on the monitoring parameters obtained from the SCADA system. Neural Networks (NNs) are used to establish prediction models for the assessment indices that are dependent on environmental conditions such as ambient temperature and wind speed. An abnormal level index (ALI) is defined to quantify the abnormal level of the proposed indices. Prediction errors of the prediction models follow a normal distribution. Thus, the ALIs can be calculated based on the probability density function of normal distribution. For other assessment indices, the ALIs are calculated by the nonparametric estimation based cumulative probability density function. A Back-Propagation NN (BPNN) algorithm is used for the overall WT condition assessment. The inputs to the BPNN are the ALIs of the proposed indices. The network structure and the number of nodes in the hidden layer are carefully chosen when the BPNN model is being trained. The condition assessment method has been used for real 1.5 MW WTs with doubly fed induction generators. Results show that the proposed assessment method could effectively predict the change of operating conditions prior to fault occurrences and provide early alarming of the developing faults of WTs.

AB  - Inundation, elevation gradient and salinity fluctuations are considered the major abiotic drivers that influence the growth and distribution of mangroves. In certain conditions, these environmental stressors trigger excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), affecting mangrove physiology and homeostasis, leading to oxidative stress and mortality if the condition remains exacerbated. As a natural defense to quench the deleterious effects of ROS, mangroves have developed an antioxidant system to scavenge the toxic effects of excessive ROS. This study investigated environmental stress due to salinity, inundation, and elevation gradient using the biochemical responses in the leaves of Rhizophora stylosa as an oxidative stress indicator in greenhouse experiments and field conditions. From the variations of biochemical responses and levels of oxidative stress, the niche-width preference was extrapolated. The results of the study showed that the observed environmental factors significantly induced the generation of high H2O2 concentrations in the leaves of R. stylosa, which in return activated the antioxidant defense system. Inundation of the whole plant imposed a higher-order oxidative stress compared with the effect of salinity in the greenhouse condition, as shown by the significant increase in H2O2, and even caused sublethal damage, as manifested by the chlorotic leaves when prolonged. In the field, rare inundation and high elevation are also considered stressful to R. stylosa, as shown by the significantly higher H2O2 levels compared with those in the frequently inundated (but plants not submerged) areas. The long-term negative effects of high H2O2 at the plant and community levels were manifested in the reduction of growth rate in plants cultured in the greenhouse and the reduction of height in the 30-year-old R. stylosa plantation. Integrating the levels of oxidative stress induced by salinity, inundation and elevation from both greenhouse experiments and field conditions, it appears that relatively low oxidative stress results in a preference of the niche-width of R. stylosa in inundated areas as long as the leaves remain emerged, even during the spring tide. Thus, this species typically dominates middle intertidal areas. These findings could have valuable implications for the selection of areas appropriate for mangrove rehabilitation.

AB  - Globally, over 110 million game birds are reared annually and released for recreational hunting. Game birds differ from other reared livestock because they experience two very distinct environments during their lives. Chicks are first reared in captivity for 6-12 weeks under managed, stable conditions and then released into the wild. A limited set of 13 studies have explored how the rearing conditions experienced by chicks influences their pre-release welfare, typically in terms of physical injury (feather-pecking) or behavioural assays of stress responses. However, no studies have considered the specific indicators of welfare of game birds after release. We therefore need to draw from studies that do not specifically investigate welfare but instead ones that examine how rearing environments influence post-release morphology, behaviour and survival. Consequently, we reviewed how reared and wild-born game birds differ and suggest methods by which more naturalistic rearing conditions may be achieved. We noted five areas where artificial rearing deviates substantially from natural conditions: absence of adults; unnatural chick densities; unnatural diet; unnatural physical environment; and exclusion of predation risk. Mimicking or introducing some of these elements in game bird rearing practice could bring two benefits: i) facilitating more natural behaviour by the chicks during rearing; and ii) ensuring that birds after release are better able to cope with natural hazards. Together, these could result in an improved overall welfare for game birds. For example, enrichment of the spatial environment may serve to both improve welfare pre-release and after release into the wild. However, some adaptations may induce poor welfare for a short period in the young birds. For example, exposure to predators may be temporarily stressful, but ultimately such experiences in early life may permit them to better cope with such threats when released into the wild. Therefore, to achieve an optimal welfare for the entirety of a game bird's life, a careful balance between the conditions experienced in early life and adequate preparation for later life in the wild is required.

AB  - Condition monitoring of the cutting process is a core function of autonomous machining and its success strongly relies on sensed data. Despite the enormous amount of research conducted so far into condition monitoring of the cutting process, there are still limitations given the complexity underlining tool wear; hence, a clearer understanding of sensed data and its dynamical behavior is fundamental to sustain the development of more robust condition monitoring systems. The dependence of these systems on acquired data is critical and determines the success of such systems. In this study, data is acquired from an experimental setup using some of the commonly used sensors for condition monitoring, reproducing realistic cutting operations, and then analyzed upon their deterministic nature using different techniques, such as the Lyapunov exponent, mutual information, attractor dimension, and recurrence plots. The overall results demonstrate the existence of low dimensional chaos in both new and worn tools, defining a deterministic nature of cutting dynamics and, hence, broadening the available approaches to tool wear monitoring based on the theory of chaos. In addition, recurrence plots depict a clear relationship to tool condition and may be quantified considering a two-dimensional structural measure, such as the semivariance. This exploratory study unveils the potential of non-linear dynamics indicators in validating information strength potentiating other uses and applications.

AB  - Questions Molecular phylogenies are increasingly used to better understand the mechanisms structuring natural communities. The prevalent theory is that environmental factors and biotic interactions promote the phylogenetic clustering and over-dispersion of plant communities, respectively. However, both environmental filtering and biotic interactions are very likely to interact in most natural communities, jointly affecting community phylogenetic structure. How do environmental filters and biotic interactions jointly affect the phylogenetic structure of plant communities across environmental gradients? Location Eleven Stipa tenacissima L. grasslands located along an environmental gradient from central to southeast Spain, covering the core of the distribution area of this vegetation type in Europe. Methods We jointly evaluated the effects of environmental conditions and plantplant interactions on the phylogenetic structure measured with the mean phylogenetic distance index - of the studied communities. As an indicator of environmental conditions, we used a PCA ordination including eight climatic variables. Different metrics were used to measure the following processes: (1) competition/facilitation shifts at the entire community level (species combination index), and (2) the effect of microclimatic amelioration provided by the two most important nurse plants on neighbour composition (similarity indices and comparison of the phylogenetic pattern between canopy patches and bare ground areas). Results Biotic interactions and, to a less extent, environmental conditions affected the phylogenetic pattern of the studied communities. While positive plantplant interactions (both at community level and the scale of individual nurse plants) increased phylogenetic overdispersion, higher rainfall increased phylogenetic clustering. The opposing effects of environmental conditions and biotic interactions could be the main cause of the overall random phylogenetic structure found in most of these communities. Conclusions Our results illustrate, for the first time, how an overall random phylogenetic pattern may not only be promoted by the lack of influence of either environmental filtering or biotic interactions, but rather by their joint and opposing effects. They caution about making inferences on the underlying mechanisms shaping plant communities from the sole use of their phylogenetic pattern. We also provide a comprehensive set of easy-to-measure tools to avoid misleading conclusions when interpreting phylogenetic structure data obtained from observational studies.

The findings indicate that these conditions have promoted the reproduction of heterozygotes in polyloci spectra of molecular genetic markers and animals with a relatively increased stability of the chromosomal apparatus. The prospects of using the reproductive "success" of the carriers of these characteristics as an integral indicator of the selective influence of environmental stress factors are discussed.

AB  - The reliability of condition assessment of bridges obtained from analysis of visual inspection data is always a big concern among structural engineers. It has been known that the condition grading of a bridge is very subjective and can convey limited information to the end user. To finalize and verify the reported condition grading, inspectors and bridge owners have mainly been relying on images. It has been known that the image observation may not be sufficient to address all kinds of problems associated with visual condition grading. The integration of practical supplemental measurements into condition grading as proposed in this paper will contribute to minimize the errors in visual inspection. Measurement of vehicle induced vibrations through wireless accelerometers can be used to determine the natural frequencies of the bridge that can be reported at each inspection. The change in frequencies can be an indication of deterioration in stiffness of bridge over the years. Taking concrete samples by chipping at the inspection site and analyzing them under scanning electron microscope (SEM) at the laboratory can be used to identify the current problems with concrete degradation. In this scope, the regular bridge inspection procedure with the proposed enhancements has been performed on field inspection of highway bridges in Turkey to determine the practicality of the quick supplemental measurements and to analyze the difference in grading of the three different inspectors with different level of experiences.

AB  - Haematology and plasma biochemistry values are useful tools for ecological research. They have been used to investigate the physiological state and the adaptation of individuals to their habitat, changes in nutritional state of birds, body condition, the level of parasite infestation, male quality, the physical condition of nestlings, etc. In the present study we tested the role of haematological and plasma biochemistry values in burrowing parrots Cyanoliseus patagonus (Aves, Psittaciformes) for determining individual quality and condition. We measured triglyceride levels, plasma protein levels, plasma hue and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of nestlings and breeding adults in a colony in the north of Patagonia, Argentina. We found that plasma triglyceride levels strongly relate to changes in individual condition. Plasma levels of triglycerides were found to be strongly related to mass change, hatching order and brood size in nestlings. Levels of triglycerides were found to reflect reproductive effort in adults: males fledging larger broods had decreased levels of triglycerides. Adults with lower body condition had increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Plasma hue showed a strong relationship with an ornamental trait, the red abdominal patch of male adults, and with parameters of structural body size. Thus, we have shown that haematological and plasma biochemistry values, especially plasma levels of triglycerides, are good indicators of individual quality and condition in nestlings and breeding birds.

AB  - Seedling emergence is one of the most important factors in the establishment of optimum plant density for a maximum yield. Seed quality and seedbed conditions affect seedling emergence. Seedbed condition is affected by soil content, especially soil organic matter. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of soil organic matter on germination and seedling emergence of three hybrid sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) cultivars. This research was conducted in 2000 and 2001 in field and glasshouse conditions. Perlite and 20 soils with different organic matter contents were used as seedbed conditions. Soil organic matter, environment, and soil organic matter x environment factors had significant effects on seedling emergence. Decreasing soil organic matter content resulted in a decrease of seedling emergence due to the decreases in water content of the soil. This effect was clearer in adverse environmental conditions, especially in the soils with less than 2% organic matter.

AB  - This article reports on an effort to explore the differences between two approaches to intuition and expertise that are often viewed as conflicting: heuristics and biases (HB) and naturalistic decision making (NDM). Starting from the obvious fact that professional intuition is sometimes marvelous and sometimes flawed, the authors attempt to map the boundary conditions that separate trite intuitive skill from overconfident and biased impressions. They conclude that evaluating the likely quality of art intuitive judgment requires an assessment of the predictability of the environment in which the judgment is made and of the individual's opportunity to learn the regularities of that environment. Subjective experience is not a reliable indicator of judgment accuracy.

AB  - The first life-phase of forest stand development causes significant changes of light condition under the canopy. It is the most dynamic phase of ground layer species, too. The purpose of the survey is to describe the dependence between the light conditions within young sessile oak stands of different ages and characteristics of ground vegetation (dominance. diversity of species, evenness' biomass, indicator values. Tab. 1). The light conditions are characterized by relative values as against radiation of 100%, their standard deviation and leaf area indices of trees. The study sites are located 50 km west from Gottingen where a step by step afforestation with Sessile oak is established. Natural conditions were investigated by describing a chronosequence with a range from 5 to 24 years. A total number of seven different ages is available where no silvicultural treatment has been undertaken.

AB  - Present study aimed to investigate the effects of almix herbicide on histopathological and ultrastructural changes in freshwater teleostean fish, Anabas testudineus (Bloch) under field and laboratory conditions with a dose of 8 g/acre and 66.7 mg/L respectively for 30 days. In field experiment fish species were reared in special type of cage submerged in pond. Cellular alterations of the concerned organs namely gills, liver and kidney were observed through light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). Gill showed hypertrophy and oedema in secondary gill epithelium, and epithelial lifting under laboratory condition but in field condition hyperplasia was prominent. SEM study revealed necrosis, hyperplasia, excessive secretion of mucus and loss of microridges; while TEM study depicted degenerative changes in mitochondria and chloride cells and severe cytoplsmic vacuolation but the changes were comparatively less under field study. In liver, damage in acinar cells of hepatopancreas, degenerative changes in zymogen granules and detachment of hepatopancreatic acinar cells under laboratory condition were the serious changes, but in field condition fatty deposition is prominent. TEM study depicted dilated, degranulated and vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum, dilation and swelling of mitochondria and vacuolation in hepatocytes, but under field condition dilation of mitochondria and appearance of vacuolation were well marked. Kidney showed shrinkage of glomerulus, damaged and hypertrophied proximal convoluted tubule, loss of haematopoietic tissues under light microscopy; while ultrastructural changes like degenerative changes in mitochondria, deformed nucleus, dilation, fragmentation and vesiculation of rough endoplasmic reticulum, severe vacuolation in cytoplasm and necrosis were of very serious concern under laboratory condition, but in field condition epithelial cells showed less damage. Responses depicted that symptoms of lesions were more pronounced under laboratory than field condition and the degree of responses in different tissues were different under these two conditions. Therefore, evaluation of these histopathological lesions in concerned tissues may be established as symptomatic indicators for toxicity study in aquatic ecosystem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A series of batch die-away tests was conducted to evaluate the decay rates of MBAS and COD under conditions simulating untreated discharge. Under aerobic conditions, decay of MBAS was consistently faster than that of GOD, and dilution into river water had no effect on either rate. Under strictly anaerobic conditions, neither MBAS nor COD decreased in concentration. Additional testing examined the fate of C-14-LAS and the results showed that LAS disappeared and was mineralized after a lag period. Half-lives were 8-10 hours for loss of parent and 11-12 hours for mineralization. Addition of C-14-LAS in sewage to systems previously exposed to raw sewage resulted in no lag and shorter half-lives. This work indicates that MBAS and LAS degrade more rapidly than GOD, suggesting these materials would be at low levels once a stream had recovered from the addition of untreated sewage.

AB  - Lacustrine organic-rich shales are widespread in the Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation Chang 7 Member of the Ordos Basin. However, information on the short-term climate evolution within the Chang 7 Member is still lacking, and the mechanism of organic accumulation in the shales remains controversial. To address these issues, this study analyzes the palaeoenvironment and depositional setting of different intervals in the Chang 7 Member of the southwestern Ordos Basin and constrains the main control factors on accumulation and preservation of organic matter based on organic, major, and trace element data. The lower Chang 7(3) shale, which contains a high abundance of thermally mature Type I and II kerogen, has excellent original hydrocarbon generative potential. The lower Chang 7(3) interval has the most humid climatic condition, the strongest weathering condition, a euxinic bottom water condition, a high paleo-productivity, and a low terrigenous input. During the period of upper Chang 7(3) and Chang 7(2), the climate became somewhat drier and hotter, which was marked by relatively weak weathering conditions, suboxic to anoxic conditions, low paleoproductivity, and high terrigenous input. The Chang 7(1) was characterized by a moderately humid climate, moderate weathering conditions, paleoproductivity, and terrigenous input. The relationship among the primary productivity, redox conditions, elastic influx indicators and TOC content suggests that primary productivity was the most critical factor controlling the enrichment of organic matter. The high primary productivity during the early Chang 7(3) interval was probably driven by the deposition of volcanic ash and was influenced by marine incursion events. A warm and humid paleoclimate, combined with input of volcanic ash and seawater, resulted in eutrophic, nutrient-rich, and stratified surface water during the early Chang 7(3) period, which led to algal blooms with high primary productivity. A stratified water column with high primary productivity, together with oxygen-deficit bottom water conditions and low terrigenous input, resulted in the greatest enrichment of organic matter in the lower part of Chang 7(3) shale.

AB  - Ecological systems can be regarded as natural capital that yields ecosystem services vital for human well-being. The provision of these services strictly depends on the protection of natural capital stocks generating them, highlighting the need for conservation and monitoring actions led by proper assessment methodologies. Among the available methods, the Environmental Accounting Model based on the emergy approach is rapidly gaining popularity in ecological applications. We used such method to assess the natural capital value of Posidonia oceanica meadows, widely recognized the most important ecosystems in the Mediterranean basin, at Italian national spatial scale. The natural capital value of P. oceanica was further weighed by the estimates provided by a Habitat Suitability Model. We observed that the estimated level of habitat suitability played an important role as modifier of the average biophysical value of P. oceanica. Our approach allowed to identify the meadows having the highest stability and over space and time, which we defined as the most valuable in biophysical terms, thus with highest natural capital value. The spatially explicit estimates we provided could support managers and policy-makers to ensure the long-term provision of ecosystem services generated by P. oceanica, enhancing ecosystem management and maritime spatial planning.

AB  - The load capacity factor tracks a certain ecological threshold by comparing biocapacity and ecological footprint, thus enabling a comprehensive research on environmental degradation. It can be observed that the environmental degradation rises with decreasing the load capacity factor. However, until now, researchers have empirically considered environmental issues using ecological footprint, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide emissions, and similar indicators. The use of these indicators can lead to the neglect of the supply side of environmental issues. To compensate for this shortcoming, this study aims to investigate the influence of human capital, natural resource rent, per capita income, and energy intensity on the load capacity factor, which focuses on environmental concerns on both the supply and demand sides. In this regard, the study utilizes a recently developed dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) simulation model for China from 1981 to 2017. The results of dynamic ARDL demonstrates that an increase in income, energy intensity, and resource rent leads to a decline in the load capacity factor, while human capital improves environmental quality in the long-run. Moreover, according to Narayan and narayan (2010) approach, the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis is valid for China because the short-run income elasticity is lower than the long-run elasticity (-0.644 was compared with -0.460). Based on the results, policy recommendations for China's sustainable development are presented.

AB  - The Ecological Footprint can inform benefit transfer estimates of ecosystem services by considering the different productivity of land-types. In this paper, ecosystem service values are used to calculate Ecosystem Service Yield Factors (ES-YFs) for the world countries as monetary-based alternative to resource-based Yield Factors (YFs). These scaling factors are context-dependent and can be used for transferring ecosystem service values calculated in different locations for cropland, grazing land and forest. The ES-YFs were further used to calculate Biocapacity Economic Values (BEVs) that represent natural capital values and can be used for environmental economic accounting and as a component of wellbeing indicators. Besides improving the accuracy and feasibility of the benefit transfer method, the ES-YFs can inform natural resource management towards more sustainable options and allows for comparison with economic values in markets sensible to asymmetry, incomplete information, unfairness and unethical behaviours.

AB  - Policies that require development projects to ensure no net loss (NNL) of biodiversity are becoming common globally. Momentum is increasing to extend this concept to one of net gain, including for the marine environment. While such policies are being formulated it is important to learn the lessons from NNL approaches and consider the wider opportunities presented by a net gain strategy. The vehicle for NNL is typically the mitigation hierarchy, which is applied through planning consents and licensing to projects expected to have significant environmental impact. However, it becomes clear that significant marine net gain is unlikely to be achieved by following this approach. Attempting site-based like-for-like compensation, restoration and enhancement is likely to result in only a minimal contribution towards aspirations for environmental recovery and addressing the climate and biodiversity crises. Moving forward with an effective net gain strategy will be a complex process, with challenges that range from a lack of data to the limitations presented by existing governance frameworks. In particular, the inadequate treatment of cumulative effects within the Environmental Impact Assessment process, and how regional marine planning can be better used to translate strategic objectives to the site level, need to be addressed. Taking the broader perspective of environmental (as opposed to biodiversity-only) net gain, and linking this to the natural capital approach offers advantages, and it is also essential that marine net gain considers species as well as habitats. Widespread marine net gain cannot occur independently of fisheries management, and extensive public engagement and stakeholder co-production is required to develop the necessary collaborative solutions.

AB  - Marine and coastal natural capital stocks provide a bundle of ecosystem services vital for human well-being. The biophysical and economic assessment of the value of natural capital stocks is much needed for achieving nature conservation goals, while ensuring the sustainable exploitation of marine resources. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are increasingly being established worldwide to protect and conserve natural capital stocks from anthropogenic threats. In this study, a biophysical and trophodynamic model based on the emergy accounting method was used to assess the value of natural capital for a set of Italian MPAs. In particular, the assessment focused on four main macro-habitats: 1) sciaphilic hard bottom (SHB), 2) photophilic hard bottom (PHB), 3) soft bottom (SB), and 4) Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds (PSB). The emergy method allowed the assessment of natural capital stocks in terms of direct and indirect solar energy flows invested by nature for their generation. The SHB habitat showed the highest emergy density value in most of the investigated MPAs, confirming the high convergence of input resource flows in the formation of this habitat. When considering extensive indicators, the contribution of the PSB habitat to the total value of natural capital was higher than other habitats in most MPAs. In addition, to facilitate the understanding of the results in socio-economic contexts, the biophysical values of natural capital stocks were converted into monetary units. The total value of natural capital in the investigated MPAs ranged from about 8 to 1163 M(sic). In conclusion, assessing the value of natural capital can support local managers and policy makers in charge for achieving nature conservation targets while ensuring the sustainable exploitation of natural resources.

AB  - Littorals represent highly dynamic and complex systems which undergo changes imposed by several environmental factors and human-induced disturbances. Among coastal ecosystems, seagrass meadows represent a key habitat and, according to the European Water Framework Directive, the endemic Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica is considered as biological indicators thanks to their susceptibility to pressures and changes. In this work, four P. oceanica meadows in the Portofino Marine Protected Area (NW Mediterranean) are investigated to evaluate the potential effects of different disturbances (i.e., anchoring and a severe sea storm) on them through the study of their conservation status (measured with the Conservation Index, CI) and their natural capital (NC). Results obtained for CI and NC are not always consistent: meadows with high conservation status often showed low NC values. A link between the ability of ecosystems to store NC and develop a complex functioning and the meadows conservation is evident only when ecosystems are subjected to strong disturbances like the sea storm that hit the Ligurian coast on October 2018. The two indices should thus be integrated in monitoring activities because they account for different and complementary aspects of the meadow status.

AB  - Natural capital accounting aims to measure changes in the stock of natural assets (i.e., soil, air, water and all living things) and to integrate the value of ecosystem services into accounting systems that will contribute to better ecosystems management. This study develops ecosystem services accounts at the European Union level, using nature-based recreation as a case study and following the current international accounting framework: System of Environmental-Economic Accounting - Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EEA). We adapt and integrate different biophysical and socio-economic models, illustrating the workflow necessary for ecosystem services accounts: from a biophysical assessment of nature-based recreation to an economic valuation and compilation of the accounting tables. The biophysical assessment of nature-based recreation is based on spatially explicit models for assessing different components of ecosystem services: potential, demand and actual flow. Deriving maps of ecosystem service potential and demand is a key step in quantifying the actual flow of the service used, which is determined by the spatial relationship (i.e., proximity in the case of nature-based recreation) between service potential and demand. The nature-based recreation accounts for 2012 show an actual flow of 40 million potential visits to 'high-quality areas for daily recreation', with a total value of EUR 50 billion. This constitutes an important contribution of ecosystems to people's lives that has increased by 26% since 2000. Practical examples of ecosystem services accounts, as shown in this study, are required to derive recommendations and further develop the conceptual and methodological framework proposed by the SEEA EEA. This paper highlights the importance of using spatially explicit models for ecosystem services accounts. Mapping the different components of ecosystem services allows proper identification of the drivers of changes in the actual service flow derived from ecosystems, socio-economic systems and/or their spatial relationship. This will contribute to achieving one of the main goals of ecosystem accounts, namely measuring changes in natural capital, but it will also support decision-making that targets the enhancement of ecosystems, their services and the benefits they provide.

AB  - The pulp and paper sector is the fourth-largest industrial sector worldwide in terms of energy use, accounting for approximately 6% of the total Industrial energy consumption and contributing to 2% of direct carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced by industries. The definition of the environmental profile of this industrial sector is crucial, due to the high market demand of paper and the increasing concern for the environmental costs of the whole papermaking process. A sustainability perspective should rely on a wider and holistic viewpoint, properly including all direct and indirect interactions with the environment. To this purpose, the Emergy (spelled with "m") Accounting method (EMA) is very appropriate for the evaluation of the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of the papermaking process under different perspectives (resource quality, fossil energy and material consumption, environmental and human-driven support). Several studies concerning environmental impacts, eco-efficiency, and cleaner technologies in the pulp and paper sector have already been carried out, but none of them addressed resource quality and resource generation costs from a supply-side point of view. This study aims to fill this gap in the literature by highlighting the direct and indirect contribution in terms of natural capital and ecosystem services to the pulp and paper production process.
   By means of EMA performance indices, this paper aims to assess the environmental sustainability associated to the production of pulp and paper, so as to identify those process steps that entail the highest environmental costs and require improvements. Three forest management scenarios - based on Spruce/Pine, Eucalyptus and Poplar production for raw material supply - were evaluated to assess the sustainability and the efficiency of each species. Moreover, the marginal costs of achieving higher energy and material efficiency are investigated, with a special focus placed on the identification of the effects of energy input flows on additional demand for environmental services.
   The research results show that the largest supply-side environmental costs are generated by the industrial processing activities, due to high energy, water and chemicals consumption. Only a minor role is played by forestry activities that supply the raw feedstock, although forestry management practices certainly affect both the final productivity and the energy balance, through the amount and use efficiency of the farm inputs. Additionally, among the three forest systems under study, Spruce/Pine forest management displays the most sustainable option for paper production because, basing on the emergy indices, it presents the best sustainable contribution to both the economy and the environment of the investigated region. In conclusion, the application of EMA approach allowed a more comprehensive assessment of forestry and industrial operations, contributing to assist decision makers in implementing the best environmental management of papermaking process.

AB  - Marine and coastal ecosystems are among the most productive environments in the world and their stocks of natural capital offer a bundle of vital ecosystem services. Anthropogenic pressure seriously threatens health and long-term sustainability of marine environments. For these reasons, integrated approaches capable of combining ecological and socio-economic aspects are needed to achieve nature conservation and sustainability targets. In this study, the value of natural capital of the Egadi Islands Marine Protected Area (EI-MPA) was assessed through a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model. The emergy value of both autotrophic and heterotrophic natural capital stocks was calculated for the main habitats of the EI-MPA. Eventually, the emergy value of natural capital was converted into monetary units to better communicate its importance to local managers and policy-makers. The total value of natural capital in the EI-MPA resulted in 1.12.10(21) sej, equivalent to about 1.17 billion of euros. In addition, using Marxan software, the results of the environmental accounting were integrated with spatial data on main human uses. This integration took into account the trade-offs between conservation measures and human exploitation by means of two different scenarios, with and without considering human uses in the EIMPA. The comparison between the scenarios highlighted the importance of taking into account human activities in marine spatial planning (MSP), allowing the identification of key areas for natural capital conservation. In conclusion, this study showed the importance of integrating environmental accounting with conservation planning to support effective strategies for ecological protection and sustainable management of human activities. The results of this study represent a first benchmark useful to explore alternative nature conservation strategies in the EI-MPA, and, more in general, in Mediterranean MPAs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Changes imposed to nature by human activities and related impacts on all environmental matrices have become a critical issue. Gradually, humans began to perceive and face the magnitude of the impact of human economy on natural ecosystems and the implications for human well-being. From this perception, the concepts of natural capital and ecosystem services arose, highlighting the relationships between natural and human economy while boosting environmental conservation and management. In this framework, the definition and application of metrics and models capable of accounting for natural capital value are much needed. This is even more important when a protection regime is established (such as in the case of marine protected areas) to evaluate the efficacy of undertaken conservation measures. In this study, a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model was developed to assess the value of natural capital in marine protected areas. The model of natural capital assessment is articulated in three main steps: 1) trophodynamic analysis, providing an estimate of the primary productivity used to support the benthic trophic web within the study area, 2) biophysical accounting, providing an estimate of the biophysical value of natural capital by means of emergy accounting, and 3) monetary conversion, expressing the biophysical value of natural capital into monetary units. This conversion does not change the biophysical feature of the assessment, but instead it has the merit of allowing an easier understanding and effective communication of the ecological value of natural capital in socio-economic contexts.

AB  - Research on ecosystem services has become a dominant field within environmental management, framing the way in which human-nature relationships are understood and managed. Although ecosystem services are usually defined as 'the benefits that humans receive from nature', our work shows that most services are actually co-produced by a mixture of natural capital and various forms of social, human, financial and technological capital. Here, we review how ecosystem services are co-produced, and then we assess how this affects the quantity, quality, trade-offs, resilience and the equity of the distribution of ecosystem services. Then we discuss the implications of co-production for sustainability. Finally, we present some challenges for an adequate consideration of co-production within the assessment of ecosystem services.

AB  - Ecological Footprint and biocapacity metrics have been widely used in natural capital and ecosystem accounting, and are frequently cited in the sustainability debate. Given their potential role as metrics for environmental science and policy, a critical scrutiny is needed. Moreover, these metrics remain unclear to many, are subject to criticisms, and discussion continues regarding their policy relevance. This paper aims to explain the rationale behind Ecological Footprint Accounting (EPA) and help ensure that Ecological Footprint and biocapacity results are properly interpreted and effectively used in evaluating risks and developing policy recommendations. The conclusion of this paper is that the main value-added of Ecological Footprint Accounting is highlighting trade-offs between human activities by providing both a final aggregate indicator and an accounting framework that shed light on the relationships between many of the anthropogenic drivers that contribute to ecological overshoot.

AB  - A comprehensive understanding of interlinked ecological-economic systems requires integration of different theoretical frameworks and assessment methods. This paper reviews the main definitions, classifications, and methodological approaches used to identify, assess, and value stocks of natural capital and flows of ecosystem services. A synthesis of the major developments in the field of ecosystem services assessment is provided and the main future challenges are outlined. The notion of value in relation to natural capital and ecosystem services is discussed exploring different economic and ecological approaches. We then propose a conceptual framework integrating environmental accounting and ecosystem services assessment to highlight three main possible windows of attention to be investigated when focusing on ecosystem services provision and exploitation: (1) sustained economic and environmental costs, (2) received benefits, and (3) generated impacts. Finally, we conclude that such an ecological-economic and systems perspective to ecosystem services assessment could play an important role in investigating the interplay between ecological and socio-economic systems, allowing a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the benefits gained from ecosystems and the costs due to their exploitation.

AB  - The evaluation of natural capital and environmental services has always been an important step in the implementation of sustainable development concepts and policies. The results presented in this study address the demand for environmental support of the economy of Xilinguole League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as well as the value of its natural and human-made capital. The results show that the reliance of the economy of Xilinguole League on local and imported non-renewable resources (coal and minerals) decreases both the environmental and economic sustainability of the area. Emergy-based performance indicators of the Xilinguole League economy show a low sustainability index (ESI=0.79), though it is higher than for the Chinese economy as a whole (ESI=0.47), as well as a low percentage of renewable resources being used (%REN=0.16, though this is higher than for all of China, 0.09). In contrast, the grassland-based livestock sector shows a higher renewability index (%REN=0.67) and sustainability (ESI=9.61). The emergy exchange ratios (exported emergy/imported emergy) are calculated to be 4.38 for the livestock system and 4.28 for the Xilinguole economy, which is much higher than the value of 1.74 for the overall Chinese economy, indicating uncompensated overexploitation of local systems (meat and coal, respectively). Intensified coal exploitation and intensive cattle grazing are discussed to support the decision-making process for setting local energy policy and ecological compensation. It is proposed that conservation of coal resources (avoiding misuse and moderating excess extraction and trade) and protection of natural grassland capital are more advantageous in emergy terms than the "blind" pursuit of accelerated, economic growth.

AB  - Lake Sentiz and Lake Chozas are two small water bodies in the Province of Leon (NW Spain). The former is mesotrophic and the latter went from oligotrophic to turbid in 1997, due to introduction of an invasive allochthonous crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Rodriguez et al., 2003,2005; Marchi et al., 201 lab). We set out to study health status of the two ecosystems by the joint use of different but correlated ecological indicators, supplementing the values obtained by monitoring campaigns. We examine three scenarios: (1) Lake Sentiz, (2) Lake Chozas before and (3) Lake Chozas after the biological invasion. We evaluate eco-exergy, emergy and eco-exergy-empower ratio, three holistic ecological indicators based on the thermodynamics of far-from-equilibrium systems. When structural changes take place in ecosystems it is recommended to apply holistic thermodynamic indicators as presented in Jorgensen et al. (2010a,b). We propose their joint application for a complete overview of the monetary value of natural capital, because they provide information added to statistical analysis and direct measurement. The aim is to determine which of these indicators best represents the effects of eutrophication and perturbations caused by alien species in the two freshwater systems. The eco-exergy-empower ratio gives the best results, since it clearly indicates lake efficiency in transforming direct and indirect solar energy inputs into organization. The eco-exergy (work capacity) results are used to estimate ecosystem services and quantify the economic value of lake natural capital. Calculation of ecosystem services on an eco-exergy basis provides good indications of monetary gains or losses possible in perturbed systems, including eutrophic or invaded ecosystems. This is not surprising, because work capacities include all possible services offered by ecosystems, not only the services actually used by humans. Eco-exergy and the eco-exergy-empower ratio can be guidelines for the calculation of ecosystem services, although they give only a partial indication of the environmental costs and benefits of a given level of information. The present results suggest political and economic considerations and solutions, and are a useful example for organisations involved in environmental management of pollution and biological invasions by exotic species.

AB  - Soils are one of the most important features of the natural capital of terrestrial ecosystems. There is a strong and increasing policy requirement for effective monitoring of soils at local, regional and national-scales. However, it remains unclear which properties of soils are most appropriately monitored. This is partly due to the wide range of goods and services that soils provide, but also their inherent chemical, physical and biological complexity. Given that the biota plays such fundamental roles in the majority of ecosystem services provided by soils, biological properties are logical candidates as effective indicators, to complement soil physico-chemical properties. A plethora of biological methods have been suggested as indicators for monitoring soils but few are used in national-scale monitoring or are published as international standards. A framework for selecting ecologically relevant biological indicators of soil quality, for national-scale soil monitoring, that cover the range of functions and services of soil was devised. The literature was surveyed to identify 183 candidate biological indicators which were then scored by experts and stakeholders against a wide range of scientific and technical criteria. The framework used the scores and weightings; to then rank, prioritise and select the indicators. This semi-objective approach using a "logical sieve" allowed repeated iterations to take account of end-user requirements and expert opinion. A ranked list of 21 indicators was produced that covered a range of genotypic-, phenotypic- and functional-based indicators for different trophic groups. Four of these were not deemed sufficiently robust for ready deployment in a national-scale monitoring scheme without further methodological development. The suite of indicators identified offers the strongest potential candidates for deployment in national-scale soil monitoring schemes. However, standard operating procedures, their inherent sensitivity, ability to discriminate between soil:land use combinations, ecological interpretation all need to be confirmed. The power of the approach adopted here is that it provides a clear record and audit trail on the decision-making process, enables different priorities to be set contingent on the nature of the desired monitoring, and can direct and allow the inclusion of further methods or indicators into the framework.

AB  - Although human presence is one of the main characteristics of the Mediterranean identity since ancient times, a false dialectic between conservation and social-economic development has emerged in recent decades. On the one hand, an economic growth policy is taken as the paradigm of social-economic development; on the other hand, there is a multi-scale conservation policy, in which natural protected areas, as patches of preserved nature, are used as one of the main tools to deal with the challenge of sustainability. The Mediterranean Basin is the habitat of many unique species and one of the 25 main biodiversity hotspots in the world, and as a consequence a strong conservation policy has been used to protect environmental values. At the same time, Mediterranean countries are deeply involved in promoting strong economic growth policies, which are not always compatible with environmental ones. In this paper, Spain has been studied as one model of this situation. Due to political reasons, Spanish economic growth and conservationist policies were pursued together during the last 20 years. As a result, Spain owns one of the largest networks of natural protected areas in Western Europe, and at the same time it has experienced one of the strongest periods of economic growths in the European and Mediterranean context during the 1980s and 1990s. An historical series of resource use in five annual periods in the last 20 years of conservation policy, and the effects on the preservation of natural capital have been investigated by means of the eMergy (spelled with an 'm') synthesis approach, which was used to characterize the flow of environmental services supplied by ecosystems, but not in monetary terms. This study shows that Spain is becoming less self-sufficient and more inefficient in resource use, comprehensively measured in eMergy terms. A large part of Spain's economy depends on imported goods and services, and most economic activities are based on tourist services and associated construction, which promotes intensification in the urban use of the territory and more intense environmental impacts and resource use intensification of those countries supplying the raw materials. The consequence is a decoupling of the Spanish economy from local environmental services and the increase of Ecological footprint of Spain, measured by means of eMergy-based indicators. In spite of the increase in number, area and associated budget of the natural protected areas and other conservation measures, the general sustainability of the nation is decreasing.

AB  - Adaptive management as applied to tourism policy treats management policies as experiments that probe the responses of the system as human behavior changes. We present a conceptual systems model that incorporates the gap between observed and desired levels of the ecological footprint with respect to biocapacity. Addressing this gap (or 'overshoot') can inform strategies to increase or decrease visitation or its associated consumption in the coming years. The feedback mechanism in this conceptual model incorporates a gap between observed and desired ecological footprint levels of tourists and residents. The work is based on longer-term and ongoing study of tourism impacts and ecological footprint assessments from the SPIN-Eco Project. We present historical tourism and environmental data from the province of Siena, Italy and discuss the use of discrete, static environmental indicators as part of an iterative feedback process to manage tourism within biophysical limits. We discuss a necessary shift of emphasis from certain and static numbers to a process-based management model that can reflect slow changes to biophysical resources. As underscored by ecological footprint analysis, the energy and material use associated with tourism and local activity can erode natural capital foundations if that use exceeds the area's biological capacity to support it. The dynamic, and iterative process of using such indicators as management feedback allows us to view sustainability more accurately as a transition and journey, rather than a static destination to which management must arrive.

AB  - A study to characterise the Crop Status Index (CSI) was performed on wheat crop grown under eight abiotic stress conditions categorised into four levels of stress intensity (No stress, single, double and triple stress). Twenty probable crop abiotic stress indicators were used to select minimum dataset (MDS) responsive of different intensities of abiotic stress conditions. Indices were determined by linear and nonlinear scoring, with weighted and additive methods of calculation. To determine the MDS principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on the total dataset of indicators that were sensitive to abiotic stress conditions. The objectives of this study are to identify suitable abiotic stress indicators, the best scoring technique (linear or nonlinear) and appropriate method (additive and weighted) to derive a CSI to characterise abiotic stress condition like moisture, temperature and nitrogen stress alone or in different (single, double or triple) combinations of theses stresses. Twenty Biophysical, Physiological and Biochemical stress indicators comprised the initial dataset, out of which Relative Water Content, Stomatal Conductance, Leaf Temperature, Chlorophyll, Root Length and Leaf Nitrogen were selected as MDS through PCA. The type of abiotic stress condition and stress intensity affected each indicator in different ways. CSI calculated by means of MDS and nonlinear weighted additive integration showed the best ability to distinguish different intensity of abiotic stress. In general the CSI values were lower under higher intensity of abiotic stress condition, and showed that abiotic stress effect was inclining towards a detrimental effect on crop status for wheat production under semi-arid condition. There was a clear indication that crop quality for wheat production was worsened by moisture and nitrogen stress under normal and high temperature stress conditions. The results revealed that increasing stress intensity might cause deterioration in crop status due to limitations in soil and environmental resources under future global warming scenarios. The indexing method used in this study offers a useful, time and cost efficient approach to quantify abiotic stress effects on crop status for wheat production in semi-arid condition.

AB  - Thermodynamic calculations of the systems Te-O-H, Au-Te-Cl-S-O-H, and Ag-Te-Cl-S-O-H up to 300-degrees-C, using the isocoulombic principle, show that the nature of aqueous tellurium species in equilibrium with native tellurium and the nature of aqueous chloride and sulfide species in equilibrium with calaverite (AuTe2) and hessite (Ag2Te) are strongly dependent upon physicochemical conditions.
   Te2(2-) is the most important aqueous tellurium species is equilibrium with native tellurium in epithermal or mesothermal deposits in which sericitic alteration is dominant, and f(o2) is near the hematite-magnetite buffer.  HTeO3- is the dominant aqueous species at f(02) conditions more oxidizing than the hematite-magnetite buffer, whereas HTe- is dominant under reduced conditions.  For Au and Ag contents of between 0.1 and 1 ppb, SIGMAS = 0.01 m, m(cl-) = 1 (conditions typical of epithermal or mesothermal gold-silver ore-forming fluids), and a SIGMATe = 1 ppb, calaverite is precipitated generally from solutions enriched in Au(HS)2- and HAu(HS)2(0), whereas hessite is precipitated from solutions enriched in Ag(HS)2- at near-neutral to slightly alkaline conditions, and from AgCl2- at f(o2) conditions higher than the hematite-magnetite buffer.  The stabilities of binary silver tellurides and ternary gold-silver tellurides cannot be calculated due to a lack of thermodynamic data.
   The stability of calaverite can be used, in conjunction with silicate-sulfide-oxide assemblages, to determine the physicochemical conditions of gold-silver telluride formation.  For example, the mutual stability of calaverite, quartz, pyrite, hematite, chalcopyrite, bornite, and sericite at 200-degrees-C for conditions of SIGMAS = 0.001 m, m(ca)2+ = 0.019, m(Na)+ = 0.25, m(Mg)2+ = 0.002, and m(K)+ = 0.02 suggests that stage 1b mineralization in the upper portions of the Golden Sunlight deposit, Montana, precipitated from a fluid with an f(o2) between 0.10(-40) and 10(-37) and a pH of 4.3 to 5.7.  The stability of hessite covers most conditions of ore formation (oxidizing to reducing, and acid to alkaline) and is a less useful indicator of ore-forming conditions.

AB  - Current environmental risk assessments (ERA) do not account explicitly for ecological factors (e.g. species composition, temperature or food availability) and multiple stressors. Assessing mixtures of chemical and ecological stressors is needed as well as accounting for variability in environmental conditions and uncertainty of data and models. Here we propose a novel probabilistic ERA framework to overcome these limitations, which focusses on visualising assessment outcomes by constructing and interpreting prevalence plots as a quantitative prediction of risk. Key components include environmental scenarios that integrate exposure and ecology, and ecological modelling of relevant endpoints to assess the effect of a combination of stressors. Our illustrative results demonstrate the importance of regional differences in environmental conditions and the confounding interactions of stressors. Using this framework and prevalence plots provides a risk-based approach that combines risk assessment and risk management in a meaningful way and presents a truly mechanistic alternative to the threshold approach. Even whilst research continues to improve the underlying models and data, regulators and decision makers can already use the framework and prevalence plots. The integration of multiple stressors, environmental conditions and variability makes ERA more relevant and realistic.

AB  - Southern Brazilian rivers and streams have been intensively affected by human activities, especially agriculture and the release of untreated domestic sewage. However, data about the aquatic macroinvertebrates in these streams are scarce and limited to only certain groups. In addition, studies focusing on the structure and spatial distribution of these communities are lacking. This study analyzed the effects of natural and anthropic variables on the community structure of macroinvertebrates along a longitudinal gradient in three microbasins located in a region of landscape transition in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Sampling was conducted in the Vacaca -Mirim River (August 2008) and in the Ibicu -Mirim and Tororaip rivers (August 2009) following an environmental gradient including 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th order segments. Local natural factors that were analyzed include water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, substrate granulometry, and the presence of aquatic vegetation. Anthropic variables that were analyzed include including bank erosion, land use, urbanization, riparian deforestation, and fine sediments input. A total of 42 families and 129 taxa were found, with predominance of environmentally tolerant taxa. Geological context (landscape transition and large hydrographic basins) tended to influence natural environmental factors along the rivers' longitudinal gradients. However, changes in anthropic variables were not affected by these geological differences and therefore did not correlate with patterns of spatial distribution in macroinvertebrate communities. Only 1st order stream segments showed a community composition with high richness of taxa intolerant to anthropic disturbance. Richness as a whole tended to be higher in 3rd to 4th order set of segments, but this trend was a result of local anthropic environmental disturbances. Future inventories conducted in similar landscape transition regions of Brazil, for conservation purposes, must consider stream segments of different orders, microbasins, and major basins in order to obtain data that faithfully reflect the regional diversity. Additionally, it is necessary to consider environmental gradients of land use and anthropic impacts in order to suggest appropriate strategies for conserving the environmental integrity of streams.

AB  - Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that have generated increasing interest in recent years due to their potential applications. Their biological capacity to grow faster than higher plants and their ability to convert solar energy into biomass and other bioactive molecules, has led to the development of various culture systems in order to produce different high-value products with commercial interest. The industrialization of the microalgae cultivation process requires the introduction of standardized quality parameters. In order to obtain bioactive compounds with high added value at a commercial level, it is necessary to sustainably produce biomass at a large scale. Such a process would imply specific stress conditions, such as variation in temperature, light or pH. These environmental conditions would make it more difficult to maintain the viability of the culture and protect the yield and condition of the target molecules. The physiological and biochemical impact of these stress factors on the microalgae biomass can be potentially measured by the presence and activity of various biochemical indicators called biomarkers.

AB  - Four southwestern Caribbean atolls (Albuquerque, Courtown, Roncador, and Serrana) were visited in 1994-95 to evaluate the status of coral reefs. A study of the health condition of hard corals (Cnidaria: Scleractinia and Milleporina) was performed at 62 stations, covering different reef environments from shore to 20 m depth. The surface of over 2100 colonies of 30 species was carefully examined along haphazardly selected linear transects. Old dead areas were found in a great number of colonies (mean = 78.9% +/- 2.5%), but only 23.7% (+/- 1.7%) of the colonies showed evidence of recent mortality. Other frequent conditions were live tissue invaded by algae (mean = 54.1% +/- 3.2%) and Stegastes planifrons (Cuvier in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1830) territories (mean 11.5% +/- 1.8%). Remaining recorded conditions (including diseases, predation, invasion by other organisms, and physical damages) occurred at frequencies < 9%. Mean affected area was < 4% of the colony surface, except for old mortality (mean = 33.2% +/- 1.5%). Since the atolls are far away from continental influence and urban impacts, the origin of the high old coral mortality is probably related to degrading agents of regional and global nature occurring during the past 20 yrs (bleaching events, epidemic diseases, Diadema antillarum (Philippi, 1845) mortality).

AB  - Structural components and systems have an important safety function in nuclear power plants. Although they are essentially passive under normal operating conditions, they play a key role in mitigating the impact of extreme environmental events such as earthquakes, winds, fire and floods on plant safety. Moreover, the importance of structural components and systems in accident mitigation is amplified by common-cause effects. Reinforced concrete structural components and systems in NPPs are subject to a phenomenon known as aging, leading to time-dependent changes in strength and stiffness that may impact their ability to withstand various challenges during their service lives from operation, the environment and accidents. Time-dependent changes in structural properties as well as challenges to the system are random in nature. Accordingly, condition assessment of existing structures should be performed within a probabilistic framework. The mathematical formalism of a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) provides a means for identifying aging structural components that may play a significant role in mitigating plant risk. Structural condition assessments supporting a decision regarding continued service can be rendered more efficient if guided by the logic of a PRA. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hermaphroditic individuals in the population of Chinese crucians [Carassius auratus (Linnaeus, 1758)] in Chany Lake (Western Siberia) were recorded during a water level regression phase between 2006 and 2014. This period was characterized by critical conditions affecting crucian spawning because of increasing water salinity and a wide amplitude of water temperature fluctuations in the shallow spawning zone. The average percentage of hermaphrodites in the population was 1.6% relative to females and approximately 16% relative to males. The morphological constitution of the gonads of the hermaphrodites evidenced their participation in spawning. According to the Fisher criterion (F), the females, males, and hermaphrodites were similar in body size, morphometric indicators and gonad maturity (P > 0.05). Since hermaphrodites were not recorded during periods of the transgressive water phase, there is a biological possibility that the formation of hermaphrodites occurs under harsh environmental conditions. According to this hypothesis, the appearance of hermaphrodites can be considered to be one of the compensatory mechanisms regulating the population size under adverse environmental conditions by increasing sperm concentrations in spawning areas.

AB  - Environmental conditions have a great influence on the growth and development of weeds and, consequently, on their ability to compete, and changing these conditions can be effective in weed management. For this purpose, an experiment was carried out in 2016 and 2017 in the greenhouse of the Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Iran. The studied factors were four weed species Red root pigweed (Amaranthus retrollexus), Jimsonweed (Datura stramonium), Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens L) and Catchweed (Setaria verticilata) and three irrigation periods to field capacity (irrigation daily (control), irrigation once in every three days and irrigated once every six days). Results showed that with increasing irrigation period, Leaf Area Index (LAI), Relative Growth Rate (RGR), Weed Growth Rate (WGR), Net Assimilation Rate (NAR) and Total Dry Matter (TDM) decreased. The extent of decrease in growth indices was different between weeds C3 and C4. Total dry matter of Catchweed and Red root pigweed responded to increased irrigation periods less than others. In control irrigation, Jimsonweed growth indices were higher than other weeds, but to exert stress and increasing irrigation periods, Red root pigweed was more successful and a stronger competitor.

AB  - Unintended release of CO2 from carbon sequestration reservoirs poses a well-recognized risk to groundwater quality. Research has largely focused on in situ CO2-induced pH depression and subsequent trace metal mobilization. In this paper we focus on a second mechanism: upward intrusion of displaced brine or brackish-water into a shallow aquifer as a result of CO2 injection. Studies of two natural analog sites provide insights into physical and chemical mechanisms controlling both brackish water and CO2 intrusion into shallow aquifers along fault zones. At the Chimayo, New Mexico site, shallow groundwater near the fault is enriched in CO2 and, in some places, salinity is significantly elevated. In contrast, at the Springerville, Arizona site CO2 is leaking upward through brine aquifers but does not appear to be increasing salinity in the shallow aquifer. Using multiphase transport simulations we show conditions under which significant CO2 can be transported through deep brine aquifers into shallow layers. Only a subset of these conditions favor entrainment of salinity into the shallow aquifer: high aspect-ratio leakage pathways and viscous coupling between the fluid phases. Recognition of the conditions under which salinity is favored to be cotransported with CO2 into shallow aquifers will be important in environmental risk assessments.

AB  - Many studies suggest that migratory birds are expected to travel more quickly during spring, when they are en route to the breeding grounds, in order to ensure a high-quality territory. Using data recorded by means of Global Positioning System satellite tags, we analysed at three temporal scales (hourly, daily and overall journey) seasonal differences in migratory performance of the booted eagle (Aquila pennata), a soaring raptor migrating between Europe and tropical Africa, taking into account environmental conditions such as wind, thermal uplift and day length. Unexpectedly, booted eagles showed higher travel rates (hourly speed, daily distance, overall migration speed and overall straightness) during autumn, even controlling for abiotic factors, probably thanks to higher hourly speeds, more straight routes and less non-travelling days during autumn. Tailwinds were the main environmental factor affecting daily distance. During spring, booted eagles migrated more quickly when flying over the Sahara desert. Our results raise new questions about which ecological and behavioural reasons promote such unexpected faster speeds in autumn and not during spring and how events occurring in very different regions can affect migratory performance, interacting with landscape characteristics, weather conditions and flight behaviour.

AB  - Diel vertical migration (DVM) bioassay-guided Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy can be a prominent non-destructive and innovative approach for ecological studies. During the characterization of the nature of the fish-exuded kairomone, the peak area results from the spectroscopic analysis of the control, fish-conditioned (F) and temperature incubated fish-conditioned (IF) treatments of the DVM bioassays demonstrated that there was a strong correlation between the alterations of the amine N-H, amide II, amide IV and CH3 asymmetric vibrations, suggesting that both N-H and CH3 molecules may be main components of the fish-exuded kairomone cocktail. The IF treatment, which showed similar results with the control treatment, supported that the kairomone is inactivated by bacterial biodegradation. The seasonal variations in the peak areas of the N-H and CH3 bands suggested that DVM response varied seasonally, where migration response developed quickly in warmer seasons. The peak area of the amine N-H band of the F and IF treatments relative to control conditions can be used as an ideal indicator of the absence or presence and the promptness of migration, at all seasons.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine under laboratory conditions over a period of 311 clays if infection with the nematode Anguillicola, crassus induces stress in European eels (Anguilla anguilla), and stimulates the endocrine stress axis as measured by serum cortisol levels, Eels were experimentally infected with 3rd-stage larvae (L-3) in different doses to simulate natural conditions with varying infection pressures. Blood samples were drawn from the caudal vein every 2 weeks and serum cortisol con cent ratio ris were determined by radio immunoassay (RIA). The results showed that the application of L-3 resulted in a significant increase in the cortisol levels. The period of time at which elevated cortisol values were observed was consistent with the time of larval development and the appearance of adult A. crassus. Thus, there is a stress response to the larval and young adult stages, but no chronic response to older adults. Therefore, it is likely that infection of eels under natural conditions especially with a high number of larvae may be a considerable stressor, in combination with different environmental factors like water temperature, pH, oxygen concentration, pollution and interindividual relationships.

AB  - The bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica is a common floating alga in the southern hemisphere, but despite the ecological and biogeographic importance of kelp rafts, little is known about the responses of detached kelps to the conditions at the sea surface. The morphological, physiological and reproductive performances of D. antarctica rafts in the Coastal System of Coquimbo, Chile (CSC, 30A degrees S), were examined during winter and summer of two successive years (2010/11 and 2011/12). Epibionts (Lepas spp.) that only attach to floating objects were used as indicator for the floating time of kelp rafts. Photosynthetic efficiency and reproductive maturity of both benthic and floating algae varied seasonally, with a stronger decrease in summer than in winter. Blade size (measured as weight proportion of kelp individuals), phlorotannin concentrations and antioxidant activities were lower in floating than in benthic algae. Environmental conditions and floating time affected the blade tissues, with stronger negative effects during summer. These results confirm that floating persistence of D. antarctica in the CSC is suppressed during the summer months, which indicates that the dispersal potential of this (and other) floating algae varies seasonally.

AB  - Here we present the first terrestrial record of mid-Holocene environmental changes in Vanuatu. This preliminary multi-proxy analysis of core Tfer 06 from Emaotfer Swamp (Efate Island) indicates changes in environmental conditions are mainly related to variations in climate over the last 6500 cal yr BR Drier periods are broadly correlated with an increase in sustained El Nino events recorded in the Pacific on a decadal timescale. The earliest change is the disappearance of mangroves adjacent to the site around 3200 cal yr BP, this could well be due to both local tectonic uplift with subsequent hydrostatic adjustment and the onset of a drier period. From c. 3250-2500 cal yr BP the prevailing drier conditions can be linked to more persistent El Nino conditions. Local volcanic events had limited ecological impact on the area. Freshwater diatoms indicate a hydroseral succession, species living on submerged plants being common in muds from c. 3250-1500 cal yr BP, but rare in fibrous peat deposited later. Palaeoecological indicators of human impact have not been identified throughout this work. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - PALEOBIOLOGY

KW  - LAKE ENVIRONMENTS
KW  - TIME
AB  - Eocene lake beds of Horsefly, British Columbia, are preserved in varves, or discrete yearly layers representing seasonal changes in the lake. These varves allow study of temporal variation and rates of change in morphological and ecological characters on a very short time scale. One of the most sensitive indicators of the paleoenvironmental conditions on the floor of the lake may be the taphonomic condition of the fishes, which vary between perfectly articulated and completely disarticulated skeletons. Patterns of disarticulation correspond to those produced by scavengers. The taphonomy supports the hypothesis that the lake was warm monomictic, circulating in the winter, at which time scavengers could gain access to the bottom of the lake. Larger-scale environmental events (on the order of hundreds of years) are suggested by the fact that the proportion of well-preserved specimens reached two peaks within the seven centuries of deposition, one peak during the second century and another during the fifth and sixth centuries. These results clearly demonstrate two principles: that taphonomy can be a sensitive indicator of paleoenvironmental conditions, and that temporal averaging can affect the taphonomic properties of this fossil site, and presumably of others with equal or lower time resolution.

KW  - biofertilizers
AB  - Modern agriculture is currently facing major economic and environmental problems, due to the indiscriminate use of chemical products and poor management of natural resources, hence the need to reduce the use of mineral fertilizers and resort to other healthier methods such as the use of biofertilizers. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus in the tomato crop in the typical Ferralitic Red soil conditions. The research was conducted at the Horticultural Research Institute "Liliana Dimitrova", during two campaigns (2016-2017 and 2017-2018) under open field conditions. The variety of tomato 'L-43' was used as vegetable material. Four treatments were studied: T1: 70 % nitrogen fertilization + 2 applications of G. diazotrophicus, T2: 50 % nitrogen fertilization + 2 applications of G. diazotrophicus, T3: 50 % nitrogen fertilization + 3 applications of G. diazotrophicus and T4: control (100 % nitrogen fertilization) which were distributed in a randomized block design with four replications, where indicators of vegetative and morphological, productive and fruit quality were evaluated. The results indicate that the application of G. diazotrophicus allows reducing by 30 % the nitrogen fertilization recommended for the tomato in the typical Red Ferralitic soil conditions, not affecting the external quality of the fruits, constituting an alternative of nutritional management.

AB  - Recreation activities and visitor use often have deleterious ecological impacts in protected areas. Management agencies then face the difficult task of providing recreation and tourism opportunities without compromising environmental values. This study assessed the success of efforts aimed at conserving alpine vegetation along the Mt Bogong Massif in Victoria, Australia, through controlling the use of horses. Vegetation condition was assessed in 2001 to coinciding with restrictions on the use of horse riding on trails and then resurveyed 10years later. Sampling was undertaken in track plots that included the trail and surrounding vegetation, and control plots located away from the trail. There were significant differences in the amount of bare ground, the height of shrubs and ground layer vegetation, and shrub cover between track and control plots in 2001. Ten years later, track plots were recovering with reductions in bare ground and changes in vegetation, with improved ground layer vegetation height. Results show that vegetation condition has improved with restrictions of horse numbers. The indicators selected were sensitive to changes in vegetation condition and hence should be used for ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of this and similar management interventions.

AB  - Nitrate content in various species of vegetable and potatoes is influenced by a number of external factors acting on conversion of crude protein in soil and on their metabolism in plant.  Nitrate pool of plants is very unstable and effects of environment may be very strongly applied in the final nitrate content in products. Results of research and experience obtained in practice show that soil properties and concrete meteorological conditions in the growing season often overlap even such an important antropic factor, as is application of fertilizers or manures. This includes different level of soil fertility conditioned by a mechanical composition, physical and biological properties out of soil characteristics, and agrochemical indicators include e.g.: humus supply, soil pH, ratio C : N, content of variable forms of main nutrients and microelements, etc. This includes also meteorological conditions of year given by moisture content, heat and light and schedule of their supply during the growing region. The part of effect of environment may amount even to 85 % in the total variability of nitrate content. The data discussed of world literature indicate the complexity of problems and necessity of complex approach to the evaluation of the whole spectrum of factors applied in accumulation of nitrates in plant products.

AB  - Burial of organic carbon in marine sediments has a profound influence in marine biogeochemical cycles and provides a sink for greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4. However, tracing organic carbon from primary production sources as well as its transformations in the sediment record remains challenging. Here we examine a novel but growing tool for tracing the biosynthetic origin of amino acid carbon skeletons, based on naturally occurring stable carbon isotope patterns in individual amino acids (delta C-13(AA)). We focus on two important aspects for delta C-13(AA) utility in sedimentary paleoarchives: first, the fidelity of source diagnostic of algal delta C-13(AA) patterns across different oceanographic growth conditions, and second, the ability of delta C-13(AA) patterns to record the degree of subsequent microbial amino acid synthesis after sedimentary burial. Using the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii, we tested under controlled conditions how delta C-13(AA) patterns respond to changing environmental conditions, including light, salinity, temperature, and pH. Our findings show that while differing oceanic growth conditions can change macromolecular cellular composition, delta C-13(AA) isotopic patterns remain largely invariant. These results emphasize that delta C-13(AA) patterns should accurately record biosynthetic sources across widely disparate oceanographic conditions. We also explored how delta C-13(AA) patterns change as a function of age, total nitrogen and organic carbon content after burial, in a marine sediment core from a coastal upwelling area off Peru. Based on the four most informative amino acids for distinguishing between diatom and bacterial sources (i.e., isoleucine, lysine, leucine and tyrosine), bacterially derived amino acids ranged from 10 to 15% in the sediment layers from the last 5000 years, and up to 35% during the last glacial period. The greater bacterial contributions in older sediments indicate that bacterial activity and amino acid resynthesis progressed, approximately as a function of sediment age, to a substantially larger degree than suggested by changes in total organic nitrogen and carbon content. It is uncertain whether archaea may have contributed to sedimentary delta C-13(AA) patterns we observe, and controlled culturing studies will be needed to investigate whether delta C-13(AA) patterns can differentiate bacterial from archeal sources. Further research efforts are also needed to understand how closely delta C-13(AA) patterns derived from hydrolyzable amino acids represent total sedimentary proteineincous material, and more broadly sedimentary organic nitrogen. Overall, however, both our culturing and sediment studies suggest that delta C-13(AA) patterns in sediments will represent a novel proxy for understanding both primary production sources, and the direct bacterial role in the ultimate preservation of sedimentary organic matter.

AB  - The effects of the unpredictability of the flow system in a karst area, with respect to bacterial communities in the aquatic environment, were evaluated. Bacterial communities from two different types of flow conditions (spring and sinkhole) were characterized and compared in the karst area. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia were the major phyla present in the sampled spring and sinkhole waters. The water samples from the spring points were heavily loaded with Actinobacteria, especially Firmicutes, which accounted for 4.3% of the bacterial content. Furthermore, Actinobacteria were prevalent in some water samples, serving as indicators of the effects of seawater inundation. The richness and diversity of bacterial species were evaluated at the spring and sinkhole water points. The spring waters showed a higher bacterial richness and diversity compared to the sinkhole waters. Our results provide valuable information for the evaluation and investigation of microbial compositions in karst areas, which are characterized by heterogeneous hydrological conditions. The microbial species in karst areas are already exposed to changing hydrogeological conditions, and are likely to be confronted with future changes; thus, their spatiotemporal variations reflect the shifting baselines of physicochemical and ecosystem processes.

AB  - Reintroduced environments represent stressful conditions to plants that can be observed in different ways. We evaluated the relationships between fluctuating asymmetry (FA), herbivory, and plant ontogeny of Chamaecrista semaphora (Fabaceae) under natural and restored habitat conditions. The patterns of leaf FA and herbivory by folivorous insects (chewing) on saplings and mature plants in each habitat were determined. No relationship was found between FA and herbivory on the two ontogenetic stages in both environments, suggesting that FA did not represent an indicator of stress. The frequency and amount of leaf area removed by folivores were higher in saplings compared to adult plants under the natural habitat, while the opposite trend was observed on restored habitat for adult plants. The restored habitat did not represent an environmental stress condition to C. semaphora, indicating that this endemic plant may represent a good candidate to restoration programs in harsh environments. However, we observed great differences in leaf FA and herbivory among individuals within habitats. Knowledge on plant quality, competition, physiology, and interactions with natural enemies are highly needed to support long lasting programmes on restoration of harsh environments.

AB  - Submergent aquatic vegetation (SAV) is a powerful indicator of environmental conditions in both marine and fresh water ecosystems. Quickbird imagery was used to map SAV at three sites across the Great Lakes. Unsupervised classifications were performed at each site using summer Quickbird sensor data. At one site, a multi-temporal classification approach was added, combining visible red difference (May-August) with August red and green visible band data. Multi-temporal SAV classification was superior to single-date results at this site. Muck bottom was not seriously confused with SAV, which was unexpected. Multi-temporal classification results showed less confusion between deep water and SAV, although spectral variability due to sub-surface sandbar structure was a source of error in both single- and multi-date classifications. Nevertheless, some of the confounding effects of water column on SAV classification appear to have been mitigated using this multi-temporal approach. Future efforts would be well served by incorporating detailed, continuous, bathymetry data in the classification process. Quickbird sensor data are very useful for classifying SAV under US Great Lakes conditions. However, regional classification efforts using these data may be impractical at this time, as high cost, rigid tasking parameters and unpredictable water conditions limit availability of suitable imagery.

AB  - Soil biodiversity constitutes the biological pillars of ecosystem services provided by soils worldwide. Soil life is threatened by intense agricultural management and shifts in climatic conditions as two important global change drivers which are not often jointly studied under field conditions. We addressed the effects of experimental short-term drought over the wheat growing season on soil organisms and ecosystem functions under organic and conventional farming in a Swiss long term trial. Our results suggest that activity and community metrics are suitable indicators for drought stress while microbial communities primarily responded to agricultural practices. Importantly, we found a significant loss of multiple pairwise positive and negative relationships between soil biota and process-related variables in response to conventional farming, but not in response to experimental drought. These results suggest a considerable weakening of the contribution of soil biota to ecosystem functions under long-term conventional agriculture. Independent of the farming system, experimental and seasonal (ambient) drought conditions directly affected soil biota and activity. A higher soil water content during early and intermediate stages of the growing season and a high number of significant relationships between soil biota to ecosystem functions suggest that organic farming provides a buffer against drought effects.

AB  - The private home is a crucial site in the aging process, yet the upkeep of this physical space often poses a challenge for community-dwelling older adults. Previous efforts to explain variation in disorderly household conditions have relied on individual-level characteristics, but ecological perspectives propose that home environments are inescapably nested within the dynamic socioeconomic circumstances of surrounding spatial contexts, such as the metro area. We address this ecological embeddedness in the context of the Great Recession, an event in which some U.S. cities saw pronounced and persistent declines across multiple economic indicators while other areas rebounded more rapidly. Panel data (2005-6 and 2010-11) from a national survey of older adults were linked to interviewer home evaluations and city-level economic data. Results from fixed-effects regression support the hypothesis that older adults dwelling in struggling cities experienced an uptick in disorderly household conditions. Findings emphasize the importance of city-specificity when probing effects of a downturn. Observing changes in home upkeep also underscores the myriad ways in which a city's most vulnerable residents- older adults, in particular-are affected by its economic fortunes.

AB  - Agricultural sustainability considers the effects of farm activities on social, economic, and environmental conditions at local and regional scales. Adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices entails defining sustainability, developing easily measured indicators of sustainability, moving toward integrated agricultural systems, and offering incentives or imposing regulations to affect farmer behavior. Landscape ecology is an informative discipline in considering sustainability because it provides theory and methods for dealing with spatial heterogeneity, scaling, integration, and complexity. To move toward more sustainable agriculture, we propose adopting a systems perspective, recognizing spatial heterogeneity, integrating landscape-design principles and addressing the influences of context, such as the particular products and their distribution, policy background, stakeholder values, location, temporal influences, spatial scale, and baseline conditions. Topics that need further attention at local and regional scales include (1) protocols for quantifying material and energy flows; (2) standard specifications for management practices and corresponding effects; (3) incentives and disincentives for enhancing economic, environmental, and social conditions (including financial, regulatory and other behavioral motivations); (4) integrated landscape planning and management; (5) monitoring and assessment; (6) effects of societal demand; and (7) integrative policies for promoting agricultural sustainability.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the study is to develop directions for improving the management of livestock reproduction processes on the basis of its innovation-and-investment development.
   Methodology / approach. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study is the dialectical method of cognition, conceptual provisions of economic theory, scientific works of domestic and foreign scientists on the management of the process of reproduction of animal husbandry and a systematic approach to the study and timely detection of various socio-economic and industrial problems. The study of economic aspects of management of the process of revival and effective development of animal husbandry was carried out using general scientific (analysis, synthesis, abstraction, generalization) and statistical and mathematical methods (correlation, regression, scenario planning, mathematical modeling and forecasting of economic processes).
   Results. The application of the proposed methods and methodological approaches made it possible to take into account the main components of the management system to reproduce the potential of the industry to identify prospects for growth in gross livestock production and predict changes in economic indicators of its innovation and investment development in the future. The use of systematic and abstract-logical approaches contributed to the formation of a strategy for the revival of the livestock industry based on a list of development scenarios in accordance with the objectives for its implementation and provided an opportunity to outline the problem area for economic modernization of livestock.
   Originality / scientific novelty. For the first time, a mechanism for modernization and development of animal husbandry, flexible to economic and social changes in production, is developed, which provides the possibility of modernization processes in the main subsectors of animal husbandry and the introduction of innovative technologies for livestock production. It is developed the study of the use of an alternative method of forecasting priority economic parameters under the conditions of unstable tendencies of agricultural production and dynamic changes in the development of animal husbandry under the influence of factors that are changed with different intensity over a long period.
   Practical value / implications. The developed theoretical and practical principles made it possible to reveal the integrity of the process of managing the reproduction and development of the livestock industry. The conducted forecast allowed stating changes in production of livestock products and productivity of animals. The obtained results helped to identify the factors that prevent the changing economic, social, political and environmental conditions to transfer the livestock industry to an innovative path of its development through the introduction of modern technologies.

AB  - The stereoselective degradation behaviors of chiral triazole fungicides (hexaconazole, flutriafol and tebuconazole) in sediment were investigated under laboratory conditions. The enantiomers were completely separated by high-performance liquid chromatography on a cellulose tris(3-chloro-4-methyl-phenylcarbamate) (Lux Cellulose-2) column. The mean recoveries of hexaconazole, flutriafol and tebuconazole in sediment ranged from 86.7% to 105.9%. The methods were successfully applied for the enantioselective degradation analysis of fungicides in sediment. The results showed that the dissipation of hexaconazole, flutriafol and tebuconazole stereoisomers in sediment followed first-order kinetics (R-2 > 0.95). The degradation rate of the enantiomers was different in sediment, and the (-)-enantiomer (t(1/2) was 86 days for hexaconazole, 139 for flutriafol and 136 for tebuconazole) degraded faster than the (+)-enantiomer (t(1/2) was 94 days for hexaconazole, 144 for flutriafol and 151 for tebuconazole) in native condition. The fungicides were degraded slowly, and no significant enantioselective degradation were observed under Sterilized conditions. The results may hold promising implications for the environmental and ecological risk assessment of three important chiral triazole fungicides. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Landscape evolution and environmental conditions from Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to Late Holocene times were reconstructed from the mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the alluvial morphochronostratigraphy, recorded in Bardenas Reales Natural Park (Ebro Basin, NE Spain). Alluvial architecture includes a LGM-Holocene gravelly unit (approximate to 22-9 ka BP), a Lower Holocene silty-muddy unit (approximate to 9-7 ka BP), and an Upper Holocene sandy unit (approximate to 5-0.1 ka BP). Increases in illite-smectite mixed layers, kaolinite, chlorite and modified Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA*), as well as the decrease in illite FWHM(E), are indicators of minor increases in the chemical weathering of the alluvial sediments. The results suggest that this area, although under broad semiarid conditions, underwent the following environmental evolution: i) an increasing trend in moisture availability in the Lower Holocene, and ii) a variable pattern in water disposal at the onset of the Upper Holocene, followed by a decrease in humidity during the last millennium. This reconstruction proves the usefulness of mineralogical and geochemical proxies as indicators of rapid environmental changes under Mediterranean conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - Biochar is a solid material of biological origin obtained from biomass carbonization, designed as a mean to reduce greenhouse gases emission and carbon sequestration in soils for a long time. Biochar has a wide spectrum of practical utilization and is applied as a promising soil improver or fertilizer in agriculture, or as a medium for soil or water remediation. Preparations of biochar increase plant growth and yielding when applied into soil and also improve plant growth conditions, mainly bio, physical and chemical properties of soil. Its physical and chemical properties have an influence on bacteria, fungi and invertebrates, both in field and laboratory conditions. Such effects on rhizosphere organisms are positive or negative depending on biochar raw material origin, charring conditions, frequency of applications, applications method and doses, but long term effects are generally positive and are associated mainly with increased soil biota activity However, a risk assessment of biochar applications is necessary to protect food production and the soil environment. This should be accomplished by biochar production and characterization, land use implementation, economic analysis, including life cycle assessment, and environmental impact assessment.

AB  - In this study, phytosociological plots are used to describe species composition and ecological conditions of habitats in which Solidago xniederederi, a natural hybrid between the North American S. canadensis and the European S. virgaurea, was found as established in Poland. Four groups of phytosociological plots have been distinguished based on the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean. The groups did not differ significantly in the mean number of species per plot and in the species evenness, in contrast to the mean values of Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson index. In each group of phytosociological plots, S. xniederederi and S. virgaurea had the highest value of constancy degree. Meadow species of the class Molinio-Arrhenatheretea had the highest share in all groups of phytosociological plots. Considering the Ellenberg's indicators, the groups of phytosociological plots differed significantly in the mean values of the light and thermal conditions, soil moisture, soil reaction, and nutrients. The results suggested that S. xniederederi can be established in well light places with partial shade and temperate conditions, on moist, moderately acidic to almost neutral soils with average fertility and is strongly associated with S. virgaurea and meadow species of Molinio-Arrhenatheretea.

Consequently, community structure in many rivers is expected to change because river flow is fundamental in determining conditions required by organisms, and processes on which they depend. Future flows in pan-European rivers were computed for baseline conditions (period 1961-1990) and for different combinations of climate and socio-economic scenarios (2040-2069). For each scenario a set of indicators was produced describing flow regime aspects that are most important in determining river ecosystem character. Classification techniques were applied to each set to define eco-hydrological river types. Spatial patterns of baseline and future types were mapped. Depending on scenario, about 30-50% of the river network length remained of the same type, whilst c. 40-50% transformed to an existing type; a third group of rivers (c. 10-20% of network length) formed new types, not present under baseline conditions, with potential to create novel river ecosystems.

AB  - Environmental flows (e-flows) are a common management tool to improve the health of flow-regulated river systems and their biota. The effect of e-flows on fish, waterbirds and vegetation has been assessed in Australia, but their influence on turtles remains largely unstudied. We opportunistically examined the effect of e-flows on the eastern longnecked turtle (Chelodina longicollis), a species that occupies ephemeral aquatic habitats, by measuring an index of abundance (catch per unit effort) and body condition before and after an environmental watering event that replenished a severely contracted creek in the mid-Murray region. We found that average body condition increased after watering. Abundance decreased markedly after watering, but the change was not statistically significant. While the causal inference of our study was limited by the opportunistic nature of our before-after experimental design, this study provides preliminary evidence that environmental flows may improve the health of turtles occupying ephemeral floodplain habitats. Weencourage further research into the effect of e-flows on turtles to confirm the hypothesis that the increase in average body condition recorded in the current study was a function of e-flows.

AB  - Stream temperature is thought to be a primary determinant of the macro-spatial distribution of stream biota, but we lack temperature data for most streams. Past research often relied on surrogates, such as altitude, latitude, catchment area (ALCA) and air temperature to study biota-temperature relationships. However, temperature surrogates may not accurately represent the thermal environments experienced by the biota and could thus produce misleading inferences regarding such relationships. In the absence of observations, modelled stream temperature could improve both predictions and interpretations of stream biodiversity patterns. We tested this hypothesis by relating stream benthic invertebrate assemblage structure and composition at 92 reference-quality streams to ALCA, air temperature, modelled stream temperature and measured stream temperature, that is a progression from a coarse surrogate to directly measured water temperature. Modelled stream temperatures were obtained from a U.S.A.-wide model developed previously with data from 569 reference-quality sites. Variation in taxonomic composition, measured with an ordination, was strongly and almost identically associated with both modelled and measured stream temperature, but was less strongly associated with ALCA and air temperature. We also built predictive niche models to assess how choice of thermal metrics affected model performance. Model performance was measured as the precision with which each model predicted the number of taxa at a site (i.e. observed-to-expected taxon ratios). Niche models that contained modelled or measured stream temperature were more precise than those based on air temperature and ALCA. In addition, we compared the predicted probabilities of occurrence using niche models based on both modelled and measured stream temperatures. The two produced predicted probabilities of occurrence that were statistically indistinguishable for most (79%) taxa. Finally, we calculated thermal optima for each taxon as the abundance-weighted average of stream temperature at sites where each taxon occurred. Thermal optima produced with modelled and measured stream temperatures were almost identical. Large-scale models of stream temperature can be sufficiently accurate and precise to detect temperature-driven patterns in stream biodiversity and should be useful in predicting the effects of climate change and other human-caused thermal alterations on stream biodiversity.

AB  - In this study, the host-specificity and -sensitivity of human-and bovine-specific adeno-viruses (HS-AVs and BS-AVs) were evaluated by testing wastewater/fecal samples from various animal species in Southeast, Queensland, Australia. The overall specificity and sensitivity of the HS-AVs marker were 1.0 and 0.78, respectively. These figures for the BS-AVs were 1.0 and 0.73, respectively. Twenty environmental water samples were collected during wet conditions and 20 samples were colleted during dry conditions from the Maroochy Coastal River and tested for the presence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), host-specific viral markers, zoonotic bacterial and protozoan pathogens using PCR/qPCR. The concentrations of FIB in water samples collected after wet conditions were generally higher compared to dry conditions. HS-AVs was detected in 20% water samples collected during wet conditions and whereas BS-AVs was detected in both wet (i.e., 10%) and dry (i.e., 10%) conditions. Both Campylobacter jejuni mapA and Salmonella invA genes detected in 10% samples collected during dry conditions. The concentrations of Salmonella invA ranged between 3.5 x 10(2) and 4.3 x 10(2) genomic copies per 500 ml of water Giardia lamblia beta-giardin gene was detected only in one sample (5%) collected during the dry conditions. Weak or significant correlations were observed between FIB with viral markers and zoonotic pathogens. However, during dry conditions, no significant correlations were observed between FIB concentrations with viral markers and zoonotic pathogens. The prevalence of HS-AVs in samples collected from the study river suggests that the quality of water is affected by human fecal pollution and as well as bovine fecal pollution. The results suggest that HS-AVs and BS-AVs detection using PCR could be a useful tool for the identification of human sourced fecal pollution in coastal waters.

AB  - Remote sensing of local environmental conditions is not accessible if substrates are covered with vegetation. This study explored the relationship between vegetation spectra and karst eco-geo-environmental conditions. Hyperspectral remote sensing techniques showed that there were significant differences between spectral features of vegetation mainly distributed in karst and non-karst regions, and combination of 1,300- to 2,500-nm reflectance and 400- to 680-nm first-derivative spectra could delineate karst and non-karst vegetation groups. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) successfully assessed to what extent the variation of vegetation spectral features can be explained by associated eco-geo-environmental variables, and it was found that soil moisture and calcium carbonate contents had the most significant effects on vegetation spectral features in karst region. Our study indicates that vegetation spectra is tightly linked to eco-geo-environmental conditions and CCA is an effective means of studying the relationship between vegetation spectral features and eco-geo-environmental variables. Employing a combination of spectral and spatial analysis, it is anticipated that hyperspectral imagery can be used in interpreting or mapping eco-geo-environmental conditions covered with vegetation in karst region.

AB  - Moist lower montane vegetation has rarely been classified beyond broad zonational belts over large altitudinal ranges due to highly diverse species composition and structure. This study shows it is possible to further classify such forest types within Bwindi-Impenetrable National Park (BINP), and that these assemblages can be explained by a combination of environmental conditions and past management. Botanical and environmental data were collected along some 4000 m of linear transects from the area surrounding Mubwindi Swamp, BINP. Ordination using Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and classification using Two-way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) successfully identified four different species assemblages. These forest types were then named on the basis of the ecological characteristics of the species within the group, and the environmental conditions influencing the distribution and past disturbance of the forest. The techniques used were in agreement for three out of the four forest types identified. Analysis using an environmental overlay showed a significant association between forest type and altitude. The results of this study indicate that a regional classification of forest types within moist lower montane forest belt using only tree species is possible, and that the forest types identified can be explained by environmental conditions and past management.Resume
   La vegetation humide de basse montagne a rarement ete classee au-dela de larges ceintures de zonage portant sur des etendues de grandes amplitudes altitudinales, en raison de compositions et de structures d'especes extremement diverses. Cette etude montre qu'il est possible de classer plus precisement de tels types forestiers dans le Parc National de la Foret Impenetrable de Bwindi (BINP), et que l'on peut expliquer ces assemblages par une combinaison de conditions environnementales et de gestion passee. Des donnees botaniques et environnementales ont ete collectees le long de quelque 4,000 m de transects lineaires a partir de la zone entourant le Marais de Mubwindi, au BINP. L'ordination par la Gradation non metrique multidimensionnelle et la classification utilisant l'Analyse TWINSPAN (Two-way Indicator Species Analysis) ont reussi a identifier quatre assemblages d'especes differents. Ces types forestiers furent alors nommes en se basant sur les caracteristiques ecologiques des especes au sein du groupe ainsi que sur les conditions environnementales qui influencent la distribution et des perturbations anciennes des forets. Les techniques utilisees se sont montrees coherentes pour trois des quatre types de foret identifies. L'analyse utilisant une superposition environnementale a revele une association significative entre type forestier et altitude. Les resultats de cette etude indiquent qu'une classification regionale des types forestiers dans la ceinture forestiere humide qui entoure la basse montagne est possible en n'utilisant que trois especes d'arbres, et que les types forestiers identifies peuvent s'expliquer par les conditions environnementales et par la gestion anterieure.

AB  - The objective of the research was to determine whether the Vistula Lagoon and Lake ebsko, both brackish water bodies, provide similar habitat conditions for zooplankton. The physical and chemical parameters of the water and biological indicators were examined based on the example of zooplankton assemblages in samples collected from June to October in 2010 and 2011. The two water bodies investigated exhibited low water transparency, fluctuating water pH from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline, good oxygen conditions, and frequent hyperoxia. The salinity profiles in both reservoirs were shaped by inflows of riverine and marine waters. The nutrient concentrations between the Vistula Lagoon and Lake ebsko did not differ significantly, except for that of ammonium nitrogen in 2010. The values recorded for orthophosphates, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a concentration were comparable in both water bodies. The physical and chemical parameters of the water in the research seasons differed significantly in terms of pH and temperature ranges in both of the basins investigated. No clear trends in the variability of the remaining parameters were observed either seasonally or spatially. The study demonstrated that the two water bodies provide moderately similar habitat conditions to the zooplankton that inhabit them.

AB  - An accelerometric record from the IVIDIL experiment (ESA Columbus module) has exhaustively been studied. The analysis involved the determination of basic statistical properties as, for instance, the auto-correlation and the power spectrum (second-order statistical analyses). Also, and taking into account the shape of the associated histograms, we address another important question, the non-Gaussian nature of the time series using the bispectrum and the bicoherence of the signals. Extrapolating the above-mentioned results, a computational model of a high-temperature shear cell has been performed. A scalar indicator has been used to quantify the accuracy of the diffusion coefficient measurements in the case of binary mixtures involving photovoltaic silicon or liquid Al-Cu binary alloys. Three different initial arrangements have been considered, the so-called interdiffusion, centred thick layer and the lateral thick layer. Results allow us to conclude that, under the conditions of the present work, the diffusion coefficient is insensitive to the environmental conditions, that is to say, accelerometric disturbances and initial shear cell arrangement.

AB  - Four lacustrine rift sub-basins in the Erlian Basin, one of the most petroliferous basins in northern China, have been analyzed to characterize source rock potential, to reveal environmental and ecological changes and to construct depositional models for lacustrine source rocks in different tectonic settings. The first member of the Tengger Formation in these sub-basins is characterized by a wide range of total organic carbon contents, hydrogen indices and kerogen types. These sub-basins have dissimilar boundary fault activities and sedimentation rates. The differences in border fault activity and sedimentation rate are consistent with changes in productivity, redox conditions and clastic influx input. The carbon isotopic composition of carbonates in mudstone samples suggests that the productivity of Aer and Wuli sub-basins is higher than that of Naoer and Saihan sub-basins. Differences in tectonic conditions also result in different redox conditions of depositional environments. Total reduced sulfur and Pr/Ph ratios show an oxidizing environment in Aer and Wuli sub-basins; while a reducing environment was present in Naoer and Saihan sub-basins. With more active boundary faults and higher sedimentation rates, the terrigenous organic matter inputs to Aer and Wuli sub-basins are higher than Naoer and Saihan sub-basins. This can be confirmed by relative steranes abundances. Different tectonic conditions existed in different sub-basins, which lead to variations in ecological communities in the lake systems. These environmental and ecological changes enable us to construct models for the deposition of lacustrine source rocks under different tectonic backgrounds. During source rock deposition in Aer and Wuli sub-basins, the high influx of clastic sediments carrying high terrigenous organic matter and dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrate into the lake, might have sustained high productivity and oxidizing conditions. Due to high influx of clastic sediments and unstable water column stratification, the depositional environment of Aer and Wuli subbasins are oxidizing. In a high productivity lake, there is still significant organic matter accumulation in oxidized environment after oxidative degradation. The high productivity is the dominant factor controlling the formation of organic rich sediments and the deposition of source rocks in Aer and Wuli sub-basins. In Naoer and Saihan sub-basins, the depositional environment during source rock formation is reducing due to low influx of clastic sediments with low productivity. In low productivity lakes, such as Naoer and Saihan sub-basins, which are low productivity lakes, redox condition substitutes for productivity and becomes the predominant factor controlling the formation of lacustrine source rocks. It is evident that the synergetic evolution of depositional environments and organisms in a lake system accounts for the formation of source rocks with different characteristics. The proposed models may have important implications for source rock prediction in other lacustrine rift basins. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystem functioning and community structure are recognized as key components of ecosystem integrity, but comprehensive, standardized studies of the responses of both structural and functional indicators to different types of anthropogenic pressures remain rare. Consequently, we lack an empirical basis for (i) identifying when monitoring ecosystem structure alone misses important changes in ecosystem functioning, (ii) recommending sets of structural and functional metrics best suited for detecting ecological change driven by different anthropogenic pressures, and (iii) understanding the cumulative effects of multiple, co-occurring stressors on structure and function. We investigated variation in community structure and ecosystem functioning of stream ecosystems along three gradients (10-16 independent stream sites each) of increasing impact arising from agriculture, forestry and river regulation for hydropower, respectively. For each stream, we quantified variation in (i) the abiotic environment, (ii) community composition of four organism groups and (iii) three basal ecosystem processes underpinning carbon and nutrient cycling in streams. We assessed the responsiveness of multiple biodiversity, community structure and ecosystem functioning indicators based on variance explained and effect size metrics. Along a gradient of increasing agricultural impact, diatoms and fish were the most responsive groups overall, but significant variation was detected in at least one aspect of community composition, abundance and/ or biodiversity of every organism group . In contrast, most of our functional metrics did not vary significantly along the agricultural gradient, possibly due to contrasting, antagonistic effects of increasing nutrient concentrations and turbidity on ecosystem process rates. The exception was detritivore-mediated litter decomposition which increased up to moderate levels of nutrient. Impacts of river regulation were most marked for diatoms, which were responsive to both increasingly frequent hydropeaking and to increasing seasonal river regulation. Among functional indicators, both litter decomposition and algal biomass accrual declined significantly with increasing hydropeaking. Few structural or functional metrics varied with forest management, with macroinvertebrate diversity increasing along the forestry gradient, as did algal and fungal biomass accrual. Together, these findings highlight the challenges of making inferences about the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances at the ecosystem level based on community data alone, and pinpoint the need to identify optimal sets of functional and structural indicators best suited for detecting ecological changes associated with different human activities.

AB  - The determination of land cover changes (LCCs) and their association to biophysical and socioeconomic factors is vital to support government policies toward the sustainable use of natural resources. The present study aimed to quantify deforestation, forest recovery and net cover change in tropical dry forests (TDFs) in Brazil from 2007 to 2016, and investigate how they are associated to biophysical and socioeconomic factors. We also assessed the effects of LCC variables in human welfare indicators. For this purpose, we used MODIS imagery to calculate TDF gross loss (deforestation), gross gain (forest recovery) and net cover change (the balance between deforestation and forest recovery) for 294 counties in three Brazilian states (Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Piaui). We obtained seven factors potentially associated to LCC at the county level: total county area, road density, humidity index, slope, elevation, and % change in human population and in cattle density. From 2007 to 2016, TDF cover increased from 76,693 to 80,964 km(2) (+5.6%). This positive net change resulted from a remarkable forest recovery of 19,018 km2 (24.8%), offsetting a large deforested area (14,748 km2; 19.2%). Practically all these cover changes were a consequence of transitions from TDF to pastures and vice-versa, highlighting the importance of developing sustainable policies for cattle raising in TDF regions. Each LCC variable was associated to different set of factors, but two biophysical variables were significantly associated both to TDF area gained and lost per county: county area (positively) and slope (negatively), indicating that large and flat counties have very dynamic LCCs. The TDF net area change was only associated (negatively) to the humidity index, reflecting an increase in TDF cover in more arid counties. The net increase in Brazilian TDF area is likely a result from an interplay of biophysical and socioeconomic factors that reduced deforestation and caused pasture abandonment. Although the ecological integrity and permanence of secondary TDFs need further investigation, the recovery of this semi-arid ecosystem must be valued and accounted for in the national forest restoration programs, as it would significantly help achieving the goals established in the Bonn agreement and the Atlantic Rain Forest pact.

AB  - The provision of ecosystem services at the landscape level can be significantly influenced by land management practices. Within an agriculturally dominated case study area in Saxony, Germany, a more detailed land use classification, which includes differentiated information on agricultural management practices, was utilized within the raster-based planning support tool GISCAME. "Management" refers to typical, regional crop rotations and soil tillage practices.
   The focus of this research was based on an indicator-based approach to assess ecosystem services and the development of land use change (LUC) and land management change (LMC) scenarios. The EuroMaps Land Cover data set was specifically developed for the case study and included remote sensing information for the general land use classification and terrestrial mapping information. Furthermore, statistical data on detailed regional agricultural land management were included. The raster-based planning support tool GISCAME was then used to simulate scenarios and visualize results. The LUC and LMC scenarios showed that the more detailed land use classification provided better output for the prioritization of planning alternatives. Further it enabled a refined assessment of the provisioning services (i) food and fodder provision, (ii) biomass provision, the regulation services, (iii) soil erosion protection, (iv) drought risk regulation, (v) flood regulation, (vi) returns from land-based production (i.e. the market value of biomass provision), and (vii) ecological integrity. The results of this study support the view that the application of improved management measures, such as conservation tillage, can significantly enhance the provision of ecosystem services (e.g. soil erosion protection and drought risk regulation) at the landscape level. The study also indicates that a combination of strategic LUC, such as afforestation and LMC, might be an effective way to enhance regulating services with acceptable trade-offs regarding provisioning services. Our approach presents a refined foundation for ecosystem services assessment, which is designed to better support regional planning and the provision of information to non-experts in the participatory processes. For transfer into other regions, standardized land use and land management classification will have to be defined. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many indicators and criteria have been proposed to assess the sustainable management of forests but their scientific validity remains uncertain. Because the effects of forest disturbances (such as logging) are often specific to particular species, sites, landscapes, regions and forest types, management "shortcuts" such as indicator species, focal species and threshold levels of vegetation cover may be of limited generic value. We propose an alternative approach based on a set of five guiding principles for biodiversity conservation that are broadly applicable to any forested area: (1) the maintenance of connectivity; (2) the maintenance of landscape heterogeneity; (3) the maintenance of stand structural complexity; and (4) the maintenance of aquatic ecosystem integrity; (5) the use of natural disturbance regimes to guide human disturbance regimes.
   We present a checklist of measures for forest biodiversity conservation that reflects the multi-scaled nature of conservation approaches on forested land. At the regional scale, management should ensure the establishment of large ecological reserves. At the landscape scale, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) protected areas within production forests; (2) buffers for aquatic ecosystems; (3) appropriately designed and located road networks; (4) the careful spatial and temporal arrangement of harvest units; and (5) appropriate fire management practices. At the stand level, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) the retention of key elements of stand structural complexity (e.g., large living and dead trees with hollows, understorey thickets, and large fallen logs); (2) long rotation times (coupled with structural retention at harvest); (3) silvicultural systems alternative to traditional high impact ones (e.g., clearcutting in some forest types); and (4) appropriate fire management practices and practices for the management of other kinds of disturbances.
   Although the general ecological principles and associated checklist are intuitive, data to evaluate the effectiveness of many specific on-the-ground management actions are limited. Considerable effort is needed to adopt adaptive management "natural experiments" and monitoring to: (1) better identify the impacts of logging operations and other kinds of management activities on biodiversity, and; (2) quantify the effectiveness of impact mitigation strategies; and (3) identify ways to improve management practices.

AB  - This paper revises the response of freshwater ostracods to different environmental conditions and anthropogenic impacts, with a worldwide overview of the potential use of these microcrustaceans as bioindicators and several examples of applications in different scenarios. The development of either a single species or an ostracod assemblage is influenced by physical-chemical properties of waters (salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen), hydraulic conditions, bottom grain sizes or sedimentation rates. In addition to population and community changes, morphological and geochemical changes can also be detected in the ostracod carapace, which serves as a tracer of the water quality. All these features permit to delimit the spatial effects of urban sewages, mining effluents, agricultural wastes, watershed deforestation or road building. These data are the basis for the palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of cores, with an interesting application to archaeology. In addition, favourable results of recently developed bioassays, coupled with an important variability of local assemblages under changing conditions in both waters and sediments, suggest that these microcrustaceans may included between the most promising sentinels groups in freshwater areas. These microcrustaceans show high sensitivity to pesticides, herbicides, heavy metal pollution and oil inputs.

AB  - This study aimed at evaluating periphytic algae adaptive strategies, including size class, growth, and adherence forms, and the CRS functional groups model under nitrogen and phosphorus artificial enrichment in a Brazilian tropical shallow and oligotrophic reservoir. Four treatments were designed using enclosures (n = 3) filled with 185 L of reservoir water: control (no nutrient addition), P+ (isolated P addition, N-limiting condition); N+ (isolated N addition, P-limiting condition); and NP+ (combined addition, no limitation). N:P ratios were maintained throughout the experiment. Glass slides were used for periphyton growth, and sampling campaigns were carried out at short regular intervals (3-5 days) over a 31-day succession. Enrichment favored replacement of flagellates and loosely attached (mobile) forms by firmly attached mainly prostrate and entangled forms over succession. Isolated or combined P addition favored C-S-strategists green algae, whereas P limitation kept R-strategists over succession, promoting R-Cyanobacteria under high P limitation. Our results were supported by the species density and biovolume due to the dominance of small size classes (small-sized classes) in the community (nano and picoperiphyton). Overall, only the CRS strategies were more predictive of the experimental nutritional conditions.

AB  - A group of river managers, stakeholders, and scientists met during summer 2005 to design a more naturalized flow regime for the Lower Missouri River (LMOR). The objective was to comply with requirements under the U.S. Endangered Species Act to support reproduction and survival of threatened and endangered species, with emphasis on the endangered pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus), while minimizing negative effects to existing social and economic benefits of prevailing river management. Specific hydrograph requirements for pallid sturgeon reproduction are unknown, hence much of the design process was based on features of the natural flow regime. Enviornmental flow components (EFCs) extracted from the reference natural flow regime were used to design and assess performance of alternative flow regimes.
   The design process incorporated a primary stage in which conceptual hydrographs were developed and assessed for their general ecological and social-economic performance. The second stage accouted for hydroclimatic variation by coding the conceptual hydrographs into reservoir release rules, adding constraints for downstream flooding and low-storage precludes, and running the rules through 100 years of hydroclimatic simulation. The output flow regimes were then evaluated for presumed ecological benefits based on how closely they resembled EFCs in the reference natural flow regime. Flow regimes also were assessed for social-economic cost indicators, including days of flooding of low-lying agricultural land, days over flood stage, and storage levels in system reservoirs.
   Our experience with flow-regime design on the LMOR underscored the lack of confidence the stakeholders place in the value of the natural flow regime as a measure of ecosystem benefit in the absence of fundamental scientific documentation. Stakeholders desired proof of ecological benefits commensurate with certainty of economic losses. We also gained insight into the processes of integrating science into a collaborative management exercise. Although the 2005 collaborative effort failed to reach a consensus among stakeholders on a naturalized flow regime, the process was successful in pilot-testing a design approach: it helped focus scientific efforts on key knowledge gaps; and it demonstrated the potenetial for collaborations among scientists, stakeholders, and managers in river management decision making.

AB  - Historically monitoring of grazing impacts in rangelands has been seriously compromised by the small area, infrequency and variability of field-based sampling plots. Remote sensing of vegetation cover, which can be a surrogate for overall ecosystem condition, permits adequate spatial and temporal monitoring of land condition but can still be compromised by considerable inter and intra-paddock (field) variability. Cross-fence sample pairs control for local dines and patchiness in spatial and temporal variables such as vegetation, landform, soil type, surface-flows, and rainfall. We describe the theory behind a novel monitoring methodology that utilizes cross-fence sample pairs to rank paddocks, whether adjacent or not, using a system of linear equations and field based or preferably remotely-sensed data. This methodology outputs a condition ranking for each paddock in the system, with the aforementioned spatial and temporal variables controlled. Within paddock variability, such as differential grazing distribution, can be readily incorporated as weighting factors when suitable models are developed. This methodology may also be applicable to other grazing, agricultural and natural systems and applications where land management units have distinguishable boundaries. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to examine three sediment parameters used in paleolimnological studies, sediment organic, carbonate and biogenic silica (BSi) content, and to quantify the relationship among these parameters and modern environmental conditions for a series of Canadian Arctic lakes. Sediment samples from 63 lakes were analysed for organic, carbonate and BSi content. The environmental and physical parameters of these lakes were recorded. Bedrock composition exerted a very strong influence on sediment organic, BSi and carbonate content, and differences in lake production accounted for much of the remaining variance. The strongest relationships existed among sediment carbonate content, BSi content and water pH. A statistical model developed for predicting water pH provides a new tool for reconstructing past environmental conditions for Arctic aquatic ecosystems. A positive relationship between mean July air temperature and sediment organic and BSi content was detected, but was confounded by effects of bedrock on these parameters. However, the relationship between mean July air temperature and sediment organic and BSi could be even more significant in the context of constant bedrock composition, as is the case in paleolimnological studies.

AB  - Land consolidation zoning is the basis of land reclamation planning and provides a precondition for land management work. Zoning is beneficial to scientific decision-making regarding the use of cultivated land resources, and helps to ensure the quality and production level of cultivated land. Hence, land consolidation zoning is of national significance in terms of safeguarding food security. In this paper, an indicator system for land evaluation and zoning is described based on indicators of natural ecological conditions, socioeconomic conditions, land-use conditions, and the land consolidation potential of Hubei province. The application of self-organizing maps and Hierarchical clustering results in 11 and 12 categories, respectively. After comparing and adjusting these results according to the real situation and key points in the land consolidation of each zone, seven integrated categories are determined. Finally, the land consolidation zoning scheme for these seven integrated partitions is shown to be suitable for Hubei province and in line with the real situation. The proposed scheme offers support for land remediation in a coordinated and orderly way, and provides a scientific basis for improving land utilization efficiency and grain production capacity in Hubei province.

AB  - The use of natural fibers such as hemp (Cannabis saliva L) as substitutes for nonrenewable fibers increases the life cycle performance of composite materials. The management of retting in fields as a natural pretreatment prior to fiber extraction remains challenging due to a lack of knowledge about the relative importance of environmental and biotic factors, which continually interact under field conditions. Here, we studied the dynamics of hemp retting under controlled air temperature and humidity conditions and with simulated rain. We tracked the color and infrared spectral absorbance of the stem surface, the chemical composition and microbial enzyme activities of the bast tissues, and the stem architecture over 42 days at 15 degrees C. Color changes on the stem surfaces were the first indicators of retting progress, with a significant decrease in the L*, a* and b* values (CIELAB) from day 14 onward. These findings were closely correlated with the surface colonization progress as revealed by scanning electron microscopy, the changes in enzymatic activities and the decohesion of the bast tissues. Additional investigations are needed to study other environmental scenarios to provide an accurate assessment of the retting process over time.

AB  - The intensive feedlot systems of pig farming produce big amounts of waste with high potential of environment degradation. A possible alternative to the treatment of this waste is the implantation of tubular biodigesters for the generation of electric energy from the pig residues, which also generates byproducts such as biogas and generating carbon credits. The paper analyzed the economic viability of such types of projects based on a case study of the Piglandia Farm, located in MG, Brazil. Based on the main indicators of viability, such as net present value and internal rate of return, the project of implementation of biodigester was found to be highly viable. Aiming to incorporate risk in this type of study, it was performed a Monte Carlo simulation using the @Risk Software to improve decision making under risky conditions. The results indicate that even under conditions of risk, the project remained viable. As a suggestion of Policy, projects of this nature should be stimulated by public agencies and banks of development, for in addition to contributing to the maintenance of natural resources, if well dimensioned, they can be highly profitable to the investors.

AB  - Variation in canopy composition can influence ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling and light transmittance, even when environmental soil conditions are similar. To determine whether forest cover type influences species composition of the understory vegetation (herbs and shrubs), the composition of this layer was studied on two different surface deposits, clay and till, and under four different forest cover types dominated, respectively, by Populus tremuloides Michx. (aspen), Betula papyrifera Marsh. (white birch), Pinus banksiana Lamb. (jack pine), and Picea glauca (Moench) Voss - Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. (spruce-fir) over similar environmental conditions. Detrended correspondence analysis and analysis of variance performed on the ordination scores revealed that understory plant composition was highly affected by surface deposit and forest cover. The gradient observed in the correspondence analysis proceeds from aspen, white birch, spruce-fir, to jack pine. Indicator species were identified for each surface deposit and cover type, and most of them were associated with either jack pine or aspen. The richness, evenness, and diversity of the understory vegetation did not vary between cover types, but were affected by surface deposit. By controlling ecosystem processes such as light transmittance and nutrient cycling, forest cover influences understory composition.

AB  - Dissatisfaction persists with current approaches to range condition and trend assessment.  Sometimes assessed condition does not truly represent the past or the potential of range.  One of the likely causes is a failure to re-examine and change if necessary the theoretical basis of assessment, in line with developing understanding of ecological processes.  The concept of thresholds of environmental change appears to provide a reasonable alternative in some circumstances to the concepts of gradual retrogression and secondary succession which are currently accepted.  I suggest that environmental change can be discontinuous, with thresholds between alternative states.  Once a threshold is crossed to a more degraded state, the former state cannot be attained without significant management effort, such as prescribed burning, ploughing, or herbicide application, rather than simple grazing control.  Examination of data from extensive monitoring programs and from a study of grazing impact, as well as more general sources of information, indicates that thresholds of change may be identifiable in arid rangelands.  A practical means of monitoring proximity to thresholds is available and, with the aid of multivariate analysis, the effects of spatial variability and season can be separated from those of management.  The potential of this approach deserves investigation in a wider variety of environments.

AB  - Bioassessment programs in Sweden at present commonly use relatively simple approaches for detecting ecological change (e. g. the presence/absence of single indicator taxa). This study introduces and tests a more contemporary approach for assessing the ecological quality of Swedish streams. Macroinvertebrate data from 281 stream sites in southern Sweden, sampled in the autumn of 1995, were used for calibration of a multimetric index for assessing organic pollution of streams. For validation a data set consisting of 15 sites, sampled twice (spring and autumn) in 2000 was used. Eighty-four candidate macroinvertebrate metrics, within six attribute groups (richness, composition, tolerance, feeding, habit and habitat measures) were tested for inclusion in the final multimetric. Sites were grouped into four regional categories: (1) all sites combined (n = 281), and stream sites situated in the (2) southern boreal (n = 63), (3) boreonemoral (n = 187), and (4) nemoral (n = 31) ecoregions. Within each category, tests were done for the association between macroinvertebrate attributes and organic pollution.
   Five metrics were selected for inclusion in the final multimetric index (the DJ index): (i) number of EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) taxa, representing richness measures; (ii) percent Crustacea and (iii) percent EPT taxa, representing composition measures; and (iv) ASPT (Average Score Per Taxon) and (v) Saprobic index, representing tolerance measures. The DJ index was significantly correlated with environmental variables indicative of organic pollution stress, both at habitat- (silt substratum) and catchment-level (e. g. conductivity and percentage of the catchment classified as urban and arable). Using an external data set (the AQEM data set) for validation showed that the DJ index was significantly related to total phosphorous concentration both in spring (r(2) = 0.50, 1 SE = 0.30) and autumn (r(2) = 0.57, 1 SE = 0.43). Between-class discrimination was poor at moderate or low total phosphorous concentrations. However, the low number of sites (n = 15) used in this external validation may have resulted in low statistical power. Nonetheless, both the calibration and the validation showed that the final multimetric index developed here is a promising tool for detecting the effects of organic pollution on stream ecosystems.

AB  - Although landscape indicators are widely used to assess wetland ecological condition, how they capture the spatial arrangement of land cover is not well addressed. We conducted a Level 1 Landscape Assessment to revise strengths and weaknesses of landscape indicators when links to ecological conditions are strong. Wetland sites mapped by the National Wetlands Inventory were defined as 1-km radius circles around centroid points. Forest fragmentation type, road density, Landscape Development Intensity (LDI) index, and percentage of impervious surface were quantified at each site by integrating land cover and road network information. Based on forest cover, 6% of wetland sites scored in the highest ecological category while 45% fit into the lowest one. Results showed high dispersion of data for the impervious surface indicator in the lowest condition category. When comparing LDI and impervious surface under different landscape compositions and configurations, LDI better described disturbance in agricultural areas where road density was low. Impervious surface better reflected the occurrence of fragmented landscapes at forested areas with high percentage of edge forest cover. In addition, a significant proportion of freshwater wetlands (60%) in the lowest condition category was associated with first-order streams, indicating a wide range of disturbance at some headwater watersheds.

AB  - Reef ecosystems all over the world are in decline and managers urgently need information that can assess management interventions and set national conservation targets. We assess the conservation status and risk of ecosystem collapse for the Oyster Reef Ecosystem of Southern and Eastern Australia, which comprises two community sub-types established by Saccostrea glomerate (Sydney rock oyster) and Ostrea angasi (Australian flat oyster), consistent with the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems risk assessment process. We established: (i) key aspects of the ecosystem including: ecological description, biological characteristics, condition and collapse thresholds, natural and threatening processes; (ii) previous and current extent of occurrence and current area of occupancy; and (iii) its likelihood of collapse within the next 50-100 years. The most severe risk rating occurred for Criterion A: Reduction in Extent (since 1750) and Criterion D: Disruption of biotic processes (since 1750), although assessment varied from Least Concern to Critically Endangered amongst the four criteria assessed. Our overall assessment ranks the risk of collapse for the ecosystem (including both community sub-types) as Critically Endangered with a high degree of confidence. Our results suggest the need for rapid intervention to protect remaining reefs and undertake restoration at suitable sites. Several restoration projects have already demonstrated this is feasible, and Australia is well equipped with government policies and regulatory mechanisms to support the future conservation and recovery of temperate oyster ecosystems.

AB  - We studied how environmental conditions affect reproduction in sympatric skua species that differ in their reliance on marine resources: the exclusively marine foraging south polar skua Catharacta maccormicki, the terrestrially foraging brown skua C. antarctica lonnbergi and mixed species pairs with an intermediate diet. Egg size, clutch asymmetry and hatching dates varied between species and years without consistent patterns. In the south polar skuas, 12 to 38% of the variation in these parameters was explained by sea surface temperature, sea ice cover and local weather. In mixed species pairs and brown skuas, the influence of environmental factors on variation in clutch asymmetry and hatching date decreased to 10-29%, and no effect on egg size was found. Annual variation in offspring growth performance also differed between species with variable growth in chicks of south polar skuas and mixed species pairs, and almost uniform growth in brown skuas. Additionally, the dependency on oceanographic and climatic factors, especially local wind conditions, decreased from south polar skuas to brown skua chicks. Consistent in all species, offspring were more sensitive to environmental conditions during early stages; during the late chick stage (>33 d) chick growth was almost independent of environmental conditions. The net breeding success could not be predicted by any environmental factor in any skua species, suggesting it may not be a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions. Hence, the sensitivity of skuas to environmental conditions varied between species, with south polar skuas being more sensitive than brown skuas, and between breeding periods, with the egg parameters being more susceptible to oceanographic conditions. However, during offspring development, local climatic conditions became more important. We conclude that future climate change in the Maritime Antarctic will affect reproduction of skuas more strongly through changes in sea ice cover and sea surface temperature (and the resulting alterations to the marine food web) than through local weather conditions.

AB  - It is frequently hypothesized that animals employ a generalized "stress response," largely mediated by glucocorticoid (GC) hormones, such as corticosterone, to combat challenging environmental conditions. Under this hypothesis, diverse stressors are predicted to have concordant effects across biological levels of an organism. We tested the generalized stress response hypothesis in two complementary experiments with juvenile and adult male Eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus). In both experiments, animals were exposed to diverse, ecologically-relevant, acute stressors (high temperature or red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta) and we examined their responses at three biological levels: behavioral; physiological (endocrine [plasma corticosterone and blood glucose concentrations] and innate immunity [complement and natural antibodies]); and cellular responses (gene expression of a panel of five heat-shock proteins in blood and liver) at 30 or 90 min post stress initiation. In both experiments, we observed large differences in the cellular response to the two stressors, which contrasts the similar behavioral and endocrine responses. In the adult experiment for which we had innate immune data, the stressors affected immune function independently, and they were correlated with CORT in opposing directions. Taken together, these results challenge the concept of a generalized stress response. Rather, the stress response was context specific, especially at the cellular level. Such context-specificity might explain why attempts to link GC hormones with life history and fitness have proved difficult. Our results emphasize the need for indicators at multiple biological levels and whole-organism examinations of stress.

AB  - Given that farmland serves as a strategic resource to ensure national food security, blind emphasis on the improvement of food production capacity can lead to soil overutilization and impair other soil functions. Hence, the evaluation of soil health (SH) should comprehensively take soil productivity and ecological environmental effects into account. In this study, five functions from the perspective of functional soil management were summarized, including primary productivity, provision and cycling of nutrients, the provision of functional and intrinsic biodiversity, water purification and regulation, and carbon sequestration and regulation. For each soil function, in view of the natural and ameliorable conditions affecting SH, basic indicators were selected from the two aspects of inherent and dynamic properties, and restrictive indicators were chosen considering the external properties or environmental elements, with the minimum limiting factor method coupled with weighted linear model. The new evaluation system was tested and verified in Yixing City, China. The healthy and optimally functional soils were concentrated in the northeast and mid-west of Yixing City, whereas unhealthy soils were predominant in the south and around Taihu Lake. The main limitations to SH improvement included cation exchange capacity, nutrient elements, and soluble carbon. The SH evaluation method was verified using the crop performance validation method, and a positive correlation was noted between food production stability index and soil health index, indicating that the evaluation system is reasonable.

AB  - Numerous studies have explored the "shifting baseline syndrome" (SBS), which suggests that individual perceptions of environmental health are formed by comparing the environment to a "baseline" from the past. Understanding social perceptions of environmental conditions, especially where they differ from ecological assessments, can help guide environmental management efforts. In this study we compared ecological assessments of coral reef health with perceptions of reef health from surveyed residents in five villages in Solomon Islands and Fiji. Comparative analysis suggests that respondents from Solomon Islands perceived their reefs as being degraded, yet based on ecological measurements actually had healthier reefs, while in Fiji fewer people perceived their reefs to be declining in health, yet ecological measurement showed them to be more degraded than Solomon Islands reefs. We found no evidence of baselines "shifting" relative to respondent age in this instance and suggest that these differential baselines and the inverse relationship between local perceptions and ecological measurements may be a result of: (1) differences in the rate of environmental change experienced at local scales; and (2) may also be related to differences in respondent perceptions of "quality of life" at each site. If the success of conservation approaches such as marine protected areas (MPAs) are dependent on local social consensus that natural resources are diminished or degraded, then tracking broader social indicators like "quality of life" and "rates of change" (real and perceived) alongside ecological assessments of environmental health may prove beneficial to conservation practitioners.

AB  - Aim We examined whether developmental instability can be used as a bio-monitoring tool in the endangered Taita thrush (Turdus helleri L.) through the measurement of individual levels of fluctuating asymmetry in tarsus length. Because estimates of the association between developmental instability, stress and fitness derived from traditional regression are biased, we compared parameter estimates obtained from likelihood based analysis with those obtained from a Bayesian latent variable model.
   Location Taita thrushes were captured and measured in three isolated cloud forest fragments located in the Taita Hills of south-east Kenya.
   Methods We applied mixed-effects regression with Restricted Maximum Likelihood parameter estimation (performed with SAS version 8.0) and Bayesian latent variable modelling (performed with WINBUGS version 1.3 and CODA version 0.4) to estimate unbiased levels of developmental instability and to model relationships between developmental instability and body condition in 312 Taita thrushes.
   Results Likelihood and Bayesian analyses yielded highly comparable results. Individual levels of developmental instability were strongly inversely related to body condition in the subpopulation with the lowest average condition. In contrast, both variables were unrelated in two other subpopulations with higher average condition. Such heterogeneity in association was in the direction expected by developmental theory, given that higher condition suggests more benign ambient conditions. The estimated levels of body condition in the three subpopulations did not support their presumed ranking in relation to environmental stress. Developmental instability and body condition are therefore believed to reflect different aspects of individual fitness.
   Main conclusions Variation in developmental homeostasis, either modelled as observable variable (fluctuating asymmetry) or latent variable (developmental instability), appears a useful indicator of stress effects in the Taita thrush. Because relationships between environmental stress and developmental instability may depend on the extent to which stress-mediated changes in other components of phenotypic variation are correlated, the study of trait asymmetry should preferably be combined with that of other measures of trait variability, such as trait size or organismal condition.

AB  - A sulfide with a bicyclic squalene hydrocarbon skeleton present in sediments from Various depositional settings and of different geological age has been identified by synthesis of a reference compound. In contrast to previous expectations [cf. Schouten, S., Sinninghe Damste, J.S., de Leeuw, J.W., 1995. A novel triterpenoid carbon skeleton in immature sulphur-rich sediments. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 59, 953-958; Gug, S., Schaeffer, P., Adam, P., Klein, S., Motsch, E., Albrecht, P., 2009. Identification Of a Sulfide derivative with a bicyclic hydrocarbon skeleton related to squalene. Part 1: Synthesis of a dithiane triterpenoid. Organic Geochemistry 40, 876-884.], this sulfide bears two "S-spiro type" thiolane moities, but not the two thiochromane moieties Originally envisaged. The synthesis resulted in the formation of a complex isomeric mixture of compounds, all co-eluting in gas chromatography (GC) in the form of one broad peak, as is the case with the geochemical compound. The spiro-type sulfide was formed by intramolecular sulfurization of a polyunsaturated bicyclic squalene derivative of unknown biological Origin. The presence of this sulfide in a number of Triassic to Miocene marine sediments from various and contrasting depositional settings (upwelling environments, shallow continental platforms, lagoonal subbasins, hypersaline environments), all characterized by Strongly anoxic conditions, but with OF without photic zone anoxia, indicates that the microorganisms biosynthesizing the precursor bicyclic squalene occupy diverse ecological niches.

AB  - The status and potential degradation of an ecosystem is often difficult to identify, quantify, and characterize. Multiple, concurrent drivers of degradation may interact and have cumulative and confounding effects, making mitigation and rehabilitation actions challenging to achieve. Ecosystem status assessments generally emphasize areal change (gains/losses) as a primary indicator; however, this over-simplifies complex ecosystem dynamics and ignores metrics that would better assess ecosystem quality. Consideration of multiple indicators is necessary to characterize and/or anticipate ecosystem degradation and appropriately identify factors causing changes. We utilize mangrove forests as a model system due to their distribution across a wide range of geographic settings, their position in the inherently dynamic coastal zone, and the multiple natural and anthropogenic pressures they face. We present a conceptual framework to: i) examine drivers of ecosystem degradation and characterize system status, and ii) delineate the roles of biogeographic and geomorphic variability, site history and typology, and references. A complementary workflow is proposed for implementing the conceptual framework. We demonstrate the universal applicability of our conceptual framework through a series of case studies that represent locations with differing drivers of degradation and biogeographic and geomorphic conditions. Our conceptual framework facilitates scientists, conservation practitioners, and other stakeholders in considering multiple aspects of ecosystems to better assess system status and holistically evaluate degradation. This is achieved by critically evaluating suitable comparisons and relevant elements in assessing a site to understand potential actions or the outcome of previously implemented management strategies.

AB  - Chinese chive has a long history of planting in China. At present, there are many studies on endophytic bacteria and rhizosphere microorganisms of Chinese chive, but the effects of ecological compartment and growth conditions on bacterial communities in Chinese chives are unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate the differences in bacterial a-diversity, beta-diversity, community structure, core species differences, interaction networks and predicted metabolic functions among bacterial communities in different ecological compartments (the phylloplane, leaf endosphere, stem endosphere, root endosphere, and rhizosphere) in Chinese chives in an open field, a solar greenhouse, an arched shed, and a hydroponic system. Sixty samples were collected from these five ecological compartments under four growth conditions, and we compared the bacterial profiles of these groups using 16S rRNA sequencing. We evaluated the differences in diversity and composition among bacterial communities in these ecological compartments, analyzed the bacterial interaction patterns under the different growth conditions, and predicted the bacterial metabolic pathways in these ecological compartments and growth conditions. The results showed that the effects of ecological compartments on bacterial diversity, community composition, interaction network pattern, and functional expression of Chinese chives were greater than those of growth condition. Ecological compartments (R-2 = 0.5292) could better explain bacterial community division than growth conditions (R-2 = 0.1056). The microbial interaction networks and indicator bacteria in different ecological compartments showed that most of the bacteria that played the role of key nodes (OTUs) in each ecological compartment were bacteria with high relative abundance in the compartment. However, the bacteria that played the role of key nodes (OTUs) in bulbs were not Proteobacteria with the highest relative abundance in the compartment, but Actinobacteria that were significantly enriched in the root endosphere and rhizosphere ecological compartments. In addition, interactions among bacteria were interrupted in the hydroponic system, and specific bacterial communities and interaction patterns in Chinese chives varied among growth conditions. Prediction of metabolic functions indicated that plant metabolic activity related to stress responses and induction of system resistance was greater in belowground ecological compartments.

AB  - Using light (LM, including plastid characterization on fresh material) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as a thorough morphological, physical, chemical, and biological characterization of the habitats, the present study aims at describing three species new to science. They belong to the genera Eunotia Ehrenb., Planothidium Round and L. Bukht., and Delicatophycus M.J. Wynne, and were found in two contrasting spring types in the northern Apennines. The three new species described differ morphologically from the most similar species by: less dense striae and areolae, and the absence of a ridge at the valve face-mantle transition (SEM feature) [Eunotia crassiminor Lange-Bert. et Cantonati sp. nov.; closest established species: Eunotia minor (Kutz.) Grunow]; narrower and shorter cells [Planothidium angustilanceolatum Lange-Bert. et Cantonati sp. nov.; most similar species: Planothidium lanceolatum (Breb. ex Kutz.) Lange-Bert.]; barely-dorsiventral symmetry, set off ends, and lower density of the central dorsal striae [Delicatophycus crassiminutus Lange-Bert. et Cantonati sp. nov.; most similar species: Delicatophycus minutus M.J.Wynne]. Two of the three species we described are separated from the closest species by dimensions. Their description improved knowledge on two taxa (Eunotia minor s.l. and Planothidium lanceolatum s.l.) likely to be only partially resolved species complexes. We could also refine knowledge on the ecological profiles of the three newly-described species. Eunotia crassiminor sp. nov., as compared to Eunotia minor, appears to occur in colder inland waters with a circumneutral pH and a strict oligotrophy as well with respect to nitrogen. The typical habitat of Planothidium angustilanceolatum sp. nov. appears to be oligotrophic mountain flowing springs with low conductivity. Delicatophycus crassiminutus sp. nov. was observed only in limestone-precipitating springs, and is therefore likely to be restricted to hard water springs and comparable habitats where CO2 degassing leads to carbonate precipitation. Springs are a unique but severely threatened wetland type. Therefore, the in-depth knowledge of the taxonomy and ecology of characteristic diatom species is important, because diatoms are excellent indicators of the quality and integrity of these peculiar ecosystems in the face of direct and indirect human impacts.

AB  - Sandy beaches are of interest to various sectors of society, so it is urgent to move to integrated and participatory models that facilitate the management of these socioecological systems. Currently, there is a growing appreciation of the perception of the social and natural environment as a valuable tool for the management of tourist beaches, as the opinions of users are essential to evaluate beach management proposals and policies. Chile has one of the longest coastlines in the world, where sandy beaches are one of the most interesting coastal habitats for the tourism industry. Based on traditional knowledge of a socioeconomic stratification of users along Playa La Herradura (Coquimbo), we studied the perception of the level of quality of different indicators and the degree of satisfaction of beach users in three different sectors through semistructured interviews. The analysis showed a not good enough evaluation by all users, a higher demand at the highest socioeconomic levels and a series of factors that require urgent attention from the municipality, such as litter in the sand, the growing accumulation of stranded algae and the presence of stray dogs. To advance beach management, we propose the development of a "management ecosystem" for sandy tourist beaches, including a central government that promotes decentralization of management, a municipality with high governance power, academic institutions with high public involvement and a civil society that mobilizes bottom-up processes.

AB  - The inventory and remediation of contaminated sites have emerged as top environmental priorities worldwide. A large body of evidence has accumulated to show how soil contamination affects biological communities and ecological processes. This knowledge has yet to be used for the development of indicators of soil quality that are meaningful to end-users and are easy to implement in soil quality assessment schemes. In this study, we used quantifiable measures of litter decomposition, a key biophysical process, as indicators of the ecological impact of soil contamination by trace metals and hydrocarbons. We conducted a litterbag experiment with coarse and fine mesh bags to compare highly vs. minimally contaminated sites within eight locations representative of a wide array of environmental conditions and types of pollution. Contrary to the common assumption that soil contamination hampers soil functions, idiosyncratic responses were detected for litter decomposition rate and decomposer activity metrics. A negative relationship between detritivore and microbial responses to soil contamination indicates that wherever the activity of one group of decomposers is reduced, increase in activity of the other group may ensure litter decomposition to proceed at rate similar or higher than baseline rate. This finding may indicate that compensatory dynamics in soil communities is important in determining ecosystem stability against chemical stressors. As litter decomposition may inform on the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to cope with soil contamination, it may be a useful complement to chemical soil analyses in routine soil quality assessment schemes.Y

AB  - The Bachental bituminous mans (Bachentaler Bitumenmergel) belonging to the Sachrang Member of the Lower Jurassic Middle Allgau Formation were investigated using a multidisciplinary approach to determine environmental controls on the formation of organic-rich deposits in a semi-restricted basin of the NW Tethys during the Early Jurassic. The marls are subdivided into three units on the basis of mineralogical composition, source-rock parameters, redox conditions, salinity variations, and diagenetic processes. Redox proxies (e.g., pristane/phytane ratio; aryl isoprenoids; bioturbation; ternary plot of iron, total organic carbon, and sulphur) indicate varying suboxic to euxinic conditions during deposition of the Bachental section. Redox variations were mainly controlled by sea-level fluctuations with the tectonically complex bathymetry of the Bachental basin determining watermass exchange with the Tethys Ocean. Accordingly, strongest anoxia and highest total organic carbon content (up to 13%) occur in the middle part of the profile (upper tenuicostatum and lower falciferum zones), coincident with an increase in surface-water productivity during a period of relative sea-level lowstand that induced salinity stratification in a stagnant basin setting. This level corresponds to the time interval of the lower Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE). However, the absence of the widely observed lower Toarcian negative carbon isotope excursion in the study section questions its unrestricted use as a global chemostratigraphic marker. Stratigraphic correlation of the thermally immature Bachental bituminous marls with the Posidonia Shale of SW Germany on the basis of C-27/C-29 sterane ratio profiles and ammonite data suggests that deposition of organic matter-rich sediments in isolated basins in the Alpine realm commenced earlier (late Pliensbachian margaritatus Zone) than in regionally proximal epicontinental seas (early Toarcian tenuicostatum Zone). The late Pliensbachian onset of reducing conditions in the Bachental basin coincided with an influx of volcaniclastic detritus that was possibly connected to complex rifting processes of the Alpine Tethys and with a globally observed eruption-induced extinction event. The level of maximum organic matter accumulation in the Bachental basin corresponds to the main eruptive phase of the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous province (LIP), confirming its massive impact on global climate and oceanic conditions during the Early Jurassic. The Bachental marl succession is thus a record of the complex interaction of global (i.e., LIP) and local (e.g., redox and salinity variations, basin morphology) factors that caused reducing conditions and organic matter enrichment in the Bachental basin. These developments resulted in highly inhomogeneous environmental conditions in semi-restricted basins of the NW Tethyan domain during late Pliensbachian and early Toarcian time.

AB  - With growing population and urbanization, there is an increasing exploitation of natural resources, and this often results to environmental pollution. In this review, the levels of heavy metal in lentic compartments (water, sediment, fishes, and aquatic plants) over the past two decades (1997-2017) have been summarized to evaluate the current pollution status of this ecosystem. In all the compartments, the heavy metals dominated are zinc followed by iron. The major reason could be area mineralogy and lithogenic sources. Enormous quantity of metals like iron in estuarine sediment is a very natural incident due to the permanently reducing condition of organic substances. Contamination of cadmium, lead, and chromium was closely associated with anthropogenic origin. In addition, surrounding land use and atmospheric deposition could have been responsible for substantial pollution. The accumulation of heavy metals in fishes and aquatic plants is the result of time-dependent deposition in lentic ecosystems. Moreover, various potential risk assessment methods for heavy metals were discussed. This review concludes that natural phenomena dominate the accumulation of essential heavy metals in lentic ecosystems compared to anthropogenic sources. Amongst other recent reviews on heavy metals from other parts of the world, the present review is executed in such a way that it explains the presence of heavy metals not only in water environment, but also in the whole of the lentic system comprising sediment, fishes, and aquatic plants.

AB  - The brackish water benthic shellfish, Corbicula japonica, was experimentally exposed to Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts at 1.51 x 10(4) oocysts/clam/day for 7 or 14 days. Oocysts were predominantly eliminated through the feces of Corbicula japonica in both cases by microscopic and PCR methods. The fecal excretion rates of oocysts within 4 days after the last exposure to Corbicula japonica were 87.6% for the 7-day exposure group and 86.0% for the 14-day exposure group. The tissue residue level of oocysts in the gastrointestinal tract 3 days after the last exposure was 2.7% of total exposed oocysts and that of 7 days was 1.1% for the 7-day exposure case and 1.6 and 0.5% for the 14-day exposure case, respectively, maintaining infectivity to cultured cells (HCT-8) in vitro. At the same time, field tests of Corbicula japonica for collecting oocysts showed that this clam could certainly collect Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in the natural river and, furthermore, the gene type of C. parvum could be also identified proving its effectiveness as a biological indicator. The present study showed that the brackish water benthic shellfish Corbicula japonica may be capable of gathering and preserving Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts to a considerable extent under the natural ecological conditions, and further suggests the effectiveness of Corbicula japonica as a practical and general bioindicator for estimates of river water contamination by oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to identify the factors that promote the invasiveness of Rhododendron ponticum L. by the means of comparative field observations. Rhododendron ponticum (Ericaceae) is an evergreen shrub with a natural distribution in the Mediterranean and Black Sea area and was introduced to the British Isles in 1763, Thenceforward, the species has been considered as a major threat to natural ecosystems there.
   We compared native and invasive populations of Rhododendron ponticum with respect to trait patterns that are associated with invasiveness. Six populations each in the natural part of its range, in Georgia (Caucasus) and Spain as well as six invasive ones in Ireland were examined with regard to biometrical, morphological and ecological characteristics.
   Invasive Irish populations differed from non-invasive ones mainly in growth patterns and showed much higher rates of annual shoot growth in the field and higher rates of seedling recruitment. In contrast, native Spanish populations were discriminated by their shape and a-e; whereas native Georgian rhododendron, above all, showed distinctive leaf characteristics. In general, the relationship between Irish and Spanish populations was closer than to the Georgian ones. Our results suggest that both genotype and environment account for the trait pattern found in Irish populations. Differences in genetically fixed traits had a greater effect in morphological differences to Georgian provenances. In contrast, the invasive Irish rhododendron were favoured by a more benign environment than the Spanish populations.

AB  - Ombrogenic peat bogs are ecologically extreme ecosystems, where the restrictive conditions such as anoxia, high acidity and low availability of nutrients allow a gradual accumulation of the organic substrate known as peat. This substrate is of great commercial interest because it is exploited for horticultural purposes and energy biomass. The exploitation of peat, however, involves the removal of vegetation, which has an important effect on secondary succession and ecosystem resilience. The flora and vegetation of peat bogs in the Brunswick Peninsula (Magallanes), in an area susceptible to mining exploitation, was studied to characterize ecological indicators. Phytosociological surveys were carried out to determine attributes of composition and structure at the community and landscape scale. This information was collated with satellite images and analyzed by univariate procedures (e.g. KW, Pearson) and multivariate (e.g. NMDS, ISA, ANOSIM). The following types of ombrogenic peat bogs were differentiated: graminoid, chamaephytic, Sphagnum and pulvinated peat bogs, which were associated with a terrestrialization to paludification gradient, and decomposition. The highest average richness was recorded in the pulvinated peat bogs. The chamaephytic and graminoid bogs has the largest areas, while the pulvinated were distributed in a few hectares. Diagnostic species (e.g. Caitha appendiculata, Donatia fascicularis, Drosera uniflora, Myrteola nummularia) were associated with one or another type of vegetation, showing ecological preferences. No exotic species were recorded. This information can help define critical levels of resilience and propose management and restoration strategies in post-disturbance abandoned peatlands.

AB  - High-mountain ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots, providing habitats that shelter a great variety of unique species. Climate change is increasing the severity and recurrence of drought events, potentially endangering many species. We studied the distribution of a monocarpic perennial plant, Saxifraga longifolia and evaluated altitudinal changes in leaf physiological performance, with a particular emphasis on trade-offs and drought vulnerability in nine natural populations. Drought vulnerability of the studied populations covering almost the entire distribution range of the species was considered taking into account both ecological and physiological markers. The distribution of S. longifolia outside the Pyrenees was limited to the high eastern and North-west mountains of the Iberian Peninsula, constituting geographically highly isolated populations. We found that tradeoffs between the activation of defense responses against abiotic and biotic stresses occur in this species, with populations occurring at high elevation showing less sensitivity to drought stress but higher endogenous contents of biotic defensive compounds. Furthermore, drought stress appeared to be a key factor in the distribution of this species, with populations growing at lowest elevations being the most exposed to the potential negative effects of climate change. It is concluded that, despite S. longifolia has developed complex mechanisms to adapt to the harsh environmental conditions of high-mountain ecosystems, global change is threatening its survival, most particularly in the regions most exposed to drought events.

AB  - Failure of systems applied in machines comprising rolling and slewing bearings usually causes downtime of the entire heavy machine. The problem of failures can be aggravated by extremely difficult operating conditions, such as significant loads or a harsh environment. The entire issue inspired us to develop a method of monitoring the condition of such units. A study was carried out for six different large-scale excavators which examined strain distributions in the tested subassemblies. In order to estimate the technical condition of wheeled bogies, we used the phenomenon of strain propagation caused by the concentrated force acting in the ring girder web. Flamant theory was utilized to describe this phenomenon. Measurements were performed using strain gauges and the obtained results were compared with the FEM model. To determine whether bearing joints were in a good or bad condition, a coefficient of variation and an impulse factor were introduced as diagnostic indicators. It turned out that by evaluating these indicators, it was possible to distinguish between these two conditions. The method was successfully validated on machines that are in operation

AB  - Natural pH values in coastal waters vary largely among locations, ecosystems, and time periods; still, there is an ongoing acidification trend. In this scenario, more acidic pH values can alter bioavailability of organic contaminants, to organisms. Despite this, interactive effects between pH and chemical substances are not usually considered in Ecological Risk Assessment protocols. This study investigated the effects of pH on the toxicity of a hydrophobic organic compound on a benthic community using a microcosm experiment setup to assess the response of nematode assemblages exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of Irgarol at two natural pH conditions. Estuarine nematode assemblages were exposed to two concentrations of Irgarol at pH 7.0 and 8.0 for periods of 7 and 35 days. Lower diversity of nematode genera was observed at the highest tested Irgarol concentration (1281 +/- 65 ng.g(-1)). The results showed that the effects of Irgarol contamination were independent of pH variation, indicating no influence of acidification within this range on the toxicity of Irgarol to benthic meiofauna. However, the results showed that estuarine nematode assemblages are impacted by long-term exposure to low (but naturally occurring) pHs. This indicates that estuarine organisms may be under naturally high physiological pressure and that permanent changes in the ecosystem's environmental factors, such as future coastal ocean acidification, may drive organisms closer to the edges of their tolerance windows.

AB  - Desert ecosystems are generally considered lifeless habitats characterised by extreme environmental conditions, yet they are successfully colonised by various biocrust nonvascular communities. A biocrust is not only an important ecosystem engineer and a bioindicator of desert ecological restoration but also plays a vital role in linking surficial abiotic and biotic factors. Thus, extensive research has been conducted on biocrusts in critical dryland zones. However, few studies have been conducted in the vast temperate deserts of China prior to the beginning of this century. We reviewed the research on biocrusts conducted in China since 2000, which firstly focused on the eco-physiological responses of biocrusts to species composition, abiotic stresses, and anthropological disturbances. Further, research on the spatial distributions of biocrusts as well as their succession at different spatial scales, and relationships with vascular plants and soil biomes (especially underlying mechanisms of seed retention, germination, establishment and survival of vascular plants during biocrust succession, and creation of suitable niches and food webs for soil animals and microorganisms) was analysed. Additionally, studies emphasising on the contribution of biocrusts to ecological and hydrological processes in deserts as well as their applications in the cultivation and inoculation of nonvascular plants for land degradation control and ecological restoration were assessed. Finally, recent research on biocrusts was evaluated to propose future emerging research themes and new frontiers.

AB  - DNA barcoding uses a short, standardized DNA fragment to sort individuals into species. This molecular technique has applications in fields including ecology, evolution, conservation, and biogeography. In ecological applications such as species monitoring and habitat restoration, its potential has not been fully realized and implemented. Invertebrates are excellent biological indicators, as changes in species diversity or community assemblage provide important insights into the condition of, or changes in, the environment. This information is particularly useful within the context of restoration ecology. In this study, DNA barcoding is used to assess the potential of Hemiptera as a biological indicator of restoration success for the Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project (Durban, South Africa). A total of 393 Hemiptera specimens were collected from sites reforested at distinct phases (plots reforested in 2010, 2012, and 2015) and two reference sites (natural forest and grassland). The Hemiptera species composition and assemblage were assessed by analyzing diversity indices, ordination, unweighted pair-group average cluster analysis, and phylogenetic analysis. Hemiptera species composition varied significantly across the chronologically different reforested sites, with a higher species richness observed in the older reforested plots. This suggests that Hemiptera diversity can be used to track restoration success, even over the small temporal scale used in this study. This study highlights the utility of DNA barcoding as a taxonomic sorting tool both to monitor ecological restoration and to discover specific taxa within Hemiptera that may be useful biological indicators.

AB  - Despite their unique ecology and implications for ecological assessment, diatoms in lentic ecosystems are still insufficiently studied in both scientific research and operational monitoring. In particular, the ecology of periphytic diatoms relative to the global expansion of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes has not been described at all. This study aims to describe the diversity and dynamics of a periphytic diatom community in the Vrutci Reservoir during Planktothrix rubescens bloom, and to evaluate the adequacy of standard diatom index implementation in lentic ecosystems relative to the diatom index adapted for lakes - the Trophic Diatom Index for Lakes (TDIL). The study was conducted in the Vrutci Reservoir in western Serbia. Periphyton was developed on an artificial glass substrate during the summer of 2015, following a depth gradient of a stratified water column. Diatom diversity and abundance, as well as diatom indices were estimated. Discounting the cyanobacterial bloom, 79 taxa of diatoms were recorded and among them the species Aneumastus stroesei as the first representative of the entire genus Aneumastus ever to be detected in Serbia. Diatom distribution along the depth gradient was clearly associated with shifts in environmental conditions. TDIL showed an advantage over standard diatom indices in terms of stability during experimental period and uniformity along the depth gradient, indicating the necessity for further testing of this index performance in lakes, and consequently local water-quality legislation update.

AB  - The meaning of health for wildlife and perspectives on how to assess and measure health, are not well characterized. For wildlife at risk, such as some polar bear (Ursus maritimus) subpopulations, establishing comprehensive monitoring programs that include health status is an emerging need. Environmental changes, especially loss of sea ice habitat, have raised concern about polar bear health. Effective and consistent monitoring of polar bear health requires an unambiguous definition of health. We used the Delphi method of soliciting and interpreting expert knowledge to propose a working definition of polar bear health and to identify current concerns regarding health, challenges in measuring health, and important metrics for monitoring health. The expert opinion elicited through the exercise agreed that polar bear health is defined by characteristics and knowledge at the individual, population, and ecosystem level. The most important threats identified were in decreasing order: climate change, increased nutritional stress, chronic physiological stress, harvest management, increased exposure to contaminants, increased frequency of human interaction, diseases and parasites, and increased exposure to competitors. Fifteen metrics were identified to monitor polar bear health. Of these, indicators of body condition, disease and parasite exposure, contaminant exposure, and reproductive success were ranked as most important. We suggest that a cumulative effects approach to research and monitoring will improve the ability to assess the biological, ecological, and social determinants of polar bear health and provide measurable objectives for conservation goals and priorities and to evaluate progress.

AB  - Fungal symbionts are increasingly targeted as tools for crop management, but their use in the field requires an understanding of how fungi interact in a community context. Fungal interactions may result in additive effects on the host plant, which could be predicted simply based on individual fungal behavior. Alternatively, interactions among fungi may result in non-additive synergistic or antagonistic effects on plant performance that are more challenging to predict. Here, we hypothesized that the effects of fungal interactions on the plant host could be predicted from their niche overlap. To test this idea, we used foliar fungal endophytes with a range of niche overlap based on trait dissimilarities to examine the effects of six fungal species pairs compared to the corresponding individual fungal species on switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) in water-stressed and well-watered conditions. Mixtures of endophytes had either no effect or predictable, additive effects on plant tiller number, but effects on plant growth rate and wilting were largely nonadditive. Moisture level, fungal stress, and metabolic trait dissimilarity predicted 51 to 92% of the deviation of fungal effects from additive, with less similar fungi likely to have more synergistic effects on the plant host. Furthermore, we identified indicator metabolites for fungal interaction outcomes. However, the effects of endophyte interactions on the plant host were environment dependent making single community applications more challenging. Overall, future development of microbial tools for use in agriculture must consider their interactions to optimize application.

AB  - We evaluated the potential of soil microarthropods and enchytraeid worms to be useful as bioindicators of soil condition in forest, wetland, and agricultural ecosystems over a range of ecoregions. Selected mesofauna and soil characteristics in soil and litter in relatively undisturbed and disturbed examples of each of three ecosystems within each of three land resource regions were monitored over two years. Optimal times of year to sample these organisms as indicators of disturbance were April, May, July and September. No single measure reflected disturbance across all three ecosystems. Among forest sites, Simpson's diversity index, evenness, abundance of ants, and proportion of enchytraeids in the mesofauna differed between soils of different disturbance levels. Among agricultural sites, richness, evenness, abundance of mites, and proportions of collembolans and of enchytraeids in the mesofauna differed between disturbance levels. Among wetland sites, Shannon's and Simpson's diversity indices, richness based on the total mesofauna, and abundances of mites, diplurans, ants, and isotomid and onychiurid collembolans differed between disturbance levels. Covariates most frequently associated with abundance and diversity of the measured mesofauna were soil electrical conductivity, available N, organic matter, and pH. Canonical correspondence analysis provided information somewhat different to bivariate analysis. Using both approaches to examine soil and litter taxa that have distinctive responses to disturbance may help to identify candidate groups applicable for use in large-scale environmental monitoring programs.

AB  - Physical changes in coastal systems, caused by human or natural processes, lead to changes in flow patterns and salinity, temperature and sediment distributions. These changes can affect the health of an ecosystem. This paper demonstrates the use of the model ECHO (coastal ECosystem Health assessment model using Oysters as the indicator species) for the assessment of the impacts on spatial distribution of the oyster zones. ECHO uses outputs of a 3-D hydrodynamic model to delineate zones hospitable to oysters; its outputs are much more concise than the extensive spatial and temporal outputs of the hydrodynamic models typically employed to simulate physical changes in a coastal environment. This study used ECHO to investigate the impacts of two hypothetical physical changes which altered hydrodynamics in a bay; the impacts were determined by examining the changes in the spatial extents of the delineated oyster zones. For the test cases, a region of a decreased water depth results in improved conditions for oysters, whereas adding an increased amount of freshwater inflow to the bay decreases the prevalence of oyster zones throughout the bay. ECHO reveals that the predominant reason for changes in the spatial extents of oyster zones in the latter case is prolonged stratification. By examining the spatial and temporal behavior of shear and density effects, we conclude that the Richardson number is a better means of quantifying stratification in a complicated tidal system than density gradients alone.

AB  - Anthropogenic impacts on carp pond environments have increased over the last 100-150years in Central Europe. Present semi-intensive carp pond management combines natural food resources, supplementary feeding and additional intensification measures such as manuring, liming, and winter and summer drainage. Despite increased eutrophication and fish stock pressure, many carp ponds still serve as habitats for threatened biota, including macrophytes. Both the ecologically essential role of aquatic macrophytes and the impacts that reared fish may have on them have been repeatedly reported in the literature; however, information is scattered and there exists no multidisciplinary synthesis of knowledge of fish farming and plant interactions for European carp ponds. In this review, we show that macrophytes from different ecological groups have specific demands regarding optimal ecological conditions (e.g. pH and trophy level); hence, they can act as indicators of a water body's ecological status. Nevertheless, the overall ecological ranges of many species (i.e. the limits enabling their survival) remain rather broad. Moreover, interactions between the different elements within carp pond ecosystems are complex and change rapidly, facilitating the co-existence of macrophytes with contradictory ecological demands. As the literature suggests, carp ponds may play a role in biodiversity protection that is just as important (or even more so) than that of natural wetlands. Sustainable, environmentally friendly carp pond management is undoubtedly the best means of preserving the unique natural and cultural value of these aquatic ecosystems for the future.

AB  - Measurement of complex natural flows, especially those occurring in rivers due to man-made structures, is often hampered by the limitations of existing flow measurement methods. Furthermore, there is a growing need for new measurement devices that are capable of measuring the hydrodynamic characteristics of complex natural flows required in environmental studies that often use fish as an indicator of ecological health. In this paper, we take the first step toward in situ natural flow measurements with a new biologically inspired probe design in conjunction with signal processing methods. The device presented in this paper is a dedicated hydrodynamically sensitive sensor array following the fish lateral line sensor modality. Low-level multidimensional sensor signals are transformed to the two key hydrodynamic primitives, bulk flow velocity and bulk flow angle. We show that this can be achieved via canonical signal transformation and kernel ridge regression, allowing velocity estimates with a less than 10 cm/s error. The approach provides robust velocity estimates not only when the sensor is ideally oriented parallel to the bulk flow, but also across the full range of angular deviations up to a completely orthogonal orientation by correcting the pressure field asymmetry for large angular deviations. Furthermore, we show that their joint estimation becomes feasible above a threshold current velocity of 0.45 m/s. The method demonstrated an error of 14 cm/s in velocity estimation in a river environment after training in laboratory conditions.

AB  - The demand for pragmatic tools for mapping ecosystem services (ES) has led to the widespread application of land-use based proxy methods, mostly using coarse thematic resolution classification systems. Although various studies have demonstrated the limited reliability of land use as an indicator of service delivery, this does not prevent the method from being frequently applied on different institutional levels. It has recently been argued that a more detailed land use classification system may increase the accuracy of this approach. This research statistically compares maps of predicted ES delivery based on land use scoring for three different thematic resolutions (number of classes) with maps of ES delivery produced by biophysical models. Our results demonstrate that using a more detailed land use classification system does not significantly increase the accuracy of land-use based ES assessments for the majority of the considered ES. Correlations between land-use based assessments and biophysical model outcomes are relatively strong for provisioning services, independent of the classification system. However, large discrepancies occur frequently between the score and the model-based estimate. We conclude that land use, as a simple indicator, is not effective enough to be used in environmental management as it cannot capture differences in abiotic conditions and ecological processes that explain differences in service delivery. Using land use as a simple indicator will therefore result in inappropriate management decisions, even if a highly detailed land use classification system is used. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Caatinga is a semiarid ecosystem that undergoes continual environmental disturbances through outdated production technologies and deregulated use of its natural landscapes. Bioindicators, such as dung beetles, are successfully used to understand processes of forest disturbance and subsequent regeneration. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the dung beetle assemblage of a region of the Caatinga with fragments at initial, intermediate, and late stages of regeneration. Sampling was conducted in forest remnants of northeastern Brazil between 2011 and 2013 during the dry and rainy seasons, using traps baited with dung and carrion. There were no differences in beetle richness and abundance according to stage of regeneration. However, there was higher abundance in carrion traps and during the rainy season, which also presented higher richness compared to the dry season. There was a difference in species composition among the fragments in late regeneration. Deltochilum irroratum (Laporte) and Canthon aff. simulans Martinez occurred predominantly in fragments with late regeneration. The harsh conditions and scarcity of resources in Caatinga during the dry season seem to be important factors that limit the activity of these beetles. As this ecosystem has high evapotranspiration rates, carrion, which is less ephemeral than dung, could be an important resource for the beetles, justifying the higher abundance attracted to this resource. Our results suggest that D. irroratum and C. aff. simulans have a strict distribution in conserved habitats and could be evaluated as indicator species of this ecosystem in future studies.

AB  - The world has become an urban world, more than 50 % of the human population live in cities. The effects of urbanization are diverse, complex and wide; ranging from unbalanced biogeochemical cycles in urban areas, to the local extinction of several species in different cities around the globe. However, diverse biological groups live and thrive in cities adapting to the new and sometimes harsh conditions of urban areas. In an effort to compile and assess the current status of knowledge of copro-necrophagous beetles in urban areas, we performed an extensive search for publications regarding Scarabaeinae beetles in urban areas. We found 27 publication that address four general topics: (1) ecological patterns; (2) disease transmission; (3) conservation biology; and (4) species lists. Although in the last fifteen years it has been published extensively about Scarabaeinae as an indicator group in biodiversity studies and in the analysis of ecosystem functions, references to Scarabaeinae in cities are scarce. In a broad sense, the study of copro-necrophagous beetles in urban areas is in an early stage of advance, providing an opportunity for entomologists to explore their response to urbanization, altogether with the role of these insects as host and intermediates of parasitic diseases, but also, with the environmental services provided by them, like the burial and destruction of a great amount of excrements found in urban soil.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment (ERA) of inorganic metals and metalloids (metals) must be specific to these substances and cannot be generic because most metals arc naturally occurring, some are essential, speciation affects bioavailability, and bioavailability is determined by both external environmental conditions and organism physiological/biological characteristics. Key information required for ERA of metals includes: emissions, pathways, and movements in the environment (Do metals accumulate in biota above background concentrations?); the relationship between internal dose and/or external concentration (Are these metals bioreactive?); and the incidence and severity of any effects (Are bioreactive metals likely to result in adverse or, in the case of essential metals, beneficial effects?)-ground-truthed in contaminated areas by field observations. Specific requirements for metals ERA are delineated for each ERA component (Hazard Identification, Exposure Analysis, Effects Analysis, Risk Characterization), updating Chapman and Wang (2000). In addition, key specific information required for ERA is delineated by major information category (conceptual diagrams, bioavailability, predicted environmental concentration [PEC], predicted no effect concentration [PNEC], tolerance, application [uncertainty] factors, risk characterization) relative to three different tiered, iterative levels of ERA: Problem Formulation, Screening Level ERA (SLERA), and Detailed Level ERA (DLERA). Although data gaps remain, a great deal of progress has been made in the last three years, forming the basis for substantial improvements to ERA for metals.

AB  - Humus forms are good indicators of environmental conditions and thus important in forest ecological processes. Attitudinal gradients are considered as natural laboratory for evaluating soil ecological processes and humus form distribution. The objective of this study was to evaluate the macromorphology of humus forms along an attitudinal gradient (0-2000 m a.s.l.) covered with plain forest, mixed and pure forests and forest-grassland ecotone, in Alborz Mountains in northern Iran. In total, 225 humus profiles were evaluated. Forest stand variables including tree density, basal area, crown density, and height, forest floor and soil physico-chemical properties along with biological features were measured. We found that attitudinal gradients influence both humus forms distribution and soil properties but with different mechanisms. While soil properties (i.e., temperature, pH, CaCO3, soil N content, soil C/N and microbial biomass N) were significantly correlated with altitude, the forest floor properties were more influenced by tree species composition. Particularly, the abundance of Mull was decreased in plain mixed forests compared to mountain pure forests, whereas the frequency of Amphi was increased. Moreover, Oligomull and Leptoamphi were abundant in mixed beech forests, while Eumacroamphi, Eumesoamphi and Pachyamphi were only observed in pure beech forests. Such a distribution influenced soil fertility where higher values of nitrogen (N), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) and pH were observed at lower altitudes under mixed forests compared to pure forests at higher altitudes.

AB  - Human disturbance in highly anthropized areas is known to have many negative effects on biodiversity. Due to their close relation to the environment (e.g., thermoregulation) and their limited movement capacities, reptiles (and snakes in particular) are excellent bioindicators of environmental quality. In addition, they carry out essential ecological functions, acting as prey and predator simultaneously. However, studies focusing on the effects that conservation efforts have on their populations after implementation are scarce. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of small protected areas on one of the most common snake species in the Iberian Peninsula, Natrix maura. During 2015 and 2018, samplings were conducted at eight different points in the Albufera de Valencia Natural Park in Spain, three of them being biological reserves. The results show that such protected areas have positive effects on the N. maura populations at different levels. In protected areas, population structures are more complex and the body condition of large individuals is better. The study also examined predatory pressure, but did not find a significant correlation between the abundance of predatory birds (herons) and injured or "scared" individuals of N. maura. In conclusion, such areas can be essential for allowing snakes to maintain their biological cycles, and in some cases even to prevent their disappearance from highly anthropized environments. Therefore, we strongly recommend the creation of more protected areas in order to promote the conservation of biodiversity in these areas.

AB  - Rotifers are known as cosmopolitan organisms, found in high density in most waters, often representing the dominant group in terms of species diversity and abundance in the zooplankton community. Since the functionality of an ecosystem is closely related to the diversity of communities, analysis of rotifers assemblage may be a useful tool in understanding the mechanisms of the spatial and temporal changes on this level. Data were collected from 2008 until 2010, in distinct areas of Danube, Sfantu Gheorghe branch with different degrees of human impact. Sfantu Gheorghe river branch has distinct features conferred by the construction of new canals and cutting off the meanders. Due to these regularization changes, a complex of ecosystems with different features resulted. The impact of engineering may determine a reduction in species diversity and abundance in the new ecosystems. The canals of Sfantu Gheorghe branch presented the lowest value of the species richness and diversity indices in comparison with the other two areas. The constant species belong to Brachionus, Keratella, Asplanchna, Synchaeta genus. The branch environmental conditions allow the development loricate species and soft-bodied type, the dominant species belonging to Brachionidae family. This study reveals a close resemblance between natural sectors and meanders in terms of diversity and abundance of the rotifer assemblage. Opposites, in the newly created canals, the species richness and abundance registered a decreasing reflecting the impact of human interventions on the ecological system.

AB  - Ecological perturbations caused by biotic invasion have been identified as a growing threat to global sustainability. Invasive alien plants species (IAPS) are considered to be one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss and thereby altering the ecosystem services and socio-economic conditions through different mechanisms. Although the ecological impacts of IAPS are well documented, there is a dearth of studies regarding their economic quantification, livelihood considerations, biotechnological prospects (phytoremediation, bioenergy, phytosynthesis of nanoparticles, biomedical, industrial applications etc.) and human health risk assessments of IAPS. In this context, the current panoramic review aimed to investigate the environmental, socio-ecological and health risks posed by IAPS as well as the compounded impact of IAPS with habitat fragmentation, climate and land use changes. To this end, the need of an integrated trans-disciplinary research is emphasized for the sustainable management of IAPS. The management prospects can be further strengthened through their linkage with geo-spatial technologies (remote sensing and GIS) by mapping and monitoring the IAPS spread. Further, the horizon of IAPS management is expanded to ecological indicator perspectives of IAPS, biosecurity, and risk assessment protocols with critical discussion. Moreover, positive as well as negative implications of the IAPS on environment, health, ecosystem services and socio-economy (livelihood) are listed so that a judicious policy framework could be developed for the IAPS management in order to mitigate the human health implications.

AB  - The worldwide occurrence of complex climate-induced ecological shifts in marine systems is one of the major challenges in sustainable bio-resources management. The occurrence of ecological environment-driven shifts was studied in the Southern Caspian Sea using the "shiftogram" method on available fisheries-related (i.e. commercially important bentho-pelagic fish stocks) ecological and climatic variables. As indicators of potential environmentally driven shift patterns we used indices for the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Southern Oscillation, the Siberian High, the East Atlantic-West Russia pattern, as well as Sea Surface Temperature and surface chlorophyll-a concentration. Given the explorative findings from the serial shift analyses, the cascading and serial order of multiple shift events in climatic-ecologic conditions of the southern Caspian Sea suggested a linkage between external forces and dynamics of ecosystem components and structures in the following order: global-scale climate forces lead to local environmental processes, which in turn lead to biological components dynamics. For the first time, this study indicates that ecological shifts are an integral component of bentho-pelagic subsystem regulatory processes and dynamics. Qualitative correspondence of biological responses of bentho-pelagic stocks to climatic events is one of the supporting evidences that overall Caspian ecosystem structures and functioning might have-at least partially-been impacted by global-scale climatic or local environmental shifts. These findings may help to foster a regional Ecosystem-based Approach to Management (EAM) as an integral part of bentho-pelagic fisheries management plans.

AB  - In complex systems, a critical transition is a shift in a system's dynamical regime from its current state to a strongly contrasting state as external conditions move beyond a tipping point. These transitions are often preceded by characteristic early warning signals such as increased system variability. However, early warning signals in complex, coupled human-environment systems (HESs) remain little studied. Here, we compare critical transitions and their early warning signals in a coupled HES model to an equivalent environment model uncoupled from the human system. We parameterize the HES model, using social and ecological data from old-growth forests in Oregon. We find that the coupled HES exhibits a richer variety of dynamics and regime shifts than the uncoupled environment system. Moreover, the early warning signals in the coupled HES can be ambiguous, heralding either an era of ecosystem conservationism or collapse of both forest ecosystems and conservationism. The presence of human feedback in the coupled HES can also mitigate the early warning signal, making it more difficult to detect the oncoming regime shift. We furthermore show how the coupled HES can be "doomed to criticality": Strategic human interactions cause the system to remain perpetually in the vicinity of a collapse threshold, as humans become complacent when the resource seems protected but respond rapidly when it is under immediate threat. We conclude that the opportunities, benefits, and challenges of modeling regime shifts and early warning signals in coupled HESs merit further research.

AB  - Most modeling and statistical approaches encourage simplicity, yet ecological processes are often complex, as they are influenced by numerous dynamic environmental and biological factors. Pacific salmon abundance has been highly variable over the last few decades and most forecasting models have proven inadequate, primarily because of a lack of understanding of the processes affecting variability in survival. Better methods and data for predicting the abundance of returning adults are therefore required to effectively manage the species. We combined 31 distinct indicators of the marine environment collected over an 11-year period into a multivariate analysis to summarize and predict adult spring Chinook salmon returns to the Columbia River in 2012. In addition to forecasts, this tool quantifies the strength of the relationship between various ecological indicators and salmon returns, allowing interpretation of ecosystem processes. The relative importance of indicators varied, but a few trends emerged. Adult returns of spring Chinook salmon were best described using indicators of bottom-up ecological processes such as composition and abundance of zooplankton and fish prey as well as measures of individual fish, such as growth and condition. Local indicators of temperature or coastal upwelling did not contribute as much as large-scale indicators of temperature variability, matching the spatial scale over which salmon spend the majority of their ocean residence. Results suggest that effective management of Pacific salmon requires multiple types of data and that no single indicator can represent the complex early-ocean ecology of salmon.

AB  - Reconstruction of environmental conditions from biological indicators, such as chironomids, can provide valuable insight into the variance of natural systems and the extent of current environmental problems. Various numerical techniques have been developed for this challenging task, based on different models and assumptions, but ignoring some of the uncertainties inherent in the reconstruction.
   We study the use of Bayesian modeling and inference in organism-based palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. We propose a Bayesian model, BUM, and compare it empirically with eight other methods, including the widely used weighted averaging (WA) technique. The methods are evaluated on a surface-sediment chironomid training data set from 53 subarctic lakes in northern Fennoscandia by comparing the prediction statistics of these data. The resulting calibration models are also applied to fossil chironomid assemblages in order to evaluate the differences in Holocene temperature reconstructions. The empirical results indicate that BUM is competitive compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
   We also describe a generic Bayesian framework for reconstruction, to demonstrate Bayesian tools for reasoning with a variety of ecological response models. Bayesian statistics support the "classical" approach to regression and calibration whereas the state-of-the-art methods, including WA, are based on the conceptually more controversial "inverse" approach. Further, the use of probability distributions rather than point estimates for species responses gives a principled method for handling uncertainty in response modeling.

AB  - Conditioning film grown on glass panels was analyzed for organic carbon and nitrogen, total carbohydrates, aldoses, uronic acids, and proteins. These compounds showed non-linear increase over the period of immersion. Total carbohydrate-C, aldose-C, uronic acid-C, and protein-C accounted for 5.59-23.50%, 0.6-5%, 1-5%, and 4-14% of organic carbon, respectively, while aldose-C accounted for 10-72% of the total carbohydrate-C. Aldoses such as rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, and glucose were generally present in the conditioning film. A principal component analysis based on weight percentages of aldoses established three factors that contributed similar to 77% of the total variance. The first factor was influenced by the abundance of rhamnose and accounted for 41% of the total variance. The second factor was influenced by the concentrations of arabinose and xylose, whereas the third factor was controlled by ribose and galactose, thereby implicating the role of terrestrial and microbial input to the conditioning film. These changes in the chemistry of the conditioning film may play some role in influencing microbial adhesion to surfaces. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study focuses on the characterization of the Bertioga channel (Sao Paulo, Brazil) through the foraminiferal and micro algal distribution as correlated to environmental gradients (salinity, dissolved oxygen, biomass, primary production). Despite of its proximity to the cities of Sao Paulo and Santos, the Bertioga channel is still partially preserved in its natural conditions though presenting just a few anthropic alterations. In terms of the relation of assemblage formation to the influence of freshwater the environmental field may be divided into 3 regions. The euhaline environment in the channel's north entrance harbors includes Pararotalia cananeiaensis, Pseudonium atlanticum, Hanzawaia boueana and Quinqueloculina lamarckiana. The mixohaline environments in the channel's south entrance, south middle region and Largo do Candinho are dominated by species of Ammonia tepida, Elphidium poeyanum and E. excavation, whereas mixohaline to brackish water from adjacent rivers and mangroves swamps is populated by Arenoparella mexicana, Haplophragmoides wilberti, Ammotium salsum and Gaudryina exillis. Foraminifera species patterns presented modifications in accordance with tidal oscillations, land drainage and channel geomorphology. The microphytobenthic biomass presented higher values for chlorophyll and phaeopigments in the summer. Spatially the biomass and the primary production presented higher values in the entrances of the channel and lower values towards the middle of the same. The pennate diatoms were the dominant taxa. Through ecological and environmental indicators it was possible to evaluate the water quality of the Bertioga Channel and also provide data on the natural history of the species to make a comparison of unpolluted and polluted sites possible.

AB  - Bio-indicators are extremely useful for quickly assessing the true condition of a rapidly deteriorating freshwater environment at a low cost. Global research has shown that the spider (Arachnida: Araneae) is a well-known taxon with bio-indicator potential. Present study was performed to find out if any spider species could be used as a bio-indicator of undisturbed habitat for Gangetic riparian zone. For the study, total 27 sites were selected along the Ganga River's banks, with an average distance of 75 kms between each site. Based on disturbance ratings, the sampling sites were divided into five groups: very low disturbed sites, low disturbed sites, moderately disturbed sites, highly disturbed sites and very highly disturbed sites. The non-parametric analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) test and non-parametric permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) were used to understand similarities of species composition between these groups. The redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to investigate the relationship between spider distribution and habitat disturbance. The indicator value (IndVal) method was used to find out significant bio-indicator spider species for habitat disturbance. The study found that the agriculture, human occupation, manmade embankment, and sand mining were the most effective combination of disturbance that affects spider assemblage and eight species can be used as indicator of very low disturbed sites and one species can be used as indicator of low disturbed sites.

AB  - One of the challenges for large-scale, long-term ecological assessments lies in the integration of faunal datasets. A comparison was made between various ways of analysing benthic macrofaunal datasets using both taxon names as well as functional traits. The sampling stations were located on both sides of the average location of the Polar Front in the Barents Sea, and included the Spitsbergen Bank, slope areas and the deeper basins Storfjord Trough and Hopen Trough. Taxon richness and overall faunal biomass were highest at the shallowest stations, and lowest in the depressions and ice-influenced areas. The overall functioning of the faunal communities reflected the habitat type. In the trough areas, the sediment mixing depth was greatest, reflecting the bioturbatory activities of the fauna. The shallow, gravelly, erosion areas on the Spitsbergen Bank supported mostly surface-active taxa, consistent with the relatively low biological mixing depths. The mixed sediments of the slope environments supported a mixture of surface-active and bioturbating taxa. Functional trait coding offers an additional tool for mesoscale characterisation of communities, particularly for large-scale or long-term datasets, where taxonomic identifications may not be compatible. The results are discussed in terms of future research needs, in light of changing ecological conditions in the Barents Sea, as well as the need for refining environmental assessment tools.

AB  - Coastal marine ecosystems are increasingly subjected to environmental stress and degradation due to pollution. Several research programmes have addressed this problem and produced relevant data sets for specific areas, often including consistent sets of environmental and biological variables. The value of existing information gathered from these types of data can be largely increased by combining them into a common data set to determine globally applicable relationships. To perform this exercise, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO has recently formed the Ad hoc Study Group on Benthic Indicators (http://www.ioc.unesco.org/benthicindicators) with the aim of developing robust indicators of benthic health. In this paper, initial products and ongoing activities of this international initiative are described and discussed. An expansion of initial IOC/UNESCO research on benthic fauna-organic carbon relationships is also presented. As part of this follow-up research, the relationship between total organic carbon concentrations of sediment and abundance, biomass and species diversity of benthic macrofauna was evaluated using data sets from 2 different regions of the world comprising 3 different coastal marine environments. The ability of identifying threshold levels in selected variables that could serve as indicators of related adverse environmental conditions leading to stress in the benthos is envisaged within the frame of a larger joint analysis, carried out by the IOC/UNESCO Study Group on Benthic Indicators, of merged data sets from several coastal regions worldwide.

AB  - Conditions of formation of the Lower Pliocene sediments of the South Caspian Basin (SCB)-the Productive (PS) and Red-Colored (RS) sequences-were reconstructed by the example of the Absheron-Balkhan uplift zone using a complex of widely known geochemical criteria: major oxide and trace element ratios. The common and distinctive features of the conditions of formation of PS and RS are identified. It is established that PS sediments were formed under more oxidizing conditions than RS sediments and that the brownish-red coloration of RS is of diagenetic nature. The low hydrocarbon (HC) potential of PS-RS was confirmed by the pyrolysis method. It is shown that these sediments, being formed in deltaic and coastal-marine conditions, are characterized by the low quality of organic matter (OM), which is ascribed to the type 3 and consists of redeposited remains of wood plants with insignificant admixture of amorphous and algal organics. Results obtained for the Absheron-Balkhan zone are well consistent with the existing concepts on the conditions of formation of the Lower Pliocene sediments, which are the major reservoir of the SCB HC resources.

AB  - Although many aspects of environmental accounting methodologies in food production have already been investigated, the application of environmental indicators in the fruit sector is still rare and no consensus can be found on the preferred method. On the contrary, widely diverging approaches have been taken to several aspects of the analyses, such as data collection, handling of scaling issues, and goal and scope definition. This paper reviews studies assessing the sustainability or environmental impacts of fruit production under different conditions and identifies aspects of fruit production that are of environmental importance. Four environmental assessment methods which may be applied to assess fruit production systems are evaluated, namely Life Cycle Assessment, Ecological Footprint Analysis, Emergy Analysis and Energy Balance. In the 22 peer-reviewed journal articles and two conference articles applying one of these methods in the fruit sector that were included in this review, a total of 26 applications of environmental impact assessment methods are described. These applications differ concerning e.g. overall objective, set of environmental issues considered, definition of system boundaries and calculation algorithms. Due to the relatively high variability in study cases and approaches, it was not possible to identify any one method as being better than the others. However, remarks on methodologies and suggestions for standardisation are given and the environmental burdens of fruit systems are highlighted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The need for scientifically defensible water quality standards for nonpoint source pollution control continues to be a pressing environmental issue. The probability of impact at differing levels of nonpoint source pollution was determined using the biological response of instream organisms empirically obtained from a statistical survey. A conditional probability analysis was used to calculate a biological threshold of impact as a function of the likelihood of exceeding a given value of pollution metric for a specified geographic area. Uncertainty and natural variability were inherently incorporated into the analysis through the use of data from a probabilistic survey. Data from wadable streams in the mid-Atlantic area of the U.S. were used to demonstrate the approach. Benthic macroinvertebrate community index values (EPT taxa richness) were used to identify impacted stream communities. Percent fines in substrate (silt/clay fraction, < 0.06 mm) were used as a surrogate indicator for sedimentation. Thresholds of impact due to sedimentation were identified by three different techniques, and were in the range of 12 to 15 percent fines. These values were consistent with existing literature from laboratory and field studies on the impact of sediments on aquatic life in freshwater streams. All results were different from values determined from current regulatory guidance. Finally, it was illustrated how these thresholds could be used to develop criterion for protection of aquatic life in streams.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems and their associated organisms are among the most endangered in the world. Here we focus on bryophyte communities in streams characterized by a strong altitudinal gradient. The main purpose of this study was to determine the most important environmental variables affecting bryophyte species richness and composition and to quantify the relative importance of different sets of environmental variables. We studied bryophyte communities at upstream, intermediate and downstream sections of 16 streams distributed on the northern and southern side of Madeira Island in the Atlantic Ocean. We found that bryophyte species richness and composition was strongly affected by the measured environmental variables. Of particular importance were the geomorphological and hydrological variables as well as the chemical and physical properties of the streams. Temperature (or altitude) was highly correlated with other variables reflecting clear altitudinal gradients. While upstream communities were generally in a rather natural condition and rich in bryophyte species, downstream communities had less species and often anthropogenically modified stream banks. Due to the confounding of downstream areas with human influences and other variables such as temperature, the separate effects of these variables are not known. The relationship and the distributions of some bryophyte species/communities across the altitudinal range suggest that these riparian bryophyte communities may be sensitive to global warming.

AB  - Colbricon Superiore and Inferiore are two small adjacent high-mountain lakes located in the Paneveggio Natural Park (Italy) that offer the rare opportunity to study two iso-ecologic water environments differing only by area and volume in a ratio of 2:1 and 3:1, respectively. We took advantage of this setting to investigate phytoplankton dynamics, compare variability and productivity differences between the two basins, and assess size-dependent issues. The phytoplankton group of the Dinophyceae was chosen as the indicator organisms of ecological perturbation owing to their high sensitivity to environmental variations, as well as their acknowledged nature of versatile proxy to report global climatic changes. The study was conducted for over 10 years with fortnightly samplings. Results indicated that (a) the Dinophyceae communities in the smaller lake were significantly more resistant to changes exerted by the fluctuation of lakewater transparency and p}I; and (b) the smaller lake sustained a consistently higher production with an average Dinophyceae density 1.73 fold higher than that of the larger lake. The coefficients of variation show that the chemical parameters in the smaller lake display higher time-related fluctuation while being spatially homogeneous and that such conditions correlate with a higher stability of the Dinophyceae assemblage. The use of this setting is also proposed as a model to test relationships between ecosystem production and physical stability.

AB  - Assessing the spatial and temporal changes in ecosystems is essential to account for natural capital contribution to human well-being. However, various methods to quantify these changes challenge the development of reliable values which can be integrated into national statistical accounts. Following the international system of environmentaleconomic accounting framework, which recently adopts an ecosystem accounting standard. We present a novel approach to develop an ecosystem extent account from existing ecosystem classifications. This study shows the spatial and statistical extent account of 26 ecosystems (i.e. forests, grasslands, croplands, and urban, among others) between 1970 and 2015 at the national scale. Extent accounts were developed at a resolution of 25 m and provided reliable information on how ecosystem types have changed over time in Spain. Our results reflect three main patterns in the extension account: (i) an increase in forest ecosystems, (ii) a considerable decrease in agroecosystems (especially annual croplands), and (iii) substantial development of urban areas. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first attempt to develop a robust methodology to measure the extent of ecosystems at the national level. The proposed approach is crucial for a strong knowledge of ecosystem dynamics and their implications for ecosystem conditions and services at a national level. This has potential applications in urban planning, green infrastructure development, and multiple uses for territory management and policies, integrating natural capital into official statistics and mainstreaming ecosystems into national-level planning and monitoring processes.

AB  - Increased demands for water affect its quality availability and threaten biodiversity. In freshwaters, the Chironomidae (Diptera) represents * 50% of macroinvertebrate individuals and have great potential to improve ecological assessment tools. Incorporating trait-based approaches in those tools can further improve how we assess the effects of human disturbances on aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Given that chironomid genera have different degrees of sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbances, we expected that composition, structure and functional characteristics of chironomid genera would be negatively affected by anthropogenic disturbances in a neotropical savanna river basin. We used nine traits in 32 categories related to Chironomidae functional roles. Out of 6147 individuals distributed in three subfamilies, we identified 52 chironomid genera collected from 30 randomly selected stream sites. The index of functional divergence was lower in places with greater anthropogenic disturbance of riparian vegetation. A RLQ matrix analysis revealed a significant relationship between genera abundance and environmental variables as well as with biological traits. We observed a positive relationship between Tanypodinae, which are mainly engulfer predators, with average embeddedness, % sand and catchment pasture. Three Chironomidae genera (Stenochironomus, Endotribelos and Beardius) were positively related to miner habit, herbivore feeding strategy and larger body size. We found that physical habitat structure and food resources were the most important factors structuring Chironomidae assemblages in the study sites and that chironomid genera were effective for assessing basin ecological status.

AB  - The last 85,000 years were characterized by high climate and environmental variability on the Yucatan Peninsula. Heinrich stadials are examples of abrupt climate transitions that involved shifts in regional temperatures and moisture availability. Thus, they serve as natural experiments to evaluate the contrasting responses of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We used ostracodes and pollen preserved in a 75.9-m-long sediment core (PI-6, similar to 85 ka) recovered from Lake Peten Itza, Guatemala, to assess the magnitude and velocity of community responses. Ostracodes are sensitive to changes in water temperature and conductivity. Vegetation responds to shifts in temperature and the ratio of evaporation to precipitation. Ostracodes display larger and more rapid community changes than does vegetation. Heinrich Stadial 5-1 (HS5-1) was cold and dry and is associated with lower ostracode and vegetation species richness and diversity. In contrast, the slightly warmer and dry conditions during HS6 and HS5a are reflected in higher ostracode species richness and diversity. Our paleoecological study revealed the greatest ecological turnover for ostracodes occurred from 62.5 to 51.0 ka; for pollen, it was at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. Future studies should use various climate and environmental indicators from lake and marine sediment records to further explore late glacial paleoclimate causes and effects in the northern neotropics.

AB  - Ecosystem health is a newly proposed concept that sets new goals for environmental management. Its definition, indexing and assessment methods are still being perfected. An Ecological Modeling Method (EMM) for lake ecosystem health assessment is proposed in this paper. The EMM's procedures are: (1) to analyze the ecosystem structure of a lake in order to determine the structure and complexity of the lake's ecological model; (2) to develop a model having ecological health indicators, by designing a conceptual diagram, establishing model equations, estimating model parameters and being integrated with ecological indicators; (3) to compare the simulated and observed values of important state variables and process rates (i.e. model calibration) in order to evaluate the applicability of the model to lake ecosystem health assessment; (4) to calculate ecosystem health indicators based on the developed model; and (5) to assess lake ecosystem health according to the values of the ecosystem health indicators. The EMM was applied, as a case study, to the ecosystem health assessment of a eutrophic Chinese lake (Lake Chao) between April 1987 and March 1988. A relative order of health states from poor to good was determined as follows: August-October 1987 > April-May 1987 > June-July 1987 > November-December 1987 > January-March 1988. These results compared quite favourably with the actual current conditions at Lake Chao. The EMM method, therefore, was suitable in assessing lake ecosystem health at Lake Chao.

AB  - Parental conditions, such as temperature, soil moisture, nutrient availability, light and competition during plant growth and seed maturation, influence seed quality and germinability. Elevated CO2 concentration can be also treated as a parental condition and should be considered when evaluating crop productivity under future climate conditions. Available information on the effect of parental CO2 conditions on seed quality and germinability is limited, particularly for intra-population variations. Therefore, seeds of several entries of a rust resistant common wheat germplasm (Triticum aestivum L., AZ-MSFERS-82RR PI# 552988) grown under three CO2 concentrations (350, 700 and 1000 ppm) were studied to determine the intra-population variation in seed germinability and grain quality, and the relationship between grain quality and germinability. Germination percentage was near 100% for all treatments, but different patterns in germination rate were found among entries: (1) both 700 and 1000 ppm CO2 increased germination rate comparing with 350 ppm CO2, (2) both 700 and 1000 ppm CO2 reduced seed germination rate, and (3) 700 but not 1000 ppm CO2 reduced germination rate. These variations were apparently entry-related, indicating the existence of intra-population variation in the response of germination rate to parental CO2 conditions. Chemical constituents responded to increasing CO2 concentration differently among entries, but the C/N ratio was similar among CO2 treatments. A negative correlation between C content and germination rate was found. The importance of this correlation in seeds of other species should be evaluated because it may serve as an indicator for the effect Of CO2 enrichment on seed germinability. Because elevated CO2 parental conditions may affect both seedling establishment and grain quality of crops, intra-population variations in the response of seed germinability and grain quality to CO2 conditions should be considered in future breeding efforts.

AB  - Agroecology has been suggested as a promising concept for reconciling agricultural production and environmental sustainability by optimizing ecological processes that deliver ecosystem services (ES) to replace external inputs. While this statement is widely agreed upon, few assessments of real-life conditions exist that assess multiple ES simultaneously. This paper provides an assessment of seven ES based on 14 indicators in three agroecological farming systems (AFS) and thirteen of their adjacent conventional fanning systems (CFS). Based on field-scale measurements spread over three years, our findings suggest that the studied AFS succeed in providing a wider array of regulating services than their neighboring CFS. Soil aggregate stability and soil respiration rates are in general more supported in AFS, which also show lower pest abundance. On the other hand, CFS show higher grain production and higher performance for two out of three fodder quality indices. While this 'productivity gap' may be due to the still-evolving state of the studied AFS, we nuance this through the lens of an emerging paradigm to assess farming system multi-performance. It is now argued that we need to shift from a volume-focused production system to a system that also values the ecological processes underpinning crop production and other benefits to society. Based on our findings, we recommend future work to iterate our initiative, including several indicators per service and embed these into a wider context of co-adaptive science-practice to further develop context-specific and user-useful research.

AB  - Periphytic algae is a useful indicator of aquatic ecological conditions. We investigated the periphytic algae on natural substrate and the environmental variables at 44 sites on three river systems in the Weihe River Basin (WRB). A total of 84 species are identified, representing 37 genera. The most common genera were Navicula, Oscillatoria, Nitzschia, Scenedesmus, Cymbell, and Fragilaria. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated significant differences among the three river systems in environmental variables (p < 0.05). Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses also showed differences in periphytic algae communities in the three river systems (p < 0.05) and identified different dominant species in each river system. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Monte Carlo permutation tests revealed that nutrient concentration, WT, and altitude were the most important variables affecting the structure and distribution of periphytic algae communities. Chemical variables were the most accounted for environmental variables (12.5%), while physical variable and geographical factors (5.8% in total) play a relevant minor role. Our results demonstrate that Navicula pupula, Navicula radiosq, Nitzschia palea, and Nitzschia denticula, exhibiting wide ecological amplitude, are tolerant of high concentrations of nutrient pollution. Variation of periphytic algae communities in WRB is due to the combination of anthropogenic and natural factors including agricultural and domestic wastes water inputting, land use patterns, geology, climatic changes, and river hydrology.

The Tarium Niryutait Marine Protected Area (TN MPA), the first MPA in the Canadian Arctic is located in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, NT and is selecting indicators for monitoring. Proposed health indicators for the TN MPA species of interest, the Eastern Beaufort Sea (EBS) beluga, include the body condition metrics blubber thickness and girth. Sex-specific body condition models for both metrics were developed to account for age, size, location, and timing of harvest from belugas harvested from 2000 to 2015. Models were tested to determine if the spatial variation is detected in the condition of belugas between the three areas of the TN MPA and between belugas harvested inside to outside of the TN MPA. Lastly, we assessed belugas from entrapment events to determine if indicator thresholds could be developed. Three of the indicators (girth male, girth female, blubber thickness male) contain both temporal and spatial factors, signalling the significant influence of year and harvest location on condition. Male belugas harvested from the western area of the TN MPA had smaller mean blubber thickness and girth compared to the other TN MPA areas, whereas there was no significant difference in female condition across the TN MPA. There was a significant difference inside and outside the TN MPA for all four indicators, with larger mean blubber thickness inside the TN MPA, females exhibiting larger mean girth and males exhibiting smaller mean girth inside the TN MPA. Indicators confirm that belugas from entrapment events had significantly lower body condition than belugas harvested during the summer and can serve as thresholds for condition indicators. This study provides guidance on the selection and use of condition indicators for their application in monitoring the TN MPA and demonstrates that careful consideration is required for indicator development and selection.

AB  - Monoculture plantation woodlands are particularly vulnerable to disturbance events as species uniformity makes such stands highly susceptible to pests and diseases. Red band needle blight (caused by the fungus Dothistroma septosporum) is a disease which has a particularly significant economic impact on pine plantation forests worldwide, affecting diameter and height growth. However, monitoring its spread and intensity is complicated by the fact that the diseased trees are often only visible from aircraft in the advanced stages of the epidemic. Remote sensing could potentially aid in the detection of infected stands and in monitoring disease development and spread. Thermography is one of the techniques that can be used for monitoring changes in the physiological state of plants following infection. However, the use of thermography in forestry has so far been restricted by poor spatial resolution (satellite-based sensors) or high data acquirement costs (airborne sensors). This paper investigates the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-borne thermal systems for detecting disease-induced canopy temperature increase and explores the influence of the imaging time and weather conditions on the detected relationship. Furthermore, the potential of a number of airborne LiDAR-derived structural metrics for detection of changes in the canopy structure following the infection are investigated. The study was located in a diseased Scots pine (Arius sylvestris) stand in Queen Elizabeth II Forest Park (central Scotland, UK), where 60 sample trees were surveyed. The thermal imagery was acquired at six different times of a day from an altitude of 60 m. Statistically significant correlation between canopy temperature depression (CTD) and disease levels was found for most of the flights (R-2 between 0.27 and 0.41), which may be related to the needle damage symptoms caused by the disease, i.e. loss of cellular integrity, necrosis and eventual desiccation. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the crown temperature exhibited weak but statistically significant correlation (R-2 between 0.11 and 0.13). The combination of CTD and standard deviation of crown temperature in a partial least squares regression (PLSR) further improved the observed relationship with the estimated disease level. Inclusion of LiDAR structural metrics was also investigated but only provided a slight improvement. A change in environmental conditions altered the magnitude of differences between canopy temperatures; no significant correlation with disease level was found in the morning flight, whilst the strongest relationship was obtained at the time of highest solar radiation, which coincides with the time of maximum photosynthetic activity.

AB  - Comprehensive consideration of multiple meteorological elements for the objective identification and division of seasonal changes is important in the field of climate monitoring and diagnostic analysis. The development of relevant identification and classification methods will help us better understand the new characteristics of seasonal transitions against the background of climate change. Based on reanalysis data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction from 1950 to 2015, we used the multi-element atmospheric condition similarity method to seasonally divide the average climatological conditions at 850 hPa over the South China Sea, and analyzed the annual mean results of the onset of seasons and annual mean seasonal variations of meteorological elements in this region. The results show the following. First, the seasonal division results based on multi-element atmospheric condition similarity coincide with the seasonal variation times of each meteorological element with atmospheric conditions comprising five meteorological elements. When the four seasons change, the meteorological elements at 850 hPa in the South China Sea have obvious seasonal variation, and atmospheric circulation and surface upward long-wave radiation change conspicuously with seasonal transformation. This confirms the validity of the method as applied to seasonal divisions in the South China Sea. Second, when the climate system translates from winter to summer in the South China Sea, thermal elements change greatly and rapidly. Changes to thermal elements in spring provide climate conditions for the onset of summer and the onset of the summer monsoon in the South China Sea. Third, when the climate system shifts from summer to winter in the South China Sea, changes to wind elements are obvious and rapid. In autumn, changes in thermal conditions between the Eurasian continent and the Pacific Ocean lead to major changes in atmospheric circulation and wind. In addition, seasonal divisions are no longer just nodes of time. Rather, they can be used as important indicators for further studies of atmospheric circulation changes, short-term climate predictions, and seasonal changes of other climate systems.

AB  - The Dingqu River Basin, a major tributary of the upper Yangtze River, is located at southeast edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. The fishes of this plateau constitute a major faunal component of this basin, particularly Schizothoracinae (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae) and Triplophysa (Cypriniformes: Nemacheilidae). Hydropower development is an impact that affects natural habitats and biological resources of the upper Yangtze River and this has led to a decrease in biodiversity. This study investigated the species diversity of fishes of the Dingqu River Basin and accumulated basic data for conservation of biodiversity and assessment of ecological health of the upper Yangtze River.

AB  - UVC light, a strong surface disinfection technology, is used worldwide to ensure not only environmental safety but also food safety. Several drawbacks associated with the use of mercury-containing UV lamps, especially human and environmental health risks, led to the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which prohibits the manufacture and import/export of products containing mercury. Therefore, lightemitting diode (LED)-based UVC irradiation, a new technology that is ecofriendly and represents an effective UV light source, has been researched recently. To date, however, there has been no report describing pulsed UVC-LED irradiation for improvement of inactivation of foodborne pathogens, although much research regarding conventional pulsed xenon lamps has been published. In this investigation, we evaluated the enhanced bactericidal effect of a pulsed UVC-LED system, compared to continuous irradiation, and optimum conditions for maximizing the effect were determined. Also, the differences in inactivation between pulsed and continuous UVC-LED irradiation were determined by inactivation mechanism analyses. The combination of 20-Hz frequency and 50% duty ratio for pulsed UVC-LED irradiation achieved 4- to 5-log-unit reductions of Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes; this combination showed the greatest bactericidal effect among various treatment conditions using 2 or 5 mi/cm(2). In mechanism assessments, membrane integrity (propidium iodide uptake) was not affected by UVC-LED treatment but membrane potential [bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol [DiBAC(4)(3)] accumulation] showed significantly different values when pulsed and continuous treatments were compared. Changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and respiratory enzyme activity were attributed to generation of more reactive oxygen species by pulsed UVC-LED irradiation.
   IMPORTANCE In 2013, the United Nations Environment Programme convened the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which prohibits trade in mercury-containing products in order to ensure human health. It will be effectuated in 2020; use of low-pressure mercury lamps will be discontinued and a new UV light source selected to replace the conventional technology. In this regard, UVC-LEDs have been developed and the fundamental inactivating effect has been researched. However, a pulsed UVC-LED system has not been studied, because of the difficulty of generating a UVC-LED pulse wave. An optical chopper system that physically divides the light with an adjustable blade, with personalized frequency and duty ratio settings, was introduced for generation of pulsed UVC-LED irradiation. This study elucidated the efficacy of a pulsed UVC-LED system and investigated its enhanced bactericidal effect in mechanism analyses.

AB  - The concept of an Earth's Third Pole national park cluster has been proposed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and preliminary research for this completed in the initial stage of the second scientific investigation on the plateau. Based on the theory of territorial function, it is realized that with the diversification of land use demand, limited land exerts stronger and stronger binding forces on the allocation of territorial functions. There will be more and more space with complex territorial functions, among which national parks will become a new territorial function for large-scale optimization of the development and protection pattern of land on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Currently, land development accounts for about 0.08%, of the total area in Tibet, whereas various nature reserves account for 33.9%. There are many problems in protected natural areas, such as overlapping, a large number of settlements there, and the poverty of local farmers and herdsmen. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has become the only area of deep poverty in China. Because of these problems, four territorial functions of the proposed Third Pole national park cluster on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are: Maintaining protection of the global ecological system and the diversity of human civilization and culture; reshaping the main body of the natural protection system; coordinating the human-land coupling system; and supporting sustainable livelihood and high-quality regional development. To fulfill the requirements of forming a national park cluster, this paper explores the selection conditions of potential sites and proposes some innovative evaluation ideas, such as the contribution of alternative sites to the formation of the national park cluster and the integrity of their uniqueness and interaction. Through preliminary evaluation of the representative regional space of different ecosystems provided by ecological and geographical zoning, a draft of the global Third Pole national park cluster is proposed. It includes 6 flagship national parks, composed of 2 transnational national parks, and 9 national parks. With a land coverage of more than 300000 square kilometers, it will be a focused, large national park cluster, with distinctive ecological characteristics, and outstanding scientific research value for recreation and tourism. Studying the reasonable capacity of national parks (cluster) is the key link in the construction feasibility study. Furthermore, the reasonable capacity calculation is expanded from the natural carrying capacity to that of the facility and the society. Carrying-capacity considerations include the dual requirements of national, and non-national park functions, and from this, a comprehensive carrying capacity calculation model is then established. The concept and algorithm of a comprehensive carrying capacity were initially applied to test the Selincuo-Puruogangri national park alternative. Preliminary results indicated that the daily capacity for tourism should not exceed 7000 people, and the annual capacity should not exceed 800000 people. Results obtained in the extremely fragile natural ecosystems of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in northern Tibet indicate that the establishment of national park cluster there has a high feasibility. The construction of a national park cluster will be a new model of sustainable development for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region, which will help change the current "transfusion" development model relying on state financial subsidies to farmers and herdsmen.
   Through subsidizing projects in the construction of national parks, the degree of public participation, the level of services, and also subsidizing the contribution of ecological protection, a "hematopoietic" development model is proposed in which the more you do, the more benefit you get. Finally, a virtual circle of "ecological advantages + assets. ecological products + benefits. sustainable livelihood + development. ecological restoration + value-added" will be realized. With the intensifying of this proposition in the second scientific investigation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a scientific basis for the special sustainable development model of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau will be achieved by the completion of a construction plan of the Earth's Third Pole national park cluster.

AB  - Diatom metrics are important tools for evaluating the environmental conditions of streams for the achievement of environmental sustainability. Aim of the present study was to assess the ecological status of Degirmendere and Bulakli streams using diatom indices developed in different ecoregions and to elucidate responses of diatom assemblages to stressors using multivariate approaches. Analysis of similarity percentage indicated a 74% dissimilarity between Degirmendere and Bulakli streams with the most contribution of Encyonopsis minuta, Achnanthidium minutissimum, Achnanthidium druartii, Amphora indistincta, and Gomphonema cuneolus species to this dissimilarity. The first two axes of canonical correspondence analysis exhibited a strong correlation (93.1%) between diatom assemblages and environment variables. Pollution-tolerant species were associated with Bulakli stream, whereas pollution-sensitive species displayed relatedness to Degirmendere stream. Conductivity, salinity, oxidation-reduction potential, total phosphorus (TP), and orthophosphate were the significant effective environmental factors on the spatiotemporal distribution of diatom assemblages. Used diatom indices showed significantly positive and negative correlations with TP gradient. The results of bioassessment exhibited that diatom indices have different scores for the ecological status of the sampling stations. European diatom indices except Trophic Diatom Index and Duero Diatom Index mainly showed similar behavior in the bioassessment of ecological conditions of Degirmendere and Bulakli streams. Among European diatom indices, Trophic Index Turkey was more competitive and could give better results in the bioassessment of streams. Results indicated that ecoregional specific diatom index could be used as a suitable tool to accurately evaluate the surface water quality.

AB  - Grassland tourism is a very popular leisure activity in many parts of the world. However, the presence of people in these areas causes disturbance to the local environment and grassland resources. This study analyzes the composition, diversity, and productivity under different levels of disturbance of the plant communities in the Kangxi Grassland Tourist Area and the Yeyahu Wetland Nature Reserve of Beijing, China. It aims to identify indicators of plant communities and their responses to different levels of disturbance. Our analysis shows that the plant community density and coverage have a certain compensatory increase under disturbed conditions. With the increase in disturbances, more drought-tolerant species have appeared (increased by 5.7%), some of which have become the grazing-tolerance indicator species in the trampled grazed area (TGA). For plant community productivity, biomass and height are good indicators for distinguishing different disturbances (p < 0.05). In addition, several diversity indices reveal the change of plant communities from different perspectives (three of the four indices were significant at the p < 0.05 level). For soil parameters, soil water content and organic matter concentration help to indicate different disturbance levels (the former has a 64% change). Moreover, the standard deviation of the plant community and soil parameters is also a good indicator of their spatial variability and disturbance levels, especially for the TGA. Our analysis confirms that the indicators of productivity, diversity, and soil parameters can indicate the disturbance level in each subarea from different perspectives. However, under disturbed conditions, a comprehensive analysis of these indicators is needed before we can accurately understand the state of health of the plant community.

AB  - Many threatened fish species that utilize riverine habitats are faced with habitat degradation and subsequent deterioration in their ecological surroundings. Habitat degradation is a consequence of water quality parameters associated with anthropogenic activities including mining, industrial, agricultural and urban activities. We examined how the movement behaviour of radio-tracked Orange-Vaal largemouth yellowfish (Labeobarbus kimberleyensis) responded to a suite of water quality chemical parameters and habitat features in the Vaal River, South Africa. We found that the probability of their movement increased with a decrease in water clarity, presence of emergent and overhanging marginal vegetation and fast flowing rapids. High mobility in conditions of low water clarity was probably related to low prey capture success of this piscivorous fish. High movement of largemouth yellowfish in emergent and overhanging marginal vegetation areas and rapid habitat biotopes were attributed to accessibility of prey within these important cover features. When water quality parameters were considered, the probability of largemouth yellowfish movement increased with increasing levels of dissolved chloride (Cl) and silicon (Si), whereas movement decreased with high phosphate (PO4) concentrations and increased with alkalinity levels in the river. High nutrient levels associated with eutrophication caused reductions in the movement of largemouth yellowfish. The association of increased movement of largemouth yellowfish with increasing Cl and Si is indicative of degraded habitat condition in the Vaal River system. Our study showed the importance of monitoring fish behavioural movement patterns to multiple environmental parameters, as these fish are important ecological indicators when appropriate conservation and management plans of freshwater ecosystems are required.

AB  - Coastal environments may be impacted by several anthropogenic activities such as sewage discharges, fish-farming and hydrocarbons along with seaside tourism activities, all proved to have an effect on benthic and, particularly, meiobenthic assemblages. An ecological survey was conducted along the Apulian coast (South Italy) to explore potential relationships between the degree of human disturbance and meiobenthic communities which are still unexplored. Sediment samples were collected in triplicate from 3 stations along each of 16 transects and at a different depth gradient (from similar to 10 to 50 m). The levels of taxa richness and biodiversity of the meiobenthic and nematode assemblages were overall high. The Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive suggest the creation of specific thresholds to define the EcoQ (Ecological Quality) status of marine coastal systems. The thresholds applied on the meiobenthos showed the worst conditions at Brindisi harbour and at the mussel farm infrastructure of Castro. An overall moderate impact was also detected at the multiple-use Marine Protect Area of Porto Cesareo, likely due to the overwhelming number of tourists leading to an increase of organic enrichment (sewage discharge) negatively affecting the benthic communities assemblages. The main representatives of the nematode assemblages were taxa known as typical of muddy sediments. When EcoQ was assessed with the nematode thresholds, the worst EcoQ was found at Brindisi Harbour, Torre Specchia, and Alimini Lakes. The ecological conditions revealed by meiobenthic and nematode assemblages were generally consistent and seem to highlight a greater alteration of the meiobenthic communities assemblages along the Adriatic than the Ionian coasts.

AB  - Invertebrates represent an essential component of coral reef ecosystems; they are ecologically important and a major resource, but their assemblages remain largely unknown, particularly on Pacific islands. Understanding their distribution and building predictive models of community composition as a function of environmental variables therefore constitutes a key issue for resource management. The goal of this study was to define and classify the main environmental factors influencing tropical invertebrate distributions in New Caledonian reef flats and to test the resulting predictive model. Invertebrate assemblages were sampled by visual counting during 2 years and 2 seasons, then coupled to different environmental conditions (habitat composition, hydrodynamics and sediment characteristics) and harvesting status (MPA vs. non-MPA and islets vs. coastal flats). Environmental conditions were described by a principal component analysis (PCA), and contributing variables were selected. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to test the effects of different factors (status, flat, year and season) on the invertebrate assemblage composition. Multivariate regression trees (MRT) were then used to hierarchically classify the effects of environmental and harvesting variables. MRT model explained at least 60% of the variation in structure of invertebrate communities. Results highlighted the influence of status (MPA vs. non-MPA) and location (islet vs. coastal flat), followed by habitat composition, organic matter content, hydrodynamics and sampling year. Predicted assemblages defined by indicator families were very different for each environment-exploitation scenario and correctly matched a calibration data matrix. Predictions from MRT including both environmental variables and harvesting pressure can be useful for management of invertebrates in coral reef environments.

AB  - Questions: 1. How do physiography, flooding regime, landscape pattern, land-cover history, and local soil conditions influence the presence, community structure and abundance of overstorey trees? 2. Can broad-scale factors explain variation in the floodplain forest community, or are locally measured soil conditions necessary?
   Location: Floodplain of the lower 370 km of the Wisconsin River, Wisconsin, USA.
   Methods: Floodplain forest was sampled in 10 m x 20 m plots (n = 405) during summers of 1999 and 2000 in six 12- to 15-km reaches.
   Results: Species observed most frequently were Fraxinus pennsylvanica,Acer saccharinum and Ulmus americana. Physiography (e.g. geographic province) and indicators of flooding regime (e.g. relative elevation and distance from main channel) were consistently important in predicting occurrence, community composition, and abundance of trees. Correspondence analysis revealed that flood-tolerant and intolerant species segregated along the primary axis, and late-successional species segregated from flood-tolerant species along the secondary axis. Current landscape configuration only influenced species presence or abundance in forests that developed during recent decades. Land-cover history was important for tree species presence and for the abundance of late-successional species. Comparison of statistical models developed with and without soils data suggested that broad-scale factors such as geographic province generally performed well.
   Conclusions: Physiography and indicators of flood regime are particularly useful for explaining floodplain forest structure and composition in floodplains with a relatively high proportion of natural cover types.

AB  - The aim of this study was to quantify uncertainty when assigning field investigation sites according to their species community composition to either undisturbed or disturbed reference sites by use of ecological indicators. In ecological risk assessment this problem arises when selecting control investigation sites or defining reference species communities. Uncertainty is quantified using a Type II error or misclassification rate. A probabilistic Bayesian model is used to integrate a priori domain knowledge, assess the error rate and come to recommendations about an adequate sample size. Application is demonstrated using data from a case study investigating off-crop arthropod communities in German grassy field margins and consequences for impact assessment of pesticides on terrestrial ecosystems. The model allows calculating statistical power when using such a classification system. By means of stochastic simulations, recommendations about experimental design and indicator size are derived. The study shows that to develop a classification system to typify newly observed sites a well-balanced ratio of undisturbed and disturbed sites as well as a high relevance of reference sites are needed. For the given data set, a much larger number of reference sites as well as increased relevance of selected reference sites would be needed to achieve a good classification result. An optimal number of indicators is calculated allowing for a compromise between sampling error and indicator quality. Uncertainty for correct assignment of an investigation site is compared using indicators for disturbance and reference conditions. Finally, misclassification rate is proposed as a new measure for indicator quality.

AB  - In the present study, Gammarus fossarum was used to investigate the bioaccumulation and toxic effects of aquatic pollutants in the real environmental conditions. The novelty of the study is the evaluation of soluble tissue metal concentrations in gammarids as indicators in early assessment of metal exposure. In the Sutla River, industrially/rurally/agriculturally influenced catchment in North-Western Croatia, physico-chemical water properties pointed to disturbed ecological status, which was reflected on population scale as more than 50 times lower gammarid density compared to the reference location, Crnomerec Stream. Significantly higher levels of soluble toxic metals (Al, As, Cd, Pb, Sb, Sn, Sr) were observed in gammarids from the Sutla River compared to the reference site and reflected the data on higher total dissolved metal levels in the river water at that site. The soluble metal estimates were supplemented with the common multibiomarker approach, which showed significant biological responses for decreased acetylcholinesterase activity and increased total soluble protein concentrations, confirming stressed environmental conditions for biota in the Sutla River. Biomarker of metal exposure, metallothionein, was not induced and therefore, toxic effect of metals was not confirmed on molecular level. Comparable between-site pattern of soluble toxic metals in gammarids and total dissolved metal levels in water suggests that prior to biomarker response and observed toxic impact, soluble metals in tissue might be used as early warning signs of metal impact in the aquatic environment and improve the assessment of water quality.

AB  - Assessment of environmental change over long periods of time is often impossible due to the absence of long-term quantitative data. Because it is not possible to collect such data retrospectively, qualitative data may provide some understanding of variation in environmental parameters over large temporal scales. The potential of qualitative data to yield valid and informative conclusions hinges on the extent of consistency in those data. The present study explored the potential for semi-structured interviews to serve as a data source for the retrospective assessment of environmental change. Two groups of people (anglers and divers) interacting with the environment of Port Phillip Bay, Australia, were questioned about their perceptions of change in that environment Accounts covered more than six decades and several patterns emerged. Commercial dredging for scallop (Pecten fumatus) was assumed to have had a major negative impact on many taxa. Abundance of Snapper (Pagrus auratus) increased after dredging ceased in the mid-1990s though size and abundance were reduced relative to the early 1960s. The abundance of Flathead spp. (Neoplathycephalus richardsoni, Plathycephalus laevigatus & Plathycephalus arenarius) declined, and the spread of an introduced seastar (Asterias amurensis) was implicated in this decline. Importantly, the overall condition of Port Phillip Bay appears to have deteriorated on a large scale. Many species of fish and invertebrates purportedly disappeared or declined over the course of six decades. Similarly, a substantial reduction of macroalgae was noted. This preliminary study underscores the potential of qualitative data to assess environmental conditions in the past and illustrates the capacity for interdisciplinary research to aid in management and conservation.

AB  - We investigated long-term (18 years) effects of three organic (cow manure (CM), poultry manure (PM), compost from agro-industry orange wastes (OW)) and one inorganic fertilization (IF) on various soil biological indicators (microbial biomass C, soil respiration, total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), total bacteria, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi) and nutrient contents (total and extractable organic C, total and mineral N, available P and K) along the profile of a Typic Haplustept under orange Mediterranean orchards. All fertilizers were added on the same N content basis (190 kg N ha(-1) per year). Variables related to carbon cycling gradually worsened with depth, regardless of treatment, but at any soil depth they improved according to IF < PM < OW < CM. Similarly, mineral nutrient availability decreased with increasing soil depth, according to CM > OW > PM > IF. Organic manures favoured Gram-negative bacteria, especially between 35 and 55 cm depth, whereas Gram-positive bacteria flourished better under inorganic fertilization up to 55 cm. Organic fertilizers increased microbial biomass C, compared with IF, with CM being the most efficient, i.e. inducing the greatest C use efficiency, in turn coupled with a greater amount of fungi compared to bacteria. This is crucial from the environmental viewpoint, since fungi better contribute to soil C storage. PLFAs signatures of microbial communities reflected the differences in resources availability determined by soil depth and fertilizer type; indeed, fungi and Gram-negative bacteria responded more promptly to nutrient contents than other microbial groups. Oligotrophic conditions in deeper soil horizons increased the metabolic quotient, an indicator of stress conditions.

AB  - 1. The atolls and islands comprising Chagos are a biodiversity hotspot of global conservation significance in a remote part of the central Indian Ocean.
   2. This study examines the condition of the archipelago's coastal ecosystems by rapid environmental assessment at 21 sites/islands, which were also investigated a decade earlier using the same methodology. Major changes in ecosystem structure and environmental disturbance were determined.
   3. Coral fish abundance was significantly lower in 2006 than 1996. Decrease in the physical structural complexity of the reefs, as a result of coral bleaching and mortality induced by the 1998 warming event, may have been a contributing factor.
   4. Evidence of collecting/fishing was significantly greater in 2006 than 1996. This is attributed mainly to an illegal fishery for holothurians (sea cucumbers), which has expanded over recent years and now exerts substantial pressure on the resource. The significant decline observed in beach wood, a readily accessible fuel for fishing camps, is consistent with this.
   5. Solid waste on islands was high (median 2 to 20 items m(-1) beach) in both 1996 and 2006. Potentially harmful biological impacts, determined from other studies, include entanglement, toxic effects and provision of transport for invasives or other 'hitchhiker' species.
   6. Significantly higher bird abundances were recorded in protected areas than 'unprotected' areas, attributed mainly to absence of predation by rats.
   7. Rapid assessment augments more comprehensive ecosystem investigations. It provides a valuable snapshot of environmental conditions based upon a broad suite of features (ecosystems and disturbances) determined, concurrently, within the same site inspection quadrats and using the same scale of assessment.

AB  - The Niger Delta at the southernmost part of Nigeria, is a large and ecologically sensitive region. Natural and anthropopenic activities, such as subsidence, sea-level rise, upstream dams and reservoirs, dredging and over-abstraction of groundwater, disturb this equilibrium, leading to adjustments in ecological conditions and boundaries. Ecological changes affecting large areas cannot be explained by local observation. Relating observed effects to causes of environmental behaviour that requires a regionalized data collection, that provides a broader perspective of the Issues involved with resultant ease in the identification of common problems and formulation of effective solutions.

AB  - The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has highlighted as a key concern the decline in high ecological quality river sites. Such waters are indicators of largely undisturbed conditions and reflect natural background status or only minor distortion by anthropogenic influences. These sites tend to be located in the upper portions of larger river catchments, and constitute lower order streams in the main. Small water bodies therefore form the greatest proportion of high status waters. High status water bodies are protected under several tiers of European and National legislation. The key piece of legislation for the protection of all waters is the Water Framework Directive or WFD (2000/60/EC).

AB  - Organic-rich shale samples from the Late Cretaceous Galhak Formation were collected from one well location in the northern Melut Basin, Sudan, and analyzed by integrated organic geochemical and microscopic techniques. The study investigates the nature and preservation conditions of the organic facies and their relevance to petroleum resource potential. Judging from the high total organic contents (total organic carbon (TOC) > 2%), the analyzed Galhak shales are organically rich and include favorable source rocks. The organic richness in these shale sediments may be attributed to enhance the preservation of organic matter under suboxic conditions as implied from the n-alkanes and isoprenoid biomarkers. Biological markers, including of n-alkanes, isoprenoids, terpanes, and steranes, further suggest that the Galhak shale sediments were deposited in a relatively fresh lacustrine environment and received largely aquatic organic matter of plankton and bacteria with little terrestrial plant input. An abundance of aquatic-derived organic matter is consistent with types I and II kerogen as indicated by high Rock-Eval HI values of more than 400 mg HC/g TOC. The hydrogen-rich kerogen types I and II in the analyzed samples suggests an oil-prone source. According to the optical and geochemical maturity indicators, the organic matter in the Galhak oil shale is thermally immature; thus, they have not reached sufficient oil-window maturity for commercial oil generation. Therefore, the deeper parts of the Melut Basin, where the Galhak Formation reached high mature of peak-oil generation window, are recommended for further petroleum exploration and production.

AB  - We use remotely sensed data to estimate species diversity in Blouberg Nature Reserve (BNR) in the Limpopo province, South Africa to understand the state of biodiversity since communities' involvement in conservation initiatives. To achieve this objective, Landsat series data collected before and after community involvement in biodiversity conservation were used in conjunction with selected diversity indices i.e., Shannon-Wiener Index (H') and Simpson Index (D). Thirty 15 m x 15 m field plots were selected and all trees within each plot were identified, with the help of Botanists. Further, we applied regression analysis to determine the relationship between satellite derived tree species diversity and field observations. The results of the study demonstrated a significant (p < 0.5) variation in tree species diversity between 1990 and 2019. The highest relationship was obtained between H' and the combined remotely sensed spectral data and as well as Indices (VIs) when compared to other derived satellite data. Further, the results showed positive significant relationship (p < 0.05) between the combined remotely sensed data and observed H' index with r(2) = 0.36 and r(2) = 0.34 for the period before and after involving local communities in biodiversity conservation, respectively. Thus, the findings of the study indicate that the ecological condition of the reserve was slightly affected by the involvement of local communities in biodiversity conservation, for instance, volunteering in bush-encroachment eradication and decision-making. Overall, findings of the study underscore the relevance of remotely sensed data in assessing the ecological condition of protected areas and this information can help in decision-making.

AB  - The effect of land use changes on the composition of nematode communities has been well documented, however, the applicability of such studies limited to areas with relatively uniform soil and environmental conditions. To determine whether the historical difference in vegetation types affects soil nematode communities during the land use change processes, we carried out a study along two transects where contrasting natural vegetation types (grass versus shrub) were replaced by tea monocultures. Soil nematode communities were compared between two transects at three chronosequence stages: natural vegetations, 3-7 years old tea plantations. Nematode abundance, generic richness, diversity, and proportions of bacterivores and fungivores were higher at each stage of GT transect (from grassland to tea plantation) than at the equivalent stage of ST transect (from shrubland to tea plantation), whereas lower values of maturity index and nematode channel ratio occurred at each stage of GT transect relative to ST transect. MDS ordination analyses, SIMPER analyses and beta(w) indices indicated that the difference in nematode community structure was greatest between the two 3-year-old tea plantations, although the greatest difference in environmental conditions was observed between two original vegetation habitats. This suggested that the original vegetation types may affect the following nematode community development; however, the effects can decrease over time. Different trophic groups responded to land use in different ways along the vegetational development. This supports the viewpoint that the addition of a common resource can evoke disparate responses from individual food-web components. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Canopy cover and canopy closure are two closely related measures of vegetation structure. They are used for estimating understory light conditions and their influence on a broad range of biological components in forest ecosystems, from the demography and population dynamics of individual species to community structure. Angular canopy closure is more closely related to the direct and indirect light experienced by a plant or an animal than vertical canopy cover, but more challenging to estimate. We used airborne laser scanner (ALS) data to estimate canopy cover for 210 5-m radius vegetation plots in semi-open habitats and forests in protected nature areas in Denmark. The method was based on the area of Thiessen (Voronoi) polygons generated from the ALS points. We also estimated angular canopy closure by transforming ALS points from Cartesian to spherical coordinates, and calculating the percentage of azimuth and zenith angle intervals which contained points. We compared these estimates with field-based estimates using densiometer for 60 vegetation plots in forest. Finally, we compared ALS-based estimates of canopy cover and canopy closure to field-based estimates of understory light, based on the average Ellenberg indicator values for light for the plant species present in a given plot. The correlations of Ellenberg values with ALS-based canopy closure were higher (r(2): 0.47) than those with ALS-based canopy cover (r(2): 026) and densiometer readings (r(2): 0.41) for the forest sites. ALS-based canopy closure is thus a reasonable indicator of understory light availability and has the advantage over field-based methods that it can be rapidly estimated for extensive areas.

AB  - Watersheds represent spatially explicit areas within which terrestrial stressors can be quantified and linked to measures of aquatic ecosystem condition. We delineated thousands of Great Lakes watersheds using previously proven and new watershed delineation techniques. These were used to provide summaries for a variety of anthropogenic stressors within the Great Lakes. All delineation techniques proved useful, but each had applications for which they were most appropriate. A set of watershed delineations and stressor summaries was developed for sampling site identification, providing relatively coarse strata for selecting sites along the U.S. Great Lakes coastline. Subsequent watershed delineations were used for high-resolution site characterization of specific sites and characterizing the full coastal stressor gradient. For these delineations we used three general approaches: 1) segmentation of the shoreline at points midway between adjacent streams and delineation of a watershed for each segment; 2) specific watershed delineations for sampled sites; and 3) a Great Lakes basin-wide, high-resolution approach wherein sub-basins can be agglomerated into larger basins for specific portions of the coast. The third approach is unique in that it provides a nested framework based on hierarchies of catchments with associated stressor data. This hierarchical framework was used to derive additional watershed delineations, and their associated stressor summaries, at four different scales. Providing anthropogenic stressor metrics in such a format that can quickly be summarized for the entire basin at multiple scales, or specifically for particular areas, establishes a strong foundation for quantifying and understanding stressor-response relationships in these coastal environments.

AB  - Because environmental conservation can remove scarce natural resources from competing uses, it is important to gain support for conservation programs by demonstrating that management actions have been effective in achieving their goals. One way to do this is to show that selected significant environmental variables (indicators) vary between managed and unmanaged areas or change over time following implementation of a management regime. However, identifying indicators that reflect environmental conditions relevant to management practices has proven difficult. This paper focuses on developing a framework for choosing indicators in a coral reef habitat. The framework consisted of three phases: (1) information gathering to identify candidate variables; (2) field-testing candidate variables at sites that differ in intensity of human activity, thus identifying potential indicators; and (3) evaluating potential indicators against a set of feasibility criteria to identify the most useful indicators. To identify indicators suitable to measure the success of a management strategy to reduce anchor damage to a coral reef, 24 candidate variables were identified and evaluated at sites with different intensities of anchoring. In this study, measures that reflected injuries to coral colonies were generally more efficient than traditional measures of coral cover in describing the effects of anchoring. The number of overturned colonies was identified as the single most useful indicator of coral reef condition associated with anchoring intensities. The indicator selection framework developed here has the advantages of being transparent, cost efficient, and readily transferable to other types of human activities and management strategies.

AB  - The Silurian Waldron Shale preserves a diverse marine fossil assemblage dominated by epibenthic suspension feeders. Three paleocommunities, distinguished from one another by taxonomic composition, relative abundance of taxa, and fossil distribution, are represented in the Waldron.
   The Biohermal Community exists above storm-wave base and has the greatest taxonomic richness and evenness. Species-abundance data for non-strophomenid brachiopods most closely fit a log-normal distribution. The Inter-reef Community occurs below storm-wave base,: contains fewer species, and is less even in abundance distribution. Rank-abundance data for the non-strophomenid brachiopod fauna most closely fit a log-series distribution. The Deeper Platform Community exists below storm-wave base, and may have experienced lower oxygen concentrations. The community has low species richness and abundance, and is dominated by strophomenid brachiopods. This community cannot be fitted to either the log-series or log-normal distributions, but resembles a broken stick distribution.
   In all three Waldron communities, water depth, habitat heterogeneity, biotic interactions, and disturbance may have played important roles in determining biodiversity. General environmental conditions predicted by species-abundance models are congruent with paleoenvironmental conclusions drawn from sedimentological and paleontological data,, suggesting that some paleoenvironmental and paleoecological conditions can be inferred from the ecology of a fossil indicator taxon. Many of the factors controlling diversity in biological communities may have remained the same over much of Phanerozoic time, possibly making analysis of the link between the Recent and the Paleozoic a viable foundation for predictive models far some aspects of community dynamics.

AB  - Comparative assessment of pollution and ecosystem health among the Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) of Latin America and the Caribbean requires tracking of shifting food-chain associations, loss of habitat, toxic and anoxic impacts to species, diseases, harmful algal blooms and vulnerability to climate extremes, invasive species, and overfishing. Meta-data search and extraction techniques help researchers consolidate disturbance observations into one of eight multiple marine disturbance (MMED) categories important for the creation of place specific disturbance regimes. By measuring the changing baseline condition of impact-sensitive indicator species involved in these MMED events, resource managers can better compare, mitigate, and track changes in marine ecosystem health.

AB  - Reconstructing historical hydrologic and vegetation conditions can provide useful insights into the mechanisms underlying peatland development and can be used to construct baselines for peatland restoration. In this study, we present numerous physical and biological indices for a 4000-year core from the Honghe National Natural Reserve (HE), a dish-like depression peatland in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. The history of vegetation change was reconstructed by combining plant macrofossils and pollen data from the core, and the water level changes were reconstructed through a multi-proxy study of plant macrofossils, charcoal, stable carbon isotopes, testate amoebae, sediment grain size, loss on ignition, humification degree and magnetic susceptibility. We found that the HE peatland featured wet condition from 4000 to 3600 cal yr BP, which was in accordance with the extreme flooding event at 4.0 lea in northern China. Significant drier shifts were recorded at 3600 and 1200 cal yr BP, while significant wetter shifts were recorded at 2600 and 500 cal yr BP. Factor analysis were applied to all of the proxies to reduce the seven variables to two factors, and the biological indicators, such as plant macrofossils, charcoal and stable carbon isotopes, were found to be more sensitive than the other parameters to water level changes over the last 4000 years. Furthermore, the multi-proxy reconstruction of the wetness of the HE peatland resembles the pattern observed at other sites in Northeast China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal ocean ecosystems are impacted by atmospheric conditions and events, including episodic severe systems such as hurricanes as well as more regular seasonal events. The complexity of the atmosphere-ocean relationship makes establishing concrete connections difficult. In this paper, this relationship is assessed through synoptic climatological methods, a technique well established in applied climatological research but heretofore rarely used in assessing coastal ocean water quality and ecological status. Historical sea level pressure data are used to define 10 circulation patterns across the southeastern United States and adjacent Gulf of Mexico, based on the spatial pattern of sea level pressure, which can then be associated with the presence of cyclones, precipitation, and wind stress. The frequency of these patterns, and their deviation from climatological means, is then compared with Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) chlorophyll observations over the Florida Bay and south Florida shelf for the period 1997-2010. Several circulation patterns indicative of cyclonic activity over the broader region are associated with increased chlorophyll levels in the study area, while several other patterns, indicative of anticyclonic conditions, are associated with decreased chlorophyll levels. These relationships are spatially and temporally variable, generally with stronger correlations observed in winter and spring, and farther north in the study region when compared with more southern locations near the Florida Keys. The results here demonstrate the potential of using synoptic analysis and derived statistics for tracking and modeling changes in chlorophyll and other indicators related to water quality and biological health.

AB  - The TreeNet research and monitoring network has been continuously collecting data from point dendrometers and air and soil microclimate using an automated system since 2011. The goal of TreeNet is to generate high temporal resolution datasets of tree growth and tree water dynamics for research and to provide near real-time indicators of forest growth performance and drought stress to a wide audience. This paper explains the key working steps from the installation of sensors in the field to data acquisition, data transmission, data processing, and online visualization. Moreover, we discuss the underlying premises to convert dynamic stem size changes into relevant biological information. Every 10 min, the stem radii of about 420 trees from 13 species at 61 sites in Switzerland are measured electronically with micrometer precision, in parallel with the environmental conditions above and below ground. The data are automatically transmitted, processed and stored on a central server. Automated data processing (R-based functions) includes screening of outliers, interpolation of data gaps, and extraction of radial stem growth and water deficit for each tree. These long-term data are used for scientific investigations as well as to calculate and display daily indicators of growth trends and drought levels in Switzerland based on historical and current data. The current collection of over 100 million data points forms the basis for identifying dynamics of tree-, site- and species-specific processes along environmental gradients. TreeNet is one of the few forest networks capable of tracking the diurnal and seasonal cycles of tree physiology in near real-time, covering a wide range of temperate forest species and their respective environmental conditions.

AB  - Several biomarkers used for ecological risk assessment have been established for single contaminant toxicity, many of which are less predictive of the influence of media and/or dietary nutrients on toxicity outcomes of contaminant mixtures. In this study, we investigate toxicological responses and life traits of Scenedesmus acutus and Daphnia pulex to heavy metals (cadmium-Cd, arsenic-As, binary mixture-Cd/As-mix) in media and diets with varied nutrient (nitrate-N) conditions (low-LN, median-MN, optimum - COMBO). Results showed that nitrate-N-mediated metal inhibitory effects on growth and productivity of primary producer (S. acutus) were significantly interactive (p < 0.05; effect size, eta(2) <= 56 %). Cadmium toxicities (Cd-IC50 s) in S. acutus were 1.2 x , 5.3 x , and 4.3 x As-IC(50)s in LN, MN and COMBO media, respectively, while mixture (Cd/As-mix) toxicities were synergistic in MN medium and partial additivity in COMBO and LN media. Nitrate-N and metal exposure effects on S. acutus nutrient stoichiometry, metal uptake and bioaccumulation were significantly interactive (p < 0.05, eta(2)<= 100 %). Moreover, survival of primary consumer (D. pulex) was significantly impaired by single and mixed dietary-metal exposures with greater effect under LN condition coupled with significant interactive effects on reproductive capacity (p < 0.05, eta(2)<= 21.2 %) but not on swimming activity. We recommend that nitrate-N-mediated metal exposure effects/toxicity in bioindicator species should be considered during ecological risk assessments.

AB  - Environmental microbial gene expression patterns remain largely unexplored, particularly at interannual time scales. We analyzed the variability in the expression of marker genes involved in ecologically relevant biogeochemical processes at a temperate Atlantic site over two consecutive years. Most of nifH transcripts, involved in nitrogen (N) fixation, were affiliated with the symbiotic cyanobacterium Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa, suggesting a key role as N providers in this system. The expression of nifH and amoA (i.e., marker for ammonia oxidation) showed consistent maxima in summer and autumn, respectively, suggesting a temporal succession of these important N cycling processes. The patterns of expression of genes related to the oxidation of carbon monoxide (coxL) and reduced sulfur (soxB) were different from that of amoA, indicating alternate timings for these energy conservation strategies. We detected expression of alkaline phosphatases, induced under phosphorus limitation, in agreement with the reported co-limitation by this nutrient at the study site. In contrast, low-affinity phosphate membrane transporters (pit) typically expressed under phosphorus luxury conditions, were mainly detected in post-bloom conditions. Rhodobacteraceae dominated the expression of soxB, coxL and ureases, while Pelagibacteraceae dominated the expression of proteorhodopsins. Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria were major contributors to the uptake of inorganic nutrients (pit and amt transporters). Yet, in autumn, Thauma- and Euryarchaeota unexpectedly contributed importantly to the uptake of ammonia and phosphate, respectively. We provide new hints on the active players and potential dynamics of ecologically relevant functions in situ, highlighting the potential of metatranscriptomics to provide significant input to future omics-driven marine ecosystem assessment.

AB  - Populations of wildlife species worldwide experience incidents of mass morbidity and mortality. Primary or secondary drivers of these events may escape classical detection methods for identifying microbial insults, toxin exposure, or additional stressors. In 2012, 28% of polar bears sampled in a study in the southern Beaufort Sea region of Alaska had varying degrees of alopecia that was concomitant with reduced body condition. Concurrently, elevated numbers of sick or dead ringed seals were detected in the southern Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering seas in 2012, resulting in the declaration of an unusualmortality event (UME) by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The primary and possible ancillary causative stressors of these events are unknown, and related physiological changes within individual animals have been undetectable using classical diagnostic methods. Here we present an emerging technology as a potentially guiding investigative approach aimed at elucidating the circumstances responsible for the susceptibility of certain polar bears to observed conditions. Using transcriptomic analysis we identified enhanced biological processes including immune response, viral defense, and response to stress in polar bears with alopecia. Our results support an alternative mechanism of investigation into the causative agents that, when used proactively, could serve as an early indicator for populations and species at risk. We suggest that current or classical methods for investigation into events of unusual morbidity and mortality can be costly, sometimes unfocused, and often inconclusive. Advances in technology allow for implementation of a holistic system of surveillance and investigation that could provide early warning of health concerns in wildlife species important to humans.

AB  - One of the limitations of paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on multiple bioindicators is a lack of knowledge on the differential preservation of hard parts, which may lead to biases in interpretation. This is particularly important when biological proxies differ in their intrinsic properties, such as skeletal mineralogy or size. We explored and compared the preservational patterns of siliceous (diatoms) and carbonate (mollusks) fossils during the late Holocene (ca. 4000 cal. years B.P.) in two lacustrine sedimentary successions from Argentina (Nahuel Ruca and Hinojales-San Leoncio). Fragmentation and fine-scale surface-alteration indices were calculated on two target species: the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana Kutzing and the snail Heleobia parchappii (d'Orbigny, 1835). The taphonomic data were smoothed along depth with a locally weighted regression (LOESS) and statistically compared using Spearman correlations. Additionally, past environmental conditions were inferred from the autoecology of the dominant taxa. Diatoms and mollusks displayed similar tendencies in fragmentation, characterized by a gradual decrease of breakage toward the top of the successions. On the other hand, trends in surface preservation were opposite. Diatoms exhibited higher alteration in the oldest sedimentary levels, characterized as saline and less-productive water bodies, while mollusks were more altered at the topmost levels, characterized as freshwater highly productive lakes. This contrasting response of both indicators can be interpreted as a consequence of the differential reaction of carbonate and silica to dissolution agents acting in fresh and saline water. Hence, the accuracy of the paleoenvironmental information provided by both indicators under these contrasting conditions probably would be affected by the taphonomic biases suffered, which highlight the relevance of including taphonomic traits in Quaternary paleoenvironmental or paleoclimatic studies.

AB  - We investigated and compared management practices for dealing with uncertainty in agroecosystem dynamics in two cases of smallholder farming in different parts of the world: northeast Tanzania and east-central Sweden. Qualitative research methods were applied to map farmers' practices related to agroecosystem management. The practices are clustered according to a framework of ecosystem services relevant for agricultural production and discussed using a theoretical model of ecosystem dynamics. Almost half of the identified practices were found to be similar in both cases, with similar approaches for adjusting to and dealing with local variability and disturbance. Practices that embraced the ecological roles of wild as well as domesticated flora and fauna and the use of qualitative biological indicators are identified as tools that built insurance capital for change and enhanced the capacity to respond to changing agroecosystem dynamics. Diversification in time and space, as well as more specific practices for mitigating pest outbreaks and temporary droughts, can limit the effects of disturbance. In both Sweden and Tanzania, we identified social mechanisms for the protection of species that served important functions in the agroecosystem. We also found examples of how old practices served as a source of adaptations for dealing with new conditions and that new knowledge was adjusted to local conditions. The study shows that comparing management practices across scales and in different cultural settings can reveal insights into the capacity of farmers to adjust, respond to, and shape ecosystem dynamics. We emphasize the importance of continuous learning for developing the sustainable management of complex agroecosystems and securing agricultural production for the future.

AB  - Redoximorphic features, saturation, and reduction of Fe are the essential properties that define aquic conditions, Proposed colorimetric tests for reduction of Fe did not respond in sola of a Mollisol catena from central Iowa. The objectives of this study were to determine the distributions of redox-sensitive metals as potential indicators of aquic condition and relate them to soil morphology and water table depth of soils to differentiate aquic from nonaquic conditions. The variabilities of different forms of extractable Fe and Mn throughout the soil profile and their relationships to aquic and nonaquic conditions were investigated for five soils from a Mollisol catena in central Iowa, Selective dissolution methods were used to extract various forms of Fe and Mn, There was a pronounced decrease in total Fe as the duration of saturation increased. With permanent saturation and presence of gray matrices in soil horizons, content of Fe-d and Mn-d (citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite-extractable Fe and Mn) decreased, but Mn-d increased where periodic saturation exists. The ratio of Mn-d/Fe-d with its depth function in conjunction with water table data and soil morphology separated aquic from nonaquic conditions among members of the Mollisol catena studied. Therefore, secondary Fe and Mn distributions within this Mollisol catena are better indicators of aquic and nonaquic environments than the colorimetric tests for Fe2+. This ratio needs to be tested in other areas and could be used as an alternate criterion instead of reduction of Fe when a colorimetric test does not differentiate aquic from nonaquic conditions.

AB  - The present paper discusses the fate of the fungicide carbendazim (nominal concentrations: 0, 3.3, 33, 100 and 1000 mu g L-1) and its effects on the macroinvertebrate community in outdoor microcosms set up in Thailand. Fate and threshold values were subsequently compared with those noted in temperate model ecosystem studies in order to evaluate to which extent toxicity data generated in temperate regions for compounds like carbendazim may be extrapolated to tropical areas. Carbendazim disappeared faster from the water column than reported in temperate model ecosystem studies, which is explained by a possibly greater microbial breakdown of the fungicide under the tropical conditions tested. The No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) calculated in the present study for the macroinvertebrate community was the same as recorded in a study carried out in The Netherlands (3.3 mu g L-1). However, most sensitive representatives in the latter study were "worm-like" taxa, whereas water boatmen (Corixidae) were the most sensitive macroinvertebrates in the present study. The ecological realism of a tropical risk assessment based on temperate organisms that are less sensitive than local macroinvertebrates may be questionable. Recommendations for future research include testing the possibility to rear sensitive representatives of indigenous Thai Corixidae in the laboratory and conducting model ecosystem studies evaluating a wider range of pesticides on a larger tropical geographical scale.

AB  - In this work we investigated the correlations between global gene expression patterns and environmental parameters in natural ecosystems. We studied the preferential gene expression of the iron oxidizer bacterium Leptospirillum ferrooxidans to adapt its physiology to changes in the physicochemical parameters in its natural medium. Transcriptome analysis by DNA microarrays can proportionate an instant picture about the preferential gene expression between two different environmental samples. However, this type of analysis is very difficult and complex in natural ecosystems, mainly because of the broad biodiversity and multiple environmental parameters that may affect gene expression. The necessity of high-quality RNA preparations as well as complicated data analysis are also technological limitations. The low prokaryotic diversity of the extremely acidic and iron-rich waters of the Tinto River (Spain) ecosystem, where L. ferrooxidans is abundant, allows the opportunity to achieve global gene expression studies and to associate gene function with environmental parameters. We applied a total RNA amplification protocol validated previously for the amplification of the environmental transcriptome (meta-transcriptome). The meta-transcriptome of two sites from the Tinto River mainly differing in the salt and oxygen contents were amplified and analysed by a L. ferrooxidans DNA microarray. The results showed a clear preferential induction of genes involved in certain physicochemical parameters like: high salinity (ectAB, otsAB), low oxygen concentration (cydAB), iron uptake (fecA-exbBD-tonB), oxidative stress (carotenoid synthesis, oxyR, recG), potassium (kdpBAC) or phosphate concentrations (pstSCAB), etc. We conclude that specific gene expression patterns can be useful indicators for the physiological conditions in a defined ecosystem. Also, the upregulation of certain genes and operons reveals information about the environmental conditions (nutrient limitations, stresses, etc.).

AB  - Endangered species conservation requires the understanding of factors affecting animal condition and performance. However, commonly investigated resource-use metrics such as habitat selection may not accurately predict biological outcomes because some components of habitats are more important to animals than others. We examined individual level resource-outcome relationships and the relationship between 2 biological outcome metrics-body condition and fate-in Ozark hellbenders Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi, which were recently included on the US Endangered Species List by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Our regression models included proportional use of a stream substrate, average distance to cover, distance moved, and water temperature as predictors of daily change in body condition or fate of captive-reared, radio-marked released hellbender populations in 2 sections of the North Fork of the White River in Missouri in 2008-2009. Distance moved between observations helped predict change in body condition, but no variable predicted fate well. We infer that resource use of selected substrate features did not predict biological outcomes in the short term. Our results indicate that energetic metrics such as distance moved can predict biological outcomes better than use of substrate features. Body condition did not correlate with fate and may be a poor indicator of an animal's ability to survive and reproduce. These investigations improve our understanding of influences on biological outcomes in hellbenders, which may improve efficacy of management and conservation of this species through efforts to increase abundance of important resources to improve hellbender condition and performance.

AB  - Heat stress during the last week of growth induces hyperthermia and kills a great number of broiler chickens. Body temperature can be considered as an useful indicator of the thermic comfort of broilers exposed to heat and of their capacities of adaptation. Early-age thermal conditioning by exposure of chicks, during 24 hours to 36-40degreesC, reduced in a limited way (0.12-0.30degreesC but significantly and consistently the average temperature measured in the final colon and decreases mortality due to heat stress during the finishing period, without reducing growth. Several results suggest an increased muscular synthesis due to early-age thermal conditioning. These results of research were reproduced under tropical conditions in Venezuela. The mechanisms of early acquisition of a durable resistance to a heat stress are not completely known. Early-age thermal conditioning reduces hematocrite, blood viscosity, blood level of T3, without changing significantly those of glucose and proteins. No result confirms an implication of heat shock proteins in the early acclimation process. Early-age thermal conditioning probably induces thermolysis mechanisms (peripheral blood flow and panting) and reduces thermogenesis under warm conditions (thyroid metabolism and mitochondrial uncoupling), in young chicks when they become homeothermic. There are enough positive results today to assert that the capacity of chickens to survive heat stress is increased by exposure to high temperature during 24 hours at the age of 5 days.

AB  - Ecologists and conservationists need accurate and replicable tools for monitoring wetland conditions in order to develop and implement adaptive management strategies efficiently. The Rhone Delta (Camargue) in southern France encloses 9200 ha of fragmented reed marshes actively managed for reed harvesting, waterfowl hunting or cattle grazing, and holding significant numbers of vulnerable European birds. We used multi-season SPOT-5 data in conjunction with ground survey to assess the predictive power of satellite imagery in modelling indicators of reed structure (height, diameter, density and cover of green/dry stems) relevant to ecosystem management and bird ecology. All indicators could be predicted accurately with a combination of bands (SWIR, NIR) and indices (SAVI, OSAVI, NDWI, DVI, DVW, MSI) issued from scenes of March, June, July, September or December and subtraction between these. All models were robust when validated with an independent set of satellite and field data. The high spatial resolution of SPOT-5 scenes (pixel of 10 x 10 m) permits the monitoring of detailed attributes characterizing the reed ecosystem across a large spatial extent, providing a scientifically-based, replicable tool for managers, stakeholders and decision-makers to follow wetland conditions in the short and long-term. Combined with models on the ecological requirements of vulnerable bird species, these tools can provide maps of potential species ranges at spatial extents that are relevant to ecosystem functioning and bird populations.

AB  - The Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone of the Sydney Basin occur in the headwaters of Sydney's drinking water catchments and are listed as endangered ecosystems, yet they have suffered habitat losses and degradation due to human impacts such as urbanisation. Despite ongoing efforts to restore and better protect upland swamps, they remain poorly understood, potentially hindering the effectiveness of management efforts. Essential to overall ecosystem function and the provision of services for human and environmental benefit are the microbial component of wetland ecosystems. In the case of these swamps, the microbes, have not yet been studied. Here, we investigated differences in the microbial community of upland swamps in urbanised catchments compared to swamps from natural catchments in the Blue Mountains. A total of twelve swamps were sampled, six from within urbanised catchments and six with intact vegetation catchments, to compare sediment conditions and microbial community and genes expression and abundances. Catchment impervious area and number of stormwater drains entering a swamp, indicators for urbanisation, positively correlated with the pH and ammonium concentration of swamp sediment. Community analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (T-RFLP, qPCR) revealed the elevated pH of urbanised swamps coincided with changes to the abundance of bacteria and archaea. Furthermore, RT-qPCR revealed genes involved in carbon cycling (mcrA & pmoA) were more likely to be found in urbanised swamps. Taken together, our results indicate that urbanisation of the Blue Mountains is impacting the environmental services provided by the microbial community of upland swamps in the Sydney Basin.

AB  - Participatory modeling (PM) has become an essential concept in environmental impact assessment and planning in the field of water resources. In this paper, we focus on the use of PM to support the development of the integrated regional modeling system DANUBIA as a scientific concept to analyze the previously unknown impacts of global change, i.e., the combined effects of climate, demographic, economic, social and ecological change, on the Upper Danube Catchment (Germany). We use this case study to examine the specific conditions for PM in the field of complex integrated models on a regional scale. We describe the stepwise PM process and discuss the respective results, focusing on (1) the stakeholder dialogue's contribution in supporting the development of new, complex modeling systems, particularly on a regional scale, (2) conditions of stakeholder involvement in issues related to the distant future, such as climate change impacts on regional water availability, and (3) limitations of PM and scientists' motivation to carry out participatory research at all. We conclude that the PM process was not entirely successful in improving the scientific quality and practical applicability of the developed models because the process goals were manifold and overambitious, and the definition of the problem of "global change impacts on a regional scale" was too weak and uncertain to allow for a clear common objective of modelers and stakeholders. We claim that there is a lack of incentives for scientists, particularly natural scientists, to commit to PM activities.

AB  - The importance of local hydraulic conditions on the structuring of freshwater biotic communities is widely recognized by the scientific community. In spite of this, most current methods based upon invertebrates do not take this factor into account in their assessment of ecological quality. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of local hydraulic conditions on invertebrate community metrics and to estimate their potential weight in the evaluation of river water quality. The dataset used consisted of 130 stream sites located in four broad European geographical contexts: Alps, Central mountains, Mediterranean mountains anti Lowland streams. Using River Habitat Survey data, the river hydromorphology was evaluated by means of the Lentic-lotic River Descriptor and the Habitat Modification Score. To quantify the level of water pollution, a synoptic Organic Pollution Descriptor was calculated. For their established, wide applicability, STAR Intercalibration Common Metrics and index were selected as biological quality indices. Significant relationships between selected environmental variables and biological metrics devoted to the evaluation of ecological quality were obtained by means of Partial Least Squares regression analysis. The lentic-lotic character was the most significant factor affecting invertebrate communities in the Mediterranean mountains, even if it is a relevant factor for most quality metrics also in the Alpine and Central mountain rivers. Therefore, this character should be taken into account when assessing ecological quality of rivers because it can greatly affect the assignment of ecological status.

AB  - A 30,000 yr dinocyst and pollen record from the eastern equatorial Atlantic (off Cameroon) has been investigated in order to identify land-ocean linkages during the last deglacial transition. A strong correlation between the abundance of Brigantedinium spp. and the Ca/Fe ratio during the last glacial period suggests enhanced marine productivity in association with cool seawater temperatures and nutrient input linked to coastal upwelling and/or a proximal river mouth. Dry conditions are recorded on the adjacent continent with a significant representation of open vegetation indicators and the Afromontane taxon Podocarpus. After 17 cal ka BP these indicators register a sharp decline as a result of a climatic transition from the dry/cooler conditions of the last glacial period to the wetter/warmer conditions of the deglaciation. Simultaneously, dinocysts show a significant shift from dominant heterotrophs to an increasing abundance of auto-trophs, reflecting warmer conditions. Significant changes are observed during the Younger Dryas, with a return to drier conditions and higher salinities. The start of the Holocene is marked by very low-salinity conditions, reflecting optimal monsoonal conditions over west equatorial Africa. The end of the African Humid Period is observed between 6 and 5 cal ka BP, followed by significant fluctuations in both terrestrial and oceanic proxies.

AB  - Understanding how environmental factors and short-term evolution affect the growth of invasive plants is a central issue in Invasion Biology. For macrophytes, salinity is one of the main factors determining distribution along estuarine environments.Urochola arrectais a Poaceae with high invasive potential in several freshwater and estuarine ecosystems. In South Brazilian estuaries, this species is found sparsely in mangroves, and invades successfully freshwaters and areas with low salinity. We experimentally described theU. arrectatolerance to salt. Furthermore, we tested if the response to the saline gradient depends on the population origin, through an experiment with populations inhabiting estuarine and freshwater ecosystems. We designed the experiment with three populations of this species, expecting that estuarine populations were more resistant to salinity. Plants grew in a salinity gradient and after 40 days we measured macrophytes biomass and length. Salinity was highly stressful forU. arrectaindependently of its origin. Even so, plant growth differed significantly among populations. Despite higher growth, the population originated from freshwater habitats presented the fastest decrease in performance indicators with increasing salinity. This result indicates short-term evolutionary changes because all populations grew common-garden conditions in our experiment. Furthermore, salinity did not prevent the full establishment of this plant, since almost all propagules developed roots even in the saline treatments. Differences among populations suggest that invasion potential of this species can be higher than predicted by the environmental conditions of current invaded sites. Constant monitoring in estuarine invaded ecosystems is central to manage invasions in critical ecosystems, such as mangroves areas.

AB  - Fluvial biofilms are subject to multistress situations in natural ecosystems, such as the co-occurrence of light intensity changes and metal toxicity. However, studies simultaneously addressing both factors are rare. This study evaluated in microcosm conditions the relationship between short-term light intensity changes and Zn toxicity on fluvial biofilms with long-term photoacclimation to different light conditions. Biofilms that had long-term photoacclimation to 25 mu mol photons.m-2. s-1 (low light [LL] biofilms), 100 mu mol photons. m-2.s-1 (medium light [ML] biofilms), and 500 mu mol photons.m-2.s-1 (high light [HL] biofilms) were characterized by different structural (Chlorophyll-a [Chl-a], total biomass-AFDW, EPS, algal groups, and diatom taxonomy) and physiological attributes (ETR-I curves and photosynthetic pigments). HL biofilms showed higher light saturation intensity and a higher production of xanthophylls than LL biofilms. In contrast, LL biofilms had many structural differences; a higher proportion of diatoms and lower AFDW and EPS contents than ML and HL biofilms. A clear effect of light intensity changes on Zn toxicity was also demonstrated. Zn toxicity was enhanced when a sudden increase in light intensity also occurred, mainly with LL biofilms, causing higher inhibition of both the F'PSII and the FPSII. A decoupling of NPQ from de-epoxidation reaction (DR) processes was also observed, indicating substantial damage to photoprotective mechanisms functioning in biofilms (i.e., xanthophyll cycle of diatoms) due to Zn toxicity. This study highlights the need to take into account environmental stress (e.g., light intensity changes) to better assess the environmental risks of chemicals (e.g., metals).

AB  - On the basis of the European Water Framework Directive (2000/60), the water resources of the member states of the European Community should reach good quality standards by 2015. Although such regulations illustrate the basic points for a comprehensive and effective policy of water monitoring and management, no practical tools are provided to face and solve the issues concerning freshwater ecosystems such as rivers. The Italian government has developed a set of regulations as adoption of the European Directive but failed to indicate feasible procedures for river monitoring and management. On a local scale, Sicilian authorities have implemented monitoring networks of watersheds, aiming at describing the general conditions of rivers. However, such monitoring programs have provided a relatively fragmentary picture of the ecological conditions of the rivers. In this study, the integrated use of environmental quality indices is proposed as a methodology able to provide a practical approach to river monitoring and management. As a case study, the Imera Meridionale River, Sicily's largest river, was chosen. The water quality index developed by the U.S. National Sanitation Foundation and the floristic quality index based on the Wilhelm method were applied. The former enabled us to describe the water quality according to a spatial-temporal gradient, whereas the latter focused on the ecological quality of riparian vegetation. This study proposes a holistic view of river ecosystems by considering biotic and abiotic factors in agreement with the current European regulations. How the combined use of such indices can guide sustainable management efforts is also discussed.

AB  - Millions of people rely on active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to prevent and cure a wide variety of illnesses in humans and animals, which has led to a steadily increasing consumption of APIs across the globe and concurrent releases of APIs into the environment. In the environment, APIs can have a detrimental impact on wildlife, particularly aquatic wildlife. Therefore, it is essential to assess their potential adverse effects to aquatic ecosystems. The European Water Framework Directive sets out that risk assessment should be performed at the catchment level, crossing borders where needed. The present study defines ecological risk profiles for surface water concentrations of 8 APIs (carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, cyclophosphamide, diclofenac, erythromycin, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, metformin, and metoprolol) in the Vecht River, a transboundary river that crosses several German and Dutch regions. Ultimately, 3 main goals were achieved: 1) the geo-referenced estimation of API concentrations in surface water using the geography-referenced regional exposure assessment tool for European rivers; 2) the derivation of new predicted-no-effect concentrations for 7 of the studied APIs, of which 3 were lower than previously derived values; and 3) the creation of detailed spatially explicit ecological risk profiles of APIs under 2 distinct water flow scenarios. Under average flow conditions, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol were systematically estimated to surpass safe ecological concentration thresholds in at least 68% of the catchment's water volume. This increases to 98% under dry summer conditions. (c) 2021 The Authors. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of SETAC

AB  - Long-term datasets developed based on measurements of archived fish otoliths may help in the evaluation of climatic impacts on marine resources. The objective of the present study was to identify the factors that influence interannual variations in the somatic growth rate of herring (Clupea harengus) in the Baltic Sea. This work covers otolith samples collected from commercial catches and during scientific surveys from 1951 to 2017 in the Polish zone of the southern part of the Baltic. Otolith increment widths, which represent changes in fish growth, were analyzed with linear mixed models to investigate different intrinsic and extrinsic sources of fish growth variation. The stock biomass of pelagic species (herring and sprat Sprattus sprattus), sea surface temperature, Baltic Sea Index and land precipitation over the catchment area were considered potential predictors of herring growth. Methods to identify the optimal time window for environmental factors were incorporated in the modeling. Moreover, a wavelet coherence analysis, tests for identification of regime shifts in fish growth and a spatial correlation analysis were applied to the data. The developed multidecadal otolith-based biochronology showed that the growth of Baltic herring is under the strong influence of interspecific competition between herring and sprat, but the biochronology also indicated a high correlation with precipitation patterns over the runoff area and hydrological conditions within the Baltic Sea. A detailed investigation revealed that the relationships between herring growth and abiotic conditions or other ecosystem components can vary over time. The recognized complex ecological effects on herring growth necessitate the application of holistic ecosystem-based approaches for sustainable management and exploitation of small pelagic fish resources.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates are globally used in environmental monitoring and assessment. However, due to environmental and biological evolution, local adaptations of species might occur. This can contribute to uncertainties in the extrapolation of familyspecific ecological models developed from one region to another. Thus, we aimed to determine if models can be extrapolated to other regions with similar climatic conditions and if a reliable model can be developed from a pooled dataset (consisting of data from different regions). The occurrence of five families was modelled based on physical-chemical water quality variables with classification trees using the data from three tropical river basins (Chaguana in Ecuador, Gilgel Gibe in Ethiopia and Cau in Vietnam). The relevance of each model was tested on complementary data from both the same and other river basins, to test specificity and universality. Furthermore, models with a pooled dataset were developed and tested. Model reliability was assessed based on chance-corrected agreement (Cohen's kappa, kappa) and percent agreement (correctly classified instances, CCI). Values of higher than 0.4 (kappa) and 70% (CCI) were used to classify models as good. Only the pollution sensitive taxon (Leptophlebiidae) resulted in reliable models for most cases. In general, responses of macroinvertebrates towards pollution were different among countries except for the pollution sensitive taxa. Thus, extrapolation of ecological models for sensitive taxa to another river basin with similar climatic and environmental conditions is possible. Nevertheless, this type of systematic analyses for all families is necessary to determine and minimize uncertainty in ecological assessment.

AB  - Mesoamerican biodiversity is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic destruction of natural land cover. Habitat degradation and climate change are primary threats to specialized forest odonate species that are important model organisms for forest health and defining conservation units. The extreme niche specialization of Megaloprepus caerulatus, the world's largest extant odonate, makes it well suited as an indicator for changing environmental conditions. Megaloprepus, which is considered to be a monospecific genus, is highly dependent on old growth forests whose water filled tree holes are limiting reproductive resources for this species. Here, we focus on the question how historical and recent fragmentation events, strong niche conservatism and ecological conditions have affected population dynamics, viability and the species status in this evolutionarily old genus. Two mitochondrial sequence markers (ND1 and 16S rRNA) and a set of microsatellites were used to analyze population structure and genetic diversity of M. caerulatus in the northern part of its distributional range. Results suggested an absence of gene flow and no shared haplotypes among the study populations. Statistical parsimony indicated high sub-structuring among populations with sequence diversity similar to levels found at the species level compared to other odonates. In sum, the genetic data suggest that Megaloprepus may actually consist of more than one species. The taxonomic status of the group should be revised in light of the three distinct genetic clusters found in different forest regions. The results may also allow insights into the impact of recent and historical habitat fragmentation on a strong Neotropical forest restricted insect species.

AB  - Aquatic communities vary depending on local factors, such as environmental conditions and biological interactions and regional factors, such as the hydrological regime in floodplains. This study analyzed the community structure of rotifers and their secondary production in two lakes of an Upper Parana River floodplain (Brazil) differing in their hydrology: one connected to the river and the other isolated. Integrated samples of the water column were collected daily during 15 days in the low and high water periods. Three statistical methods, ANOVA, MRT, and IndVal were applied to distinguish the structure, biomass, and secondary production of their rotifer communities. The rotifer fauna was rich (91 species). Temperature, an indicator of seasonal change, and hydrological connection to river were major factors structuring rotifer communities. The community presented differences between periods in the isolated lake, but had a higher stability in the connected lake. We identified 34 indicator species of the groups formed by the MRT analysis. Production was low and consistent in the connected lake (similar to 1.5 mu g DW m(-3) day(-1)), being higher and more variable in the isolated lake (peaking at ca. 60-90 mu g DW m(-3) day(-1)). Results also showed that changing environmental conditions verified in the low water period and in the isolated lake were determinant for both the community structure and the secondary production of rotifers. We demonstrate that not only flooding but also the levels of isolation from the river during low water period are the driving forces for the structure and dynamics of organisms in floodplains. Thus, the isolated lakes represent important areas for rotifer biodiversity.

AB  - Over-abstraction of water places unsustainable pressures on river ecosystems, with the impacts amplified under drought conditions. Freshwater fishes are particularly vulnerable due to associated changes in water quality, and habitat availability, condition and connectivity. Accordingly, fish assemblages are ideal indicators of the impacts of drought and over-abstraction. The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), south-eastern Australia, terminates at the Ramsar listed Coorong and Lower Lakes, which comprise Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert. Over-abstraction and extreme drought during the last decade has placed these lakes under severe environmental stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate shifts in fish assemblages caused by substantial water level recession and salinization in the Lower Lakes. Small-bodied fish assemblages were sampled at the beginning and several years into the drought. Off-lake habitats held diverse fish assemblages in 2003, but most sites were dry by 2009. Remaining habitats were disconnected, salinities increased substantially, and aquatic vegetation shifted from freshwater to salt-tolerant species. There was a substantial decline in the proportion of specialist species, especially diadromous and threatened species, and an emerging dominance of generalist freshwater and estuarine species. The findings warn of the inevitable ecological impact of over-allocating water for human use in drought-prone regions, and highlight the need for adequate environmental water allocations. This study also emphasises that understanding the ecological attributes of a fish species, and the subsequent assignment to a functional group, will help predict vulnerability to decline and extirpation.

AB  - Belowground ecosystem processes can be highly variable and difficult to predict using microbial community data. Here, we argue that this stems from at least three issues: (a) complex covariance structure of samples (with environmental conditions or spatial proximity) can make distinguishing biotic drivers a challenge; (b) communities can control ecosystem processes through multiple mechanisms, making the identification of these controls a challenge; and (c) ecosystem function assessments can be broad in physiological scale, encapsulating multiple processes with unique microbially mediated controls. We test these assertions using methane (CH4)-cycling processes in soil samples collected along a wetland-to-upland habitat gradient in the Congo Basin. We perform our measurements of function under controlled laboratory conditions and statistically control for environmental covariates to aid in identifying biotic drivers. We divide measurements of microbial communities into four attributes (abundance, activity, composition, and diversity) that represent different forms of community control. Lastly, our process measurements differ in physiological scale, including broader processes (gross methanogenesis and methanotrophy) that involve more mediating groups, to finer processes (hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and high-affinity CH4 oxidation) with fewer mediating groups. We observed that finer scale processes can be more readily predicted from microbial community structure than broader scale processes. In addition, the nature of those relationships differed, with broad processes limited by abundance while fine-scale processes were associated with diversity and composition. These findings demonstrate the importance of carefully defining the physiological scale of ecosystem function and performing community measurements that represent the range of possible controls on ecosystem processes.

AB  - The study was conducted to assess the community structure of planktonic rotifers and their relation to the environmental impact of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Linaeus, 1758), aquaculture activities (ponds and net-tanks), associated with a Neotropical semiarid reservoir in Brazil. Our hypothesis was that the ecological attributes of the rotifer community were different when considering the influence of fish aquaculture activities. We identified 28 species, with 10 species from the Brachionidae family. The average density and diversity index of rotifers were higher in reservoir stations, with mean values in the ponds approximately 50% lower than those of the reservoir. The microphagous species dominated during all the time, while the raptorial species were accidental in all studied environments. The ponds were represented by four significant indicator species: Brachionus caudatus, B.leydigi, Dicranophoroides caudatus and Testudinella patina and the reservoir by three: B.falcatus, B.havanaensis and Conochilus dossuarius. In general, nine species were significantly associated with some categories of environmental conditions, such as high or low turbidity and low values of conductivity and TDS. Four of the five best bioindicator species belonged to the microphagous genus Brachionus. B.havanaensis indicated five environmental conditions (IndVal>93.1%), and it appeared to be a key species in this Neotropical semiarid reservoir influenced by aquaculture activities. The dominance of microphagous rotifers suggests a functional redundancy of species in the studied environments. We found that these systems and their management affected the planktonic rotifer community in this region of Brazil by increasing the species richness.

AB  - Indicator species are species that are used as ecological indicators of community or habitat types, environmental conditions, or environmental changes. In order to determine indicator species, the characteristic to be predicted is represented in the form of a classification of the sites, which is compared to the patterns of distribution of the species found at the sites. Indicator species analysis should take into account the fact that species have different niche breadths: if a species is related to the conditions prevailing in two or more groups of sites, an indicator species analysis undertaken on individual groups of sites may fail to reveal this association. In this paper, we suggest improving indicator species analysis by considering all possible combinations of groups of sites and selecting the combination for which the species can be best used as indicator. When using a correlation index, such as the point-biserial correlation, the method yields the combination where the difference between the observed and expected abundance/frequency of the species is the largest. When an indicator value index (IndVal) is used, the method provides the set of site-groups that best matches the observed distribution pattern of the species. We illustrate the advantages of the method in three different examples. Consideration of combinations of groups of sites provides an extra flexibility to qualitatively model the habitat preferences of the species of interest. The method also allows users to cross multiple classifications of the same sites, increasing the amount of information resulting from the analysis. When applied to community types, it allows one to distinguish those species that characterize individual types from those that characterize the relationships between them. This distinction is useful to determine the number of types that maximizes the number of indicator species.

AB  - Spring water reflects the hydrochemistry of the aquifer in the associated catchments. On dense siliceous bedrock, the near surface groundwater flow is expected to be closely related to the biogeochemical processes of forest ecosystems, where the impact of land use is also low. We hypothesize that the plant species composition of springs mainly reflects hydrochemical conditions. Therefore, springs may serve as indicator systems for biogeochemical processes in complex forest ecosystems. To test this hypothesis, we investigate the influence of spring water chemical properties, catchment traits, and spatial position on plant species composition for 73 springs in forested catchments it? central Germany, using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), Mantel tests, and path analyses. Partial Mantel tests and path analyses reveal that vegetation is more, greatly influenced by spring water chemistry than by catchment trails. Consequently the catchment's influence on vegetation is of effective in an indirect way, via spring water. When considering spatial aspects (in particular altitude) in addition, the explanatory power of catchment traits for spring water properties is reduced almost to zero. As vegetation shows the highest correlation with the acidity gradient, in assume that altitude acts as a sum parameter that incorporates various acidifying processes in the catchment. These processes are particularly, related to attitude - through bedrock, climatic parameters and forest vegetation. The species composition of undisturbed springs is veri, sensitive in reflecting such conditions and may serve as an integrative tool for detecting complex ecological processes.

AB  - Purpose: This paper deals with the problem of traditional maintenance model ignoring energy consumption in two-component parallel systems. Thus, the aim of the article is to propose a new maintenance model with ecological consciousness for two-component parallel systems, which can improve the energy utilization and achieve sustainable development. The objective is to obtain the optimal maintenance policy by minimizing total cost.
   Design/methodology/approach: This paper integrates energy efficiency into condition-based maintenance (CBM) decision-making for two-component parallel systems. Based on energy efficiency, the paper considers the economic dependence between the two components to take opportunistic maintenance. Specifically, the objective function consists of traditional maintenance cost and energy cost incurred by energy consumption of components. In order to assess the performance of the proposed new maintenance policy, the paper uses Monte-Carlo method to evaluate the total cost and find the optimal maintenance policy.
   Findings: Simulation results indicate that the new maintenance policy is superior to the classical condition-based opportunistic maintenance policy in terms of total costs.
   Originality/value: For two-component parallel systems, previous researches usually simply establish a condition-based opportunistic maintenance model based on real deterioration data, but ignore energy consumption, energy efficiency (EE) and their contributions of sustainable development. This paper creatively takes energy efficiency into condition-based maintenance (CBM) decision-making process, and proposes a new condition-based opportunistic maintenance policy by using energy efficiency indicator (EEI).

AB  - Ecological assessment was performed in different thermal springs located in the Ethiopian Rift Valley area: Gergedi, Sodere, Halaba, and Gara. We assessed the habitat conditions, physicochemical characteristics, and macroinvertebrate composition at 12 sampling sites in four thermal spring systems. The physicochemical properties of the water samples varied among the sampling stations. Temperature ranged from 38.5 to 90 degrees C among the 12 sites. Dissolved oxygen, which is essential to aquatic ecosystem normal functioning, was not detected at three sampling sites. An average of 109 macroinvertebrates were identified in three sampling campaigns. Relatively higher macroinvertebrate abundance 94 (86.2%) was registered in Gergedi than any other thermal spring sites. The macroinvertebrate abundance was 9 (8.3%) and 6 (5.5%) for the Gara and Sodere thermal springs. No macroinvertebrate communities were observed in all sites of Halaba thermal spring. From all macroinvertebrate groups, 82 (75.2%) were dipterans, 20 (18.4%) Oligochaeta, 5 (4.6%) Gastropoda, and the rest Hemipterans and Coleopterans, which comprises 2 (1.8%) individuals. Chironomidae was the dominant invertebrate taxa at all sites, and when the water temperature exceeds 42 degrees C, it becomes the only taxon in the thermal springs. Macroinvertebrates were absent in thermal springs where the water temperature is 52 degrees C or higher. Other diversity measures were not sensitive enough to discriminate sampling sites regardless of physicochemical variabilities except the richness and abundance. Water temperature, chloride, pH, and phosphate were identified as major determinants of macroinvertebrate richness in the Ethiopian Rift Valley region.

AB  - Many U.S. national parks are already at the extreme warm end of their historical temperature distributions. With rapidly warming conditions, park resource management will be enhanced by information on seasonality of climate that supports adjustments in the timing of activities such as treating invasive species, operating visitor facilities, and scheduling climate-related events (e.g., flower festivals and fall leaf-viewing). Seasonal changes in vegetation, such as pollen, seed, and fruit production, are important drivers of ecological processes in parks, and phenology has thus been identified as a key indicator for park monitoring. Phenology is also one of the most proximate biological responses to climate change. Here, we use estimates of start of spring based on climatically modeled dates of first leaf and first bloom derived from indicator plant species to evaluate the recent timing of spring onset (past 10-30 yr) in each U.S. natural resource park relative to its historical range of variability across the past 112 yr (1901-2012). Of the 276 high latitude to subtropical parks examined, spring is advancing in approximately three-quarters of parks (76%), and 53% of parks are experiencing "extreme" early springs that exceed 95% of historical conditions. Our results demonstrate how changes in climate seasonality are important for understanding ecological responses to climate change, and further how spatial variability in effects of climate change necessitates different approaches to management. We discuss how our results inform climate change adaptation challenges and opportunities facing parks, with implications for other protected areas, by exploring consequences for resource management and planning.

AB  - An increasing need for integrative assessments that measure the contributions of the environment to human welfare has recently been recognised. In the present study, a preliminary assessment of the services provided by the Mondego Basin in terms of system ecological quality was carried out. The ecological, economic, and societal relations of the Mondego estuarine services were analysed. An inventory of the main ecosystem services provided by the Mondego system was performed. The conditions and trends of the main services (food production, recreation and water quality maintenance) were determined, and the scale dependence of this assessment was interpolated on three different scales: Mondego Basin, Lower Mondego, and Mondego Estuary. The interdependence among services was quantified; an ecological assessment regarding water quality and ecological conditions was performed, and a preliminary valuation of the food production, recreation and tourism in the region was undertaken. In the study system, from 1992 to 2006, there was an increase in recreation activities and water uses and a simultaneous decrease in services such as food production (i.e., strong interdependence among services). Ecological quality improvement is reflected in both local communities' diversity and water quality. The market prices method was used to estimate the values for the three services considered; however, the Mondego catchment's full value cannot be calculated without estimating the real wetlands value because these are prone to underestimation. Uncertainties and shortcomings regarding the reliability of this kind of assessment for implementation on estuarine ecosystems are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diversity in the biophysical and socio-economic attributes of agricultural systems makes them uniquely niche based. Farmers are expert in local biophysical and socio-economic situations and can contribute in developing pragmatic indicators of agro-environmental development. During evaluation of an agricultural research project in Yunnan, China, local farmers were capable of evaluating the effects of modified technologies on existing cropping systems and discussed their attitudes to the interventions using their own indicators. Farmers' response can be grouped into seven major aspects: i) effects on income, ii) effects on production resources, iii) effects on crop management, iv) existing local knowledge about the technology, v) availability of inputs, vi) access to information, and vii) socio-economic conditions of farming households. Farmers concluded that environmental conditions in the experimental catchment in comparison to an adjacent untreated. catchment were better in terms of soil and water losses, vegetation cover and natural resources, infrastructures and catchment management, use of environmentally-friendly technologies, and crop productivity. Success in soil and water conservation programmes depends on the efforts of the farmers and other local users and their greater involvement helps to identify more pragmatic indicators. Furthermore, it increases ownership of the programme, enhances interactions with the project scientists, increases farmers' awareness of agro-environmental problems and their possible consequences. These development will enable scientists to develop better targeted interventions and increase the likelihood of adoption of tested technologies by local communities. The use of paired adjacent catchments improved evaluation activities and is proposed as good practice for future catchment improvement programmes.

AB  - In recent decades, riparian vegetation has been removed from important ecosystems around the world, in spite of its high ecological importance for aquatic biota. Nevertheless, the effects of catchment land use on zooplankton have been little studied. The present study investigated if replanting riparian vegetation in a tropical reservoir influences the richness and abundance of cladoceran communities, by addressing the question of whether cladocerans show differences in richness and abundance among four levels of riparian vegetation conditions: 1) native forest (NF); 2) 30 years after forest replanting (R1); 3) 10 years after forest replanting (R2); and 4) no forest (No-F). Zooplankton samples were obtained from 9 stations in the Volta Grande Reservoir, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Cladocerans in zones NF and R1 showed higher levels of richness and abundance than in zones No-F and R2. Ceriodaphnia reticulata, Ceriodaphnia laticaudata, and Diaphanosoma spinulosum showed higher abundances in zones NF and R1. Cladoceran community structure was influenced by the different levels of riparian vegetation. This study showed that the presence and age of riparian forest positively influence the abundance, richness and diversity of cladoceran assemblages. Furthermore, our results indicated that C. reticulata, C. laticaudata and D. spinulosum are more efficient than other cladocerans in exploiting allochthonous resources provided by riparian forest. Functional diversity was higher in zones NF and R1, suggesting that the trait composition of cladoceran assemblages responds positively to recovery of riparian forest. Overall, our research suggests that cladocerans are good indicators of riparian vegetation conditions and that restoration of riparian forest positively affects cladoceran assemblages of tropical reservoirs.

AB  - Since the Brisbane Declaration in 2007, implementation of environmental flows in public policies has witnessed a steady increase around the globe. Environmental water reserves are an annual volume that is designated to remain in the ecosystem for the sustainable management of river basins. In Mexico, these reserves are determined on the basis of the Mexican Environmental Flows Norm and must be established at a river basin scale through a presidential decree for 50 years. In this manuscript, we present and discuss the implementation strategy of the norm developed for the National Water Reserves for the Environment Program, and its results in 25 reference sites based on environmental flow assessments conducted from 2012 to 2015 using hydrological and holistic methodologies. An analytical evaluation revealed an overall consistency between the Norm's environmental objectives (baseline) and the current ecological conditions on-site for the 80% of the cases (96% over high confidence rating). Furthermore, in 72% of the reference sites, the coefficient of variation among the reserve's was below the fourth quartile (<11%), whereas those remaining above that limit can be attributed to a difference in the methods' hydrologic scope. The recommended volumes for environmental allocation are feasible under the current water availability conditions in the 94% of the river basins. Although challenges have appeared in the process, to date, one reserve has been decreed on the basis of the strategic approach of setting sustainable limits of water allocation and being built an enriched flow-ecology relationships' understanding system, urgently needed to prevent ecosystems degradation and secure ecological processes.

AB  - The contemporary distribution of benthic diatoms and their use as ecological indicators were examined in a coastal wetland, the Ebro Delta, as a representative of environmental conditions in Mediterranean coastal wetlands. A total of 424 diatom taxa were identified across 24 sites encompassing a wide range of wetland habitat types (coastal lagoons, salt and brackish marshes, shallow bays, microbial mats and nearshore marine waters) and conductivities. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that water conductivity and water depth were the main factors structuring the diatom assemblages. Cluster analysis identified five habitat types according to the similarity in diatom species composition: salt marshes, brackish marshes, brackish coastal lagoons and bays, coastal lagoons with fresher conditions, and nearshore open sea. For each wetland habitat, diatom indicator species were identified. Partial canonical correspondence analysis showed that water conductivity, a proxy for salinity, was the most statistically significant and independent variable for explaining the distribution of benthic diatoms in the study area. A transfer function, using a weighted average regression model, was developed for conductivity and displayed reasonable performance (r (2) = 0.64; RMSEP = 0.302 log(10) mS/cm). Our study in the Ebro Delta provides a basis for using diatom assemblages to make quantitative conductivity inferences, and for using diatom indicator species to identify wetland habitats. These approaches are complementary and may be valuable for paleoenvironmental studies of (1) effects of large-scale, natural changes in the Delta (e.g. sea-level fluctuations), and (2) impacts of short-term anthropogenic changes, such as the introduction and development of rice agriculture.

AB  - We tested the hypotheses that management of the soil food web in the fall would enhance grazing on bacteria and fungi by microbivorous nematodes in the spring, consequently increasing N availability in cover-crop driven organic and low-input farming systems. The food web was manipulated by irrigating the dry soil of late summer and/or providing carbon sources. By creating conditions conducive for biological activity, we increased the abundance of bacterivore and fungivore nematodes in the fall and the following spring. Greater biological activity in the soil enhanced concentrations of mineral N available to the subsequent summer tomato crop. Mineral N concentration in the spring was associated with abundance of bacterivore nematodes, and with the corresponding Enrichment Index (EI) provided by nematode community analysis. Because environmental conditions that favour increase of bacterivore nematodes probably also favour other microbial grazers, including protozoa, the abundance of bacterivore nematodes may be an indicator of overall grazing activity and N mineralisation rates from soil fauna. Decomposition pathways in the spring, inferred from nematode bioindicators, were dominated by bacteria in plots that had been irrigated the previous fall while fungi were more prevalent in those that had not. The responses of omnivore and predator nematodes to our treatments were not consistent and there was no evidence that regulation of opportunist species by predators would be enhanced by the management practices imposed.

AB  - Global environmental change is causing increases in soil temperatures and alternations in precipitation patterns, which are affecting soil biota in natural and managed systems. Arable soils, generally disturbed due to management practice, are particularly sensitive to a changing environment. However, little is known how warming interacts with precipitation pattern to affect soil fauna and thereby ecosystem functions. In an arable system, we investigated the interactions of soil warming and altered precipitation amount and frequency on soil conditions and health using nematodes as bioindicators. Our findings showed that the nematode population density was significantly increased by warming and decreased by reduced precipitation frequency. Warming mainly fostered the density of fungal feeders and obligatory plant parasites, with the latter suggesting higher crop damage. Rootassociated plant feeders were further affected by changes in precipitation pattern; their density declined with reduced precipitation frequency and increased with the alternated precipitation amount. The nematode abundance was generally low in the arable ecosystem and remained stable under the simulated environmental change. In response to warming, the major soil decomposition channel via bacteria was reduced, and the fungal mediated pathway fostered, implying more fungal dominated depleted and degraded soil conditions. Soil decomposition pathways were not affected by altered precipitation pattern, neither by amount nor by frequency. Overall, warming and precipitation independently altered the soil nematode fauna and the functioning of belowground food webs. Therefore, our study highlights the need for more research considering the interactions of environmental variables to see if this lack is a general pattern and to develop strategies for agroecosystem's management under climate change.

AB  - Despite the increasing use of pesticides in tropical countries, research and legislative efforts have focused on their temperate counterparts. This paper presents a review of the literature on environmental risk assessment of pesticides for tropical terrestrial agroecosystems. It aims at evaluating potential differences in pesticide risk between temperate and tropical regions as well as to highlight research needs in the latter. Peculiarities of pesticide risks in tropical terrestrial agroecosystems are discussed in subsections 1) agricultural practices; 2) research efforts; 3) fate and exposure; 4) toxicity testing methods; and 5) sensitivity. The intensive and often inadequate pesticide application practices in tropical areas are likely to result in a relatively greater pesticide exposure in edge-of-field water bodies. Since pesticide fate may be different under tropical conditions, tropical scenarios for models estimating predicted environmental pesticide concentrations should be developed. Sensitivity comparisons do not indicate a consistent similar, greater or lower relative sensitivity of tropical soil organisms as compared to temperate organisms. However, several methods and procedures for application in the tropics need to be developed, which include: 1) identifying and collecting natural soils to be used as reference test substrates in tests; 2) identifying and discerning the range of sensitivity of native test species to soil contaminants; 3) developing test guidelines applicable to tropical/subtropical conditions; and 4) developing methods and procedures for higher tier testing for full development and implementation of environmental risk assessment schemes.

AB  - Ecological indicators are often collected to detect and monitor environmental change. Statistical models are used to estimate natural variability, pre-existing trends, and environmental predictors of baseline indicator conditions. Establishing standard models for baseline characterization is critical to the effective design and implementation of environmental monitoring programs. An anthropogenic activity that requires monitoring is the development of Marine Renewable Energy sites. Currently, there are no standards for the analysis of environmental monitoring data for these development sites. Marine Renewable Energy monitoring data are used as a case study to develop and apply a model evaluation to establish best practices for characterizing baseline ecological indicator data. We examined a range of models, including six generalized regression models, four time series models, and three nonparametric models. Because monitoring data are not always normally distributed, we evaluated model ability to characterize normal and non-normal data using hydroacoustic metrics that serve as proxies for ecological indicator data. The nonparametric support vector regression and random forest models, and parametric state-space time series models generally were the most accurate in interpolating the normal metric data. Support vector regression and state-space models best interpolated the non-normally distributed data. If parametric results are preferred, then state-space models are the most robust for baseline characterization. Evaluation of a wide range of models provides a comprehensive characterization of the case study data, and highlights advantages of models rarely used in Marine Renewable Energy environmental monitoring. Our model findings are relevant for any ecological indicator data with similar properties, and the evaluation approach is applicable to any monitoring program.

AB  - We used populations of an abundant diatom in calcareous microbial mats, Encyonema evergladianum, from 3 karstic wetlands in the Caribbean Basin to test whether the relative abundance of this species is more strongly driven by macrohabitat features (landscape-scale gradients of conductivity and P availability) or mat microhabitat characteristics (biomass and mineral content), and whether specialization is maintained in populations from geographically separated but environmentally similar wetlands. We found that, across Caribbean wetlands, the abundance of E. evergladianum was most strongly tied to microbial-mat biomass, suggesting that this species is specialized for, and probably contributes to, the unique conditions of these mats. However, the magnitude and importance of micro- and macroscale drivers on E. evergladianum abundance differed among wetlands, which implies that this diatom has differentiated ecotypically across its range. We found no morphological correlates to potential ecotypes, making it difficult to distinguish between ecotypes without molecular studies. We also searched for an engineering role of E. evergladianum in mat structure by examining freeze-fractured mat fragments under scanning electron microscopy, but found no morphological evidence for functional contributions to mat cohesion. Encyonema evergladianum is a consistently strong indicator of oligotrophic, freshwater conditions that promote calcareous microbial mats in coastal karstic wetlands of the Caribbean. Variability in the scales of specialization by microbial species requires calibration of quantitative, abundance-based approaches to habitat assessment in the context of individual wetlands, particularly in these wetlands where ecosystem-scale changes are abrupt in response to climate and anthropogenic changes in nutrient delivery and salinity.

AB  - Vanadium (V) is increasingly recognized both as a medical trace element with essential biological functions and as a potentially toxic environmental pollutant, yet the current knowledge on V speciation in soils is limited. Here, we investigated the chemical speciation and extractability of V in highly weathered tropical soils, which are often rich in V compared to soils of temperate climatic regions. Vanadium K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of soil samples, along with a range of reference compounds differing in V-oxidation state and coordination chemistry, revealed the predominance of V4+/5+ in a primarily octahedral or tetrahedral coordination. The soil spectra were best fitted with linear combinations of reference spectra of V4+ in the structure of kaolinite, V5+ adsorbed to kaolinite, and other V5+-sorbed solids. Vanadate adsorbed to goethite, ferrihydrite, gibbsite, and/or Fe(III)natural organic matter complexes and V4+ in the structure of goethite may be present, but cannot unequivocally be distinguished from each other by XANES spectroscopy. Sequential and single chemical extractions provided complementary information on the solubility of V under various conditions. The most labile V fractions, interpreted as weakly and strongly adsorbed V-5+, are the most relevant to V mobility and bioavailability in the environment, and accounted for only similar to 2% of total soil V. Our results demonstrate that kaolinite and Fe oxides can effectively sequester V in highly weathered soils by mechanisms of adsorption and structural incorporation and are relevant to other Fe-oxide-rich environments under acidic and oxic conditions.

AB  - Halophytes are plants which naturally survive in saline environment. They account for similar to 1% of the total flora of the world. They include both dicots and monocots and are distributed mainly in arid, semi-arid inlands and saline wet lands along the tropical and sub-tropical coasts. Salinity tolerance in halophytes depends on a set of ecological and physiological characteristics that allow them to grow and flourish in high saline conditions. The ability of halophytes to tolerate high salt is determined by the effective coordination between various physiological processes, metabolic pathways and protein or gene networks responsible for delivering salinity tolerance. The salinity responsive proteins belong to diverse functional classes such as photosynthesis, redox homeostasis; stress/defense, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, protein metabolism, signal transduction and membrane transport. The important metabolites which are involved in salt tolerance of halophytes are proline and proline analog (4-hydroxy-N-methyl proline), glycine betaine, pinitol, myo-inositol, mannitol, sorbitol, O-methylmucoinositol, and polyamines. In halophytes, the synthesis of specific proteins and osmotically active metabolites control ion and water flux and support scavenging of oxygen radicals under salt stress condition. The present review summarizes the salt tolerance mechanisms of halophytes by elucidating the recent studies that have focused on proteomic, metabolomic, and ionomic aspects of various halophytes in response to salinity. By integrating the information from halophytes and its comparison with glycophytes could give an overview of salt tolerance mechanisms in halophytes, thus laying down the pavement for development of salt tolerant crop plants through genetic modification and effective breeding strategies.

AB  - Thirty-four lakes and ponds on north-central Victoria Island (Arctic Canada) were examined in order to characterize the limnological conditions of these unstudied aquatic ecosystems, and to provide baseline data as part of a larger study monitoring future changes in climatically-sensitive high-latitude locations. Similar to several other arctic regions, the lakes and pondswere slightly alkaline (mean pH = 7.65), dilute (mean specific conductance = 96.4 muS), and low in nutrients. What distinguished this limnological data set was the ultra-oligotrophic nature of the lakes and ponds, as mean phosphorus (1.3 mug l(-1)) and chlorophyll a (0.4 mug l(-1)) concentrations were amongst the lowest recorded in arctic environments. Also, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (often <1 mg l(-1)) were 2-3 times lower than those recorded for ponds at similar latitudes. Principal components analysis (PCA) separated sites primarily along a gradient of DOC and specific conductance, and along a secondary gradient of particulate nitrogen, likely reflecting differences in phyto- and zooplankton biomass. These ultra-oligotrophic lakes and ponds should show a marked response to global warming. As DOC acts as a natural UV radiation screen, the combination of ultra-oligotrophic conditions and low DOC levels suggests that the biota within these sites are representative of those adapted to living in highly stressful environments. Lakes and ponds in this region make ideal monitoring sites, as they should be especially responsive to future environmental changes.

AB  - Pavement condition monitoring is fundamental for the efficient allocation of resources in transportation asset management. However, data collection involves laborious and costly procedures. Our study intends to investigate the usage of remote sensing data for network-level pavement condition assessment that offers a more cost-effective alternative and a rapid infrastructure assessment tool that can be used in the aftermath of natural disasters. Based on an extensive literature review, a data mining framework was established to train models that predict the pavement condition of different road segments. The framework exploits the inherent information of multispectral images by generating spectral related attributes. To identify pavement sampling areas, an automated procedure using image segmentation replaces manual surface digitizing. Unlike previous research, different classification models were used to approximate the mapping function from spectral information to pavement conditions. A preliminary case study was conducted with data provided by the City of Dallas and multispectral images acquired from the Texas Natural Resources Information System. The mean-shift segmentation algorithm was used to locate noise introducing areas on the pavement surface. Four different classification models were trained using k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, support vector machines, and a multilayer perceptron. The developed models were employed to predict the road surface condition class of a test set not included in the training procedure. The multilayer perceptron presented the highest accuracy level of 71%, showing that the framework might have the potential for future implementation.

AB  - The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2020 was a driving force behind spatially explicit quantifications of Ecosystem Services (ES) in Europe. In Portugal, the MAES initiative (ptMAES-Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystem and their Services) was conducted in 2014 to address Target 2 (Action 5) of the Strategy, namely mapping and assessing ecosystems, ecosystems' condition (EC), and ES. In this study covering the NUTS II Alentejo region, EC was assessed and mapped based on four indicators (soil organic matter, plant and bird diversity, and ecological value of plant communities) and five ES were assessed and mapped (soil protection, carbon sequestration, and fiber/crop/livestock production). Assessments were performed under a multi-tiered approach, ranging from spatialization of statistical data to analytical modeling, based on the most detailed land-use/land-cover cartography available. In this paper, we detail the methodological and analytical framework applied in ptMAES and present its main outcomes. Our goal is to (1) discuss the main methodological challenges encountered to inform future MAES initiatives in Portugal and other member states; and (2) further explore the outcomes of ptMAES by looking into spatial relationships between EC and ES supply. We highlight the advantages of the proposed analytical framework and identify constraints that, among others, limited the number of ES and EC indicators analyzed. We also show that MAES can provide useful insights to landscape planning at the regional scale, for instance, red-flagging areas where ES supply may be unsustainable over time.</p>

AB  - This study addresses the spatial distribution of spiders (Araneae) in relation to their environment along multiple ecological and biogeographical gradients. Two study regions representing considerable variation in the alpine climate were sampled for epigeal spiders using pitfall traps: one in the oceanic region and one in the continental region of Norway. We aimed to identify the driving forces for spider species annidation in an alpine tundra ecosystem using a multi-scale approach. During the snow-free season in 2009, we sampled 6,628 adult specimens at 73 sampling locations. These data and additional information from previous studies on spider habitat preferences were used to examine the features of the species' spatial distribution. We analysed our data set using ordination space partitioning (Isopam), which relies on hierarchical partitioning of the ordination space. This method is based on a hierarchical classification of the sampling locations according to their species composition and results in classes that can be distinguished by indicator species. The aggregated classes and their spatial patterns could be linked to snow cover. Local climatic conditions had a stronger influence on spider biogeography than did broad-scale climatic conditions. We identified various indicator species for typical alpine tundra habitats that could be described as either 'chionophobous' or 'chionophilous', depending on the topography-related snow cover at the sites where they occurred. Through this multi-scale approach, this study is the first to demonstrate the importance of snow-cover patterns on the ecology and biogeography of spiders in alpine tundra ecosystems.

AB  - Policy developed for the management of natural resources in agricultural landscapes in recent years has emphasised the need for an integrated approach. Operationally however, natural resource objectives have been pursued independently with little consideration of the link between components of ecosystems and therefore the possibility of trade-offs between components. In the absence of this information, decision makers cannot adequately assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for improving the condition of the natural resource base. The aim of this study is to assess the extent of trade-offs between multiple catchment objectives viz. biodiversity, stream salinity, stream yield, salt load, sequestration of carbon and farm profit in the Little River Catchment in Central New South Wales. Seven scenarios describing different land use alternatives for the catchment were assessed using spatial datasets of catchment characteristics. A suite of models was used to determine the impact of land use change on these characteristics over a 50-year timeframe. The results of the analysis indicate that changes in farm production methods may deliver small improvements in some indicators of catchment health. However, significant improvements would require the establishment of large areas of woody perennials and this is only likely to occur with significant public investment, given the consequent large reduction in farm profit. Trade-offs between several catchment indicators were identified. Significantly the benefits of reducing stream salinity were outweighed by the losses resulting from reduced stream flow. Generally, the financial benefits of improving the indicators of resource condition were low relative to the investment required. It was concluded therefore that the environmental value of these improvements would need to be substantial to justify the investment.

AB  - This paper is based on an integrated assessment of abandoned farmland in the Iberian Southeast, a representative area of rich-biodiversity landscapes subject to strong physical stress and highly sensitive to environmental change. It is framed within the concept of natural reforestation and seeks an integration of physical and biodiversity features relevant for management. In pilot areas of different lithology (manly, limestone, and metamorphic) and abandonment age (< or >20 years), several physical (soil characteristics, evidences of erosion) and biodiversity (flora and birds) indicators have been assessed. It is concluded that these two sets of indicators often follow divergent or contrasting trajectories, particularly in the less coherent substrates where soil degradation and erosion concur with steppic physiognomy and high ornithological value. Lithology conditions the compositional and structural development of woody vegetation, but local landscape degradation can also reduce the pool of potential colonizers. Ecosystem development can be described as the interplay of positive and negative forces acting on physical evolution and biodiversity change. Abandonment per se is not a widely applicable management option but in many instances it can naturally improve soil and vegetation conditions. In more resistant lithologies, succession could lead to landscape homogenization, although recovery is usually slow and can eventually be arrested in stages dominated by a few woody species. Although our results are not generalizable to all semiarid land abandonment, they provide a framework for selecting management measures and for setting the scale and intensity of their application.

AB  - Relatively little is known about biological consequences of natural variation in background radiation, and variation in exposure due to nuclear accidents, or even the long term consequences to human health stemming from the over-use of nuclear medicine and imaging technologies (i.e. CAT scans). This realization emphasizes the need for assessment and quantification of biological effects of radiation on living organisms. Here we report the results of an environmental analysis based on extensive censuses of abundance of nine animal taxa (spiders, dragonflies, grasshoppers, bumblebees, butterflies, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) around Chernobyl in Ukraine and Belarus during 2006-2009. Background levels of radiation explained 1.5-26.5% of the variance in abundance of these nine taxa, birds and mammals having the strongest effects, accounting for a difference of a factor 18 among taxa. These effects were retained in analyses that accounted for potentially confounding effects. Effect size estimated as the amount of variance in abundance explained by background level of radiation was highly consistent among years, with weaker effects in years with low density. Effect sizes were greater in taxa with longer natal dispersal distances and in taxa with higher population density. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that costs of dispersal (i.e. survival) were accentuated under conditions of radioactive contamination, or that high density allowed detection of radiation effects. This suggests that standard breeding bird censuses can be used as an informative bio-indicator for the effects of radiation on abundance of animals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - El Nino events have great impacts on marine ecosystems worldwide, ranging from low trophic plankton production to fishery resources. Understanding how ecosystems respond to El Nino is the key to the success of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). However, few studies have focussed on the ecosystems respond to this natural perturbation in China seas, and the selection of effective ecological network analyses (ENA) indicators to evaluate the ecosystem response under El Nino conditions needs to be assessed. In this study, we constructed Ecopath models for Haizhou Bay in ENSO-neutral (2013) and El Nino (2015) years. Comprehensive analyses were conducted to evaluate ENA indicators in terms of sensitivity to the ecosystem variations, robustness to the model parameters uncertainties, and statistical check. Results showed that there were obvious variations in the species composition and biomass in the Haizhou Bay ecosystem under the El Nino event. Four optimal ENA indicators were selected, including total system throughput, total primary production, total system non-cycled throughflow, and ascendency. The indicators further showed a shrunken ecosystem size, increased energetic efficiency, and less organised ecosystem under the El Nino event. These findings enhance our understanding of ecosystem dynamics and underscore the need for precautionary management under El Nino conditions. Moreover, this work can be helpful in guiding the further selection of ENA indicators for evaluating and managing marine ecosystems during El Nino events elsewhere and thusly contribute to the implementation of EBFM.

AB  - Measures of performance in wild ungulates must consider density dependent and stochastic factors such as parasitic rates (as natural enemies in intimae relation with hosts) along with the impact of population management. In order to standardize parasite counts to be useful ecological indicators, it is essential to test host and parasite responses to the abovementioned. In the Iberian Peninsula, the parasitic nematode Elaphostrongylus cervi and its host the red deer (Cervus elaphus) provide an excellent practical scenario to illustrate how parasitic rates should be interpreted under different management contexts. Our study focuses on two distinct management scenarios, one deer population (LM) with supplemental feeding and one population (QM) with almost no human intervention, aside from hunting. We aim to assess how management (supplemental feeding) modulates the relationships of density dependent, stochastic and individual factors, and E. cervi faecal larvae counts in the red deer, so as with other physiological traits (body condition and spleen weight as a proxy to immunological status). Overall, we have shown the decisive role that density and precipitation can have in a Mediterranean environment, with different trends in the two studied areas (e.g. negative correlation between E. cervi and red deer density in supplemented population, in opposition to un-supplemented). The crucial role that precipitation combined with density can have on deer dynamics, along with the artificial feeding as buffer of some traits, reinforces the need for an adaptive management, and the demand to manage each population considering the surrounding environment. Management strategies selected in each site can establish populations dynamics and health and should be closely monitored in a long-term context, as it occurs in our study.

AB  - Coastal habitats are rich in biodiversity and provide highly valued ecosystem services. However, they are subject to many environmental drivers that can have severe impacts on these inherently fragile ecosystems. A resurvey approach was used to assess changes in species' abundances and occupancy on sand dunes and machair in Scotland, UK to assess how this could impact on this set of habitats. These were assessed to see if increasers and decreasers shared common trait values, if trends were similar to other terrestrial habitats and if responses to environmental drivers were modulated by traits. In general, there has been a shift towards taller species with more exploitative growth forms and an increase in indicators of unfavourable habitat condition according to criteria for assessing sites designated for nature protection as part of the EU Natura 2000 network, particularly tall grasses characteristic of nutrient-rich conditions exemplified by Arrhenatherum elatius. Coastal heathlands have been particularly affected by the increase in species such as Betula spp. and Pteridium aquilinum which can dominate and exclude other heathland species. On average, increasing species were both more common nationally and increasing nationally, suggesting increasing homogenisation between sand dunes/machair and other terrestrial habitats. Changes have been faster and more negative in conservation terms in cooler, drier and more polluted sites (mainly on the east coast of Scotland) and also in sites which had seen reductions in grazing. Reinstating grazing could counteract some of the negative impacts of eutrophication, but this could prove problematic to integrate with recreational activities and the largely arable based farming systems adjacent to these sites.

AB  - We evaluated the effectiveness of watershed-scale implementations of best-management practices (BMPs) for improving habitat and fish attributes in two coldwater stream systems in Wisconsin. We sampled physical habitat, water temperature, and fish communities in multiple paired treatment and reference streams before and after upland (barnyard runoff controls, manure storage, contour plowing, reduced tillage) and riparian (stream bank fencing, sloping, limited rip-rapping) BMP installation in the treatment subwatersheds. In Spring Creek, BMPs significantly improved overall stream habitat quality, bank stability, instream cover for fish, abundance of cool- and coldwater fishes, and abundance of all fishes. Improvements were most pronounced at sites with riparian BMPs. Water temperatures were consistently cold enough to support coldwater fishes such as trout (Salmonidae) and sculpins (Cottidae) even before BMP installation. We observed the first-time occurrence of naturally reproduced brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Spring Creek, indicating that the stream condition had been improved to be able to partially sustain a trout population. In Eagle Creek and its tributary Joos Creek, limited riparian BMPs led to localized gains in overall habitat quality, bank stability, and water depth. However, because few upland BMPs were installed in the subwatershed there were no improvements in water temperature or the quality of the fish community. Temperatures remained marginal for coldwater fish throughout the study. Our results demonstrate that riparian BMPs can improve habitat conditions in Wisconsin streams, but cannot restore coldwater fish communities if there is insufficient upland BMP implementation. Our approach of studying multiple paired treatment and reference streams before and after BMP implementation proved effective in detecting the response of stream ecosystems to watershed management activities.

AB  - A comprehensive environmental modelling study has been carried out to support the Istanbul Master Plan Study reviewing the waste water strategy for the period up to year 2030, at which time the sewerage system is expected to be extended to serve about 20 million people. Already today the local marine areas suffer from pollution effects caused by sewage discharge, The affected areas in particular are the Bosphorus Strait and the Bosphorus Strait-Sea of Marmara junction area, which are also the natural receiving waters for the sewage from the planned new development areas of Istanbul. The general conditions of the entire Sea of Marmara are also of concern. The object of the study was to determine the effects of the waste water effluent on the marine system and to evaluate alternative plans for sewage treatment and location of outfalls.
   An advanced 3-Dimensional model of the Black Sea-Bosphorus Strait-Marmara Sea junction area has been set-up and used for studying the immediate effects on oxygen conditions for a two week long design period. A 3-Dimensional model has been set up for the Sea of Marmara with the purpose of studying the effects of eutrophication over a one year period, which is necessary in order to describe the processes involved. These models are based on SYSTEM 3, a general modelling system for baroclinic flow, including modules describing water quality and biological/eutrophication processes.
   The various loading scenarios evaluated included variation in outfall location horizontally and vertically, e.g. in top layer versus halocline or bottom layer trapping and variation in treatment strategy, e.g. no treatment, biological and tertiary treatment.

AB  - Semi-dry semi-natural grasslands such as those of the alliance Mesobromion (Festuco-Brometea) are one of the most-diverse habitat types in Europe with regard to many taxonomic groups, but these remnants of traditional extensive agriculture are currently threatened throughout the continent. It is important to know how and where such valuable vegetation types could be best maintained (or re-established) under current environmental conditions. To address this question, we selected 27 dry grassland sites in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, half of which had been classified as of "good" and half as of "poor" quality one decade ago. We sampled vegetation, soil and topographical data in three 1-m(2) plots in each of these sites. We then compared the current environmental conditions and plant species composition of the two original quality levels. Furthermore, we related four metrics of current conservation value (vascular plant species richness, evenness, forb/graminoid ratio and an ad hoc developed conservation score) to measured environmental predictors and mean ecological indicator values. We found that the "good" and "poor" sites differed in only few environmental predictors, such as good sites having higher pH, lower soil nitrogen and steeper slopes, while they had higher numbers and covers of typical semi-dry grassland species and a higher conservation value. The metrics of conservation value behaved inconsistently when relating them to various environmental predictors. Interestingly, species richness decreased with slope inclination, but was also marginally negatively related to soil phosphorus. Conservation score, in contrast, increased with inclination, but also with increasing litter cover and soil nitrogen. While evenness largely showed similar response as conservation score, those of the forb-graminoid ratio were reversed for several environmental predictors. Overall, our results indicate that the conservation value of semi-dry grasslands cannot simply be attributed to one or two main factors. As different metrics of conservation value behaved differently, taking just one as a proxy would not be sufficient. Despite some variation, generally lower nutrient status, higher pH and steeper slopes seem to favour the maintenance of dry grasslands of higher quality. Some of our counterintuitive results such as the higher litter cover in the plots of higher conservation value may indicate that current conservation management of these grasslands is too extensive to maintain their quality, particularly given the high atmospheric nitrogen input in the region. We thus propose an experiment to test whether earlier and/or more frequent mowing helps in maintaining the quality of semi-dry grasslands.

AB  - Deepwater redfish Sebastes mentella will be among the most important resource-sustaining commercial bottom-fish fisheries in the years to come in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL). In 2011, 2012, and 2013, three strong cohorts were recruited to the stock; their abundance in 2018 was 80 times higher than that of the 1993-2012 period. The main goal of this work was to deepen our knowledge of their growth regulation and metabolism in order to identify molecular indicators and determine how they are influenced by natural environmental conditions. Fish weight and water temperature explained 11% of the variation in relative mRNA levels of specific gene targets in liver and muscle among seven sites where deepwater redfish were captured in the EGSL. The relative expression of liver insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) and white muscle A-chain lactate dehydrogenase (ldh-a) correlate positively with weight, whereas heavy chain muscle myosin (myo), heart citrate synthase (cs), and white muscle pyruvate kinase (pk) correlate negatively. The relative expression of heart cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox-1) and white muscle igf-1 receptor isoform a (igf-1ra) correlate negatively with temperature. Deepwater redfish from the estuary were smaller than those caught at other sites. Since the growth potential of deepwater redfish was strongly correlated with temperature (being enhanced by higher temperatures), this study suggests an ecological advantage for this species in a climate-warming context.

AB  - In recent years, the use of biochemical markers, especially in the assessment of toxic effects and modes of action, under controlled laboratory conditions has increased. However, transposing their use to in situ monitoring or risk assessment evaluations has encountered barriers, mainly related to the difficulty in interpreting the meaning of biochemical variation. In this work, we aimed at understanding if biochemical marker activities (cholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase and lactate dehydrogenase) can be used to monitor the health status of natural populations of fish (Gainbusia affinis) and daphnids (Daphnia magna). For that, two ponds with different water properties were chosen as study sites, and organisms collected at four sampling periods along the year. The pattern of biochemical marker responses was not the same in the two species, showing higher integrated biochemical marker response values in the winter for G. affinis and in the autumn for D. magna, suggesting specificities that must be taken into account in biomonitoring programmes by including representative species of several trophic levels, In the case of G. aifinic, the differences in key physicochemical parameters between the two ponds (especially dissolved oxygen levels) did not seem to affect biochemical marker levels as if organisms were already perfectly adapted to their environment. In general, seasonal variation of water quality seems to have an important role on biochemical marker responses. Several parameters above Environmental Quality Standards were identified such as dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia, nitrites, sulphides and metals, but eventual responses to these stressors could not be discriminated from natural variation except for particular cases.

AB  - This is part one of a two-part discussion, in which we will provide an overview of the use of aerial photography, topographic mapping and photogrammetry in environmental enforcement actions. The visualization of spatial relationships of natural and man-made features can focus the scope of environmental investigation, and provide a simple, yet quantitative, historical record of changes in conditions on a site. Aerial photography has been used in environmental remote sensing since the early part of the 20th century. Aerial photos are valuable tools for environmental assessment because they provide objective, detailed documentation of surface conditions at a specific time. Furthermore, they can generally be obtained even in cases where access on the ground is denied to investigators. From aerial photos, precise quantitative information can be collected using photogrammetry. Such measurement and positional data can be produced in digital format for input into a Geographic information System (GIS) for computerized analysis and display. Other information derived from aerial photographs requires specialized photointerpretive skills and experience. These include the recognition of vegetation mortality, oil-spill damage, and the ecological quality of water bodies. The location, extent and historical change of hazardous waste sites can be documented on topographic maps. These maps are often created from aerial photographs, and display the extent and location of real-world features by symbolizing them. The major advantage of maps over aerial photos is that maps can show things that are not visible from the air, while omitting unnecessary and distracting information. Because maps are derived products, they may contain bias in content and presentation, and they must be backed up by careful documentation and quality assurance protocols. (C) 2000 AEHS.

AB  - The Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) is a large and diverse river system that changes character along its 1,200 mile network of rivers and canals and 2.6 million acres of floodplain. It supports more than 30 million people in its watershed, a significant commercial waterway, more than a million acres of "floodplain" agriculture and about one-half million acres of river-floodplain managed for fish, wildlife, and recreation. Large-scale geomorphology and climate patterns largely determine the hydrologic characteristics of a nested hierarchy of UMRS river reaches. The human impacts above are also important drivers determining hydrologic characteristics within the hierarchy. Understanding the relationship among physical and chemical processes and ecological responses is critical to implement an adaptive management framework for UMRS ecosystem sustainability. Historic or contemporary data from 42 locations were used to examine changes in UMRS hydrology and to demonstrate the utility of a multiple reference condition analysis for river restoration. A multivariate mathematical framework was used to show how river stage hydrology can be characterized by the variability, predictability, seasonality, and rate of change. Large-scale "geomorphic reaches" have distinct hydrologic characteristics and response to development throughout the UMRS region, but within navigation pool hydrology is similar among all impounded reaches regardless of geomorphic reach. Reaches with hydrologic characteristics similar to historic reference conditions should be examined to determine whether those characteristics support desired management objectives. Water levels can be managed, within limits to support navigation and agriculture, to more closely resemble natural hydrology for the benefit of a variety of species, habitats, and ecological processes.

AB  - North American workers have increasingly turned to self-employment since the 1970s. Using microdata for the period 1983-1994 from Canada and the United States, I assess the importance of macroeconomic conditions and the tax environment in explaining the trends in male self-employment in these two countries. My findings suggest that higher income tax and unemployment rates are associated with an increase in the rates of self-employment among North American men Changes in the tax environment account for a considerable amount of the secular trends in male self-employment over this period, while changing economic conditions played a smaller role in determining these trends.

AB  - Determining the relationship between plant functional traits and the environment arc key for the protection and sustainable utilization of riparian wetlands. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, riparian wetlands are divided into seasonal floodplain wetlands (natural) and pond-like wetlands or paddy fields (artificial). Here, species composition differences were catalogued based on plant functional traits including origin, life history, and wetland affinity in natural and artificial wetlands. Wetland physicochemical characteristics and regional socio-economic parameters collected as indicators of environmental variables were used to analyze the plant functional trait-environment relationship.The results reveal that plant functional traits in the seasonal flood plain wetland are impacted by physicochemical characteristics of habitat. The abundance of annual plants tends to decrease with concentration of heavy metals, while species diversity is mainly determined by soil physical and chemical properties, especially soil pH and temperature. Specifically, wetland-obligate species (not in water) are more resistant to heavy metal content in water than species with other types of wetland affinity. Life history strategies of species in artificial sites tend to be significantly associated with animal husbandry and artificial populations, while the wetland affinity of species is mainly determined by regional agriculture, especially the installation of agricultural covered areas. Furthermore, water quality and nutrients in suspended sediments from the Yellow River affected species diversity and life history strategies by affecting water and soil conditions of surrounding wetlands, especially conductivity and phosphorus levels.

AB  - We in situ assessed the influence of natural fluoride concentrations in lotic freshwater ecosystems on diet and morphology of Boana cordobae tadpoles. Two streams were sampled in Argentina: Los Vallecitos stream (LF-LV) and Los Cerros Negros stream (HF-CN) with low and high fluoride levels, respectively. We captured tadpoles of B. cordobae in each stream using nets. Body weight (BW), total length (TL) and body condition (BC) of tadpoles was registered. Food items were identified to genus level and assigned to functional traits. Tadpoles showed significant differences in TL between streams, with smaller individuals in HF-CN, while did not show differences in BW and BC. The diet of tadpoles consisted mostly of microalgae. In tadpoles from HF-CN stream the proportion of cyanobacteria was lower than tadpoles from LF-LV. In relation to functional traits, small algae, high profile and colonial algae were more abundant in HF-CN. Algae attached by pads showed a higher proportion in HF-CN diets and stalked algae were more abundant in LF-LV. The differences in TL and diet of tadpoles can be attributed to differences in algal community composition, with genera that are affected by high concentrations of natural fluoride; for example cyanobacteria. The low algal richness registered in HF-CN stream does not affect the physiological state of the tadpoles, possibly because of a higher algal density in HF-CN diets. However, in further studies it would be important to evaluate the population status of B. cordobae from the HF-CN, because a small body length of tadpoles could have consequences at the population level.

AB  - Background: Changes in hydrological patterns produce degradation that affects forest structure and primary productivity. With actions of hydrological restoration, it is intended to restore biogeochemical conditions to facilitate the establishment, survival and growth of mangrove vegetation to recovering the forest structure and the productivity of underground roots (< 20 mm).
   Research question: Inducing changes in environmental variables through hydrological restoration reactivate the process of roots production?
   Study species: Biomass and fine roots production of Avicennia germinans were used as indicators of restoration success.
   Study sites and dates: This study was carried out from August 2013 to February 2015 in Isla del Carmen, located in Terminos Lagoon, Campeche.
   Methods: The study included four sampling sites, three of which were sites restored at different times. The fourth one was a natural undisturbed mangrove patch used as a reference for comparisons. After incubation of about 18 months within buried growth cores in each study site, biomass and roots production were quantified and contrasted.
   Results: The restored sites showed a lower root production (< 20 mm) (17 to 233 g m(2) yr(-1)) regard to the reference site (414 g m(2) yr(-1)). The analyses showed that production is determined by the forestry structure and hydrological conditions.
   Conclusion: The proportion of roots > 2 mm in diameter was greater in the reference site and decreased towards the restored sites, indicating that the forest structure (natural regeneration) and the time (years) after the restoration was important for the functional recovery of the mangrove ecosystem.

AB  - Wood fibres are as sensitive to environmental conditions as vessels in tree rings with intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) in Mediterranean species.
   Forecasted environmental changes are likely to increase the frequency of intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) in Mediterranean tree rings. The interpretation of intra-annual anatomical variability of tree rings with IADFs can be useful to understand plant-growth response to environmental changes with seasonal resolution. We analysed the intra-annual variability of quantitative traits of both vessels and fibres in the woods of Arbutus unedo L. and Erica arborea L. to compare the sensitivity of different cell types to environmental variations. We applied digital image analysis on microphotographs of semi-thin sections of tree rings formed at sites with different soil water availability. Wood of both species showed good adaptability that allows anatomical traits of vessels and fibres to be harmonised by changing the water transport capacity and wood strength, promoting the efficiency or safety of water transport according to water availability during wood formation. The size of fibres showed trends of variation similar to vessels. Not all parameters of vessels were accurate indicators of the IADF presence. In conclusion, parameters of fibres, which offer advantages during automatic measurement, showed the same sensitivity to environmental fluctuations as vessels. Thus, they could be good indicators of summer drought to describe and interpret the ecological meaning of IADFs in tree rings.

AB  - The Israeli Mediterranean coastal dunes are considered to be a center of floral and faunal speciation and a natural habitat for rare endemic plants, with an extremely sensitive area for alien species invasion. The soil free-living nematode communities are one of the most important groups of soil biota, constituting an essential trophic link between primary decomposers, such as the soil microflora, and larger animals. Despite the fact that soil free-living nematodes play an important role in fundamental ecological processes and are sensitive bio-indicators for understanding processes of succession and nutrient flow in different ecosystems, little is known about the impact of invasive plant species on the soil free-living nematode communities. The present study was designed to fill this gap and evaluate the invasive effect of Heterotheca subaxillaris on the soil free-living nematode communities inhabiting the Mediterranean coastal dunes. Soil samples were collected from the upper (0-10 cm) soil layer under H. subaxillaris (invasive perennial shrub) and Artemisia monosperma (native perennial shrub) at two different sites in the sea-sand ecosystem during the winter and summer seasons. Molecular analysis using the 18S rRNA gene for species determination, along with the traditional method, was a useful tool for evaluation of ecological conditions under the plant associations. The nematode communities, trophic diversity, and taxon composition were affected by the invasive plant at the study sites. Furthermore, this study showed that unfavorable seasonal conditions can also exacerbate the harmful effects of the invasive plants on nematode abundance and trophic and species diversity.

AB  - Coastal seagrass habitats are at risk from a range of anthropogenic activities that modify the natural light environment, including dredging activities associated with coastal and port developments. On Australia's east coast, the tropical seagrass Zostera muelleri ssp. capricorni dominates intertidal mudbanks in sheltered embayments which are also preferred locations for harbors and port facilities. Dredging to establish and maintain shipping channels in these areas can degrade water quality and diminish light conditions that are required for seagrass growth. Based on this potential conflict, we simulated in-situ light attenuation events to measure effects on Z. muelleri ssp. capricorni condition. Semi-annual in situ shading studies conducted over 3 years were used to quantify the impact of prolonged light reduction on seagrass morphometrics (biomass, percent cover, and shoot density). Experimental manipulations were complimented with an assessment of 46 months of light history and concurrent natural seagrass change at the study site in Gladstone Harbour. There was a clear light-dependent effect on seagrass morphometrics during seagrass growing seasons, but no effect during senescent periods. Significant seagrass declines occurred between 4 and 8 weeks after shading during the growing seasons with light maintained in the range of 4-5 mol photons m(-2) d(-1). Sensitivity to shading declined when applied in 2-week intervals (fortnightly) rather than continuous over the same period. Field observations were correlated to manipulative experiments to derive an applied threshold of 6 mol photons m(-2) d(-1) which formed the basis of a reactive light-based management strategy which has been successfully implemented to ensure positive ecological outcomes for seagrass during a large-scale dredging program.

AB  - Oil sands mining disturbs thousands of hectares of boreal landscape, about 65% of which is wetland. Its reclamation will constitute the largest wetland reclamation project in Canadian history. We developed a unified analytical framework that we used to set reclamation targets and evaluate reclamation progress using submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV). We sampled SAV in 38 minimally disturbed wetlands to establish a reference condition and compared this to SAV in 25 reclamation wetlands. We observed 26 taxa: all were native and five are regionally rare. Using a combination of ordination, clustering, and indicator species analysis, we identified seven SAV assemblages, distinguishable based on 10 indicator species. The assemblages found in wetlands contaminated by tailings had significantly fewer taxa. Using joint plots, we demonstrate that they differ in terms of environmental variables reflecting depth, slope, salinity, transparency, water and sediment nutrient levels, and alkalinity. Collectively, 74% of reference wetlands had SAV belonging to either marsh or fen-marsh assemblages that we consider suitable targets for reclamation. Having multiple reclamation targets avoids creating a homogenous post-mining landscape with low gamma diversity. Using complementary multivariate and categorical tests, we found that reclamation wetlands failed to support either of these dominant reference assemblages. Instead, every reclamation wetland supported one of five atypical SAV assemblages, each of which was uncommon (<10%) among reference wetlands. The analytical framework we developed can be applied to other ecosystems or taxa to develop targets for reclamation, to evaluate reclamation progress, and to identify environmental characteristics associated with reclamation targets.

AB  - Bryophytes and lichens are outstanding bioindicators, not only of the plant community in which they develop, but also the substrates on which they grow. Some epiphytic cryptogams, particularly the rare ones, are stenotopic and require a long habitat continuity, for example substrates such as old trees. It could also be a tea plantation, this is because the shrubs are not felled, and most of them may have several dozen years. In addition, the shrubs are not subject to sudden changes in microclimatic conditions as only the young leaves are harvested. As the importance of tea plantations as host plants for mosses and lichens has not yet been studied, the present study examines the species diversity of cryptogams of two tea plantations in Georgia (Caucasus). The study also examines the phytogeography, spatial pattern, environmental conditions and ecological indicators of the cryptogams. Thirty-nine cryptogam taxa were identified; typical forest taxa dominated, even in the absence of typical forest communities. Some of these species are obligatory epiphytes, rare or even critically endangered in most European countries (e.g., Orthotrichum stellatum, O. stramineum, Lewinskya striata). The fairly abundant record of such species on tea plantations indicates the importance of these phytocoenoses for the preservation of rare species, and indicates that these habitats are hot spots for these cryptogams in otherwise changed envirnonment. Additionally, as indicated the analysis of the species composition of individual plantations and the mathematical analysis made on this basis, plantations differ from each other. Another interesting result is also the spatial distributions of cryptogams on tea bushes resemble those of forest communities and lichens seems to be more sensitive than bryophytes to antropogenic changes of environment.

AB  - Salinity is extremely hazardous to agriculture worldwide and its expanding constantly. Soil of almost 100 countries facing salinity problem including Pakistan. Cyperus laevigatus also act as salinity indicator species is a naturally adapted halophyte dispersed in subtropical regions of world. Six populations of C. laevigatus were collected from different saline habitats to evaluate adaptations regarding anatomical and physiological characteristics. C. laevigatus is perfectly adapted to harsh environmental conditions like dry barren soils, saline lakes, hyper-saline wetlands and salt marshes. Ecological success of this species is due to plasticity in physiological and anatomical characteristics to adapt variable environmental conditions. C. laevigatus is a halophyte, exhibited increased biomass production in moderately saline habitat. Higher uptake of K+ occurs to compensate the uptake of Na+ion contents, a striking feature of salt tolerant and halophytic species. Accumulation of osmoprotectants like proline, free amino acids, soluble sugar and protein contribute significantly to osmotic adjustment. Stem thickness enhanced as salinity level of habitat increased to store water in parenchymatous tissues under physiological drought. Intensive sclerification in root cortex provide mechanical strength to plant as well as prevent the radial leakage of water. Well-developed aerenchyma, increased vascular bundle area, broader vessels, small and dense stomata are critical to cope with environmental hazards. Population of Jahlar lake showing maximum biomass production indicate that this species grows better in moderate salinities. Therefore, this species will prove very useful for revegetation of salt affected rangeland and prairies by direct growth of such halophytic ecotypes. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Background. Due to the lack of knowledge of the normal variation of the physicochemical and biological water parameters of Mexican coastal systems for classifying their trophic condition, some researchers have categorized these environments using norms, standards, or regulations created for environments of other climatic, geological, and social characteristics, different from those of Mexico; in fact, these values have even been compared with Mexican norms developed for urban or industrial wastewater discharged into rivers and coastal lagoons. The concentration ranges of different chemical elements, methodologies, units, and interpretations of other countries' regulations are not similar to the conditions of the coastal waters of tropical latitudes and, therefore, their results do not adequately reflect the reality of national coastal aquatic environments. Goals. Contribute to the knowledge of the normal spatioternporal ranges of physicochemical and biological parameters in lagoons, estuaries, marshes, and Mexican bays. Methods. We conducted an extensive search of information that allowed us to determine normal ranges of variation for the following parameters: oxygen, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a), which have ecological significance, and can even be considered by some as indicators of water quality. Results. We include the average, minimum, and maximum values of different variables of 72 coastal environments in Mexico based on studies carried out from 1968 to 2015.Conclusions. The analysis of the information showed that the intervals are the result of local environmental characteristics that are unique for each system. This information will be helpful in the analysis or diagnosis in future environmental studies, and will avoid the use of foreign standards based on different environmental and socioeconomic characteristics.

AB  - Great rivers of the central United States (Upper Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers) are valuable economic and cultural resources, yet until recently their ecological condition has not been well quantified. In 2004-2005, as part of the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program for Great River Ecosystems (EMAP-GRE), we measured legacy organochlorines (OCs) (pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs) and emerging compounds (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs) in whole fish to estimate human and wildlife exposure risks from fish consumption. PCBs, PBDEs. chlordane, dieldrin and dichlorocliphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were detected in most samples across all rivers, and hexachlorobenzene was detected in most Ohio River samples. Concentrations were highest in the Ohio River, followed by the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, respectively. Dieldrin and PCBs posed the greatest risk to humans. Their concentrations exceeded human screening values for cancer risk in 27-54% and 16-98% of river km, respectively. Chlordane exceeded wildlife risk values for kingfisher in 11-96% of river km. PBDE concentrations were highest in large fish in the Missouri and Ohio Rivers (mean>1000 ng g(-1) lipid), with congener 47 most prevalent. OC and PBDE concentrations were positively related to fish size, lipid content, trophic guild, and proximity to urban areas. Contamination of fishes by OCs is widespread among great rivers, although exposure risks appear to be more localized and limited in scope. As an indicator of ecological condition, fish tissue contamination contributes to the overall assessment of great river ecosystems in the U.S. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microbial source tracking (MST) has been extensively used to detect the sources of fecal pollution in water. The inclusion of MST in water management strategies improves the ecological status of the ecosystem and human and animal health under interdisciplinary analysis in all aspects of health care for humans, animals, and the environment (One Health approach). In this study, the performance of MST markers targeting host-specific Bacteroidales (HF183 and Rum-2-Bac) and Bifidobacterium species (HMBif and CWBif) were evaluated in raw sewage collected from human, ruminant, swine, and poultry sources in Tunisia, Cyprus, Ireland, and Spain. In addition, the ratio between somatic coliphages and bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides GA17 (SOMCPH/GA17PH) was measured in Tunisia and Spain. The obtained results showed variability of the bacterial markers between the four countries, suggesting that their usefulness could be affected by several conditions (dietary habits, agricultural practices, and climatic conditions) that differ between countries. The Rum-2-Bac marker stood out as a valid MST tool, particularly in Ireland, whereas CWBif was the best option in Tunisia, Spain, and Cyprus. The human-specific HMBif marker showed good sensitivity and specificity in Tunisia, Spain, and Ireland, whereas HF183 showed a low specificity. However, HF183 was suggested as a good human marker in Ireland and Cyprus because of its higher concentration than HMBif. Regarding viral markers, the ratio of SOMCPH/GA17PH showed a clear discrimination between human and nonhuman samples. The combined use of molecular bacterial markers and the ratio of SOMCPH/GA17PH may improve the success of MST.

AB  - Eutrophication plays a crucial role in coastal systems, driving changes in the composition and abundance of flora and fauna with consequent effects for the entire ecosystem. Sensitive to nutrient levels, micro- and macroalgal blooms serve as valuable indicators of eutrophication. The San Antonio Bay (Northern Argentinean Patagonia, 40A degrees 43' S, 64A degrees 56' W) provides an appropriate system to study in situ eutrophication processes on coastal communities. In a multi-scale approach, using two different kind of settlement substrates (micro: polyethylene terephthalate, and macro: ceramic), the present study followed benthic algal dynamics over one year, distinguishing changes in natural succession and seasonality. Strong differences were found in the biofilm assemblages after three days, marked by tube dwelling diatoms and Cocconeis spp. under high nutrient-grazer conditions and needle like diatoms (e.g. Nitzschia spp., Tabularia spp.) under lower nutrient-grazer loads. The succession continued by the colonization of macroalgae, with a higher recruitment rate in the nutrient and grazer rich environment with a concomitant higher diversity. Our results show that under higher nutrient-grazer conditions natural benthic succession not only differs in trajectory but in its final taxa composition promoting higher biodiversity and biomass accumulation. In addition, taxa specific substrate preferences interfere with the observed eutrophication pattern, suggesting substrate dependant interrelations between the bloom forming taxa. These findings provide evidence that nutrient enrichment can not only affect an established assemblage but also affect the early succession stages, changing the succession trajectory and thus the final assemblage.

AB  - Following the unprecedented oil drilling presently occurring in western North Dakota, thousands of kilometers of oil roads must be reclaimed to an acceptable post-extraction condition. This study assessed the soil biological and plant communities of nine decommissioned oil roads reclaimed during three periods between 1983 and 2002 in the Little Missouri National Grasslands of western North Dakota. We hypothesized that time-since-reclamation would positively affect soil biological and plant communities and, consequently, success of reclamation at older sites. To assess this hypothesis, we measured soil enzyme activity, soil microbial community composition, plant community composition, and soil physical and chemical properties along a gradient extending from road-center to adjacent native prairie for the nine roads. Time-since-reclamation did not affect soil and plant properties measured, indicating that older reclamations are not more similar to native prairie than reclamations occurring more recently. A strong gradient between samples from road-center and native prairie was identified with univariate and ordination analyses, indicating that soil and plant communities of reclaimed oil roads do not resemble those of the surrounding prairie. Soil organic matter (SOM) was identified as the most significantly affected soil property, being 30% lower on reclaimed roads than prairie. The relationship between SOM, microbial community, and plant community suggests that incorporating additional SOM could hasten reclamation as a result of improving the physical environment for plants and providing a labile carbon and energy source for the soil microbial community which, in turn, will enhance the nutrient and physical conditions for plant growth.

AB  - Human impacts on the natural environment have resulted in a steady decline in biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. A major policy and management challenge is to efficiently allocate limited resources for nature conservation to maximise biodiversity benefits. Spatial assessment and mapping of biodiversity value plays a vital role in identifying key areas for conservation and establishing conservation priorities. This study measured biodiversity value using readily available data and tools in order to identify conservation priority sites in a heavily modified and fragmented production landscape. The study also assessed trade-offs among biodiversity and other ecosystem services. We used spatial tools for assessing and mapping biodiversity such as Patch Analyst in ArcGIS 10.2 to assess landscape alteration states, and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs to identify habitat quality. Results indicated that areas of high biodiversity conservation value were concentrated in less modified land-cover types. Substantially modified land-cover types (generally associated with agriculture and irrigated pastures) had lower habitat quality and biodiversity value. The analysis revealed that assessments based solely on habitat condition may not be the most suitable basis for conservation planning because this does not include associated adjacent land uses, roads or-other threats to biodiversity. Spatially targeted environmental plantings and less intensive agroforestry that reconnect native remnants in heavily fragmented landscapes can provide significant potential conservation outcomes. Planned landscape reconfiguration based on readily available spatial data can yield net positive benefits to biodiversity by halting degradation of remnant native vegetation and increasing total habitat area.

AB  - The association between objective water quality indicators and subjective assessments by visitors to the waterfronts was evaluated and used to identify the most important factors for public perception of urban waters. The smell and turbidity, naturalness of the banks, and overall aesthetic quality of six standing and six running waters in Vienna (Austria) were assessed based on 540 interviews with visitors in summer 2000. These assessments were related to 5 personal parameters of the interviewees, 3 parameters of the actual weather conditions, and 20 objective, water-related parameters. Non-arametric statistics suggested that the subjective assessments improved with the improvement of most measured water quality indicators. The exceptions probably reflected hydrobiological effects of the comparatively hot weather during the sampling period, and partly also the preference of the interviewees for scenic beauty and comfortable bathing conditions. The assessments were also clearly influenced by personal and meteorological factors. Categorical regression analysis suggested that increasing values of the following physicochemical and microbiological indicators, in order of decreasing importance, negatively impacted public perception: ammonium levels, counts of Escherichia coli, suspended inorganic solid levels, electric conductivity, and chlorophyll-a levels. No clear relations were found for indicators with potential positive impact, such as oxygen content and water temperature. Among the hydromorphological factors, increasing water body width (cf. scenic beauty) and presence of bank vegetation showed the strongest positive effects on public perception, whereas negative effects were noted only for artificial bank modification. The implications of these findings for water management are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The floristic quality assessment index (FQAI) is an evaluation procedure that uses measures of ecological conservatism (expressed numerically as a coefficient of conservatism or C value) and richness of the native plant community to derive a score (I) that is an estimate of habitat quality. We evaluated the ability of the FQAI to indicate the level of anthropogenic disturbance in headwater wetlands in the Ridge and Valley physiographic province of central Pennsylvania. I scores were highly correlated with disturbance, with scores generally decreasing with increasing levels of disturbance. However, we found that I did not equally characterize sites with differing species richness. I scores were higher for sites with greater intrinsic native species, regardless of other influences on floristic quality. To eliminate sensitivity to species richness, we evaluated sites using mean conservatism values ((C) over bar) and a variant of the I score (adjusted FQAI, hereafter cited as I') that considered both the contribution of non-native species and the intrinsic low species richness of high quality forested wetlands. (C) over bar values were more highly correlated with disturbance than I scores; however, site assessments based on (C) over bar values alone were misleading. I' scores were also more highly correlated with disturbance than I scores and were robust to differences in native species richness. Therefore, we offer I' as an improved formulation of the index that, in addition to serving as a useful condition assessment tool, addresses two problematic issues that have plagued the FQAI since its conception: the overwhelming influence of the species richness multiplier and the role of non-native species in floristic assessment.

AB  - In order to balance pressures for land-use development with protection of wetland resources, artificial wetlands have been constructed in an effort to replace lost ecosystems. Despite its regulatory appeal and prominent role in current mitigation strategies, it is unclear whether or not created systems actually compensate for lost wetland resources. Mitigation predictions that rely on artificial wetlands must be analyzed critically in terms of their efficacy. Destruction of wetlands due to burial by coal fly ash at a municipal landfill in Danvers, Massachusetts, USA, provided an opportunity to compare resulting growth of created cattail (Typha) marshes with natural wetland areas. Once the appropriate cattail species was identified for growth under disturbed landfill conditions, two types of artificial wetlands were constructed. The two systems differed in their hydrologic attributes: while one had a surface water flow characteristic of most cattail wetlands, the second system mimicked soil and water conditions found in naturally occurring floating cattail marshes. Comparison of plant growth measurements for two years from the artificial systems with published values for natural cattail marshes revealed similar structure and growth patterns. Experiments are now in progress to investigate the ability of created cattail marshes to remove and accumulate heavy metals from polluted landfill leachate. Research of the type reported here must be pursued aggressively in order to document the performance of artificial wetlands in terms of plant structure and wetland functions. Such research should allow us to start to evaluate whether artificial systems actually compensate for lost wetlands by performing similar functions and providing the concomitant public benefits.

AB  - A systematic research of biological and ecological characteristics of the overall Hober area and Hober forest park itself has not been performed thus far. Structural characteristics of the stand were included only in The Management Plan for Hober Forest Park (2006-2015). Forestry issues were addressed in the paper by Vojinovic (1997). Dendrological research was included in the papers by Denich and Draganovic (1985), Vojinovic (1997), Fabris (2001) and Onofri (2002). Its overall inventory records are missing.
   The current condition of Hober forest park is characterised by its neglect and no landscape design in terms of both forest vegetation, dendrological, horticultural and garden and architectural content. Moreover, there is conceptual indefiniteness of the overall Hober area.
   Hober forest park in terms of vegetation belongs to the forest community of the Aleppo pine and I oak (Querco ilicis - Pinetum halepensis Loisel 1971). It is primarily due to vegetative and structural unevenness that 7 experimental surfaces were placed in the forest park itself and 4 more outside of it. A comprehensive vegetation and structural analysis was intended for the selection of individual areas, in order to provide their description and present their condition, which can subsequently be used for the purpose of zoning the area.
   According to the analysed research the Aleppo pine prevails in the layer of trees on the surfaces 1, 2, 3 and 9; flolm oak on the surfaces 4 and 5 and Common cypress on the surfaces 6 and 7. Laurestine is the most common species in the shrub layer, which appears on all the surfaces. Then there are green olive trees with broad leaves and mastic trees. The tree layer prevails with the exception of the surfaces 8, 10 and 11 where there is maquis. It is evident that in developed stands the tree layer and the shrub layer are almost equally dense. The latter is not the case on the surface 6, partially on the surface 9 and the surface 10 where maquis prevails and the surface 11, which is a natural succession of forest vegetation on abandoned agricultural surfaces. With the exception of maquis, there is a very high wood volume which, depending on stand development, ranges from 100 to even 270 m(3)/ha. The number of trees is also very large and it ranges from 1,000 to 2,700 per hectare. All this data indicates no landscape design and absence of any silvicultural work.
   The objective of this paper is to explore vegetative, dendrological, silvicultural and structural characteristics of the overall Hober area. They are the primary indicators of the condition and will provide the guidelines for its future biological and spatial valorisation.

AB  - There is a global lack of knowledge on tropical ecotoxicology, particularly in terms of mangrove areas. These areas often serve as nurseries or homes for several animal species, including Ucides cordatus (the uca crab). This species is widely distributed, is part of the diet of human coastal communities, and is considered to be a sentinel species due to its sensitivity to toxic xenobiotics in natural environments. Sublethal damages to benthic populations reveal pre-pathological conditions, but discussions of the implications are scarce in the literature. In Brazil, the state of Sao Paulo offers an interesting scenario for ecotoxicology and population studies: it is easy to distinguish between mangroves that are well preserved and those which are significantly impacted by human activity. The objectives of this study were to provide the normal baseline values for the frequency of Micronucleated cells (MN parts per thousand) and for neutral red retention time (NRRT) in U. cordatus at pristine locations, as well to indicate the conservation status of different mangrove areas using a multi-level biological response approach in which these biomarkers and population indicators (condition factor and crab density) are applied in relation to environmental quality indicators (determined via information in the literature and solid waste volume). A mangrove area with no effects of impact (areas of reference or pristine areas) presented a mean value of MN parts per thousand < 3 and NRRT > 120 min, values which were assumed as baseline values representing genetic and physiological normality. A significant correlation was found between NRRT and MN, with both showing similar and effective results for distinguishing between different mangrove areas according to conservation status. Furthermore, crab density was lower in more impacted mangrove areas, a finding which also reflects the effects of sublethal damage; this finding was not determined by condition factor measurements. Multi-level biological responses were able to reflect the conservation status of the mangrove areas studied using information on guideline values of MN parts per thousand, NRRT, and density of the uca crab in order to categorize three levels of human impacts in mangrove areas: PNI (probable null impact); PLI (probable low impact); and PHI (probable high impact). Results confirm the success of U. cordatus species' multilevel biological responses in diagnosing threats to mangrove areas. Therefore, this species represents an effective tool in studies on mangrove conservation statuses in the Western Atlantic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental preferences of invertebrates in larger rivers are assumed to be displayed in their upstream-downstream distribution and in their abundance. Near the limits of a species' distribution, individuals must cope with rather hostile, energy consuming, environmental conditions. On the contrary, it is assumed that sites with high abundance are located more in the center of the distribution area and represent more optimal conditions. We hypothesized that at these sites also the fitness of the animals is better, which should be reflected by higher amounts of storage substrates. We measured the abundance and the energy storage (triglyceride and glycogen contents) of the mayfly Heptagenia flava (Ephemeroptera: Heptageniidae), the leech Glossiphonia complanata (Hirudinea: Glossiphoniidae), and the freshwater shrimp Dikerogammarus villosus (Crustacea: Gammaridae) along 560 km of the River Elbe during the summers of 2003 and 2004. H. flava and G. complanata reached highest densities upstream while D. villosus abundance increased continuously towards the river mouth. A model selection approach revealed that the factor sampling site was necessary to explain the data of energy storage for each species. In H. flava, triglycerides, the most efficient storage substrate, were observed to reach maximum levels at sites with high abundances. Although D. villosus and G. complanata followed a similar relation, both species displayed some exceptions from this pattern with highest triglyceride concentrations at their upstream distribution limit. It is speculated that storage substrates have the potential to become an important tool in environmental assessment because they yield long-term information about the fitness of a population, especially in merolimnic species, e.g. mayflies. As adult mayflies do not feed, the amount of accumulated energy reserves during the larval life is crucial for their reproductive success and therefore is a very good indicator for the assessment of a population's fitness.
   It is further assumed that the fitness of the other two species does not depend on the energetic status of a certain juvenile stage. Their storages can be refilled at any time, if enough food is available. Nevertheless, storage substrates as well as the total amount of available energy therein are appropriate criteria for the physiological fitness of both species. They result from long-term effects of the surrounding conditions, but may also reflect creeping changes in the environment, e.g. consequences of rising temperatures. Therefore, the use of those criteria as an assessment tool for the physiological fitness of invertebrate populations seems to be very promising. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystem service flow dynamics which establish the linkage between human and nature is essential in an ecosystem service assessment. This study constructed an ecosystem service flow model of freshwater flow then utilized it to assess the water-related ecosystem services in northeast China. We included the provision, consumption, and spatial flow of freshwater services in an index to assess the water security condition and quantified the services trans-boundary flow from the northeast forest belt (NFB) in northeast China. Our results showed that large areas (50.54%, 55.10% and 52.90%, respectively) of northeast China received upstream freshwater service in three years. The water security condition of northeast China deteriorated from 2005 to 2015 with the change of water security index considering water flow (WSIflow), mainly influenced by precipitation and agriculture water consumption. Approximately 4.16 billion m3 of freshwater service were delivered from NFB to surrounding regions demonstrating the importance of NFB in terms of ecosystem service provision. In addition, 73 key watersheds (4.71% of total area) within NFB that significantly affect the trans-boundary flow were further identified. We suggested that local government should advocate develop water-saving agriculture and livestock water quotas. Moreover, priorities should be given to protect the key watersheds within NFB in order to maintain the supply of freshwater service. This study provided a framework for exploring suitable strategies for managing water resources and laid a foundation for promoting the ecological compensation in the future.

AB  - Provisioning ecosystem services play a vital role in sustaining human well-being. Agro-ecosystems contribute a significant share of these services, besides food and fodder and also fuel and fibre as well as regulating and cultural ecosystem services. Until now, the indication of provisioning ecosystem services of agro-ecosystems has been based almost only on yield numbers of agricultural products. Such an indication is problematic due to several reasons which include a disregard of the role of significant anthropogenic contributions to ecosystem service co-generation, external environmental effects and strong dependence on site conditions. We argue for an enhanced indication of provisioning ecosystem services that considers multiple aspects of their delivery. The conceptual base for such an indication has been made by prior publications which have been reviewed. Relevant points were taken up in this article and condensed into a conceptual model in order to develop a more holistic and expanded set of indictors, which was then exemplarily applied and tested in three case studies in Germany. The case studies represent different natural conditions, and the indicator set application showed that ecosystem services (ES) flow-in terms of output alone-does not characterise agro-ecosystems sufficiently. The proposed aspects of provisioning ecosystem services can give a fuller picture, for example, by input-output relationships, as it is possible by just using single indicators. Uncertainties as well as pros and cons of such an approach are elaborated. Finally, recommendations for an enhanced indication of provisioning ecosystem services in agro-ecosystems that can help to integrate agricultural principles with ideas of sustainability and site-specific land use are derived.

AB  - As a result of the unique geographical characteristics, pastoral lifestyle, and economic conditions in Mongolia, its fragile natural ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change and human activities. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was employed in this study as an indicator of the growth status of vegetation. The Sen's slope, Mann-Kendall test, and geographical detector modelling methods were used to assess the spatial and temporal changes of the NDVI in response to variations in natural conditions and human activities in Mongolia from 1982 to 2015. The corresponding individual and interactive driving forces, and the optimal range for the maximum NDVI value of vegetation distribution were also quantified. The area in which vegetation was degraded was roughly equal to the area of increase, but different vegetation types behaved differently. The desert steppe and the Gobi Desert both in arid regions have degraded significantly, whereas the meadow steppe and alpine steppe showed a significant upward trend. Precipitation can satisfactorily account for vegetation distribution. Changes of livestock quantity was the dominant factor influencing the changes of most vegetation types. The interactions of topographic factors and climate factors have significant effects on vegetation growth. In the region of annual precipitation between 331 mm and 596 mm, forest vegetation type and pine sandy soil type were found to be most suitable for the growth of vegetation in Mongolia. The findings of this study can help us to understand the appropriate range or type of environmental factors affecting vegetation growth in Mongolia, based on which we can apply appropriate interventions to effectively mitigate the impact of environmental changes on vegetation.

AB  - Marine management plans over the world express high expectations to the development of offshore wind energy. This would obviously contribute to renewable energy production, but potential conflicts with other usages of the marine landscape, as well as conservation interests, are evident. The present study synthesizes the current state of understanding on the effects of offshore wind farms on marine wildlife, in order to identify general versus local conclusions in published studies. The results were translated into a generalized impact assessment for coastal waters in Sweden, which covers a range of salinity conditions from marine to nearly fresh waters. Hence, the conclusions are potentially applicable to marine planning situations in various aquatic ecosystems. The assessment considered impact with respect to temporal and spatial extent of the pressure, effect within each ecosystem component, and level of certainty. Research on the environmental effects of offshore wind farms has gone through a rapid maturation and learning process, with the bulk of knowledge being developed within the past ten years. The studies showed a high level of consensus with respect to the construction phase, indicating that potential impacts on marine life should be carefully considered in marine spatial planning. Potential impacts during the operational phase were more locally variable, and could be either negative or positive depending on biological conditions as well as prevailing management goals. There was paucity in studies on cumulative impacts and long-term effects on the food web, as well as on combined effects with other human activities, such as the fisheries. These aspects remain key open issues for a sustainable marine spatial planning.

AB  - In this paper a three-step procedure is proposed to deal with ecological data, usually very complex in their treatment. The three steps - exploratory, confirmatory, and modelling phases - reflect the different methodological approaches necessary in each phase of the study. To illustrate the methodology, a case study is proposed, concerning the suitability of plants as pollution bioindicators. Samples of differently aged Pinus pinea L. needles were collected throughout 1 year in three different locations, whose human disturbance was known to be different. In the samples some morphological and functional parameters were measured, whose relation with the stress was already known. The exploratory analysis suggested pollution with human origin, the needle's age, and the environmental conditions as the main factors of influence of damage. The confirmatory analysis confirmed both site and age as main factors and occasionally the sampling date. On this basis, some models were estimated separately for each site: models that best described the damage as function of age resulted non-linear and some of them with seasonal fluctuations. As a result, whereas the models described well enough the pollution temporal variation, the difference of pollution in the sites was best described by the different values of the models parameters in the different sites. In short, different pollution conditions are described better by the damage trend than by the individual measures. The three-step procedure resulted of high utility in outlining the most interesting relations to investigate through the modelling, the opportunity to model the indicators variation along time separately for each site, and to introduce the seasonal variation in some models.

AB  - Soil nematodes are involved in nutrient cycles through feeding on microorganisms, and the extent of their functioning is affected by subtle environmental changes and by biological interactions. Considering these features, soil nematodes can serve as bio-indicators reflecting environmental changes in a given ecosystem. However, the mechanism of shaping community structures of nematodes is not well understood due to the complex biological interactions in forest ecosystems. The aim of this study was to clarify the nematode communities and their determinant factors in both coastal and inland Pinus thunbergii forests of central Japan under contrasting environmental conditions. For this purpose, nematodes retrieved from soil samples were morphologically identified at generic levels and discriminated into trophic groups. We also determined whether nematode community structures varied with coastal or inland locations based on non-metric multidimensional scaling. Our results showed that generic richness of nematode at inland habitats (16.2 +/- 0.7, mean +/- SE) was significantly greater than that at coastal habitats (12.4 +/- 0.4). Moreover, the non-metric multidimensional scaling scatter-plot showed nematode communities clustered significantly within their respective coastal and inland habitats. These clusterings were further significantly influenced by surrounding environmental factors; soil water content, soil temperature, litter layer thickness, pH, total both N and C concentrations and C:N ratio. For characteristic trophic groups, microbial-feeding nematodes were represented in coastal forests while predaceous ones were dominated in inland forests. Our study provided fundamental knowledge on the formation of nematode community structures that were shaped by environmental filtering.

AB  - Proper assessment of environmental resistance of animals is critical for the ability of researchers to understand how variation in environmental conditions influence population and species abundance. This is also the case for studies of upper thermal limits in insects, where researchers studying animals under laboratory conditions must select appropriate methodology on which conclusions can be drawn. Ideally these methods should precisely estimate the trait of interest and also be biological meaningful. In an attempt to develop such tests it has been proposed that thermal ramping assays are useful assays for small insects because they incorporate an ecologically relevant gradual temperature change. However, recent model-based papers have suggested that estimates of thermal resistance may be strongly confounded by simultaneous starvation and dehydration stress. In the present study we empirically test these model predictions using two sets of independent experiments. We clearly demonstrate that results from ramping assays of small insects (Drosophila melanogaster) are not compromised by starvation-or dehydration-stress. Firstly we show that the mild disturbance of water and energy balance of D. melanogaster experienced during the ramping tests does not confound heat tolerance estimates. Secondly we show that flies pre-exposed to starvation and dehydration have "normal" heat tolerance and that resistance to heat stress is independent of the energetic and water status of the flies. On the basis of our results we discuss the assumptions used in recent model papers and present arguments as to why the ramping assay is both a valid and ecologically relevant way to measure thermal resistance in insects.

AB  - Our investigation on macrophytes in Lake Qattieneh, a large, shallow reservoir in western Syria, is a first assessment of ecological status of this lake. We studied spatial distribution patterns of aquatic macrophyte vegetation and heavy metal concentrations to determine if they can be used as indicators of point sources of pollution. Industrial and municipal point sources at the lake shore increase nutrient load and contamination by heavy metals. Water analyses revealed high concentrations of some heavy metals at some littoral sites: Ni 88.7 mu g L-1, Cr 49.99 mu g L-1, Co 14.38 mu g L-1, and Cu 11.65 mu g L-1. Despite hypertrophic conditions and high heavy metal contamination, we recorded several submerged macrophyte species with heterogeneous spatial distribution patterns. Whereas Potamogeton pectinatus L. dominates in the eastern part of the lake, near industrial point sources, both Myriophyllum spicatum L. and Potamogeton lucens L. form extended patches in the western part of the take. The shallow, littoral areas near villages are dominated by Ranunculus trichophyllus Chaix in Villars and Ceratophyllum demersum L. The west-east gradient in nutrient and heavy metal concentrations in waters and sediments are reflected by the spatial distribution of submersed species. While the heavy metal concentrations of the water body vary considerably in different seasons, the contents in submersed macrophytes integrate seasonal variations of longer time periods. Spatial distribution and tissue accumulation of littoral macrophyte species reflect the environmental conditions at respective sites such as heavy metal contents in water and sediment.

AB  - Assessment of the distribution and diversity of free-living protists is currently hampered by a limited taxonomic resolution of major phyla and by neglecting the significance of spatial and temporal scaling for speciation. There is a tremendous physiological and ecological diversity that is hidden at the morphological level and not apparent at the level of conserved genes. A conceptual framework linking the various levels of diversity is lacking. Neutral genetic markers are useful indicators of population structure and gene flow between populations, but do not explain adaptation to local habitat conditions. The correspondence between protein-coding genes, ecophysiological performance, and fitness needs to be explored under natural conditions. The area and the associated typical temporal dimension of active cells (their 'home range') are much smaller, respectively shorter, than the area and time period potentially covered during passive dispersal of protist resting stages. The assumptions that dispersal rates are generally high in free-living protists and that extinction of local populations is, therefore, infinitesimally small wait rigorous testing. Gene flow may be uncoupled largely from dispersal, because local adaptation and numerical effects of residents may strongly reduce or even prevent successful invasion (immigration). The significance of clonal selection depends on the as yet unknown frequency and timing of sexual reproduction, and on the stability of the environment. The extent of local adaptation and the fitness-related ecophysiological divergence are critical for the speciation process and, hence, for defining protist species.

AB  - Despite wide ranging interpretations of the concept of sustainable development there is growing consensus about the ecological, social, and economic conditions necessary to foster a sustainability transition. In addition to quantitative assessments of sustainability indicators, qualitative process indicators are being identified. For example, active, democratic, and inclusive decision-making are shown to lead to more informed decisions and, presumably, more sustainable use systems. The creation of these conditions, however, often requires bridging lack of mutual trust and scientific uncertainty. And while the ideals of sustainable development suggest that all stakeholders get what they want, without compromise nothing approaching sustainable development is attainable. Obstructing compromise, environmental ideology represents a key remaining hurdle to achieving a middle ground in environment and development debates. In the 1990s, the US-based Trillium Corporation sought to implement a large-scale logging project in Tierra del Fuego, Chile, but was rebuffed by environmentalists who embraced ecotourism as the preferred development option. The case is analyzed in the context of calls to reconsider conceptually nature-society relationships and ideas in sustainability science about which land management systems best match sustainability goals. Findings show that the decision-making process for determining whether or not to implement the logging project was flawed. We explore two implications. First, achieving sustainable development requires a consensus view of nature-society relationships that embraces humanized landscapes. Second, inclusive and effective decision-making about sustainable development necessitates free and open exchange of information, collective learning about regional environment and development, and the identification of compromise positions.

AB  - The application of the Mussel Watch concept to the assessment of chemical contamination in the coastal environment is still premature, since the relationship between the physiological and ecological aspects of blue mussels and the accumulation of contaminants in their soft tissues remains unclear. We cannot yet directly estimate with known confidence the degree of chemical contamination from the levels of contaminants in the soft tissues of mussels. An understanding of the source and range of variability in the tissue concentrations of contaminants is essential, and the establishment of a biomonitoring sampling strategy to minimize the effect of identified sources of variability is required. The present study was conducted to clarify the characteristics of organotin accumulation in blue mussels under various conditions in Tokyo Bay, and to establish an optimized sampling strategy of mussels as exposure indicators of organotin contamination in Japan. It was clear that the sample number, individual size, spawning activity and vertical habitat were factors causing a variation of tissue concentration. Based on a quantitative estimation of the variability of organotin concentration in mussel tissues under various physiological and natural conditions, we suggest that a composite sample of 30 mussels (3-5 cm in shell length), collected from the infralittoral zone prior to their spawning season, is essential to reduce the variability between individuals and to obtain reproducible analytical values at a sampling site. For monitoring sites where natural blue mussels cannot be collected, an alternative method of transplanting blue mussels from a relatively clean area would be required.

AB  - Cavities are important, natural components of forest ecosystems, conditioning the high level of biodiversity. They are formed either as a result of a natural process of wood decay caused by fungi or as excavations made by woodpeckers Picidae. Distribution and density of cavity trees are regionally diversified and dependent on species composition and age of the stands as well as the management way. In the global scale, decay cavities are much more numerous than those created by woodpeckers. Natural cavities dominated in deciduous forests, whilst woodpeckers-made ones - in coniferous stands. The density of cavities increases along the age gradient due to the growing size of trees and their worse health condition. Cavities in natural forests are more numerous than in commercial, managed ones. This is caused by the removal during the thinning of trees reduced in health, attacked by insects, fungi or mechanically damaged, which are potential places for the creation of cavities. The other reason is a too low age of the final cutting. Moreover, in the managed forest, cavity trees are often removed during sanitary cuttings, although leaving them is recommended. In European forests, the density of cavities is from less than 1 to almost 100 per ha. Natural cavities dominated in most of the studied plots. In Poland, their density varied from less than 1 to 16 per ha. Cavities are habitats and breeding sites of many specialized species of animals from invertebrates to mammals, fungi, and plants. In Poland, cavities are used by about 40 bird species, about 20 mammal species, as well as several hundred species of insects. According to the Polish forestry regulations, trees with cavities should be left to natural destruction, but there are no detail recommendations how to search for such trees and what is their required density. The recommendation to leave cavity trees will not contribute to the increase in their number in managed forests, unless one provides wider availability of adequately large trees with a reduced condition. In Polish forests, actions should be taken to increase the number of potential trees, in which cavities may be formed. They should be designed at the stage of tending for young stands. The minimal density of cavities in managed forests should be in the range of 1-3 per ha in coniferous and mixed forests up to 100 years old and above 3-4 per ha in stands older than 100 years, while in deciduous forests these values should equal to 2-5 per ha and 4-6 per ha in younger and older stands respectively.

AB  - Land use changes usually lead to the deterioration of freshwater ecosystems and reduced biodiversity. Aquatic organisms are considered valuable indicators for reflecting the conditions of freshwater ecosystems. Understanding the relationship between organisms and land use type, as well as physiochemical conditions, is beneficial for the management, monitoring and restoration of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, fish, macroinvertebrates, and diatoms were investigated at 60 sampling sites in the Wei River basin from October 2012 to April 2013 to determine the relationships between the environment and aquatic organisms. The richness, abundance, Shannon diversity, evenness, Margalef diversity, and Simpson diversity were selected as biological indices for analyzing the correlation between these communities and environmental variables according to Pearson's coefficient. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to analyze the relationship between the biotic communities and environmental variables. The results showed that three diatom indices were weakly correlated with chemical oxygen demand (COD), qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QH), and dissolved oxygen (DO). Four macroinvertebrate indices were associated with total phosphorus (TP) while total nitrogen (TN), and agricultural land (AL) had a significant influence on assemblages, suggesting that macroinvertebrates could respond to nutrient levels in the Wei River basin. All land use types had a strong effect on fish indices except AL, indicating that fish would be better used as indicators of spatial changes in the aquatic ecosystem. In conclusion, fish and macroinvertebrates have the potential for use in routine monitoring programs in the Wei River basin.

AB  - Freshwater communities are threatened worldwide, with pesticides being one of the main stressors for vulnerable invertebrates. Whereas the effects of pesticides on communities can be quantified by trait-based bioindicators such as SPEAR(pesticides), single species responses remain largely unknown.
   We used the bioindicator SPEAR(pesticides) to predict the toxic pressure from pesticides in 6942 macroinvertebrate samples from 4147 sites during the period 2004 to 2013, obtained by environmental authorities in Germany, and classified all samples according to their magnitude of pesticide pressure. Along this gradient of pesticide pressure, we quantified the occurrence of 139 macroinvertebrate species.
   We identified 71 species characterized by decreasing occurrence with increasing pesticide pressure. These decreasing species, mainly insects, occurred at a frequency of 19.7% at sites with reference conditions and decreased to 1.7% at sites with the highest pesticide pressure. We further determined 55 nonspecific species with no strong response as well as 13 increasing species, mainly Gastropoda, Oligochaeta and Diptera, which showed an increase of frequency from 1.8% at sites with reference conditions to 11.4% at sites with the highest pesticide pressure. Based on the change in frequency we determined the pesticide vulnerability of single species, expressed as Pesticide Associated Response (PARe). Furthermore, a trait analysis revealed that species occurrence may additionally depend on oxygen demand and, to a lesser extent on substrate preference, whereas no significant effect of feeding and respiration type could be found.
   Our results provide the first extensive pesticide vulnerability ranking for single macroinvertebrate species based on empirical large-scale field data.

AB  - Plants in cities must cope with various anthropogenic environments that differ from surrounding landscapes. Moreover, the differences in biotic and abiotic conditions among these habitats filter species with suitable traits and niche requirements. Here we aim to identify those attributes that promote species occurrence across and within urban habitat types of large cities. Species composition of spontaneously occurring vascular plant species was recorded in 1-ha plots in seven different urban habitat types in each of 32 European cities. Each species was characterized in terms of dispersal type, growth form, height, seed bank longevity, seed mass, selected leaf traits and ecological indicators including Ellenberg indicator values, Grime's life strategies, and immigration pathways using information from available speciestrait databases. For each species, total frequency of occurrence across all plots and habitat frequency of occurrence across plots of given habitat types were calculated and regression trees were used to relate them to traits and ecological indicators. The most frequently occurring species in the cities tended to be human-dispersed, nutrient-demanding plants that prefer drier to mesic soil conditions. These species do not possess the S-strategy and usually produce seeds of low mass forming short-term persistent seed banks. Habitat-specific responses were also revealed, indicating the effects of between-and within-habitat heterogeneity on trends in species performance in cities. Such patterns can be overlooked when differences in species occurrences in particular urban habitat types are not considered; thus, habitat-specific responses can resolve inconsistencies found when whole urban floras are analysed as a whole.

AB  - In the Lower Athabasca region of Alberta (Canada), surface mining for bitumen from oil sands creates highly disturbed environments, which need to be restored, after mine closing, to equivalent land capability in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services. We demonstrate a method to characterize ecosystem diversity and conditions using biophysical indicators of the Lower Athabasca meant for informing land reclamation planning and monitoring by identifying and creating a typology of the main assemblages of topography, soil and forest vegetation at the watershed, landform and ecosite scales, and analysing the relationships among land units of various scales. Our results showed that watersheds could be classified into distinct groups with specific features, even for a region with a generally flat or gently rolling topography, with slope, surficial deposits and aspect as key drivers of differences. Despite the subtle topography, the moisture regime, which is linked to large-scale cycles that are dependent on the surrounding matrix, was of primary importance for driving vegetation assemblages. There was no unique and homogeneous association between topography and vegetation; the specific landforms each displayed a range of ecosites, and the same ecosites were found in different landforms. This suggests that landscapes cannot be defined in a qualitative manner but rather with quantitative indicators that express the proportion occupied by each class of ecological units within the coarser units, therefore requiring during land reclamation that sufficient care is given to create heterogeneity within a given landform in terms of soil texture and drainage so that a mosaic of ecosite conditions is created.

AB  - We explored the relationship of aquatic midge assemblages with physicochemical and biological environmental gradients to assess which variables may govern the distribution of midge larvae in 47 shallow, polymictic lakes across New Jersey and New York State (NJ/NY) in the United States of America. Subfossil taxa collected from surficial sediments (0-1cm sediment depth), comprising 50 taxa from 47 lakes, were analysed in conjunction with environmental variables using multivariate statistical techniques. Alkalinity, maximum depth, surface area, total phosphorus and pH were identified as significant and ecologically relevant variables that explained the most variation in the midge assemblage across NJ/NY. Lake trophic state was the main driver for midge distributions in NJ/NY lakes. Biological gradients, such as per cent macrophyte cover or algal productivity (as chlorophyll a concentration), did not explain a significant portion of the variation in midge community composition. The addition of chaoborid larvae to ordinations strengthened the relationship between midge community structure and bottom oxygen concentration in NJ/NY lakes. Our results confirm that complex species-environment relationships in shallow, polymictic lakes create challenges for assessing midge assemblages along a particular environmental gradient, independently of other environmental conditions. However, it may still be possible to develop palaeolimnological inference models using midge remains to assess general historical patterns of disturbance for NJ/NY and other polymictic lakes, provided it is understood that midge-based inferences integrate some covariation in changes along several environmental gradients.

AB  - Faunal mediated particle and porewater mixing (bioturbation) alters the structure of the surface sediment layer, forming a distinct mixed layer, where the majority of organic matter degradation takes place. Current methods of assessing benthic habitat quality often reference this mixed layer as an indicator of benthic activity. Whilst a great deal of effort has been devoted to linking macro-invertebrate activity to the mixing depth, less attention has been given to defining what the mixing depth represents in terms of ecosystem process and function. Here, in situ sediment profile images are analysed using grey scale intensity analysis to distinguish the mixed zone and relate it to the physicochemical environment in order to determine the biological, chemical and physical variables most influential in its formation. Significant differences were found between biogeochemical conditions within the mixed layer relative to the underlying historic sediment layer. These were attributed to a combination of environmental variables (Fe, Mn, Si, chlorophyll a and NO3-) rather than a single dominant driver of change. Although these findings are consistent across multiple locations, the driver(s) that influence the depth of the mixed layer are site- and season-specific. The mixing depth thus provides a reasonable approximation of benthic ecosystem functioning, but when considering ecosystem process the link between the mixing depth and its driving factors (faunal mixing, food input, environmental conditions) is highly context-dependent. Conclusions on benthic community dynamics and ecosystem process, including assessments of habitat quality, cannot therefore be drawn from estimates of the mixing depth alone.

AB  - Hydrothermal vents are extreme deep-sea habitats that, due to their singular features, still intrigue scientific communities. Swift growth rates and profuse biomass of biological communities can be observed, despite of their inherently unstable physical-chemical and toxic conditions, indicating that organisms inhabiting this environment must be well adapted to these inhospitable conditions. The caridean shrimp, Chorocaris chacei, Mirocaris fortunata and Rimicaris exoculata, together with bathymodiolid mussels, dominate the vent fauna along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Crustacean species are widely used as biological indicators of environmental alterations, since they play a key ecological role as planktivorous grazers, epibenthic scavengers or as prey species. The biological consequences of the hydrothermal metal-rich environment in shrimp species are still largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was the determination of the metal levels (Ag, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn), metallothioneins (MT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in shrimp species collected in Rainbow, Lucky Strike and Menez-Gwen vent sites, in order to evaluate their different adaptation strategies toward metals when compared with two common coastal shrimp species (Palaemon elegans and Palaemonetes varians) from a fairly unpolluted estuarine system in south Portugal (Ria Formosa). Results show significant differences in metal concentrations, MT levels and lipid peroxidation between vent and coastal shrimp and also between shrimp species from the same site. This indicates that biochemical responses in both vent and coastal shrimp are affected not only by the environmental characteristics but also by inter-specific differences. Nevertheless, these responses apparently grant a successful adaptation for the survival in a metal-extreme environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mitigation of adverse effects of channel incision and the loss of alluvial bed substrate on the ecosystems of mountain watercourses downstream from check dams requires effective sediment entrapment in the incised channels. We examined changes in the ecosystem of mountainous Krzczon ' owka Stream, Polish Carpathians, resulting from lowering of a high check dam and installation of several block ramps in the downstream reach. Physical habitats, benthic macroinvertebrates and fish were examined in 10 cross-sections downstream from the dam over 5 years of the restoration project. Halfway into the restoration project, sediments flushed out by a flood from the reservoir of the lowered check dam were entrapped by block ramps, re-establishing alluvial bed substrate in the incised channel. Increases in bed elevation, bankfull channel width and near-bed flow velocity and a reduction in bankfull channel depth significantly changed physical habitat conditions. A significant increase in taxonomic richness of benthic macroinvertebrates was inversely related to a change in bankfull channel depth in given cross-sections. Fish species richness and the abundance of subadult and adult fish individuals did not increase, but the structure of fish community changed towards more natural one. Assessments of restoration effects on ecological stream quality performed with the invertebrate-based BMWP-PL index and the European Fish Index yielded different results, with the former indicating a significant improvement and the latter a lack of quality change. A combination of the applied measures appears useful in restoring the ecosystem of incised mountain streams, though effects on different groups of aquatic fauna may vary.

AB  - Concentrations of mercury (Hg) are not well studied in free-ranging wildlife. Atmospheric deposition patterns of Hg have been studied in detail and have been modeled for both global and specific locations and often correlate to environmental impact. However, monitoring the impact of Hg deposition in wildlife is complicated due to local environmental conditions that can affect the transformation of atmospheric Hg to the biologically available forms (e.g., rainfall, humidity, pH, the ability of the environment to methylate Hg), as well as affect the accessibility to organisms for sampling. In this study, Hg concentrations in blood samples from a population of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) at Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (MINWR), FL, USA, over a seven-year period (2007 to 2014; n= 174 individuals) were examined to assess Hg variation in the population, as well as the difference in Hg concentration as a function of health status. While most of this population is healthy, 18 individuals with low body mass indices (BMI, defined in this study) were captured throughout the sampling period. These alligators exhibited significantly elevated Hg concentrations compared to their age/sex/season matched counterparts with normal BMI, suggesting that health status should be taken into account when examining Hg concentrations and effects. Alligator blood Hg concentrations were related to theinteraction of age/size, sex, and season. This study illustrates the value of a routinely monitored population of large predators in a unique coastal wetland ecosystem, and illuminates the value of long-term environmental exposure assessment.

AB  - Management of water-bodies affected by prolific growths of plants pose several problems related to assessment of created imbalances. The intensity of these phenomena should be considered on both spatial and temporal scales, as well as the impact of negative effects on practical uses of the water-bodies by man. An examination of invading growths recorded on the French hydrographic system has been carried out. As a result, an inventory of the most relevant plants was produced, called "risk species" belonging to different macrophyte groups like macro-algae, native hydrophyte phanerogams as Ranunculus sp., Potamogeton sp., Myriophyllum sp., Ceratophyllum sp., Lemna sp., and introduced phanerogams like Elodea sp., Lagarosiphon sp., Ludwigia sp., Myriophyllum aquaticum. Some helophyte plants, Cyanobacteria and two riparian introduced species (Fallopia japonica and Impatiens glandulifera), have also been considered. Biological strategies determine their proliferation potential by developing high growth and substantial propagation abilities, through some special morphological and physiological features and means of reproduction. Environment types and factors favour this capacity. These favourable environments are connected with environmental conditions such as high irradiation, mostly linked to shallow depth and water warming, stable or low hydrological conditions, high mineralization and trophic level. The occurrence of dense vegetation is usually the combination of these two aspects, with the influence of mostly several favourable factors. Some situations of minimal and maximal risks can be defined. This knowledge should improve understanding of these events and provide more information for management and control practices.

AB  - The development of cascade hydropower in the Yalong River has changed the hydrological regime of the river and sharply reduced the Coreius guichenoti population dwelling downstream of the JinPing II power station. In this paper, an eco-hydrological index system for C. guichenoti habitat was constructed based on Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) and Environment Flow Components (EFC), which aimed to coordinate the processes of ecological hydrological and water temperature variations to guarantee the oviposition of C. guichenoti. The analysis revealed that the suitable rise rate and fall rate intervals, which are dimensionless parameters, were 0.05-0.10 and 0.01-0.03, respectively, during the spawning period. The rise and fall durations were both 1-2 days, the cycle of water fluctuations was 3-5 days, the flow pulse duration was 5-7 days, the flow pulse rise rate was 0.56-0.65, and the flow pulse fall rate was 0.23-0.50. Then, the Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM) method was used to calculate the ecological base flow during the C. guichenoti spawning period. Moreover, the ecological flow regime for C. guichenoti downstream of the JinPing II power station during the spawning period was determined based on eco-hydrological indicators and water temperature requirements. These results showed that the ecological flow regime could not only guarantee oviposition but also meet the drifting conditions required for eggs, and therefore, the ecological operation of diversion-type hydropower stations and cascade hydropower stations needs to be given more attention to provide suitable spawning conditions in target fish habitats.

AB  - Rapid changes, including warming and freshening, are occurring in coastal marine ecosystems worldwide. These environmental changes have the potential to alter ecosystem energetics by influencing availability of food sources and organism physiology. We investigated the influence of oceanographic variability on food availability and quality to benthic and pelagic suspension-feeders using detailed observations of phytoplankton, particulate organic matter (POM) detritus, and diverse biomarkers (fatty acids and carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur stable isotopes) along a salinity gradient in the San Juan Archipelago, Washington, U.S.A. We tested the hypothesis that freshwater input from riverine discharge would cause significant changes to oceanographic conditions and reduce food quality (indicated by essential fatty acids; EFA), owing to greater contribution of terrestrial organic matter. Contrary to our expectations, availability of high-quality marine-derived POM increased with freshwater input (reduced salinity). Phytoplankton biomass and biomarker composition responded to oceanographic change similarly across tidal and seasonal scales. Using a meta-analysis spanning a range of spatial and temporal scales, we found that chlorophyll a, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were consistently and significantly higher at reduced salinity. The increase of DO and pH corresponding to higher phytoplankton biomass in low salinity water signifies an important feedback of biological activity on seawater chemistry. This analysis supports the use of salinity as an indicator of processes controlling food availability and oceanographic conditions in this region. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of ecosystem connectivity in coastal environments and produce hypotheses for expected changes related to altered river discharge dynamics.

AB  - Analysis of the growth-limiting factor or environmental stressors affecting microbes in situ is of fundamental importance but analytically difficult. Microbes can reduce in situ limiting nutrient concentrations to sub-micromolar levels, and contaminated ecosystems may contain multiple stressors. The patterns of gene or protein expression by microbes in nature can be used to infer growth limitations, because they are regulated in response to environmental conditions. Experimental studies under controlled conditions in the laboratory provide the physiological underpinnings for developing these physiological indicators. Although regulatory networks may differ among specific microbes, there are some broad principles that can be applied, related to limiting nutrient acquisition, resource allocation, and stress responses. As technologies for transcriptomics and proteomics mature, the capacity to apply these approaches to complex microbial communities will accelerate. Global proteomics has the particular advantage that it reflects expressed catalytic activities. Furthermore, the high mass accuracy of some proteomic approaches allows mapping back to specific microbial strains. For example, at the Rifle IFRC field site in Western Colorado, the physiological status of Fe(III)-reducing populations has been tracked over time. Members of a "subsurface clade" within the Geobacter predominated during carbon amendment to the subsurface environment. At the functional level, proteomic identifications produced inferences regarding (i) temporal changes in anabolism and catabolism of acetate, (ii) the onset of N-2 fixation when N became limiting, and (iii) expression of phosphate transporters during periods of intense growth. The application of these approaches in situ can lead to discovery of novel physiological adaptations.

AB  - Diatoms were employed to assess the recovery of northern prairie wetlands restored after drainage. We predicted that diatom species diversity and equitability are lower in restored wetlands than in reference wetlands and that diatom communities are similar among reference wetlands because communities should be relatively stable over time. Conversely, we predicted that diatom communities in restored and reference wetlands differ because species recovery after restoration may be incomplete or unattainable depending on environmental conditions or dispersal limits. Eight undisturbed, unrestored (reference) wetlands were compared to eight wetlands restored after drainage. Diatom communities on artificial substrates were transplanted from restored to reference wetlands and vice versa to test for environmental control and dispersal limits to community composition. Species richness was similar at restored and reference wetlands. Diversity and equitability at restored and reference sites were similar within a sampling period, but diversity and equitability decreased over the growing season in reference sites. Based on multidimensional scaling analyses, restored and reference sites could not be distinguished by species composition either early or late in the season. Transplanted diatom community assemblages became similar to those in the wetlands to which they were transferred, suggesting a strong environmental control over diatom assemblages. Diatoms, as a whole, responded rapidly to environmental conditions; yet, dispersal still may limit some species' re-establishment, while resistance to disturbance may produce little response among other diatom species. Diatoms may have limited utility as ecological indicators in prairie wetlands because of the unique interaction between diatom life history and the cyclic hydrology of; prairie wetlands and because diatom community structure is highly variable among reference wetlands.

AB  - The East African lakes have exhibited dramatic fluctuations on both historical and paleo-climatic time scales. Levels of these lakes, and other historical indicators in Africa, suggested that environmental conditions in the nineteenth century were much more extreme than anything evident in the modern record. In this study, a water balance model is used to estimate the rainfall associated with these conditions, based on the Lake Victoria record. The results suggest that the conditions were not unlike anomalous periods found during the twentieth century, but they may have persisted for somewhat longer periods of time. The paper also demonstrates a generic tool that can be applied to interpreting historical and paleo-lake levels in quantitative terms of rainfall.

AB  - Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape (CHAL) in central Nepal is known for its rich biodiversity and the landscape is expected to provide corridors for species range shift in response to climate change. Environmental assessments have identified biological invasions and other anthropogenic activities as major threats to the biodiversity in the CHAL. One of the rapidly spreading Invasive Alien Plant species (IAPs) in the CHAL is Parthenium hysterophorus L., a neotropical invasive weed of global significance. This study aimed to investigate the current and future projected suitable habitat of P. hysterophorus in the CHAL using MaxEnt modelling in three "Representative Concentration Pathways" (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) corresponding to different greenhouse gases emission trajectories for the year 2050 and 2070. A total of 288 species occurrence points, six bioclimatic variables - mean diurnal range, isothermality, annual precipitation, precipitation of driest month, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of driest quarter and two topographic variables (aspect and slope) were selected for MaxEnt modelling. Potential range shift in terms of increase or decline in the suitable habitat areas under the projected scenarios were calculated. Slope and annual precipitation were the most important variables that explained the current distribution of P. hysterophorus. Twenty percent of the total area of CHAL was predicted to be suitable habitat for the growth of P. hysterophorus in the current climatic condition. Highest gain in the suitable habitat of this noxious weed was found under RCP 4.5 scenario in 2050 and 2070, whereas there will be a loss in the suitable habitat under RCP 8.5 scenario in 2050 and 2070. Out of four physiographic regions present in CHAL, three regions - Siwalik, Middle Mountain and High Mountain have suitable habitat for P. hysterophorus under current climatic condition. The mountainous region is likely to be affected more than the Siwalik region by further spread of P. hysterophorus in the future under low (RCP 2.6) to medium (RCP 4.5) emission scenarios. The suitable habitat for this weed is likely to increase in the protected areas of mountain regions (Langtang National Park, Annapurna Conservation Area and Manaslu Conservation Area) in the future. The results have revealed a risk of spreading P. hysterophorus from present localities to non-invaded areas in the current and future climatic condition. Such risk needs to be considered by decision makers and resource managers while planning for effective management of this weed to reduce its ecological and economic impacts in the CHAL.

AB  - There is an urgent need for a systematic methodology for condition assessment of the bridges because the old bridges of most of the countries are inadequate to carry current-day traffic and satisfy the present codal provisions and even in newer bridges, deterioration caused by unforeseen service condition and deferred maintenance is of great concern. In view of this, an attempt has been made in this study to develop a systematic procedure and formulations for condition evaluation of existing bridges using Analytic Hierarchy Process in a fuzzy environment. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is an efficient decision making tool for complicated problems with multiple evaluation criteria and uncertainty. Fuzzy logic approach has been used to take care of the uncertainties and imprecision in the bridge inspector's observations. In this paper, first, a methodology has been proposed for condition ranking of number of reinforced concrete (RC) bridges. Then, based on the results obtained from prioritization, rating of the most deserved bridge has been carried out using MADM based fuzzy logic. Computer programs have been developed based on the formulations presented in this paper for evaluating condition of existing bridges and the details are presented in the paper. The methodology and its application are demonstrated through a case study. This methodology would certainly help the engineers and policy makers concerned with bridge management to overcome the problem related to prioritization and decision on funding related to rehabilitation of bridges.

AB  - The experimental data were obtained from an ecological restoration project implemented at a metal contaminated site. The basic idea presented in this study is that the conventionally defined chemical potential mu i can be used to evaluate the abiotic and biotic effects on a species' ecological niche. An ecological niche pi i defines the suitability of an environment for a given species to live while mu i defines the ability of a species to live in a given environment. The deviation of pi i from its fundamental niche pi i0 due to changes in environment conditions will thus be reflected by the changes in mu i. As a growth potential index, mu i is a function of the standard chemical potential mu i0 and the total number of plant species N. Like pi i0, which is an upper limit of pi i, mu i0 is an upper limit of mu i at N = 1, meaning that mu i0 is also a factor independent of biotic interactions. Increasing N will reduce mu i and thus, the same as pi i, mu i takes into account the biotic effect. The derived expression of pi i as a function of N confirms that both pi i and mu i belong to the same function family. Both mu i0 and pi i0 of a species are characteristic limits uniquely determined by the species' genetic nature while mu i and pi i of a species are variables subject to both the biotic and abiotic conditions under which the species is living. Either increase in species richness or deterioration in soil conditions will reduce mu i and pi i. The derived relation mu/(RT) = ln(Nm/N) can be applied to describe the biotic and abiotic effects on average pi for species co-existed in a plant community. As an upper limit of ln(N), ln (Nm) can be interpreted as a parameter representing the total availability of a space that can house Nm species. The conventionally applied biodiversity index ln(N) then corresponds to the part of available space inhabited by N co-existed species and ln(Nm/N) stands for the remaining space availability. The terms, ln(Nm) and ln(Nm/N), meet thus, respectively, the concepts of pi 0 and pi. The results obtained from the present study showed that the negative effect of species richness and abundance on mu i and pi i was the basic cause for the generally observed inverse relationship between population density and body size. Determination of the connection between mu i and pi i is of high value in regulating the relationship between productivity and biodiversity.

T2  - WEB ECOLOGY

AB  - Dune plant assemblages are affected by severe conditions, which makes them excellent models for studying the effects of species interactions and environmental conditions on community structure. We evaluate the relationship between the structure of dune communities, local environmental conditions and the suitability of climatic conditions for their characteristic species. Using data from an extensive survey of xerophytic inland sand dune scrub communities from Portugal - one of the most threatened habitat types of Europe - we identify the main gradients of vegetation composition, the different types of communities and their indicator shrub species. Then, we model the geographical responses of these species to the environment. Soil organic matter, isothermality and the habitat suitability for Stauracanthus genistoides defined the distribution of three shrub communities in the study area.

KW  - INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - Dragonflies are important conservation subjects and excellent indicators of terrrestrial and aquatic environmental conditions. To date, 155 spp, have been recorded in South Africa; 29 spp. (18.7%) are endemic. Metacnemis angusta and Paragomphus dicksoni are only known from female specimens and are of doubtful taxonomic status. Chlorolestes apricans, C, draconica, Ecchlorolestes nylephtha, E, peringueyi. Metacnemis valida, Pseudagrion inopinatum, P. unsingaziense, Enallagma polychromaticum, Ceratogomphus triceraticus, Syncordulia gracilis, S. venator: Orthetrum rubens and Urothemis,tis luciana are ecologically threatened. Chlorolestes apricans and LI, luciana are of particular concern. C, apricans, whose populations have declined in recent years, appears not to occur in any protected area, There are several significant sites/areas for Odon,: the Western Cape has several endemic spp., while the Amatola-Wintertberg mountain range of the Eastern Cape has 2. KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg has one highly localized endemic. Greater St Lucia is rich in pan-African spp., as well as some highly localized endemics, The Kruger National Park has no indigenous spp., but is rich in spp. representing the typical southern African savanna, There are isolated localities such as Itala and Umtamvuna, which have unusual outlier assemblages. Nor all anthropogenic disturbance is harmful to Odon. Small dams play an important role in geographically increasing the overall density of many lentic spp. Similarly, the aquatic weed Pistia enhances local species richness in the Kruger National Park, Most major human disturbances however, are harmful to population levels. Exotic tree plantations within 30m of the: river's edge reduce species richness, The rainbow trout is implicated in causing range retraction of the very rare and threatened E. peringueyi, while removal of natural forest in the southern Cape has eliminated populations of the equally rare E. nylephtha. Cattle grazing, resulting in bank vegetation destruction, and black wattle infestations along Eastern Cape river banks have had a major adverse impact on C. apricans. These factors are synergistic with lowered water levels in causing population fragmentation. Of great concern from this survey is that presence of rare species in nature reserves does not necessarily guarantee their survival. Orthetrum robustum at St Lucia, and O. brachiale, O. guineense and O. hintzi at Mpenjati reserves were abundant in 1990 but absent in 1994 because the intervening dry years had dried out their pools. Management recommendations include avoidance of siltation, eutrophication, salination, cattle trampling of bunks, and planting of exotic trees on banks within 30m of edge. Recommendations also include maintaining a constant water level in lakes and reservoirs, encouraging an abundance of aquatic macrophytes, and maintaining a wide range of physical bank and shallow water conditions so that there is a variety of substrate types, vegetation structures and sun/shade conditions.

Special attention is paid to the problem of effective management in arid climate and marketization of the region. The article considers the indicators of Kalmyk nomadic farming development, estimates stocking level in the period under review and establishes the impact of market conditions on nomadic farming development. The article employs a wide range of sources and literature. The results demonstrate that the Kalmyk cattle-breeders ran their farms efficiently in arid climate taking market fluctuations into account. That was the indication of sufficient economic efficiency and ecological suitability of that type of economic management in the late 19th - early 20th centuries.

AB  - Purpose - Many construction projects are implemented in open-environment job sites and can be significantly affected by various weather conditions. Evaluating the overall impacts of the weather conditions on a project can assist project managers to prepare effectively. Nevertheless, methods measuring the overall adverse impacts of the job sites' weather condition on the project performance are still missing. This study aims to address this gap.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this investigation, a survey-based method was proposed to evaluate the overall impacts of the weather conditions on the construction project resources through a new indicator called job site weather index (JWI). The target survey population includes practitioners directly involved in the on-site construction operations.
   Findings - The JWI suggests the direction of the resource change in new construction projects based on the weather condition. The method was implemented in the road construction projects of Iran and successfully applied to four sample cities. In this experiment, construction workers were identified as the most susceptible resources to the unfavorable weather conditions. Hot temperature above 50 degrees C and cold temperature below similar to 10 degrees C were ranked as the most influential factors for the workers. The results achieved showed high accordance with the trends currently followed in the country.
   Originality/value - This research was the first structured method for capturing impacts of weather conditions on the performance of construction resources in open environment construction projects. Implementation of the method in road construction projects of Iran revealed new results that have not been previously identified. The impacts of the company-specific factors on the final productivity rate, however, were not investigated in the research. Investigations accounting impacts of various company-specific factors on the final productivity rate are required.

AB  - Hysteresis phenomenon is a distinctive approach to describe the natural behavior of the magnetic materials and magnetic cores. This article proposes a phenomenological approach for core quality assessment and condition monitoring of magnetic cores with grain-oriented electrical steels. The developed technique is based on the hysteresis phenomenon and interpreting the most distinctive parameters of the measured dynamic hysteresis loops. In this study, artificial short circuits were introduced between the laminations of stacks of two, three, and four Epstein size strips of Fe-3 wt % Si grain-oriented steel. The results showed that condition monitoring of the magnetic cores can be effectively performed by measuring and analyzing the hysteresis loops.

AB  - Animal welfare in dairy farming is characterized by avoiding health hazards for the animals and feeding of natural feedstuffs which are given in amounts according to actual nutritional demands. The housing environment facilitates normal behaviour, avoids stress and lets animals arrive at a high age with high and stable performance. To achieve this, nutritional demands must be met and the housing elements must be kept in continuous function and in hygienically perfect condition. Only the farmer can make sure that the keeping of his animals is in total ethologically adequate. A combination of animal related, technical (including building) and management specific indicators is necessary on the farm level for comprehensive evaluation of whether ethologic demands are met in the specific housing system.

AB  - Nutritional assessment focuses on evaluation of animal-specific, diet-specific, feeding management, and environmental factors. Assessment includes evaluation of a patient's medical history, comprehensive diet history, and physical examination including body weight, body condition, and muscle condition. Diagnostic testing may identify comorbidities associated with obesity or concurrent health conditions that need to be considered when developing a nutrition plan. When obesity is diagnosed during the nutritional assessment this finding along with health implications must be clearly communicated to the pet owner. Careful consideration of animal-specific, diet-specific, owner-specific, and environmental factors allows the clinician to develop a specific nutrition plan tailored to the needs of pet and owner.

AB  - Benthic samples from coastal locations off Southwestern Norway were examined and the specimens of Thyasiridae were identified to species. A multivariate analysis based on 13 parameters was carried out and the environmental preferences of all thyasirid species present were determined. The potential of the Thyasiridae as indicators of organic enrichment was investigated by using direct canonical correspondence analyses to identify correlations between selected environmental parameters and the collected biological data. The presence of Thyasira sarsi together with a low biodiversity is a good indicator of organic enrichment. High thyasirid species diversity seems to indicate good environmental conditions, and single thyasirid species that lack symbiotic bacteria might also be useful as indicators of good environmental conditions.

AB  - In order to investigate the effects of the improved environmental conditions on the population sex composition, the authors have chosen true Italian regions with different socio-economic levels. As previously seen in populations representative of the major ethnic groups, the authors have found that the progressive reduction of early male extra-mortality has lead the sex proportion at birth to be maintained almost unchanged at least to the first year of life. Since the decreased sex-specific mortality may have allowed other mechanisms to assume greater relevance on the determination of the population sex proportion, the authors have also analysed the present-day sex composition of newborns with respect to indicators of biological, cultural and socio-economic conditions.

AB  - Centre d'Etude pour un Developpement Agricole Plus Autonome (CEDAPA) is a group of farmers in Brittany (western France) which proposes a mainly pasture-based milli and meat production system defined by a set of prohibitions and obligations, CEDAPA farmers claim that their production system causes less environmental damage than the current systems used by most other farmers. With respect to pesticide effects this claim was examined by using an expert system (Ipest), which reflects the authors' perception of the potential environmental effect of the application of a pesticide to a field crop. Ipest requires three types of input variables: pesticide properties, site-specific conditions and characteristics of the pesticide application. It yields four output variables: one reflecting the rate of application of the pesticide, the other three reflecting the risk for three major environmental compartments (groundwater, surface water and air). In order to fit the hydrogeological conditions of Brittany and to decrease dependence on expert judgement, the Ipest system was modified and enhanced. An existing method for the estimation of runoff risk from the field was included. This new version of the expert system, Ipest-B, was used to compare the environmental effect of pesticide use on winter wheat, silage maize and fodder beet, which overall was largely similar. However, within each of the three crops, large differences occurred from pesticide characteristics, number of treatments and environmental conditions. This type of analysis helps to identify and recommend the least harmful treatment programmes for each crop. The Ipest system was shown to be flexible, and adaptable to the particularities of Brittany. An adaptation of the system to other regional conditions should be possible.

AB  - The environmental conditions in estuaries display distinct variability along the river-ocean mixing continuum from turbid, eutrophic freshwater to clear, oligotrophic offshore oceanic water. In order to understand the effects of suspended particulate matter (SPM), nutrient, and salinity on phytoplankton growth, this study investigated the response of a harmful dinoflagellate (Amphidinium carterae Hulburt) to the ecological gradients in estuary environments. Rapid nutrient uptake and growth of A. carterae were detected in the nutrient-rich clear water, while nutrient concentration had little impact on the cellular chlorophyll a (Chl-a) content at the stationary phase. Light attenuation caused by SPM not only inhibited the specific growth rate of A. carterae but also prolonged its adaption period in turbid water, resulting in a delayed and weakened growth response. The elevated cellular Chl-a content under high SPM conditions resulting from photo-acclimation led to the decoupling of cell density and Chl-a concentration, indicating that Chl-a is not a reliable indicator for phytoplankton abundance in turbid environments. The combined effect of SPM and nutrient on specific growth rate of A. carterae can be explained by the comparative effect model, while the multiplicative effect model better predicted their interactive effect on the growth inhibitory rate (GIR). There is a transit of dominant limiting factor for phytoplankton growth along the salinity gradient in estuary environments. Salinity (for marine phytoplankton cannot survive under low salinity condition) and SPM are the dominant limiting factors at low salinities in nearshore turbid environments, while nutrient depletion exerts the dominant inhibitory effect in high salinity offshore water. Depending on the balance between enhancing nutrient limitation and reducing light limitation with increasing salinity, blooms most likely occur in the "optimal growth region " at intermediate salinities where light and nutrient are both suitable for phytoplankton growth.

AB  - The botanical composition of samples from culture layers, explored in two medieval towns in northern Poland, is discussed with respect to their potential as a source of environmental data. The frequency of selected taxa and the proportion of their diaspores in the actualistic groups of weed and grassland species, as well as the distribution of indices for edaphic factors were used as indicators of the natural environment around and inside the towns, and of some aspects of agriculture. The comparison of the results from both towns affords new evidence for a better understanding of archaeobotanical data from culture layers of non-specific, complex origin.

AB  - Modifying human activities is key to achieving land degradation neutrality in rangelands. Rangeland stakeholders encompass different ownership regimes; however, little is known about whether different ownership models benefit or degrade social conditions and ecosystem services in the Middle East. The aim of this research was to determine the effects of Collective or Council ownership on social and ecological indicators in the wintery rangeland of Iran. The study included a social network analysis of the 187 stakeholders in the communal rangelands of Kalat (NE Iran). We considered social network variables such as density, reciprocity, transitivity, geodesic distance and E-I (external-internal) and degree centrality combined with ecological indicators such as condition, forage yield and trend in range condition. The stocking rate was 2.43 AU ha(-1) in Council rangelands and 0.94 AU ha(-1) for Collective rangelands, with both exceeding recommended carrying capacity. Herbage mass and canopy cover were both higher in the Collective (247 kg/ha; 59%) than Council rangelands (140 kg/ha; 48.3%). Density (47.6% and 48.6%) and reciprocity (54.2% and 53.7%) were higher for Collective rangelands than Council rangelands, but were lower for geodesic distance (1.5 and 1.7-1.8) for trust and collaboration ties. Collective rangelands showed more bridging ties (55%) than the council rangelands (27.5%), suggesting they would be more resilient when problems occur. It concluded that social capital was richer in the Collective rangelands, which creates a willingness in operators to contribute to participatory management of rangelands to improve their condition. Finally suggested new tools and policies, and possible financial and pedagogic support be provided to the Council rangelands to increase social capital and improve outcomes.

AB  - To achieve the desired outcomes of ecosystem-based or integrated coastal management, paradigm shifts must occur in all stages of the policy process. This article focuses on the evaluative stage following policy implementation, specifically on the use of coastal ecosystem condition indicators. A review of the recent literature suggests that coastal ecosystem condition indicators with too broad a scale or too narrow a scope lose utility and applicability. An analysis of these problems of scale and scope reveals that the process through which an index is designed and selected can hinder or heighten its validity. Local and diverse stakeholder input can help to ameliorate weaknesses, increasing the evaluative validity of coastal ecosystem condition indicators.

AB  - Human activities have severely affected the condition of freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Physical alteration, habitat loss, water withdrawal, pollution, overexploitation and the introduction of non-native species all contribute to the decline in freshwater species. Today, freshwater species are, in general, at higher risk of extinction than those in forests, grasslands and coastal ecosystems. For North America alone, the projected extinction rate for freshwater fauna is five times greater than that for terrestrial fauna-a rate comparable to the species loss in tropical rainforest. Because many of these extinctions go unseen, the level of assessment and knowledge of the status and trends of freshwater species are still very poor, with species going extinct before they are even taxonomically classified.
   Increasing human population growth and achieving the sustainable development targets set forth in 2002 will place even higher demands on the already stressed freshwater ecosystems, unless an integrated approach to managing water for people and ecosystems is implemented by a broad constituency. To inform and implement policies that support an integrated approach to water management, as well as to measure progress in halting the rapid decline in freshwater species, basin-level indicators describing the condition and threats to freshwater ecosystems and species are required. This paper discusses the extent and quality of data available on the number and size of populations of freshwater species, as well as the change in the extent and condition of natural freshwater habitats. The paper presents indicators that can be applied at multiple scales, highlighting the usefulness of using remote sensing and geographical information systems technologies to fill some of the existing information gaps. Finally, the paper includes an analysis of major data gaps and information needs with respect to freshwater species to measure progress towards the 2010 biodiversity targets.

AB  - Animal signals involved in sexual selection are often indicators of individual quality. The assumption that sexual characters such as breeding plumage may indicate immune state has rarely been tested in free-living migratory birds, particularly in relation to innate immunity. If sexual characters indeed reflect immune condition, then these could be used to evaluate individual quality. Melanin is a common pigment used in animal communication that mitigates the effects of oxidative stress and has positive effects on energy homeostasis, important functions during the strenuous activity of long-distance flights. However, melanin is also immunosuppressive, and the melanised patches of breeding plumage may to some extent compromise immune responsiveness. We studied melanin-based secondary sexual characters (SSC) in a long-distance migratory wader, the black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa, and found that breeding plumage features of male and female godwits are linked to components of innate immunity. Males with a larger colour extension had higher circulating levels of haptoglobin and hemolysis activity, while they also presented a lower body condition; whereas females presented a negative trend between colour and bar extension and hemolysis activity, and a positive trend for natural antibodies. The association between signal, immune state and physical condition in males suggests a cost for signal production and immune condition during prenuptial migration. Sex differences in how signals relate with immune capacity are a likely consequence of sex-specific signalling roles and energy demands. Our results indicate that male godwit breeding plumage reflects innate immunity state, and is therefore a likely signal for females to use during mate choice as an honest indicator of male's capacity to allocate energy/resources to both expensive traits during periods of energetic constraint.

AB  - Synoptic data on concentrations of sediment-associated chemical contaminants and benthic macroinfaunal community structure were collected from 1,389 stations in estuaries along the U. S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts as part of the nationwide Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program ( EMAP). These data were used to develop an empirical framework for evaluating risks of benthic community-level effects within different ranges of sediment contamination from mixtures of multiple chemicals present at varying concentrations. Sediment contamination was expressed as the mean ratio of individual chemical concentrations relative to corresponding sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), including Effects Range-Median (ERM) and Probable Effects Level (PEL) values. Benthic condition was assessed using diagnostic, multi-metric indices developed for each of three EMAP provinces ( Virginian, Carolinian, and Louisianian). Cumulative percentages of stations with a degraded benthic community were plotted against ascending values of the mean ERM and PEL quotients. Based on the observed relationships, mean SQG quotients were divided into four ranges corresponding to either a low, moderate, high, or very high incidence of degraded benthic condition. Results showed that condition of the ambient benthic community provides a reliable and sensitive indicator for evaluating the biological significance of sediment-associated stressors. Mean SQG quotients marking the beginning of the contaminant range associated with the highest incidence of benthic impacts (73-100% of samples, depending on the province and type of SQG) were well below those linked to high risks of sediment toxicity as determined by short-term toxicity tests with single species. Measures of the ambient benthic community reflect the sensitivities of multiple species and life stages to persistent exposures under actual field conditions. Similar results were obtained with preliminary data from the west coast ( Puget Sound).

AB  - Background and aims - The habitat conditions and population characteristics of the Italian members of the genus Pinguicula are presently still scarcely known. In this study we carried out a comparative research on two butterwort species occurring in the same mountain area, but very different in their distribution, the endemic of the western Alps Pinguicula arvetii and the circumboreal P. vulgaris.
   Methods - We sampled 36 stands of P. arvetii and 29 stands of P. vulgaris with squared plots of 0.25 m(2). In each plot we collected data on geology, topography, hydrochemistry and soil, made a complete inventory of plant species, used for calculating the Ellenberg indicator values, and assessed population density and proportion of flowering individuals. Moreover, we calculated indices of size of vegetative and reproductive structures. We compared the environmental characteristics of sites occupied by the two target species and performed ordinations to assess differences in habitat conditions and to analyse the relationships between characteristics of the two bufterworts along environmental gradients.
   Key results - The two bufterworts showed significant differences in site elevation and in most of the ecological indicator values. Consistently, the analyses of species composition of stands revealed that the endemic P. arvetii occurred more commonly at higher-elevation habitats, characterized by a greater incidence of species typical of snowbeds, screes and sandy and skeletal poor grasslands. Individual and population characteristics differed in their position along the ordination axes, with a negative relationship between population density and proportion of flowering individual in both the Pinguicula species.
   Conclusions - The main environmental variable discriminating sites occupied by the two butterworts was the elevation. Growth and reproductive performances of the two Pinguicula species were influenced by site conditions, but environmental gradients differently affected individual and population characteristics of the two target species.

AB  - A major frontier in global change research is predicting how multiple agents of global change will alter plant productivity, a critical component of the carbon cycle. Recent research has shown that plant responses to climate change are phylogenetically conserved such that species within some lineages are more productive than those within other lineages in changing environments. However, it remains unclear how phylogenetic patterns in plant responses to changing abiotic conditions may be altered by another agent of global change, the introduction of non-native species. Using a system of 28 native Tasmanian Eucalyptus species belonging to two subgenera, Symphyomyrtus and Eucalyptus, we hypothesized that productivity responses to abiotic agents of global change (elevated CO2 and increased soil N) are unique to lineages, but that novel interactions with a non-native species mediate these responses. We tested this hypothesis by examining productivity of 1) native species monocultures and 2) mixtures of native species with an introduced hardwood plantation species, Eucalyptus nitens, to experimentally manipulated soil N and atmospheric CO2. Consistent with past research, we found that N limits productivity overall, especially in elevated CO2 conditions. However, monocultures of species within the Symphyomyrtus subgenus showed the strongest response to N (gained 127% more total biomass) in elevated CO2 conditions, whereas those within the Eucalyptus subgenus did not respond to N. Root: shoot ratio (an indicator of resource use) was on average greater in species pairs containing Symphyomyrtus species, suggesting that functional traits important for resource uptake are phylogenetically conserved and explaining the phylogenetic pattern in plant response to changing environmental conditions. Yet, native species mixtures with E. nitens exhibited responses to CO2 and N that differed from those of monocultures, supporting our hypothesis and highlighting that both plant evolutionary history and introduced species will shape community productivity in a changing world.

AB  - This article provides an overview of existing literature on the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation effects on algae and cyanobacteria. We report on the effects of UV-B radiation to the growth and development, biomass, sensitivity, photosynthetic pigments, UV-B absorbing compounds, photosynthesis, protein and DNA damage, enzyme activity, nitrogen fixation and assimilation of nitrogen, protective mechanisms of algae and cyanobacteria, the accommodation of algae and cyanobacteria to environmental stress, and the effects to ecology system. Many of the studies show the dramatic effects of UV-B radiation; but typically these studies were conducted under conditions with supplemental UV-B irradiance that was higher than would ever occur outside experimental conditions or natural condition. A few of the studies reviewed used experimental conditions and supplemental UV-B irradiance that approached realism. Enhanced UV-B generally decreased chlorophyll content, whereas it increased UV-B absorbing compounds in many algae. Decrease in photosynthesis, particularly at higher UV-B doses, was due to both direct (effect on photosystem) and indirect (decrease in pigments) effects. The decreases in chlorophyll pigments and photosynthesis resulted in lower biomass. However, algae and cyanobacteria have evolved various avoidance and repair mechanisms to protect themselves against the damaging effects of UV radiation to acclimate to enhanced UV-B radiation. The review points to areas where further studies on the relationships among nitrogenase, Rubisco, antioxidase activity, signal, antioxidants, and free radicals under enhanced UV-B are needed to quantify the effects of UV-B radiation on algae and cyanobacteria. These studies are needed in order to develop dose response functions that can facilitate development of dynamic simulation models for use in UV-B and other environmental impact assessments.

AB  - The resistance formation of spores in general and ofBacillus atrophaeusin particular has long been the focus of science in the bio-defense, pharmaceutical and food industries. In the food industry, it is used as a biological indicator (BI) for the evaluation of the inactivation effects of hydrogen peroxide in processing and end packaging lines' sterilization. Defined BI resistances are critical to avoid false positive and negative tests, which are salient problems due to the variable resistance of currently available commercial BIs. Although spores for use as BIs have been produced for years, little is known about the influence of sporulation conditions on the resistance as a potential source of random variability. This study therefore examines the dependence of spore resistance on the temperature, pH and partial oxygen saturation during submerged production in a bioreactor. For this purpose, spores were produced under different sporulation conditions and their resistance, defined by the D-value, was determined using a count reduction test in tempered 35% liquid hydrogen peroxide. The statistical analysis of the test results shows a quadratic dependence of the resistance on the pH, with the highest D-values at neutral pH. The sporulation temperature has a linear influence on the resistance. The higher the temperature, the higher the D-value. However, these factors interact with each other, which means that the temperature only influences the resistance when the pH is within a certain range. The oxygen partial pressure during sporulation has no significant influence. Based on the data obtained, a model could be developed enabling the resistance of BIs to be calculated, predicted and standardized depending on the sporulation conditions. BI manufacturers could thus produce BIs with defined resistances for the validation of sterilization effects in aseptic packaging/filling lines for the reliable manufacture of shelf-stable and safe food products.

AB  - In India, freshwater aquatic resources are suffering from increasing human population, urbanization and shortage of all kind of natural resources like water. To mitigate this, all the major rivers have been planned for a river-interlinking through an interlinking canal system under a huge scheme; yet, the baseline information on ecological conditions of those tropical rivers and their fish communities is lacking at present. In view of that, the present study was undertaken to assess the ecological condition by comparing the trophic metrics of the fish community, conservation status and water chemistry of the two tropical rivers of the Ganga basin, from October 2007 to November 2009. The analysis of trophic niches of the available fish species indicated dominancy of carnivorous (19 species) in river Ken and omnivorous (23 species) in Betwa. The trophic level score of carnivorous species was recorded similar (33.33%) in both rivers, whereas omnivorous species were mostly found in Betwa (36.51%) than Ken (28.07%). Relatively undisturbed sites of Betwa (B1, B2 and B3) and Ken (K2, K3 and K5) were characterized by diverse fish fauna and high richness of threatened species. The higher mean trophic level scores were recorded at B4 of Betwa and K4 of Ken. The Bray-Curtis index for trophic level identified the carnivorous species (>0.32) as an indicator species for pollution. Anthropogenic exposure, reflected in water quality as well as in fish community structure, was found higher especially in the lower stretches of both rivers. Our results suggest the importance of trophic metrics on fish community, for ecological conditions evaluation, which enables predictions on the effect of future morphodynamic changes (in the post-interlinking phases), and provide a framework and reference condition to support restoration efforts of relatively altered fish habitats in tropical rivers of India.

AB  - The Mediterranean climate of North Africa encompasses an interesting variety of sub-climates, from humid and sub-humid to semi-arid and arid. Such variability may provide vital insights into mechanisms that drive species distribution and offered us an ideal opportunity to test phenotypic variations along gradients. We aim in this study to investigate the breeding behaviour of house martin Delichon urbica (Linnaeus, 1758) populations along regional climatic gradients in north-eastern Algeria. During two consecutive breeding seasons (2016-2017), nine field sites (328 active nests) belonging to three different sub-climates: humid, sub-humid, and semi-arid were surveyed regularly from March to August. We used generalized linear models to test the relevance of local climate and several ecological variables on laying reproductive output. Laying dates were positively correlated with climate condition (GOF = 0.42), the semi-arid climate creating appropriate conditions for advancing the laying process, whereas sub-humid and humid climate delayed it. Clutch-size and number of chicks hatched per nest were affected by local climate conditions; they were greater in humid areas than in sub-humid and semi-arid ones. The other non-climatic variables as brood order, laying date, distance to fields, and distance to water were not significant. The spatial analysis around nest sites of house martins also showed that dense vegetation cover and reduced urbanization levels may be potential predictors of breeding behaviour. Nest sites located in humid areas with dense vegetation cover, and low urbanization levels that characterize the surrounding landscape provide high-breeding success rate to this species if compared to sub-humid and semi-arid areas. These findings can be a useful indicator of environmental change in a country that is already experiencing severe drought stresses, uncontrolled urbanization, and high deforestation rates.

AB  - Parasites impose costs on their hosts. The capability to fight against them is of great advantage, but may also be traded off with other traits. Although often observed at the phenotypic level, our knowledge of the extent to which such trade-offs are genetically determined is relatively poor. We tested this possibility with a farmed rainbow trout population suffering from natural Diplostomum spp. infections that cause cataracts in fish. We estimated the heritability of cataract severity and examined phenotypic and genetic correlations between cataract and a set of performance traits measured three times during a 3-year rearing period. A cataract score was used as an indicator of the host's capability to resist and/or tolerate the parasite. Our results showed moderate heritability for the cataract. Nevertheless, we found no evidence for a genetic or phenotypic trade-off between parasite resistance/tolerance and the measured performance traits. Initial body weight was not correlated with the cataract score. Phenotypic and genetic correlations of cataract severity with body mass and condition measured in the second and third year were strongly negative, indicating reduced growth and condition in fish with a high cataract score. The reduced body size and condition in cataract-bearing fish were probably reflected in the phenotypic association between a high cataract score and delayed maturity age in females. Put together, our study did not provide evidence of genetic or phenotypic trade-offs between Diplostomum resistance/tolerance and a number of performance traits. Therefore, selection for lessened Diplostomum-caused cataracts is unlikely to have a negative impact on the studied performance traits.

AB  - This study is the first investigation which provides information regarding the organic geochemical and petrographic characteristics of Miocene Salif organic-rich shales from Tihama Basin in the Red Sea, Yemen. We evaluate organic matter content, type, maturity, and oil-generation potential as well as depositional environmental conditions. The total organic carbon (TOC) contents of the Miocene Salif shales vary between 0.59% and 5.40%, indicating fair to very good source rock potential. The Salif shales have hydrogen index values in the range of 64-576 mg HC/g TOC. The organic matter in the Salif shales are dominated by Type II kerogen and mixed II-III kerogens with a minor contribution of Type III kerogen, as supported by kerogen microscopy. This is also confirmed by their biomarker and carbon isotope results, which indicate that the Salif shales were deposited in highly reducing marine conditions and received high contributions of aquatic organic matter (e.g., algal and microbial) and terrigenous organic matter. Consequently, the Salif Formation is likely to be an oil-source rock. Maturity indicators such as vitrinite reflectance and pyrolysis data (i.e., T-max and PI) indicate that most of the Salif shale samples are generally thermally mature, at the early-mature to peak oil window stage. The new data presented in this paper suggest that early-mature oil has been generated from Miocene Salif organic-rich shales, so exploration strategies should focus on the known location of Miocene Salif organic-rich shales for predicting the location of the source kitchen.

AB  - There is substantial concern that microbial and nutrient pollution by cattle on public lands degrades water quality, threatening human and ecological health. Given the importance of clean water on multiple-use landscapes, additional research is required to document and examine potential water quality issues across common resource use activities. During the 2011 grazing-recreation season, we conducted a cross sectional survey of water quality conditions associated with cattle grazing and/or recreation on 12 public lands grazing allotments in California. Our specific study objectives were to 1) quantify fecal indicator bacteria (FIB; fecal coliform and E. coli), total nitrogen, nitrate, ammonium, total phosphorus, and soluble-reactive phosphorus concentrations in surface waters; 2) compare results to a) water quality regulatory benchmarks, b) recommended maximum nutrient concentrations, and c) estimates of nutrient background concentrations; and 3) examine relationships between water quality, environmental conditions, cattle grazing, and recreation. Nutrient concentrations observed throughout the grazing-recreation season were at least one order of magnitude below levels of ecological concern, and were similar to U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates for background water quality conditions in the region. The relative percentage of FIB regulatory benchmark exceedances widely varied under individual regional and national water quality standards. Relative to USEPA's national E. coli FIB benchmarks-the most contemporary and relevant standards for this study-over 90% of the 743 samples collected were below recommended criteria values. FIB concentrations were significantly greater when stream flow was low or stagnant, water was turbid, and when cattle were actively observed at sampling. Recreation sites had the lowest mean FIB, total nitrogen, and soluble-reactive phosphorus concentrations, and there were no significant differences in FIB and nutrient concentrations between key grazing areas and non-concentrated use areas. Our results suggest cattle grazing, recreation, and provisioning of clean water can be compatible goals across these national forest lands.

AB  - As part of an assessment of the ecological quality of surface waters, recent European water legislation, the water framework directive (WFD), requires the setting of environmental objectives for particular chemicals. As part of this, many European countries are choosing to develop a quality classification scheme for total phosphorus (TP) concentration. The assessment of ecological quality and its component parts, such as TP, must be based on the degree of divergence of a water body from an appropriate baseline, or 'reference condition'. For this reason, it is important to determine TP reference conditions for all lake types, or alternatively, models for predicting reference TP concentrations on a site-specific basis. With this purpose in mind, we have assembled a large dataset of European lakes considered to be in reference condition; 567 lakes in total. Data has been collated on TP concentration, mean depth, alkalinity, humic type, altitude, area, and geographical region. Reference TP concentrations have been derived from this dataset using two empirical approaches. Firstly, lake-type specific TP reference conditions were derived simply from descriptive statistics (median and percentiles) of TP concentrations by lake type. Secondly, empirical models were developed for estimating site-specific reference TP concentrations from a set of potential predictor variables. TP concentrations were found to vary with lake type and by geographical region. TP increased with colour and alkalinity, and decreased with lake depth and altitude. There was no clear relationship between TP and lake area. Altitude, mean depth and alkalinity were selected as independent explanatory variables for prediction of site-specific reference TP concentrations, with different models developed for humic and non-humic lakes. A simpler site-specific predictive model based solely on the morphoedaphic index (MEI) (a combination of a site's alkalinity and mean depth) was also shown to be comparably effective.

AB  - Net photosynthesis (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), leaf temperature (LT), transpiration rate (E) and in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence were monitored February 1996-February 1997 in Quercus ilex plants growing in the climax area (Rome) and in the Garda lake region. Photosynthetic activity is an appropriate temperature-dependent functional trait linked to plant metabolism and performance. We employed photosynthesis as a stress temperature indicator. Regression analysis showed that in such regional climatic conditions, net photosynthetic rates were primarily correlated with temperature. The introduction of rainfall in the function did not significantly improve the theoretical prevision, in the range of temperature and rainfall analysed. The favourable leaf temperatures allowing 90-100% of the highest photosynthetic rates were 14-28 degrees C, decreasing over 50% when leaf temperature were respectively below 6 degrees C and over 37 degrees C: the low potential photochemical efficiency of 0.71 PSII (Fv/Fm) at Castelporziano during summer, confirmed the state of stress. Transpiration rates remained high with the increase of leaf temperature in summer, in spite of the 46% decrease of stomatal conductance. Nevertheless, this decrease allowed the maintenance of acceptable Pn rates in stressful conditions. The potential productivity of Q. ilex lied on high peaks of activity during periods of lower evaporative demand and a rapid stomatal response to an increase in air temperature and soil water deficit. Although it is difficult to forecast Q. ilex productivity and plant structure, we may hypothesize its future presence in the Mediterranean Basin by the capability of vegetative activity in a wide range of temperatures, the high stomatal control in stressful conditions, the high plasticity index and water use efficiency (WUE).

AB  - The production performance of livestock is influenced by short-term variation in weather pattern. Goat adapts to varied ecological conditions and maintains productivity; however, wide variation has been observed among individual animals in response to environmental stimuli in a population. The objective of the present study was to identify the contrasting phenotypes on the basis of the physiological response in goats during heat stress. The study utilised 138 Jamunapari and 242 Barbari goats during peak heat-stress period and 82 Jamunapari and Barbari goats under thermo-neutral conditions. The physiological response of goats to different environmental conditions was evaluated by recording various parameters such as rectal temperature (RT), respiration rate (RR) and heart rate (HR). The temperature humidity index varied from 85.36 to 89.80 and from 65.32 to 73.12 during heat-stress and thermo-neutral assessments respectively. There was direct increase inHRand RR (>25%) due to heat stress in the animals, as compared with those in thermo-neutral conditions. On the basis of the distribution ofRRandHRvalues across the breed in the population, the individuals having a RR of >= 50 and a HR of >= 130 are recognised as heat stress-susceptible phenotypes and those having a RR of <= 30 and a HR of <= 100 are recognised as heat stress-tolerant individuals. Different biomarkers were analysed in plasma, while heat-shock proteins and leptin were analysed in tissue extracts by ELISA. C-reactive protein and HSP90 concentrations were significantly (P < 0.05) different between heat stress-susceptible and heat stress-tolerant individuals. Heat-shock proteins HSP70, HSP 90, and C-reactive protein and triiodothyronine were reliable indicators of long-term heat stress. Identification of contrasting phenotypes in regard to heat stress is necessary so as to evaluate the expression pattern at a cellular level, as well as physiological and biochemical parameters.

AB  - Widespread and increasing urbanization has resulted in the need to assess, monitor, and understand its effects on stream water quality. Identifying relations between stream ecological condition and urban intensity indicators such as impervious surface provides important, but insufficient information to effectively address planning and management needs in such areas. In this study we investigate those specific landscape metrics which are functionally linked to indicators of stream ecological condition, and in particular, identify those characteristics that exacerbate or mitigate changes in ecological condition over and above impervious surface. The approach used addresses challenges associated with redundancy of landscape metrics, and links landscape pattern and composition to an indicator of stream ecological condition across a broad area of the eastern United States. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected during 2000-2001 from forty-two sites in the Delaware River Basin, and landscape data of high spatial and thematic resolution were obtained from photointerpretation of 1999 imagery. An ordination-derived 'biotic score' was positively correlated with assemblage tolerance, and with urban-related chemical characteristics such as chloride concentration and an index of potential pesticide toxicity. Impervious surface explained 56% of the variation in biotic score, but the variation explained increased to as high as 83% with the incorporation of a second land use, cover, or configuration metric at catchment or riparian scales. These include land use class-specific cover metrics such as percent of urban land with tree cover, forest fragmentation metrics such as aggregation index, riparian metrics such as percent tree cover, and metrics related to urban aggregation. Study results indicate that these metrics will be important to monitor in urbanizing areas in addition to impervious surface.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the link between a hydric potential of catchments (LHP) and the predictability (P) of maximum flow of selected rivers in southern Poland (within the Upper Vistula basin) and Slovakia. The LHP method refers to the ability of ecosystems to slow down runoff and retain water. The LHP method is focused on the analysis of the following indicators, shaping the geosphere at the catchment scale: hydrogeological conditions, soil conditions, meteorological conditions, geomorphological conditions, and land use. The predictability of river flows, calculated as one of the Colwell's indices, represents a measure of confidence with regard to the state of a flood event at a given point. To determine links between the LHP and P, a cluster analysis was used with the Ward method of agglomeration. The mean LHP varied between 1.2 for the Skawa River and 20.1 for the Vistula River. Only the Vistula River has very high LHP. The rest of the investigated rivers had medium and low values of LHP. The mean predictability of maximum flows for all rivers was relatively high (0.54), with the highest value obtained for the Wislok River (0.69) and the lowest one for the Bialka River (0.40). Cluster analysis showed that the studied catchments may be aggregated into four homogeneity clusters: first - catchments with high P and limited LHP, second - catchments with mean P and low LHP, third - with low P and average LHP and fourth - with very high P and medium and excellent LHP. The results are important for the management of catchments, especially for planning of any land use changes and investment projects related to water retention. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article presents the use of a multi-criterion Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to assess geological and mining condition nuisance in longwall mining operations in selected coal mines in Poland. For this purpose, a methodology has been developed which was used to calculate the operational nuisance indicator (WUe) in relation to the cost of mining coal in individual longwalls. Components of the aggregate operational nuisance indicator include four sub-indicators: the natural hazards indicator (UZN), an indicator describing the seam parameters (UPZ), an indicator describing the technical parameters (UT) and an environmental impact indicator (US). In total, the impact of 28 different criteria, which formed particular components of the nuisance indicators were analysed. In total 471 longwalls in 11 coal mines were analysed, including 277 longwalls that were mined in the period of 2011 to 2016 and 194 longwalls scheduled for exploitation in the years 2017 to 2021.
   Correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between nuisance and the operating costs of longwalls. The analysis revealed a strong correlation between the level of nuisance and the operating costs of the longwalls under study. The design of the longwall schedule should therefore also take into account the nuisance arising from the geological and mining conditions of the operations. Selective operations management allows for the optimization of costs for mining in underground mines using the longwall system. This knowledge can also be used to reduce the total operating costs of mines as a result of abandoning the mining operations in entire longwalls or portions of longwalls that may be permanently unprofitable. Currently, underground mines do not employ this optimization method, which even more emphasizes the need for popularizing this approach.

AB  - Bird community structure was studied in the Yuksam-Dzongri trekking corridor of the Sikkim Himalaya, India. Nineteen transects with a total of 266 samplings were made in the forests along the corridor during June 1997 to June 1999. Human utilised forest (open canopy forest) and relatively unutilised forest (closed canopy forest) were designated for the study at two ecological zones, i.e. lower forest (1780-2350 m a.s.l.) and upper forest (2350-3600 in) depending on the natural resources utilisation pattern by local community living in the area and for tourism purposes. There were visible changes in the open and closed canopy forests in diameters at breast height class distribution of trees leading to distinct variation in the habitat types. Among the 143 species of birds observed during the study, a handful of species were found as habitat specific and about 40% were common to all the four habitat types. Both bird species richness and diversity were higher at the open canopy conditions compared with closed canopy, but the differences were not statistically significant. On the other hand, both the indices showed strong and significant negative relationship with the elevation. These diversity indices were also significantly higher during the summer compared with the winter season. The open canopy conditions exhibited comparatively more species of birds that were perturbated by human settlements than those species found at the closed canopy (mostly forest interior) and vice versa. Though the study could not trace out the effect of patch size brought about by human caused disturbances, the Yuksam-Dzongri trekking corridor possesses diverse habitat types as well as bird species resulted from heterogeneous habitat conditions. It is therefore important to emphasise disturbance study for threshold level assessment so that generalists as well as forest interior species could be managed through conservation efforts.

AB  - Background and aims - Epiphytic diatoms are excellent bio-indicators of the present and past ecological condition of aquatic ecosystems. In order to reconstruct the diatom history and to evaluate its diversity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, epiphytic diatoms were sampled from herbarium specimens of aquatic plants deposited at the National Herbarium of the Congo at Yangambi (YBI) and at the herbarium of Meise Botanic Garden (BR).
   Material and methods - In YBI, nine specimens belonging to the Nymphaeaceae, three to the Ceratophyllaceae, and 12 to the Lentibulariaceae collected in the Central Forest phytogeographic region were sampled for diatom investigation. In addition, nine Nymphaea lotus specimens were sampled in BR. Semi-quantitative analyses were performed by light microscopy on permanent diatom slides.
   Key results - Analyses of the epiphytic diatom communities on YBI and BR materials showed a large diversity of 132 species belonging to 44 genera. Taxa belonging to the genus Eunotia were relatively the most abundant in all studied samples followed by Frustulia saxonica and a Desmogonium sp. The diatom communities on Nymphaea were as varied as on Ceratophyllum, while on Utricularia, a significant lower diversity was observed. The Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) and Generic Diatom Index (GDI) showed that the water quality in the Central Forest phytogeographic region was overall good during the 20th century. They point to oligotrophic conditions for the running waters with a slight increase towards more mesotrophic conditions from the 1950s onwards. The only sample in the present study indicating mesotrophic condition was from a swamp.
   Conclusions - The results on the epiphytic diatoms present on herbarium material can serve as a basis for sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems in D.R. Congo. In absence of an in-depth knowledge of the species and their ecological preferences, a genus-based TDI and IDG have proven to be valuable tools for water quality monitoring in tropical Africa.

AB  - High temperature stress during grain filling period in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has pronounced effects on yield in major wheat growing agro-ecological zones. The fast chlorophyll fluorescence transients expose the damage to leaf photosynthetic activity under high temperatures. The method relies on the functioning of photosynthetic apparatus of plants under stress; however, these transients have been studied in detached leaves under controlled conditions. Still no reports are available on the potential usefulness of chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics on intact wheat leaves for screening heat stress tolerant genotypes under field conditions. Hence, we conducted a study with the hypothesis that chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters and kinetics of plant-attached leaves under field conditions can be useful for screening of heat tolerant genotypes. The experimental population for testing the hypothesis consisted of 20 diverse wheat genotypes grown under timely and late sown environments (terminal heat stress) for two years. The results showed influence of high temperature on the expression of parameters F-o, F-v/F-o, F-v/F-m, and performance index. Analysis of the fast OJIP fluorescence transients indicated that the relative variable fluorescence between steps O and K and between steps O and J were related to high temperature stress tolerance. Five genotypes with consistent performance for better photosynthetic efficiency under thermal stress were observed. The inferences drawn from the present study supported our hypothesis that the analysis of chlorophyll a fluorescence transient parameters of plant attached leaves under field conditions can be used as a tool in the selection of wheat cultivars with better thermostability and functioning of photochemical reactions that could sustain photoassimilation and grain dry matter accumulation.

AB  - Flash-induced chlorophyll fluorescence relaxation is a powerful tool to monitor the reoxidation reactions of the reduced primary quinone acceptor, Q(A)(-) by Q(B) and the plastoquinone (PQ) pool, as well as the charge recombination reactions between the donor and acceptor side components of Photosystem II (PSII). Under certain conditions, when the PQ pool is highly reduced (e.g. in microaerobic conditions), a wave phenomenon appears in the fluorescence relaxation kinetics, which reflects the transient reoxidation and re-reduction of Q(A)(-) by various electron transfer processes, which in cyanobacteria is mediated by NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH-1). The wave phenomenon was also observed and assigned to the operation of type 2 NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH-2) in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under hydrogen-producing conditions, which required a long incubation of algae under sulphur deprivation (Krishna et al. J Exp Bot 70 (21):6321-6336, 2019). However, the conditions that induce the wave remained largely uncharacterized so far in microalgae. In this work, we investigated the wave phenomenon in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under conditions that lead to a decrease of PSII activity by applying hydroxylamine treatment, which impacts the donor side of PSII in combination with a strongly reducing environment of the PQ pool (microaerobic conditions). A similar wave phenomenon could be induced by photoinhibitory conditions (illumination with strong light in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor lincomycin). These results indicate that the fluorescence wave phenomenon is activated in green algae when the PSII activity decreases relative to Photosystem I (PS I) activity and the PQ pool is strongly reduced. Therefore, the fluorescence wave could be used as a sensitive indicator of altered intersystem electron transfer processes, e.g. under stress conditions.

AB  - The ABTS and DPPH methods are among the most popular assays of antioxidant activity determination. Attempts to adapt them to different analytes and the search for the highest values of antioxidant activity has resulted in a large variety of assay conditions to be presented in the literature, including the way the measurement is made. This makes it difficult to relate the results to real oxidation systems, and often makes it impossible to compare them. Such a comparison is limited in advance by the use of stable radicals that do not exist in nature and that react differently from those generated in food or in vivo. Therefore, it is important to introduce measures aimed at standardizing the conditions of the activity assay, including reaction time and several reaction environments suitable for testing different groups of compounds. In this study, we used natural antioxidants of various structures: phenolic acids, flavonoids, peptides and corresponding amino acids, ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol, and also synthetic analogues of selected compounds. The curves of dependence of the measured absorbance on the concentration of antioxidants were described, the ranges of linearity were determined, and the value of the error made when reading in various ranges of dependencies was estimated. We also determined and compared the activity values using two popular methods (IC50 and TEAC), taking into account different environments and reaction times. Based on the collected data, recommendations were formulated regarding the reaction conditions adapted to the studies of individual groups of antioxidants, and unified reaction times were proposed. Taking into account the state before reaching the equilibrium of antioxidants reacting in a complex manner, this approach may introduce a simplified reference to the competing reaction that occurs in reality.

AB  - In recent years increasing attention has been given to the potential use of contaminated lands for biofuel production, because these degraded soils cannot be used for food production. To establish these crops in Mediterranean contaminated areas, where the soil quality is usually very poor, the addition of soil amendments might be necessary to improve soil productivity. In addition, the use of crops with low water demands, adapted to these particular conditions of climate and soil contamination, is a key requirement. We studied the development of Cynara cardunculus and Silybum marianum crops (both suitable for the production of biomass for biofuel uses under a Mediterranean climate) in trace element contaminated soils under field conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first such work under these particular experimental conditions (soil contamination and field trial). Soil physical (hydraulic), chemical, and biochemical properties were monitored for one year in experimental plots, where we tested the effects of the addition of two different amendments (sugar lime and biosolid compost) on soil functioning and crop productivity. Seed germination and plant biomass production were low, although amendment addition improved both parameters. The chemical and biological indicators (enzyme activities, PLFA profiles, and soil respiration) tended to be slightly improved by the amendments, especially sugar lime. The hydraulic properties of the soil in the experimental area were very deficient, and the effect of the amendments was not enough to improve them; this was probably the main cause of the general low productivity of these rain-fed crops, as water infiltrated poorly through the root zone. To improve crop productivity under these soil conditions, certain aspects could be improved: higher doses of amendments should be applied and deeper tillage of the soil after amendment addition should be performed to facilitate water infiltration.

AB  - Oogenesis in fishes follows a universal plan; yet, due to differences in the synchrony and rate of egg development, spawning frequency varies from daily to once in a lifetime. Some species spawn and feed in separate areas, during different seasons, by storing energy and drawing on it later for reproduction (i.e. capital breeding). Other species spawn using energy acquired locally, throughout a prolonged spawning season, allocating energy directly to reproduction (i.e. income breeding). Capital breeders tend to ovulate all at once and are more likely to be distributed at boreal latitudes. Income breeding allows small fish to overcome allometric constraints on egg production. Income breeders can recover more quickly when good-feeding conditions are re-established, which is a benefit to adults regarding bet-hedging spawning strategies. Many species exhibit mixed capital- and income-breeding patterns. An individual's position along this capital-income continuum may shift with ontogeny or in relation to environmental conditions, so breeding patterns are a conditional reproductive strategy. Poor-feeding environments can lead to delayed maturation, skipped spawning, fewer spawning events per season or fewer eggs produced per event. In a few cases, variations in feeding environments appear to affect recruitment variability. These flexible processes of energy acquisition and allocation allow females to prioritize their own condition over their propagules' condition at any given spawning opportunity, thereby investing energy cautiously to maximize lifetime reproductive value. These findings have implications for temporal and spatial sampling designs, for measurement and interpretation of fecundity, and for interpreting fishery and ecosystem assessments.

AB  - In many animals, males display costly, condition-dependent ornaments to choosy females. Indicator models of sexual selection predict that females should choose mates based on natural variation in such traits. In Habronattus pyrrithrix jumping spiders, males have conspicuous, condition-dependent red faces and green legs that they display to cryptically coloured females during courtship. In a correlational study using field-collected spiders, we paired individual males with virgin females in the laboratory and found that natural variation in male coloration did not predict mating success (likelihood of copulation) or levels of female aggression. Rather, mating success was best predicted by male body condition. We then conducted an outdoor experiment under natural sunlight where we gave both virgin and mated females the choice between two simultaneously courting males, one with his facial coloration experimentally reduced and the other that received a sham treatment. Again, we found no relationship between male coloration and courtship success. Our previous studies have shown that the presence (versus absence) of red facial coloration improves courtship success, but here we found no evidence that more subtle natural variation in this trait has any effect on success. We discuss these findings in the context of complex signalling and species recognition in Habronattus. While many studies report negative results for condition-dependent quality signalling alongside positive ones, few discuss the implications of negative results. We argue that, as empirical data accumulate, we should move towards asking why some condition-dependent traits are consistently important to females while other equally condition-dependent traits are either ignored, or only matter in certain contexts.

AB  - A Vertisol gilgai complex from the North Caucasus, Russia, was studied to evaluate the climatic and environmental conditions governing pedogenesis. The stable isotope compositions of soil organic matter (SOM) and carbonate pedofeatures in the Vertisol record a complex, but interpretable, pedogenic history. Variability in the isotopic composition of pedogenic carbonate as a function of morphology, position in gilgai microrelief, and soil depth emphasizes the importance of these parameters to interpreting pedogenic conditions. The isotopic compositions and age of SOM record evidence of pedogenesis in an earlier (> 5000 yr BP) environment that was warmer and drier than modern conditions, with a significant component of C-4 flora (up to 30%). This portion of the soil history is preserved only in the deepest portions of the microlow (> 140 cm) or in the central portion of the microhigh chimney. A change to cooler and wetter conditions was accompanied by a shift to an ecosystem dominated by C; vegetation (> 95%) and resulted in a wetter soil environment, particularly in gilgai microlow positions. Most pedogenic carbonate preserves isotopic compositions reflecting only the more recent climate history. The wetter environment contributed to rectystallization of pedogenic carbonate nodules and formation of soft carbonate masses. There are systematic differences in the isotopic composition of hard nodules and soft masses that indicate the influence of greater soil water evaporation, a greater proportion of xerophytic plants, and/or lower rates of soil respiration in the gilgai microhighs. Self-consistent interpretation of the pedogenic and paleoclimate history of these Vertisols requires consideration of a full suite of information, including carbonate pedofeature micromorphology. the stable isotope composition and age (absolute and relative) of these features, and other soil characteristics.

AB  - The potential for wide-scale adoption of genetically engineered (GE) Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz in North America has raised ecological concerns of gene flow to its weedy relatives. The objectives of this study were to determine the pollen longevity, flowering phenology and seedbank persistence of C. sativa and congenic species. Percent pollen germination of all Camelina species was reduced with increasing temperature and exposure time. Pollen germination was not observed for all taxa after 72 h between 20-40 degrees C. Weather conditions had a significant effect on pollen longevity. Under cloudy conditions, all taxa pollen had a longer period of longevity (half-life: 0.6-0.8 h) than sunny conditions (0.3-0.4 h). Under both conditions, C. sativa, Camelina alyssum (Mill.) Thell., and Camelina microcarpa Andrz. Ex DC. pollen had a longer period of longevity than Camelina hispida var. grandiflora (Boiss.) Hedge, Camelina laxa C. A. Mey, and Camelina rumelica Velen., but pollen germination was not observed after 5 h exposure. The flowering phenology of C. sativa, C. microcarpa, and C. alyssum behaved similarly, which was different from C. hispida, C. laxa, and C. rumelica. Flowering synchrony among taxa was observed, facilitating pollen-mediated gene flow among taxa. Seeds of C. sativa, C. alyssum, and C. microcarpa did not exhibit dormancy in the soil, but the germination ability of C. sativa throughout the growing season raises the ecological concerns of gene flow from C. sativa volunteers. This new information on pollen longevity, flowering phenology, and seedbank persistence will be helpful for creating containment and coexistence strategies between GE and Non-GE C. sativa, isolating field trials, and managing GE C. sativa volunteers associated weed problems.

AB  - Despite covering only 2-6% of land, wetland ecosystems play an important role at the local and global scale. They provide various ecosystem services (carbon dioxide sequestration, pollution removal, water retention, climate regulation, etc.) as long as they are in good condition. By definition, wetlands are rich in water ecosystems. However, ongoing climate change with an ambiguous balance of rain in a temperate climate zone leads to drought conditions. Such periods interfere with the natural processes occurring on wetlands and restrain the normal functioning of wetland ecosystems. Persisting unfavorable water conditions lead to irreversible changes in wetland habitats. Hence, the monitoring of habitat changes caused by an insufficient amount of water (plant water stress) is necessary. Unfortunately, due to the specific conditions of wetlands, monitoring them by both traditional and remote sensing techniques is challenging, and research on wetland water stress has been insufficient. This paper describes the adaptation of the thermal water stress index, also known as the crop water stress index (CWSI), for wetlands. This index is calculated based on land surface temperature and meteorological parameters (temperature and vapor pressure deficit-VPD). In this study, an unmanned aerial system (UAS) was used to measure land surface temperature. Performance of the CWSI was confirmed by the high correlation with field measurements of a fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (R = -0.70) and soil moisture (R = -0.62). Comparison of the crop water stress index with meteorological drought indices showed that the first phase of drought (meteorological drought) cannot be detected with this index. This study confirms the potential of using the CWSI as a water stress indicator in wetland ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding the extent to which natural streamflow characteristics have been altered is an important consideration for ecological assessments of streams. Assessing hydrologic condition requires that we quantify the attributes of the flow regime that would be expected in the absence of anthropogenic modifications. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether selected streamflow characteristics could be predicted at regional and national scales using geospatial data. Long-term, gaged river basins distributed throughout the contiguous US that had streamflow characteristics representing least disturbed or near pristine conditions were identified. Thirteen metrics of the magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and rate of change of streamflow were calculated using a 20-50 year period of record for each site. We used random forests (RF), a robust statistical modelling approach, to develop models that predicted the value for each streamflow metric using natural watershed characteristics. We compared the performance (i.e. bias and precision) of national-and regional-scale predictive models to that of models based on landscape classifications, including major river basins, ecoregions and hydrologic landscape regions (HLR). For all hydrologic metrics, landscape stratification models produced estimates that were less biased and more precise than a null model that accounted for no natural variability. Predictive models at the national and regional scale performed equally well, and substantially improved predictions of all hydrologic metrics relative to landscape stratification models. Prediction error rates ranged from 15 to 40%, but were <= 25% for most metrics. We selected three gaged, non-reference sites to illustrate how predictive models could be used to assess hydrologic condition. These examples show how the models accurately estimate pre-disturbance conditions and are sensitive to changes in streamflow variability associated with long-term land-use change. We also demonstrate how the models can be applied to predict expected natural flow characteristics at ungaged sites. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Glutamine plays a key role in the metabolism of rapidly dividing cells, including enterocytes and lymphocytes, which may contribute to its beneficial clinical effects. Gut mucosal homeostasis is achieved through a balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis. In T cells, glutamine up-regulates antiapoptotic proteins and down-regulates proapoptotic proteins. In gut mucosa, glutamine prevents apoptosis in rat epithelial cell lines, whereas glutamine starvation induces apoptosis through caspase activation. Finally glutamine specifically prevents tumor necrosis factor-alpha-related apoptosis in the human intestinal cell line HT-29. Comparative functional proteomics enables the characterization of each differentially expressed protein in intestinal cells in response to modifications of nutritional environment. The influence of glutamine on intestinal proteome expression in apoptotic conditions has not been studied and evaluated. This comparative proteomics study was performed in the human epithelial intestinal cell line HCT-8 under experimental apoptotic conditions to investigate the influence of glutamine on protein expression during apoptosis. The pharmaconutritional effects of glutamine were determined under 2 mM ( physiological concentration) and 10 mM ( pharmaconutritional concentration) conditions. About 1,800 protein spots were revealed in both conditions. Comparative assessments indicated that 28 proteins were differentially expressed significantly (i. e. at least 2-fold modulated and Student's t test with p <= 0.05) in response to an increase of glutamine concentration in the culture medium. Twenty-four proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and associated databases. From these proteins, 34% are involved in cell cycle and apoptosis mechanisms, 17% are involved in signal transduction, and 13% are involved in cytoskeleton organization. These data were integrated in a proposed schema of the interactome under apoptotic conditions. In conclusion, this by glutamine in a human enterocytic cell line under apoptotic conditions and supports further evaluation of nutritional modulation of human intestinal proteome in various pathological conditions where apoptosis may be involved.

AB  - The regions of Durham and York in Ontario, Canada have partnered to construct an energy-from-waste (EFW) thermal treatment facility as part of a long term strategy for the management of their municipal solid waste. In this paper we present the results of a comprehensive ecological risk assessment (ERA) for this planned facility, based on baseline sampling and site specific modeling to predict facility-related emissions, which was subsequently accepted by regulatory authorities. Emissions were estimated for both the approved initial operating design capacity of the facility (140,000 tonnes per year) and the maximum design capacity (400,000 tonnes per year). In general, calculated ecological hazard quotients (EHQs) and screening ratios (SRs) for receptors did not exceed the benchmark value (1.0). The only exceedances noted were generally due to existing baseline media concentrations, which did not differ from those expected for similar unimpacted sites in Ontario. This suggests that these exceedances reflect conservative assumptions applied in the risk assessment rather than actual potential risk. However, under predicted upset conditions at 400,000 tonnes per year (i.e., facility start-up, shutdown, and loss of air pollution control), a potential unacceptable risk was estimated for freshwater receptors with respect to benzo(g,h,i)perylene (SR = 1.1), which could not be attributed to baseline conditions. Although this slight exceedance reflects a conservative worst-case scenario (upset conditions coinciding with worst-case meteorological conditions), further investigation of potential ecological risk should be performed if this facility is expanded to the maximum operating capacity in the future.

AB  - Complex socio-ecological problems typically involve a variety of stakeholders, with viewpoints that may range between consensus and deep disagreement over values and judgments. Understanding this distribution of opinion is key to finding conservation solutions. We examine how stakeholders with widely different backgrounds vary in their judgments of rangeland degradation in Mongolia's Gobi Desert, where grazing intensity is a contested issue. We gathered the judgments of 92 stakeholders from a highly diverse group including: (i) nomadic pastoralists (herders), (ii) experts in botany, (iii) experts in wildlife ecology, and (iv) conservation policy practitioners. These stakeholders considered degradation in five ecosystems including Desert shrublands, Steppe, and Siberian Elm riparian woodlands, using written site descriptions in a workshop context. Each stakeholder considered degradation using two conceptual frameworks: the notion of "ecosystem collapse" described by the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems and the concept of ecological condition. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to examine the relationship between vegetation attributes and stakeholder judgments of condition. Although individual stakeholder varied in their judgments, we found only relatively small systematic variations between different types of stakeholders. Similarly, we found the degree of specialization of experts had little effect on the condition score. We also used GAMs to examine the relationship between vegetation attributes and stakeholder judgments of collapse, finding little variation between groups. We also explored the threshold of overall vegetation cover where stakeholders are likely to shift their judgment from collapsed to not collapsed, and while differences between ecosystems were observed, we found consensus between the different stakeholder groups within each ecosystem. Our results suggest that, at least in the context of the Southern Mongolia, diverse stakeholder groups have convergent views in respect to ecological degradation.

AB  - Long-term declines in abundance of wild Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, L. have been linked to reductions in marine survivorship, and recent reductions in growth condition (a measure of fish quality) have been correlated to increased mid-winter sea-surface temperature anomalies in the eastern North Atlantic. Establishing a causal link between marine climate and salmon somatic condition is difficult without at-sea measurements of environmental and biological parameters, but electronically tagging these animals to obtain this information is also difficult and costly. The stable isotope composition of oxygen and carbon in the sequential layers of salmon otoliths can provide a basis for retrospective studies of the thermal, metabolic and dietary histories of individual fish. We used high resolution delta O-18 and delta C-13 profiles obtained using secondary ion mass spectrometry to compare the marine thermal and metabolic behaviour of 1 sea-winter return-migrant adult salmon. Seasonal and ontogenetic patterns in delta O-18 and delta C-13 values dominated isotope variation, although there were marked differences between individual profiles, indicating the potential for large differences in individual migration routes. There was no significant relationship between isotope variation and adult condition. Constructed thermal profiles provided plausible data, but the present uncertainty in otolith thermometry parameters for an open-ocean fish such as Atlantic salmon preclude firm conclusions based on these estimates. Marine life-history variation in otolith delta C-13 is likely driven by ontogenetic changes, both in diet and metabolism with size. A marked and rapid decrease in the delta C-13 values of some fish in the last month(s) of the marine migration could be an indicator of physiological changes occurring during the homing migration.

AB  - Question
   Is it possible to translate vegetation maps into reliable thematic maps of site conditions?
   Method
   This paper presents a new method, called Iteratio, by which a coherent spatial overview of specific environmental conditions can be obtained from a comprehensive vegetation survey of a specific area. Iteratio is a database application which calculates environmental indicator values for vegetation samples (releves) on the basis of known indicator values of a limited number of plant species. The outcome is then linked to a digitalized vegetation map (map of plant communities) which results in a spatial overview of site conditions.
   Iteratio requires the indicator values of a minimum of 10-20% of the species occurring. The species are given a relative weight according to their amplitudes: species with a narrow range are weighted stronger, species with a broad range are weighted weaker.
   Conclusion
   The method presented here enables a coherent assessment of site conditions on the basis of a vegetation survey and the indicator values of a limited number of plant species.

AB  - Illicit fentanyl is a well known contributor to the ongoing opioid crisis. The ability to take either protective action or administer medical countermeasures can be predicated on the ability to detect even minute concentrations. For this reason, a fast, accurate, and cost effective method for fentanyl detection in the field is necessary. State of the art methods tend to be large and expensive powered electronics that limit their wide dissemination. Alter-native methods of detection include laminar flow immunoassays (LFIs) and colorimetric indicators. Many of these tests have been evaluated for potential field use under laboratory conditions. However, none of these studies have evaluated them under environmentally relevant conditions, mainly temperature and humidity, that may be encountered in the field. These environmental conditions may affect the limits of detection or cross reactivity of the test, and ultimately the user's interpretation of and response to the result. Here we assess the effect of five environmental conditions on the responses of two LFI tests and one colorimetric test to six fentanyl analogues and five cross reactivity standards.

AB  - This paper arose from collaboration and discussions over the past years between the authors about what wetlands should be restored to in landscapes that have been intensively altered due to human activities over many centuries and where reference conditions are lacking. It is not intended as an in-depth review of the thinking about reference conditions, but as an opinion paper, with the goal of stimulating discussions about wetland restoration approaches, particularly in regions around the world with highly altered landscapes where restoration of wetlands has been gaining traction only relatively recently. We first explain why the thinking on reference wetlands is biased towards North America, where large areas exist with wetlands that are relatively unimpacted by anthropogenic activities. We then argue that in regions with few unimpaired wetlands those of fair condition may still be good enough to be used as reference wetlands, and that restored and created wetlands should be considered as well.

AB  - We investigated the hypothesis that different environmental conditions during postnatal development influence the levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in pigs (Sus scrofa f. domestica). Two groups of pigs were reared under different air quality conditions in order to determine the effects on FA of sixteen skeletal characters. We performed standardized measurements of the radius, tibia, third metacarpal, and third metatarsal bones and calculated three different indices of FA. Pigs raised under suboptimal air quality conditions had a significantly lower body mass than the other group. Our results show that there was a significantly higher value of FA in the group reared under suboptimal environmental conditions in only one out of sixteen characters, i.e. distal breadth of the third metatarsal. We found that values of FA vary among postcranial skeletal characters of pigs, but the effects of environmental conditions on FA of various other characters in pigs should be explored in further studies.

KW  - WHITE
AB  - Youths have increasingly experienced labor market problems over the last several decades. One fruitful line of explanation focuses on structural changes in the demand for labor stemming from deindustrialization, changing skill requirements for employees, and increasing supply competition from women and recent immigrants. While these explanations merit attention, they have not adequately considered factors that condition their impact. This paper considers the argument that intra-metropolitan residential location conditions the effects of metropolitan labor market structure on black and white male youths' employment probabilities. Using a sample of individual-level data drawn from the 1990 census combined with metropolitan-level indicators of economic structure, it was found that some structural effects varied between central-city and suburban male youths. The conditioning role of residential location, and the subsequent nature of the structural effects, varied considerably between black and white male youths. Interpretations of the conditioning role of residential location include a variety of social and institutional effects on individual residents and the stigmatizing effects of some neighborhoods, especially on black male youths.

KW  - laminar and turbulent flow
AB  - Based on the known relations governing flow resistance of a tube during laminar and turbulent flow and the value of the so-called Reynold's number the following conclusions were derived: 1. The flow resistance of airways increases under hyperbaric conditions because a) the turbulent flow participates in the airways to a greater extent due to its gradual extension to minor airways, and b) during turbulent flow the flow resistance is directly proportional to the pressure of the inhaled gas. 2. If the pressure in the surrounding environment increases n-times, this has an impact on the distribution of laminar and turbulent flow in the airways and their flow resistance, similarly as if the flow rates would increase n-times under normobaric conditions. 3. Dynamic indicators of lung ventilation corresponding to higher flow rates (e.g. PEF - peak expiratory flow) are reduced under hyperbaric conditions to a greater extent than the dynamic parameters corresponding to lower flow rates (e.g. FMEF(25-75) - forced midexpiratory flow) determined usually by conditions in the minor airways, where the flow usually remains laminar or intermediate.

AB  - Many companies embrace Industry 4.0 technologies to enable operational sustainability against increasing climate change effects, decreasing natural resources, and raising consumer awareness of environmental issues. Even though readiness and maturity assessment of smartness and sustainability concepts are nested, no study simultaneously focuses on these concepts. As pioneering research, we propose a novel model titled "Smart and Sustainable Supply chain Readiness and Maturity model (S3RM)" and validate it by conducting a case study in the automotive industry. We design our model upon the triple-bottom-line (TBL) approach consisting of smartness and sustainability dime5nsions. Our study introduces the TBL of smartness covering availability, integrity, and adaptability sub-dimension. TBL of sustainability includes social, environmental, and economic sub-dimensions. The proposed model calculates the Smart and Sustainable Readiness and Maturity Index by averaging sustainability scores' summation and smartness scores' multiplication. Each sub-dimension consists of items measured by a readiness and maturity scale. The findings suggest how smartness and sustainability items create strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for the supply chain operations. Our model provides managerial implications in assessing the readiness and maturity of Industry 4.0 tools and sustainability indicators. This study offers a road map to managers on smart and sustainable supply chains' defined target areas.

AB  - Chlorinated hydrocarbons have been widely utilized due to their excellent physical properties and stability as solvents, coolants, propellants or raw materials etc. One of major problems in disposing of them is safe destruction or collection of recyclable components. One of most feasible methods for waste chlorinated organics is thermal treatment. In this study, experimental and theoretical analyses have been tried to investigate several fundamental operating parameters including temperature, residence time and background conditions like existence of oxygen. Vinyl chloride and trichloroethylene (TCE) were tested to observe their reaction mechanism. Vinyl chloride started to decompose at 725 degrees C, and 99% of initial amount was decomposed at 820 degrees C, 1 sec in pyrolytic environment, produing C2H2 and HCl mainly and C2HCI, C2H4, H-2 as byproducts depending on experimental conditions. TCE, on the other hand, produced C2Cl2, C2Cl4, HCl at pyrolytic conditions and CO and CO, additionally through COCl radical reactions at oxidative conditions. The supply of oxygen lowered the destruction temperature of TCE and C2Cl4 could be considered as an indirect indicator of TCE decomposition.

AB  - This study examined the perceived impacts of the Integrated Social Forestry Program (ISFP) on the biophysical and socio-economic conditions of farmers in Barangay Patag, Silay City, Negros Occidental, Philippines. Specifically, it aimed to: (a) assess the perceived impacts of ISFP on local livelihood, income, forest condition, and equity (LIFE); and (b) identify the factors that are associated with perceived equity; and (c) determine the relationships between perceived equity and ISFP goals. Data were gathered through surveys and a focused group discussion. A total of 41 respondents composed the survey, while six key informants comprised the focused discussion group. Key findings showed that ISFP was perceived to have considerable beneficial impacts on livelihood and income sources. It also had positive impacts on forest condition particularly in the perceived increased of forest cover. Some beneficial impacts were likewise noted for equity across dimensions: gender; education; economic status; and membership. Finally, challenges in sustaining the program underscored the need for strategies to further enhance its positive impacts on the local community's socio-ecological conditions.

AB  - We introduce new statistical methods for analyzing genomic data sets that measure many effects in many conditions (for example, gene expression changes under many treatments). These new methods improve on existing methods by allowing for arbitrary correlations in effect sizes among conditions. This flexible approach increases power, improves effect estimates and allows for more quantitative assessments of effect-size heterogeneity compared to simple shared or condition-specific assessments. We illustrate these features through an analysis of locally acting variants associated with gene expression (cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) in 44 human tissues. Our analysis identifies more eQTLs than existing approaches, consistent with improved power. We show that although genetic effects on expression are extensively shared among tissues, effect sizes can still vary greatly among tissues. Some shared eQTLs show stronger effects in subsets of biologically related tissues (for example, brain-related tissues), or in only one tissue (for example, testis). Our methods are widely applicable, computationally tractable for many conditions and available online.

AB  - Novelty conditions may elicit stress responses. First session effects are systematic changes in physiological parameters, resulting from the interference of physiological processes with novelty stress. Along with endocrinological changes, these stress responses may be accompanied by alterations of sensory and attentional processes. The present study examines the impact of novelty conditions on event-related potential indicators of auditory information processing and on cortisol. Twenty-two healthy subjects participated in a series of experimental sessions. Auditory-evoked potentials were recorded, and the plasma cortisol levels were determined. The first session causes an activation of the hypothalamo-hypopituitary-adrenal axis. The auditory-evoked potentials show an additional slow negative potential component in the novelty condition. This potential component is maximal at fronto-central electrode sites and reaches its peak at about 240 ms after stimulus onset. Similarities with the processing negativity suggest alterations in attention-related auditory information-processing in the novelty condition encountered in the first session.

AB  - Non-point-source pollution is an increasing source of stress to aquatic, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. Such pollution may be of unknown etiology, distributed over extensive spatial scales, and comprised of multiple stressors. Current stressor-based paradigms for ecological risk assessment (ERA) may be insufficient to characterize risk from multiple stressors at regional spatial scales, necessitating the use of effects-based approaches. Historical data (1984-1999) for benthic macroinvertebrate biodiversity in Chesapeake Bay, USA, were incorporated into a geographic information system (GIS) and spatial analysis tools were used to model zones within the bay predicted to be of low or high anthropogenic impact. Data for benthic water quality and sediment toxicant concentrations from each of these zones were subsequently analyzed and compared to identify associations between benthic biodiversity and potential stressors. A number of stressors were significantly associated with high-impact zones, including increased nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, low dissolved oxygen, heavy metals, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated biphenyls. The spatial autocorrelation among multiple stressors suggests that traditional stressor-based approaches to ERA may result in the a priori exclusion of ecologically relevant stressors. Considering the effects of individual stressors rather than net effects of multiple stressors may result in underestimation of risk. The GISs are a useful tool for integrating multiple data sets in support of comprehensive regional ERA.

AB  - Interest in the development of shale gas resources using hydraulic fracturing techniques is increasing worldwide despite concerns about the environmental risks associated with this activity. In the United Kingdom (UK), early attempts to hydraulically fracture a shale gas well resulted in a seismic event that led to the suspension of all hydraulic fracturing operations. In response to this occurrence, UK regulators have requested that future shale gas operations that use hydraulic fracturing should be accompanied by a high-level environmental risk assessment (ERA). Completion of an ERA can demonstrate competency, communicate understanding, and ultimately build trust that environmental risks are being managed properly, however, this assessment requires a scientific evidence base. In this paper we discuss how the ERA became a preferred assessment technique to understand the risks related to shale gas development in the UK, and how it can be used to communicate information between stakeholders. We also provide a review of the evidence base that describes the environmental risks related to shale gas operations, which could be used to support an ERA. Finally, we conclude with an update of the current environmental risks associated with shale gas development in the UK and present recommendations for further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Relevance. The studies are determined by the need to find the sensitive technogenesis indicators, which elemental composition can show the ecological and geochemical situation of the territory. Mercury have negative toxicological influence on living organism. Biological objects at the beginning of food chain could be informative and objective indicators of environmental situation and can have important information for further predictions.
   The aim of the research is to determine the indicator abilities of Lemnaceae family aquatic plants to the ecological and geochemical situation of various urbanized territories in Russia by studying concentration of mercury.
   Objects: an aquatic plant of the duckweed family (Lemnaceae), characterized by widespread occurrence, high biomass growth rate and tolerance to climatic environmental conditions.
   Methodology. The study was carried out according to a single methodology in 65 settlements from 46 regions of the Russian Federation. The determination of gross mercury in duckweed was carried out by atomic absorption spectrometry.
   Results. The role of aquatic plant of the duckweed family as a geo-indicator of technogenesis is considered. The distribution of mercury in macrophyte from the study area was discovered, the average mercury content in duckweed for Russia (average median - 14,7 ng/g, arithmetic average - 18 ng/g) was calculated. The abnormally high concentrations of mercury were determined in an aquatic plant from the Stavlopol Krai, the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania and Bashkorkostan, Kirov and Kemerovo Regions. The ecological and geochemical situation in these territories may be influenced by technogenic factors, such as chlorine-hydroxide production. The regional specificity of the Tomsk region were studied individually. The influence of the Northern industrial zone was particularly studied there.

AB  - Policies and actions that come from higher scale structures, such as international bodies and national governments, are not always compatible with the realities and perspectives of smaller scale units including indigenous communities. Yet, it is at this local social-ecological scale that mechanisms and solutions for dealing with unpredictability and change can be increasingly seen emerging from across the world. Although there is a large body of knowledge specifying the conditions necessary to promote local governance of natural resources, there is a parallel need to develop practical methods for operationalizing the evaluation of local social-ecological systems. In this paper, we report on a systemic, participatory, and visual approach for engaging local communities in an exploration of their own social-ecological system. Working with indigenous communities of the North Rupununi, Guyana, this involved using participatory video and photography within a system viability framework to enable local participants to analyze their own situation by defining indicators of successful strategies that were meaningful to them. Participatory multicriteria analysis was then used to arrive at a short list of best practice strategies. We present six best practices and show how they are intimately linked through the themes of indigenous knowledge, local governance and values, and partnerships and networks. We highlight how developing shared narratives of community owned solutions can help communities to plan governance and management of land and resource systems, while reinforcing sustainable practices by discussing and showcasing them within communities, and by engendering a sense of pride in local solutions.

AB  - Landscape transition drives environmental change across the globe. However, landscape and its change are complex with high spatial heterogeneity, which challenges strategic decision-making.
   This paper aims to derive management meaningful units based on landscape status and change analysis and the generalization of landscape spatial heterogeneity.
   Based on contrasting cases from Finland (Vanajavesi) and China (Baota District), this paper analyzed the landscape attributes and change since 2000. A k-means clustering approach was used to generalize the landscape types based on indicators of landscape composition and its change, spatial pattern, population, and income.
   Most significant change in land covers was the expansion of artificial surfaces, and the bi-directional transitions between agricultural areas and forests and semi-natural areas in Vanajavesi, while the expansion of artificial land and shrinkage of cropland were most significant in Baota District. Larger changes in landscape metrics were also observed in Baota District. Finally, three landscape clusters were generalized in both of the case areas. For each cluster, the landscapes and their change characteristics were interpreted as pertinent to the average land cover pattern and its change and socioeconomic conditions. Brief landscape management recommendations were also given for the resulting clusters.
   This paper contributes to enriching the understanding of the analysis and management of landscape spatial heterogeneity based on the information from both landscape status and change. The contrasting case analyses from an international perspective indicate the usefulness of clustering approach in accommodating spatial heterogeneity, which imply a regionalized need for landscape monitoring, assessment, and management.

AB  - The objective of ecological engineering is to design sustainable ecosystems that integrate human communities and their natural environment for the benefit of both. In this paper, we illustrate how social-ecological modeling can be used as a tool to clarify this objective at a landscape scale for freshwater systems. Coupled social-ecological systems (SESs) are open, dynamic systems subject to both ecological and socioeconomic perturbations. Here we demonstrate the interactive effects of social and technological uncertainties on SES dynamics over time. Additionally, we integrate research on ecosystem stability, social-ecological modeling, and ecological engineering to offer guidance for research at the human-environment interface. Based on a case study of Lake Erie's Sandusky watershed, we use an integrated human-biophysical model to investigate the influence of two parameters on SES dynamics: (1) regional societal preferences that impact watershed management and (2) technological innovation that alters agricultural nutrient efficiency. Our results illustrate ways in which SES dynamics and optimum management strategies depend on societal preferences within the region, indicating a key area of uncertainty for future investigation. As guidance for SES restoration, our model results also illustrate the conditions under which technological change that increases nutrient efficiency on farms can and cannot create a win-win, or increase both human welfare and SES resistance to eutrophication simultaneously. Using these results, we elucidate the value of ecological engineering and offer guidance for assessments of ecological engineering projects using social-ecological modeling. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to establish a fish-based typology of Italian lakes and identify possible reference and indicator fish species for each lake type, we analysed historical data on fish assemblages of all Italian natural lakes > 0.5 km(2) from the period prior to the major decline in water quality in the 1950s. General linear regression models showed the ecoregion and lake altitude being the best predictors of fish species richness. The number of species was significantly higher in the Alpine than in the Mediterranean ecoregion. Among Alpine lakes, the number of fish species increased significantly with lake volume whilst decreased with altitude. In the Mediterranean lakes, none of the selected parameters was significant. Cluster analysis of fish assemblages (presence/absence) divided the lakes of the Alpine and Mediterranean ecoregions into four and two types, respectively. Pike (Esox lucius), rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) and tench (Tinca tinca) were the main indicator species for the small and mostly shallow lakes in both the Alpine (Type 1) and Mediterranean (Type 6) ecoregions, minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) for the alpine high altitude lakes (Type 2) and landlocked shad (Alosa fallax lacustris), European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and burbot (Lota lota) for the large and very deep alpine lakes (Type 4). The European whitefish was the only indicator species for the deep Mediterranean lakes (Type 5). These species and associated fish assemblages may be useful indicators in future assessments of the ecological status of Italian lakes according to the European Directives (2000/60/EC and 2008/105/EC).

AB  - The advance of medical technology and the change in living environment gradually prolong the life expectancy of humans to constantly increase the elderly population in the world. Relevant demands and problems derived from aging are therefore getting emphasized. To cope with the elderly needs, the government sequentially promotes welfare service. Nevertheless, it is still discovered that the welfare service use rate of the elderly is rather low, not achieving the estimated demand. Aiming at the elderly in Guilin, the data in this study are collected and analyzed from social welfare related open information platforms and the analyses and research, publications, or database of government agencies. The relevant data are integrated, analyzed, discussed, and applied to understand the effects of indicators and further activate the utilization of data. The research results show remarkable correlations between redisposing factors and service use condition, enabling factors and service use condition, and demand factors and service use condition. According to the results, suggestions are proposed, expecting to comprehensively understand the elderly social welfare service use conditions and identify the factors in the elderly service use so as to examine the match of the elderly welfare service with the elderly needs to develop the maximal function of social welfare service.

AB  - Three types of glaucony grains were identified in the late Eocene (similar to 35.5-34.1 Ma) sediments from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 696B in the northwestern Weddell Sea (Antarctica). The grains are K2O-rich (similar to 7 wt%) and formed by smectite-poor interstratified similar to 10 angstrom glauconite-smectite with flaky/rosette-shaped surface nanostructures. Two glaucony types reflect an evolved (types 1 and 2 glaucony; less mature to mature) stage and long term glauconitization, attesting to the glaucony grains being formed in situ, whereas the third type (type 3 glaucony) shows evidences of alteration and reworking from nearby areas. Conditions for the glaucony authigenesis occurred in an open-shelf environment deeper than 50 m, under sub-oxic conditions near the sediment-water interface. These environmental conditions were triggered by low sedimentation rates and recurrent winnowing action by bottom-currents, leading to stratigraphic condensation. The condensed glaucony-bearing section provides an overview of continuous sea-level rise conditions pre-dating the onset of Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Sediment burial, drop of O-2 levels, and ongoing reducing (postoxic to sulphidic) conditions at Hole 696B, resulting in iron-sulphide precipitation, were a key limiting factor for the glauconitization by sequestration of Fe2+.

AB  - The aim of this study is to test a spatially explicit statistical model to identify indicators of natural stream flow using readily available stream, climate and landscape data. Understanding flow behavior of unmonitored streams at different temporal scales using environmental indicators is of great interest considering the logistic constraints of providing comprehensive flow instrumentation for all stream reaches in a region. Our results have applications to assess human impact in watersheds, to study environmental changes in fresh water resources, and in the management of local ecosystem. This study uses classification and regression tree analysis to identify significant explanatory variables for a predictive model of stream flow in semi-arid watersheds of southern California, USA. The study collected 77 variables with 30 years record, for a set of 48 sites, interpolated to create raster files at 30m spatial resolution. After applying Pearson correlation analyses to eliminate redundant variables, nine variables were found to have strong positive predictive value for estimating stream flow at ungauged sites. Nine prediction rasters portraying spatial variation of stream flow for the study region at three key index months during wet, dry, and average rainfall conditions. The predictive power of the variables was tested and cross validated over a subset of data not included when building the model. Model validation by site at monthly temporal resolution showed mixed results. While some sites where accurately predicted others did not. The comparison of observed vs predicted values by month suggest that this statistically based approach is able to predict the general patterns of stream flow at the regional scale, however it may be inaccurate in estimating actual flow values by month since the models tends to under-predict monthly discharge.

AB  - Amplification of global warming in Arctic and boreal regions is causing significant changes to permafrost-affected landscapes. The nature and extent of the change is complicated by ecological responses that take place across strong gradients in environmental conditions and disturbance regimes. Emerging remote sensing techniques based on a growing array of satellite and airborne platforms that cover a wide range of spatial and temporal scales increasingly allow robust detection of changes in permafrost landscapes. In this review, we summarise recent developments (2010-15) in remote sensing applications to detect and monitor landscape changes involving surface temperatures, snow cover, topography, surface water, vegetation cover and structure, and disturbances from fire and human activities. We then focus on indicators of degrading permafrost, including thermokarst lakes and drained lake basins, thermokarst bogs and fens, thaw slumps and active-layer detachment slides, thermal erosion gullies, thermokarst pits and troughs, and coastal erosion and flooding. Our review highlights the expanding sensor capabilities, new image processing and multivariate analysis techniques, enhanced public access to data and increasingly long image archives that are facilitating novel insights into the multi-decadal dynamics of permafrost landscapes. Remote sensing methods that appear especially promising for change detection include: repeat light detection and ranging, interferometric synthetic aperture radar and airborne geophysics for detecting topographic and subsurface changes; temporally dense analyses at high spatial resolution; and multi-sensor data fusion. Remotely sensed data are also becoming used more frequently as driving parameters in permafrost model and mapping schemes. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The ecological reaction of species on environmental factors can differ both, temporally and geographically. Therefore, bioindicator systems must be shown to remain accurate at different places and points of time. Extreme events pose challenges for testing this robustness, which has not yet been explored systematically. The unique opportunity of the extreme flooding of the river Elbe in August 2002 was used for such a test. The bioindicator system for mean groundwater depth during the vegetation period and annual duration of inundation in floodplains studied here was developed with data collected in 1999. Data from 2003 were used to analyse the dependence of the bioindication results on the humidity of the study plots and taxonomic group (plants, molluscs and carabid beetles). For the duration of inundation, the accuracy of bioindication in 2003 was similar to that in 1999, except for the medium-humid and dry plots using molluscs as indicators. For groundwater depth, the accuracy of bioindication in 2003 was similar to that of the reference year except in the dry plots with significantly lower accuracy for all species groups. With a few exceptions, the bioindicator system is shown to be robust and to remain accurate in spite of an extreme flood event. In conclusion, the relevance of extreme events for the robustness of bioindicator systems differs between the indicated parameters and taxonomic groups. The results stress the need to take into account the limits of the working range and the occurrence of extreme events, when testing and applying bioindicator systems.

AB  - Knowledge about the ecology of urban water systems is very scarce. We assessed the conservation value of urban drainage systems in lowland areas and compared these with similar watercourses in rural areas. A total of 36 water bodies in urban areas were selected to investigate the macroinvertebrate biodiversity in relation to environmental variables. Multivariate analysis of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages was used to distinguish urban water types and to link these types to key environmental variables. Several biodiversity indices for urban water systems were compared with those for other drainage systems in The Netherlands. Four types of macroinvertebrate assemblages were distinguished in the urban water systems, differing in environmental conditions and values of ecological indicators. The variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages was significantly explained by nitrate, pH, grain size (sediment composition), transparency, nymphaeid and submerged vegetation. Urban drainage systems can sustain a macroinvertebrate biodiversity comparable to that of drainage systems in rural areas (ditches and canals) and (semi)natural watercourses (lotic waters such as small streams and rivulets) and can even be a habitat for red list species. To optimize biodiversity values, urban water management should aim at lowering nutrient levels, stimulating vegetation (diversity of habitat structure) and increasing transparency, which are key factors for macroinvertebrate diversity. We show the potential conservation benefits of water systems in urban areas, but further studies are needed to investigate the optimal design of cities to include biodiversity as an integrated part of the urban environment, thereby sustaining a higher biodiversity in an increasingly urbanizing world.

AB  - Coral reef communities are threatened worldwide. Resource managers urgently need indicators of the biological condition of reef environments that can relate data acquired through remote-sensing, water-quality and benthic-community monitoring to stress responses in reef organisms. The "FORAM" (Foraminifera in Reef Assessment and Monitoring) Index (FI) is based on 30 years of research on reef sediments and reef-dwelling larger foraminifers. These shelled protists are ideal indicator organisms because:
   . Foraminifers are widely used as environmental and paleoenvironmental indicators in many contexts;
   . Reef-building, zooxanthellate corals and foraminifers with algal symbionts have similar water-quality requirements;
   . The relatively short life spans of foraminifers as compared with long-lived colonial corals facilitate differentiation between long-term water-quality decline and episodic stress events;
   . Foraminifers are relatively small and abundant, permitting statistically significant sample sizes to be collected quickly and relatively inexpensively, ideally as a component of comprehensive monitoring programs; and
   . Collection of foraminifers has minimal impact on reef resources.
   USEPA guidelines for ecological indicators are used to evaluate the FI. Data required are foraminiferal assemblages from surface sediments of reef-associated environments. The FI provides resource managers with a simple procedure for determining the suitability of benthic environments for communities dominated by algal symbiotic organisms. The FI can be applied independently, or incorporated into existing or planned monitoring efforts. The simple calculations require limited computer capabilities and therefore can be applied readily to reef-associated environments worldwide. In addition, the foraminiferal shells collected can be subjected to morphometric and geochemical analyses in areas of suspected heavy-metal pollution, and the data sets for the index can be used with other monitoring data in detailed multidimensional assessments.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in freshwater produce toxins that pose a threat to public health and aquatic ecosystems. Although algal communities have been studied globally to understand the characteristics of HABs, the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems is rarely understood. Unlike abiotic factors, the effects of biotic factors (e.g., interaction, dominance, and variability) on the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria were overlooked due to the intricate interaction of microorganisms under different environmental conditions. To address this problem, a comprehensive ecological concept stability, which encompasses variations in species or communities due to changing biological interactions or environmental fluctuations, was applied in this study. The algal communities in six river-connected lakes in the North Han River, South Korea, were classified into high and low stability groups. The algal species belonging to diatoms and green algae groups played a major role in the interaction within the algal community in highly stable lakes, but the frequency of Microcystis led the interaction within the algal community at the center of the network in low-stability lakes. These results indicate that the interaction within the cluster is easily changed by Microcystis, where the abundance explosively increases in lakes with low algal community stability. Water quality is more strongly associated with the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria (Microcystis and Dolichospermum). In low-stability lakes, more diverse water quality indicators are correlated with the development of toxic algae than in high-stability lakes. This paper is the first report on the importance of algal community stability in freshwater in the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria and offers a new perspective on Microcystis monitoring and management.

AB  - Semi-natural habitats such as heathland ecosystems are important for the conservation of biodiversity. Due to land use changes, these valuable ecosystems have become highly threatened. Nowadays, their management and restoration is of special relevance for nature conservation.
   In this study, we used carabid beetles and spiders as bioindicators to evaluate the success of montane heathland restoration on former spruce forests. We compared three different treatments: (i) montane heathlands (MONHEATH), (ii) restoration (RESSITE) and (iii) control (CONTROL) sites.
   Four to five years after conducting the restoration measures, all environmental variables, except soil moisture, significantly differed between MONHEATH on one hand and RESSITE and CONTROL on the other. MONHEATH was characterised by a high cover of dwarf shrubs; in contrast, RESSITE/CONTROL had a vegetation rich in herbs/grasses with some bare ground. Both carabid beetle and spider assemblage composition clearly reflected these differences in environmental conditions. Alpha-diversity (Simpson diversity, evenness) and niche positions were, however, only significantly different for spiders. Diversity as well as spider indicator values for shade and moisture were higher for MONHEATH.
   Due to the cool and wet montane climate and the dense dwarf-shrub stands the carabid beetle and spider species characteristic of MONHEATH are typical woodland species. Four to five years after restoration, RESSITE and CONTROL still represent early successional stages with a low cover of the Ericaceae target dwarf shrubs (Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium vitis-idaea), but are already home to some typical heathland carabid beetle and spider species that are missing in MONHEATH.

AB  - Farmers are being encouraged to redress the problems of land degradation by implementing a series of changes in their land management. However, there are few tools to monitor soil condition which can reliably inform farmers of the state of their soil. This paper examines ants and their importance in ecosystem functioning, principally their ability to maintain or restore soil quality in rural environments, and their value as bioindicators of soil quality. The reader is provided with a summary of those studies which have recorded the species composition and activity of ant fauna in agricultural soils and naturally vegetated environments. However, it is rare to find studies which sample both environments concurrently. An overview of the types of measures available to assess ant biodiversity is followed by a discussion of the current status of biopedological research into ant-soil relationships and the trends and gaps in current research knowledge, principally in the areas of water and soil movement and nutrient effects. Lastly the paper seeks to forecast the future directions of ant biopedological research, and to identify the type of research required to fully appreciate the value of ants as soil quality indicators to monitor the sustainability of the soil resource. Ants should be considered an important group of soil fauna, yet they have received meagre attention in comparison with other soil fauna such as earthworms. There is a need for specific experiments to test the hypothesis that ants can be used as bioindicators of soil quality. (C)1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A systematic investigation of the spatial and temporal variability in coccolithophore abundance and distribution through the water column of the NW Iberian coastal up-welling system was performed. From July 2011 to June 2012, monthly sampling at various water depths was conducted at two parallel stations located at 42 degrees N.
   Total coccosphere abundance was higher at the outer-shelf station, where warmer, nutrient-depleted waters favoured coccolithophore rather than phytoplanktonic diatom blooms, which are known to dominate the inner-shelf location. In seasonal terms, higher coccosphere and coccolith abundances were registered at both stations during upwelling seasons, coinciding with high irradiance levels. This was typically in conjunction with stratified, nutrient-poor conditions (i.e. relaxing upwelling conditions). However, it also occurred during some upwelling events of colder, nutrient-rich subsurface waters onto the continental shelf. Minimum abundances were generally found during downwelling periods, with unexpectedly high coccolith abundance registered in subsurface waters at the inner-shelf station. This finding can only be explained if strong storms during these downwelling periods favoured resuspension processes, thus remobilizing deposited coccoliths from surface sediments, and hence hampering the identification of autochthonous coccolithophore community structure.
   At both locations, the major coccolithophore assemblages were dominated by Emiliania huxleyi, small Gephyrocapsa group, Gephyrocapsa oceanica, Florisphaera profunda, Syracosphaera spp., Coronosphaera mediterranea, and Calcidiscus leptoporus. Ecological preferences of the different taxa were assessed by exploring the relationships between environmental conditions and temporal and vertical variability in coccosphere abundance. These findings provide relevant information for the use of fossil coccolith assemblages in marine sediment records, in order to infer past environmental conditions, of particular importance for Paleoceanography. Both E. huxleyi and the small Gephyrocapsa group are proposed as proxies for the upwelling regime with a distinct affinity for different stages of the upwelling event: E. huxleyi was associated with warmer, nutrient-poor and more stable water column (i.e. upwelling relaxation stage) while the small Gephyrocapsa group was linked to colder waters and higher nutrient availability (i.e. early stages of the upwelling event), similarly to G. oceanica. Conversely, F. profunda is suggested as a proxy for the downwelling regime and low-productivity conditions. The assemblage composed by Syracosphaera pulchra, Coronosphaera mediterranea, and Rhabdosphaera clavigera may be a useful indicator of the presence of subtropical waters conveyed northward by the Iberian Poleward Current. Finally, C. leptoporus is proposed as an indicator of warmer, saltier, and oligotrophic waters during the downwelling/winter regime.

At present, one can observe a constant increase in the number of studies devoted to the mineral composition of formations of various natural-anthropogenic environments and technological systems: atmospheric dust aerosols, salt deposits of water and heat exchange equipment, etc. Formation of calcite singer bodies (stalactites, stalagmites and carbonate crusts) within different engineering structures due to carbonate leaching from cement matrix and their subsequent re-deposition is one of the most common types of technogenic minerogenesis. In modern scientific literature, the term ''technogenic speleothems'' is used to define this phenomenon. Technogenic speleothem formation is of interest not only as a practicable source of information on possible speeds and background of authigenic mineral formation, but also as a potential indicator of engineering structure's functioning conditions, as well as to assess the quality of construction works and used building materials.
   The main aim of the research work is to study the morphology and microstructure of singer carbonate formations of the fourth level of the Tyra river embankment located within the Tyumen city to clarify the conditions of their formation and the possibility of their application to assess the functioning conditions of the engineering structure.
   The methods used in the research: macroscopic description, meseomorphological and microscopic studies of carbonate singer formations in thin sections, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis.
   The results. Carbonate crusts and stalactite-like speleothems present the complex of carbonate singer forms examined within the fourth level of embankment. The results of microscopic studies confirm that carbonate singer forms are complicated structures and their development proceeds during several stages. Carbonate crusts are the long-term formations, while ''stalactites'' are the annual or quasisea-sonal ones; that supports the high speed of their development. Growth of technogenic speleothems within the new engineering structure in uncharacteristic for this kind of formation conditions (well-blown, open space) indicates the high intensity of carbonates leaching from cement mortar used in the construction of the embankment. The detailed assessment of the scale of calcite dripstones formation on the surfaces of the embankment may be used for identifying the potential risks associated with long-term operation of the facility.

AB  - Zooplankton are the most abundant organisms in marine as well as are sensitive to environmental stresses. This study compared the communities of zooplankton as an indicator of water quality together with and without considering the survivorship of vital condition. Samples of seawater and zooplankton were collected in the inside and outside Kaohsiung Harbor, Taiwan, to understand their relationship. The relatively lower salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen, as well as the higher nutrients, suspended solids, and metals concentrations, were found in the seawater that collected from the estuary region located on the inside harbor, accompanied with the lower abundance and survival rate of zooplankton. Results suggested that the survivorship of total zooplankton varied between 17.3 and 79.6%, the high values of 67.4 +/- 8.6% were observed outside harbor whereas the low values of 41.9 +/- 13.2% were found at inside harbor. Using the density of live zooplankton to carry out cluster analysis showed a more clear division of sites among estuaries, harbor channel, and harbor outside than using that of the total zooplankton. The traditional zooplankton monitoring may misestimate the abundance and composition because it identifies all sampled individuals, which contains zooplankton that has died for a certain period and been not biodegraded and then drifts freely with the tide. Therefore, the identification of survival rate would be a valuable addition to the traditional zooplankton monitoring to accurately clarify the interactions between water quality and zooplankton ecology in the coastal ecosystem.

AB  - Our present understanding of the effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on aquatic systems in forested landscapes is based on a long history of studies relating physical, chemical and biological variables to biotic responses. The explanatory relationships resulting from this work have proven informative for ensuring environmentally-sound forest management, but such evaluations have not been applied to all forest types and management conditions and rarely in the context of aquatic ecosystem services. In this study, we applied a combination of field measurements and modelling to derive a comprehensive suite of physical, chemical, and biological variables (n = 80) to develop explanatory relationships between these variables and benthic macroinvertebrate community composition of headwater streams in managed forests. The work was conducted in a northern hardwood forest catchment that contains a gradient of disturbance, ranging from undisturbed to actively managed over the past 25 years, and a history of research that has generated an extensive relevant dataset. From among the initial suite of 80 variables, we found that those related to hydrological patterns and processes (i.e. flow variability; conductivity) were most strongly associated with benthic macroinvertebrate community structure. We also found that selection-based forest harvesting had no measurable adverse effects on benthic macroinvertebrate communities. By better defining the relationships between physical, chemical and biological indicators of aquatic ecosystem function, our work provides information required to make effective monitoring and management decisions aimed at ensuring sustainability of forest-based aquatic ecosystem services, particularly in the face of a changing climate.

AB  - Urban green space (UGS) availability has become an increasingly important aspect of planning and research because of the importance of green spaces for the wellbeing of urban residents. Municipalities across the European Union (EU) use different indicators in this area. Some cities provide per-capita threshold values for urban green space (UGS); some have recommendations regarding the minimum distance to green space while others have no recommendations at all. In this study, we assess green space availability in 299 EU cities according to land use and a population data grid. The results show a diverse picture across the EU. Southern European cities show below-average availability values, which may be explained by their low forest and tree cover and reflect the history of cities in Southern Europe. Comparatively, the above-average availability values in Northern European cities are a result of not only their biophysical conditions and the presence of rich forestland in general but also of Northern European attitudes toward urban living that naturally value having forests close to home.
   This assessment is complemented by a detailed case study analysis of two European cities Berlin, Germany and Loa Poland. Results showed that this approach's explanatory power depends on the data used, scale of interest, resolution of data and estimated threshold value. By comparing results using different datasets and threshold values, we discuss opportunities and limitations for developing indicators of green space availability. We conclude that UGS availability is an important indicator to navigate urban complexity to improve human health and wellbeing but is only one component of the intricate social-ecological interactions within cities.

AB  - The growing use of reclaimed wastewater for environmental purposes such as stream flow augmentation requires comprehensive ecological risk assessment and management. This study applied a system analysis approach, regarding a wastewater reclamation plant (WRP) and its recipient water body as a whole system, and assessed the ecological risk of the recipient water body caused by the WRP effluent. Instead of specific contaminants, two toxicity indicators, i.e. genotoxicity and estrogenicity, were selected to directly measure the biological effects of all bio-available contaminants in the reclaimed wastewater, as well as characterize the ecological risk of the recipient water. A series of physically based models were developed to simulate the toxicity indicators in a WRP through a typical reclamation process, including ultrafiltration, ozonation, and chlorination. After being validated against the field monitoring data from a full-scale WRP in Beijing, the models were applied to simulate the probability distribution of effluent toxicity of the WRP through Latin Hypercube Sampling to account for the variability of influent toxicity and operation conditions. The simulated effluent toxicity was then used to derive the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in the recipient stream, considering the variations of the toxicity and flow of the upstream inflow as well. The ratio of the PEC of each toxicity indicator to its corresponding predicted no-effect concentration was finally used for the probabilistic ecological risk assessment. Regional sensitivity analysis was also performed with the developed models to identify the critical control variables and strategies for ecological risk management. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rivers are complex systems for which it is hard to make reliable assessments of causes and responses to impairments. We present a holistic risk-based framework for river ecosystem assessment integrating all potential intervening processes and functions. Risk approaches allow us to deal with uncertainty both in the construction of indicators for magnitude of stressors and in the inference of environmental processes and their impairment. Yet, here we go further than simply replacing uncertainty by a risk factor. We introduce a more accurate and rigorous notion of risk with a transcription of uncertainty in causal relationships in probability distributions for the magnitude of impairment and the weight of different descriptors, with an associated confidence in the diagnostic. We discuss how Bayesian belief networks and Bayesian hierarchical inference allow us to deal with this risk concept to predict impairments and potential recovery of river ecosystems. We developed a comprehensive approach for river ecosystem assessment, which offers an appealing tool to facilitate diagnosis of the likely causes of impairment and predict future conditions. The ability of the risk approaches to integrate multi-scale quantitative and qualitative descriptors in the identification of multiple stressor sources and pathways in the stream network, and their impairment of specific processes and structures is illustrated for the national-level risk analysis for hydromorphology and pesticide pollution. Not only does the risk-based framework provide a more complete picture of environmental impairments, but it also offers a comprehensive, user-friendly tool to instruct the decision process.

AB  - Ecological observation of global change processes is dependent on matching the scale and quality of biological data with associated geophysical and geochemical driver information. Until recently, the scale and quality of biological observation on natural assemblages has often failed to match data generated through physical or chemical platforms due to constraints of cost and taxonomic resolution. With the advent of next-generation DNA sequencing platforms, creating 'big data' scale observations of biological assemblages across a wide range of phylogenetic groups are now a reality. Here we draw from a variety of studies to illustrate the potential benefits and drawbacks of this new data source for enhancing our observation of ecological change compared with traditional methods. We focus on a key habitat-estuaries-which are among the most threatened by anthropogenic change processes. When community composition data derived using morphological and molecular approaches were compared, the increased level of taxonomic resolution from the molecular approach allowed for greater discrimination between estuaries. Apart from higher taxonomic resolution, there was also an order of magnitude more taxonomic units recorded in the molecular approach relative to the morphological. While the morphological data set was constrained to traditional macroinvertebrate sampling, the molecular tools could be used to sample a wide range of taxa from the microphytobenthos, e.g., diatoms and dinoflagellates. Furthermore, the information provided by molecular techniques appeared to be more sensitive to a range of well-established drivers of benthic ecology. Our results indicated that molecular approaches are now sufficiently advanced to provide not just equivalent information to that collected using traditional morphological approaches, but rather an order of magnitude bigger, better, and faster data with which to address pressing ecological questions.

AB  - Habitat loss and degradation can be considered as major threats to freshwater invertebrates. These often irreversible processes lead to reduction of habitat patch quality and cause local extinctions of dragonflies, notably of habitat specialists. However, the biodiversity of specific secondary habitats is very high. Here, we present findings from a 10-year study that intensively monitored odonate fauna in the Upper Silesian industrial coal region having many secondary habitats characterized by very frequent disturbances due to soil instability. We evaluated qualitative changes in the dragonfly assemblages on 10 patches using a modified dragonfly biotic index. Data analysis was supplemented by a model examining population dynamics of the threatened dragonfly Leucorrhinia pectoralis, using the capture-mark-recapture method, as an effective indicator of habitat quality. We show that dynamics of environmental conditions in secondary habitats are reflected in population dynamics of dragonfly populations and assemblages. As frequency of L. pectoralis population extinctions within the patch is considerable and independent of size and spatial isolation of single habitats, these can be regarded as ecological traps. Nevertheless, the metapopulation dynamics may be a key adaptation of dragonflies to frequent freshwater habitat disturbances. We suggest that local extinctions are effectively balanced with (re-)colonization of newly emerging freshwater habitats. These findings have implications for potential conservation management of specific human-made habitats, because secondary habitats with a great diversity of succession stages arising directly as a consequence of environmental instability may be considered as partial alternatives to natural habitats in cultural landscapes.

AB  - The effects of anthropogenic activities combined with the lack of technical solutions for sewage treatment have lead to serious contamination problems in the coastal ecosystems of East Africa. However, not all contaminants can be considered pollutants. Determining when contamination results in pollution requires not only chemical but also biological measurements. Because benthos integrates conditions over time, macrobenthic organisms are considered good bioindicators to assess local environmental quality. Crabs constitute one of the most important macrofauna taxa in terms of abundance, species richness and biomass in mangrove ecosystems. In the present study, the reproductive potential and quality of Uca annulipes population inhabiting a peri-urban mangrove, subjected to domestic sewage discharges, was compared to populations inhabiting pristine mangroves. Fecundity, egg quality (fatty acids composition) and potential fertility were evaluated and compared by sampling a representative fraction of ovigerous females captured in each of the mangrove habitats at two, seasons (February to March, 2006 - wet season; and August to September, 2006 - dry season). Most of the measured reproductive parameters of U. annulipes were different at Maputo peri-urban mangrove when compared to nearby pristine locations. Although we cannot prove that sewage discharge done at Costa do Sol mangrove was the main factor influencing the reproductive dynamics of U. annulipes populations, at this peri-urban mangrove this fiddler crab species extended its reproductive season, increased fecundity, as well as improved embryo quality, mainly regarding the concentration of SFA and MUFA, in relation to the pristine mangrove populations.

AB  - Coral reef fishes perform a range of vital ecosystem functions, and can serve as indicators of ecological stress and resilience. However, many species are not observed when using Underwater Visual Census (UVC) during biomonitoring, and therefore overall biodiversity is often underestimated. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is proposed as an advanced and non-invasive next-generation biomonitoring method for determining the presence of aquatic organisms such as fish. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the community structure of coral fish from three different marine protected area reef zones (utility zone, open access zone, core zone) around Lombok Island using eDNA metabarcoding. Biological community composition, richness, and diversity were evaluated based on reads from mid-column water and sediment samples. A total of 58 species were identified from the eDNA samples using the Multiplex Barcode Research And Visualization Environment (mBRAVE) pipeline. The Shannon-Wiener index (H') showed significantly higher species diversity in the core zone than the utility and open access zones. There was no significant between-zone difference in community structure (ANOSIM, R = 0.11 < 0.25). NMDS analysis using the Bray-Curtis test showed significant between-zone differences in species diversity and abundance (PERMANOVA Adonis Pr (> F) = 0.001, p < 0.05). Based on the high number of fish species detected in this study, eDNA can be recommended as an alternative tool or as a complement to visual survey methods for biological monitoring and diversity assessment of remote reefs, with less stringent requirements in terms of field conditions (e.g. visibility) and taxonomic expertise.

AB  - The incorporation of local ecological knowledge in monitoring processes has been one of the great challenges of conservation initiatives worldwide. Therefore, it is essential to use indicators as local evaluation tools of the conditions of a species in order to support conservation actions. Local populations observe the environment, climate change and the influence of these factors on the species they use. However, their observations and perceptions may vary depending on different social factors. We used as model two species of economic importance involved in sociobiodiversity product chains to evaluate the role of social variables in the identification of conservation indicators for this plants. The species studied were: Caryocar coriaceum Wittm. (locally known as pequi), and Himatanthus drasticus (Mart.) Plumel (locally known as janaguba). We also registered which indicators are perceived as the most important and what they are measuring. Our results show that the knowledge among collectors is homogeneous and that, generally, the social factors do not affect the knowledge on local indicators. Age and extraction time were factors that influenced the knowledge on climate indicators and population structure only for C. coriaceum. In the communities studied, collectors not only monitor the biological characteristics of the species, but also the environmental and climatic phenomena that are threatening the sustainability of the species. These results can help to improve our ability to manage information about natural resources, incorporating local ecological knowledge in the scientific process of evaluation and monitoring of biodiversity.

AB  - Context. Mustering (gathering) feral horses (Equus ferus caballus) often cause mortalities, yet cause-specific details are lacking.
   Aims. Given the need to optimise horse welfare, we analysed public horse muster data from the USA to understand specific causes of mortalities.
   Methods. We coded 393 individual horse mortality reports for 92 cause-specific mortality terms (keywords informing the deciphering of specific causes of mortality classified as anatomical, causal or conditional) and demographic details (age, sex, and body condition). Data were derived from 50 musters across seven states with at least one horse mortality. Musters were coded for type (helicopter or bait), emergency or regular planned efforts, and number of horses mustered and shipped daily.
   Key Results. More horses were euthanased than died naturally (330 (84.0%) and 39 (9.9%) respectively), and more horses had chronic than acute conditions (317 (80.7%) and 76 (19.3%) respectively), with both trends holding for both sexes and across ages. Body condition scores (BCS) for female horses were skewed low, whereas male horse BCS data were more normally distributed. Female horses had lower BCS than did male horses (P < 0.001). On average, each horse mortality had two cause-specific mortality terms, ranging from 1 to 7. Only 57 horses (14.5%) had terms describing anatomy, cause and condition, concurrently. Phi coefficients (phi; indicators of fidelity and constancy) for cause-specific terms were related to demographic or muster attributes and were analysed with post hoc ANOVA tests of estimated marginal means to allow for ranking. Female horses were most often described as emaciated, weak, and starving, whereas male horses were described as lame, arthritic, blind or dangerous. Bait trapping and emergency musters included horses that were starving, dehydrated and weak.
   Conclusions. Generally, disorders associated with legs and feet, eyes, necks and nutrition were the most prevalent cause-specific mortality issues. Using a machine learning approach, validation and test accuracy were high for predicting euthanasia versus natural mortalities, but low for predicting acute versus chronic mortalities. Individual horse demographics or daily muster features had a greater relative influence than did capture type or emergency status in both comparisons.
   Implications. These results provide practical insight for potential cause-specific mortalities relative to demographics and muster techniques.

AB  - To enable quantifying environmental performance of products and technologies in relation to Planetary Boundaries, there is a need for life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods which allow for expressing indicators of environmental impact in metrics corresponding to those of the control variables in the Planetary Boundaries framework. In this study, we present such a methodology, referred to as PB-LCIA. Characterization factors for direct use in the LCIA phase of a life cycle assessment, or other life-cycle based assessment, were developed for a total of 85 elementary flows recognized as dominant contributors to transgressing specific Planetary Boundaries. Exception was made for "biosphere integrity" and "introduction of novel entities" where a Planetary Boundary is yet to be defined for the latter and characterization models are considered immature for the former. The PB-LCIA can be used to quantify the share of the "safe operating space" that human activities occupy, as was illustrated by calculating indicator scores for about 10,600 products, technologies and services exemplifying several sectors, including materials, energy, transport, and processing. The PB-LCIA can be used by companies interested in gauging their activities against the Planetary Boundaries to support decisions that help to reduce the risk of human activities moving the Earth System out of the Holocene state.

AB  - This paper reports the output of a consensus symposium organized by the International Union of Radioecology in November 2015. The symposium gathered an academically diverse group of 30 scientists to consider the still debated ecological impact of radiation on populations and ecosystems. Stimulated by the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters' accidental contamination of the environment, there is increasing interest in developing environmental radiation protection frameworks. Scientific research conducted in a variety of laboratory and field settings has improved our knowledge of the effects of ionizing radiation on the environment. However, the results from such studies sometimes appear contradictory and there is disagreement about the implications for risk assessment. The Symposium discussions therefore focused on issues that might lead to different interpretations of the results, such as laboratory versus field approaches, organism versus population and ecosystemic inference strategies, dose estimation approaches and their significance under chronic exposure conditions. The participating scientists, from across the spectrum of disciplines and research areas, extending also beyond the traditional radioecology community, successfully developed a constructive spirit directed at understanding discrepancies. From the discussions, the group has derived seven consensus statements related to environmental protection against radiation, which are supplemented with some recommendations. Each of these statements is contextualized and discussed in view of contributing to the orientation and integration of future research, the results of which should yield better consensus on the ecological impact of radiation and consolidate suitable approaches for efficient radiological protection of the environment.

AB  - Different factors play important roles in sustaining ecological balance and socio-economic stability of a region. Wetlands have crucial impact on preserving the ecology of a particular region. Wetland ecosystem is influenced by many factors that affect the bio-diversity and ecological balance to different degrees. The most common threats to wetlands are generally water scarcity, changing biodiversity and human intervention. Assessing the condition of a wetland involves the impact of environmental, ecological and socio economic factors which are mostly imprecise and uncertain in nature. Opinions of experts in several related fields are considered and subsequently importance of a particular environmental process in the wetland biosphere is expressed linguistically. Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) is one of the well-known procedures to assess the relative importance of different factors. In this paper, a model is developed using different wetland factors and sub-factors responsible for ecological degradation of Keoladeo National Park (KNP), India. Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) is applied to assess the relative importance of different factors responsible for preservation and restoration of ecological balance of KNP. The strategies of preservation and restoration of wetlands are sub-divided into several sub-goals. The network analysis of different factors explains their relative degrees of influence on the ecological system of KNP. Based on these findings, this paper suggests further enhancing the water supply, optimizing the land use structure and strengthening wetland protection laws. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has been recognized as an important driver of declines in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Changes in agricultural policy aims to mitigate these declines, but little is known about actual outcome of large scale changes in agricultural policy on communities of service-providing organisms. Two data sets containing captures of ground beetles (Carabidae) collected at an interval of 24 years were analyzed; the data were collected in the same area in Sweden under different environmental conditions before and after the introduction of a national pesticide risk reduction program. Environmental changes were analyzed by considering indicators of land use and agricultural management over time. Ground beetles collected over the whole season were considered and species were categorized according to functional traits. Environmental changes between the two time periods were characterized by increases in fallow and organic farming and a strong reduction in the amount of pesticide active ingredients sold and risk factors associated with pesticides. Although there were no changes in ground beetle species richness and community evenness after mitigation of agricultural intensification, there were differences in dominance distribution and functional composition. Ground beetles collected in the 1980s had higher proportions of carnivorous, cursorial, and small and intermediate size beetles than those collected in 2003. Communities sampled in 2003 had increased proportions of omnivorous, mobile, spring breeding, and large beetle species. These shifts in functional characteristics of ground beetle communities may improve biological control of cereal aphids and reduce variability in this ecosystem service over time.

AB  - This paper uses regional structural indicators and firm-level data of the EIB Investment Survey to show that framework conditions and firm innovation inputs affect innovation performance and regional productivity growth. We argue that, in addition to more R&D investments and access to higher levels of human capital, improvements in the regional business environment-including the quality of institutions and infrastructure-can help firms close the gap with the technological frontier and support the economic development of European regions.

AB  - The urban environment is becoming the most common setting in which people worldwide will spend their lives. Urban forests, and the ecosystem services they provide, are becoming a priority for municipalities. Quantifying and communicating the vulnerability of this resource are essential for maintaining a consistent and equitable supply of these ecosystem services. We propose a theory-based conceptual framework for the assessment of urban forest vulnerability that integrates the biophysical, built, and human components of urban forest ecosystems. A review and description of potential vulnerability indicators are provided. Urban forest vulnerability can be defined as the likelihood of decline in ecosystem service supply and its associated benefits for human populations, urban infrastructure, and biodiversity. It is comprised of (i) exposure, which refers to the stressors and disturbances associated with the urban environment that negatively affect ecosystem function, (ii) sensitivity, which is determined by urban forest structure and dictates the system response to forcing from exposures and the magnitude of potential impacts, and (iii) adaptive capacity, which is the social and environmental capacity of a system to shift or alter its conditions to reduce its vulnerability or to improve its ability to function while stressed. Potential impacts, or losses in ecosystem service supply, are temporal in nature and require backward-looking monitoring and (or) forward-looking modelling to be measured and assessed. Vulnerability can be communicated through the use of indicators, aggregated indices, and mapping. A vulnerability approach can communicate complex issues to decision-makers and advance the theoretical understanding of urban forest ecosystems.

AB  - The ecological restoration of ecosystem services and biodiversity is a key intervention used to reverse the impacts of anthropogenic activities such as mining. Assessment of the performance of restoration against completion criteria relies on biodiversity monitoring. However, monitoring usually overlooks soil microbial communities (SMC), despite increased awareness of their pivotal role in many ecological functions. Recent advances in cost, scalability and technology has led to DNA sequencing being considered as a cost-effective biological monitoring tool, particularly for otherwise difficult to survey groups such as microbes. However, such approaches for monitoring complex restoration sites such as post-mined landscapes have not yet been tested. Here we examine bacterial and fungal communities across chronosequences of mine site restoration at three locations in Western Australia to determine if there are consistent changes in SMC diversity, community composition and functional capacity. Although we detected directional changes in community composition indicative of microbial recovery, these were inconsistent between locations and microbial taxa (bacteria or fungi). Assessing functional diversity provided greater understanding of changes in site conditions and microbial recovery than could be determined through assessment of community composition alone. These results demonstrate that high-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA) is an effective approach for monitoring the complex changes in SMC following restoration. Future monitoring of mine site restoration using eDNA should consider archiving samples to provide improved understanding of changes in communities over time. Expansion to include other biological groups (e.g. soil fauna) and substrates would also provide a more holistic understanding of biodiversity recovery. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The relevance of the study is caused by the necessity to take into account the diversity of the migration forms of radionuclides under geochemical conditions changes, as well as prognosis of the radioecological status of hydroecosystems. On the territory of the Semipalatinsk Test Site, the migration of natural radionuclides in water systems is poorly investigated, the calculation of the migration forms of uranium and thorium with a change in geochemical conditions will be informative for understanding the migration of a wide range of transuranium radionuclides.
   The aim of the research is to determine the forms of migration of uranium and thorium in natural waters depending on the particle size and, taking into account a wide range of components, to calculate the forms of their migration in waterstreams and lakes.
   Objects: water of streams of the Degelen mountain massif, water of lakes of experimental sites of the Semipalatinsk Test Site, model hydrogeochemical systems.
   Methods. Speciation of natural radionuclides were investigated in situ using the method of cascade fractionation. The pH and Eh of the waters were determined by potentiometry, total dissolved solids was determined by conductometry. The main water ions and some elements were determined by titrimetric (HCO3-, CO32-, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+), optical emission spectrometry (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Si), and ion chromatography (Cl-, SO42-). The content of dissolved organic substances was determined by the permanganate and dichromate oxidation, the method of catalytic combustion, and the intensity of the UV signal. The content of U and Th was determined by mass spectrometry.
   Results. The features of U and Th transfer in different water bodies of Semipalatinsk Test Site are determined. The processes that control them are indicated. It was found that the sulfate ion in waterstreams is an indicator of water exchange intensity and the rate of oxidation of sulfide minerals, which determine the release of uranium significant concentrations into the solution. Uranium is associated with organic and organomineral complexes and is subjected to transformation of migration forms in the event of changes in the geochemical conditions of the environment. Thorium is more characterized by colloidal transport than uranium. Suspended components of natural waters dominate among migration forms of these elements. The Th/U ratio in dissolved form is rather stable compared to colloidal and suspended forms. For waters with various hydrodynamic regimes, there is a difference in the severity of the influence of the terrigenous components.

AB  - Recent studies suggest the long-standing discrepancy between measured and modeled leaf litter decomposition in drylands is, in part, the result of a unique combination of abiotic drivers that include high soil surface temperature and radiant energy levels and soil-litter mixing. Temperature and radiant energy effects on litter decomposition have been widely documented. However, under field conditions in drylands where soil-litter mixing occurs and accelerates decomposition, the mechanisms involved with soil-litter mixing effects are ambiguous. Potential mechanisms may include some combination of enhanced microbial colonization of litter, physical abrasion of litter surfaces, and buffering of litter and its associated decomposers from high temperatures and low moisture conditions. Here, we tested how soil-litter mixing and soil moisture interact to influence rates of litter decomposition in a controlled environment. Foliar litter of two plant species (a grass [Eragrostis lehmanniana] and a shrub [Prosopis velutina]) was incubated for 32 weeks in a factorial combination of soil-litter mixing (none, light, and complete) and soil water content (2, 4, 12% water-filled porosity) treatments. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were quantified one week into the experiment to evaluate initial microbial colonization. A complementary incubation experiment with simulated rainfall pulses tested the buffering effects of soil-litter mixing on decomposition.
   Under the laboratory conditions of our experiments, the influence of soil-litter mixing was minimal and primarily confined to changes in PLFAs during the initial stages of decomposition in the constant soil moisture experiment and the oscillating soil moisture conditions of the rainfall pulse experiment. Soil-litter mixing effects on CO2 production, total phospholipid concentrations, and bacterial to total PLFA ratios were observed within the first week, but responses were fairly weak and varied with litter type and soil moisture treatment. Across the entire 32-week incubation experiment, soil moisture had a significant positive effect on mass loss, but soil-litter mixing did not. The lack of strong soil-litter mixing effects on decomposition under the moderate and relatively constant environmental conditions of this study is in contrast to results from field studies and suggests the importance of soil-litter mixing may be magnified when the fluctuations and extremes in temperature, radiant energy and moisture regimes common dryland field settings are in play.

AB  - Understanding the biological response to increasing anthropogenic stressors is an important consideration to make when evaluating ecosystem well-being. Among aquatic ecological indicators, fish are effective as they are mobile and can be monitored relatively easily. The socio-economically important uMngeni River in South Africa is a highly regulated 'working river' and has seen a reduction in the numbers of its iconic Labeobarbus spp. as a result, primarily the KwaZulu-Natal yellowfish Labeobarbus natalensis. To understand how this species has adapted to these anthropogenic changes, we evaluated the reach-scale movements and habitat use of L. natalensis (n = 43) from August 2018 to August 2019 between Midmar and Albert Falls Dams. We included monitoring environmental parameters using radio telemetry methods. We found that L. natalensis showed facultative movements and typically exhibited diurnal activities. Habitat availability was important and appeared to depend on refugia during the austral winter (May to July) and spawning or body condition during austral summer (December to February). Upstream reach-scale movements were cued primarily by water temperature where flow provided access and maintained available habitats for breeding. Maintaining adequate flows during critical periods of movement and spawning is important and will assist in maintaining the population of L. natalensis. Furthermore, removing redundant instream barriers or fitting these with adequate fish passages will improve the fragmented population resilience of L. natalensis. These mitigation measures will improve ecosystem resilience and reduce the impacts of increasing anthropogenic stressors associated with socio-economically important rivers.

AB  - River restoration projects rely on environmental engineering solutions to improve the health of riparian ecosystems and restore their natural characteristics. The Kwacza River, the left tributary of the Supia River in northern Poland, and the recipient of nutrients from an agriculturally used catchment area, was restored in 2007. The ecological status of the river's biotope was improved with the use of various hydraulic structures, including palisades, groynes and stone islands, by protecting the banks with trunks, exposing a fragment of the river channel, and building a by-pass near a defunct culvert. The effects of restoration treatments were evaluated by comparing the physicochemical parameters of river water along the 2.5 km restored section between the source and the mouth to the Supia, before restoration and 6 years after hydrotechnical treatments. A total of 18 physicochemical parameters were analyzed at 10 cross-sections along the river. The greatest changes were observed in the concentrations of NO3--N and NH4+-N, which decreased by 70% and 50%, respectively. Dissolved oxygen concentration increased by 65%. Chloride values increased by 44%, and chlorophyll-a concentration increased by 30% after the project. The cut-off channel (by-pass), semi-palisades, and single groynes were the treatments that contributed most to water quality improvement. The results of this study indicate that river restoration projects can substantially reduce nitrogen pollution, which is particularly important in agricultural areas. Such measures can effectively reinstate natural conditions in river ecosystems. Hydrochemical monitoring is required to control the parameters of restored rivers.

AB  - The Turpan Oasis is a typical fragile environment that lies in an arid region of eastern Xinjiang and is affected by natural conditions and human activities. The severity of the land degradation and desertification in this area is increasing; therefore, ecological vulnerability evaluations are important for environmental management of the region. In this study, theories and methods of evaluating ecological vulnerability and the typical characteristics of ecological vulnerability were summarized. By combining the environmental characteristics of the research area and the driving factors of ecological vulnerability, a multilayer vulnerability evaluation index system was built, and a pressure-state-response model was established to evaluate the ecological vulnerability. GIS and remote sensing technologies were applied to extract each index and create a spatial distribution map of vulnerability. The results showed that the vulnerability index values ranged from 3.08 to 6.59, with an average value of 5.19. Regions with moderate vulnerability accounted for 81.85 % of the total area, whereas regions with light and serious vulnerability accounted for 4.19 and 13.95 % of the total area, respectively. Thus, more than 80 % of the area had moderate vulnerability, and nearly 14 % of the area had serious vulnerability. The degree of vulnerability increased from east to west, and the ecological vulnerability in the inner oasis was significantly lower than that in the outer oasis. The key factors for ecological restoration and reconstruction are to control desertification and to ensure ecological water use to the greatest extent.

AB  - Contaminants associated with stormwater are among the leading causes of water quality impairment in urban streams. Multiple device treatment systems are commonly installed with the aim of reducing contaminant loads within stormwater discharge. However, the in situ performance of such systems remains poorly understood. We investigated the efficacy of an advanced stormwater treatment system by monitoring biofilm associated metals and biofilm bacterial community composition at multiple locations through the treatment system (which included rain gardens, grassy swales, a stormwater filter and a wetland) and in the receiving stream above and below the stormwater discharge. Changes in bacterial community composition were assessed by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) and concentrations of biofilm associated metals monitored by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Significant differences in bacterial community composition were detected throughout the stormwater network. Bacterial communities gradually changed towards a community more similar to that within the receiving stream and the discharge of treated stormwater had little effect on the composition of bacterial communities in the receiving stream, suggesting the effective conditioning of water quality by the treatment system. Concentrations of some biofilm-associated metals declined following sequential treatment, for example copper (73% reduction), zinc (48% reduction) and lead (46% reduction). In contrast, levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium and nickel were not reduced by the treatment system. We demonstrate that biofilm bacterial community composition is a sensitive indicator of environmental changes within freshwater ecosystems and an efficient indicator to monitor water quality in enclosed stormwater networks where traditional biological indicators are not available.

AB  - Spinosad, a candidate biological larvicide for mosquito control, was evaluated for its effects on a field population of Daphnia pulex, using Bacillus thuringiensis serovar israelensis (Bti) as a reference larvicide. Microcosms (125 L enclosures) were placed in a shallow temporary oligohaline marsh where D. pulex was present. Three concentrations of spinosad (8, 17 and 33 mu gL(-1)) and two concentrations of Bti (0.16 and 0.50 mu LL-1) were applied (5 replicates per concentration, including the controls). Effects of larvicides on D. pulex were evaluated after 2, 4, 7,14 and 21 d of exposure, through measurements of abundance and individual size. Dissipation of spinosad from the water phase was rapid. Four days after treatment, residue concentration represented 11.8%, 3.9% and 12.7% of the initial exposure level for the nominal concentrations of 8,17 and 33 mu gL(-1), respectively. Spinosyns A and D dissipated at similar rates. Analysis of abundance and size structure of the D. pulex population showed an impact of spinosad. Both survival and size structure were affected. However, at the lowest concentration (8 mu L-1), population recovered after the first week. In microcosms treated with Bti, the abundance of D. pulex was not affected but the size structure of the population changed after 21 d. As compared to laboratory tests, the use of in situ microcosms improved the environmental risk assessment of larvicides, taking into account the influence of environmental factors (e.g., temperature, light, salinity) and intrinsic capacity of recovery of D. pulex under field conditions.

AB  - Contaminated sediments are receiving increasing recognition around the world, leading to the development of various sediment quality indicators for assessment, management, remediation, and restoration efforts. Sediment chemistry represents an important indicator of ecosystem health, with the concentrations of contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) providing measurable characteristics for this indicator. The St. Louis River Area of Concern (AOC), located in the western arm of Lake Superior, provides a case study for how numerical sediment quality targets (SQTs) for the protection of sediment-dwelling organisms can be used to support the interpretation of sediment chemistry data. Two types of SQTs have been established for 33 COPCs in the St. Louis River AOC. The Level I SQTs define the concentrations of contaminants below which sediment toxicity is unlikely to occur, whereas the Level 11 SQTs represent the concentrations that, if exceeded, are likely to be associated with sediment toxicity. The numerical SQTs provide useful tools for making sediment management decisions, especially when considered as part of a weight-of-evidence approach that includes other sediment quality indicators, such as sediment contaminant chemistry and geochemical characteristics, sediment toxicity, and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure. The recommended applications of using the numerical SQTs in the St. Louis River AOC include: designing monitoring programs, interpreting sediment chemistry data, conducting ecological risk assessments, and developing site-specific sediment quality remediation targets for small, simple sites where adverse biological effects are likely. Other jurisdictions may benefit from using these recommended applications in their own sediment quality programs.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the content of 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (acenaphthylene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene and benzo[ghi]perylene) from Environmental Protection Agency list (US-EPA PAHs) in traditional dry fermented sausage Petrovska klobasa. Sausages, stuffed in collagen and natural casings, were smoked in traditional (A1, A2, B1 and B2 - direct smoking) and industrial (B3 and B4 - indirect smoking) conditions.
   The highest total content of 13 US-EPA PAHs was determined in sausages stuffed in natural casings and smoked in traditional conditions at both examined periods, at the end of drying, as well as at the end of storage period (220 mu g/kg and 495 mu g/kg, respectively). The lowest content of these compounds was determined in sausages stuffed in collagen casings and smoked in industrial conditions, also at both examined periods (31.3 mu g/kg; 54.1 mu g/kg respectively). Phenanthrene (A1-120; A2-119; B2-37.6 and B4-13.1 mu g/kg) and acenaphthylene (B1-45.0 and B3-18.3 mu g/kg) were the most abundant PAHs in all examined sausage samples at the end of drying period, while at the end of storage period the most abundant PAHs were phenanthrene (A1-201; A2-107; B2-49.4 and B3-38.7 mu g/kg) and anthracene (B1-34.4 and B4-20.1 mu g/kg). Benzo[a]pyrene, whose maximum allowed content in smoked meat products is 5 mu g/kg (EC No. 1881/2006), was below the limit of detection in all examined samples. Also, PAH4 (sum content of benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene and benzo[a]pyrene) a more suitable indicator for the occurrence of PAHs, with maximum allowed content in smoked meat products of 30 mu g/kg (EC No. 835/2011), was below the limit of detection in all examined samples.
   According to the results obtained in this study, traditional dry fermented sausage Petrovska klobasa, smoked in traditional and industrial conditions was safe for its consumers regarding European regulation on PAHs content. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Semi-natural mesocosm experiments have been proposed as a powerful approach for evaluating the realised rather than potential ecotoxicological effects of agrochemicals on biological communities. However, there is uncertainty in the results from such experiments due to spatio-temporal variability in various ecological factors, such as community composition. Therefore, long-term studies evaluating such variability are critical for assessing the utility of mesocosm experiments, although few studies have been conducted over multiple years. We conducted a multiple-year (i.e., three-year) mesocosm experiment to examine the effects of three systemic insecticides (clothianidin, fipronil, and chlorantraniliprole) on aquatic animal communities in experimental paddies, and we evaluated the among-year variability in these ecotoxicological effects. We found substantial variation in community composition among years. However, when we controlled for this variability by performing partial redundancy analysis (partial RDA), we found that paddy community composition was significantly different between the three insecticide treatments irrespective of year. Moreover, we identified some taxa that consistently decreased in abundance following exposure to each insecticide and may thus be regarded as indicator taxa of the environmental stress caused by the insecticides (e.g., clothianidin: Gerris lacustris (water striders), fipronil: Orthetrum albistylum speciosum (dragonflies), and chlorantraniliprole: Hydroglyphus japonicus (beetles)). Our study suggests the utility of multiple-year, semi-natural mesocosm experiments not only for evaluating the temporal variability in ecotoxicological effects but also for identifying potential robust indicator organisms that consistently decrease in abundance in response to specific agrochemicals irrespective of the variability in ecological factors under realistic conditions.

AB  - A study was conducted to explore the plant biodiversity and vegetation structure of Biha Valley, District Swat, Pakistan. On the basis of the physiognomy of the vegetation the study area was divided into 19 stands. Line transect (50 m) method was used to sample the phytosociological attributes of the study area. PCORD software (version 5) was used to recognize communities by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and CANOCO software (version 5) for ordination analysis was done for detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to find variation directories of different plant species. Different life-form classes and leaf size spectra were recorded according to the Raunkiaer classification. The floristic composition of the area consists of 203 plant species belonging to 154 genera and 70 families. The biological spectrum of the area indicated that Therophytes was dominant with 46.60% among the life-classes, followed by Hemicryptophytes having 15.53%. Leaf spectra of study area revealed that Microphylls was dominant (41.26%) followed by Nanophylls (32.04%). Seven plant communities were recognized by TWINSPAN classification, which showed that species diversity decreased with altitude. Moreover, the result indicates the importance of soil organic matter in top soil layers for plant species distribution. The increases in soil nutrients (OM, P, N, and K), improvement in site conditions (community cover, depth of litter, depth of humus, soil water content) and decrease in soil bulk density indicated the natural habitat restoration following abandonment.

AB  - The ECOMAN was initiated in 2001 by the University of Plymouth, UK, Plymouth Marine Laboratory and the Department of the Environment, Fisheries and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to address the need for more pragmatic assessment techniques linking environmental degradation with its causes. The primary aim of the project was to develop an evidence-based approach in which suites of easy-to-use, cost-effective and environmentally valid biological responses (biomarkers) could be used together to assess the health of coastal systems through the general condition of individuals. A range of sub-lethal endpoints.. chosen to reflect successive levels of biological organisation (molecular, cellular, physiological), was evaluated in common coastal organisms showing different feeding types (filter feeding, grazing, predation) and habitat requirements (estuary, rocky shore). Initially, the suite of biomarkers was used in laboratory studies to determine the relative sensitivities of key species within different functional groups to common contaminants. These results were then validated in field studies performed in a range of ecosystems exhibiting different degrees/signatures of contamination. Here, an example is provided of a field study in the Humber Estuary, UK, which illustrates how multivariate statistical analysis can be used to identify patterns of response to discriminate between contaminated and clean sites. The use of a holistic, integrated approach of this kind is advocated as a practical means of assessing the impact of chemical contamination on organismal health and of ranking the status of marine ecosystems.

AB  - Climate change, population growth, and declining federal budgets are threatening the health of ecosystems, and the services they provide. Under these changing conditions, managing landscapes and resources assumes new and unprecedented challenges. Adaptive management has been identified as a natural resource management approach that allows practitioners to incorporate change and uncertainty into decision-making through an iterative process that involves long-term monitoring and continued review and adjustment of management actions. However, the success of these efforts in watershed health relies on the collective and sustained monitoring of indicators, which is seldom studied. The purpose of this analysis is to examine (1) the practical challenge of choosing a list of indicators for long-term monitoring, (2) the negotiation process among stakeholders around the selection and interpretation of indicators, and (3) the communication tools that can be used to convey the assessment's results and findings. To do this, we analyze our ongoing work in the Cienega Watershed in southern Arizona. Our analysis shows that the selective use of indicators, regular assessment and review, and establishment of partnerships among stakeholders are all important elements in establishing effective adaptive management efforts. The selection of indicators and data sources is a moving target that requires regular consensus and review among stakeholders. The assessment itself is also a powerful engagement tool with the public at large, providing legitimacy and support to land management decision-making. Here, we outline some lessons learned that can be transferred to other cases and identify potential barriers for engagement, decision-making, and project success.

AB  - The quality of water and sediments from a marginally-studied river was investigated with respect to As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn including their fractionation behavior and environmental risk. Samples were collected along the Kou River that flows across two districts in the Manyara region of Tanzania. The leaching behavior of Fe was studied using sequential extraction fractionation and kinetics approach. The Kou water failed to meet the irrigation, aquatic, and biological life standards with respect to one of more trace metallic elements (TMEs). Fe concentration in the river water ranged from 4.1 to 5.38 mg/L exceeding all the three standards. Six pollution indices were applied to assess the contamination and ecological risks of the nine trace metallic elements in the sediments. Overall, the metals were found to moderately contaminate the sediments. Cr, Fe, and Mn fell under the `severely polluted' sediment quality class. Fe was the only metal that was found to significantly pollute both the river water and sediments. The Fe fractions in the sediments were in the order of residuals>Fe-Mn bound>organic bound>carbonate bound>water soluble>ion exchangeable. 7.8% of the total Fe content was bioavailable with a low potential to leach from the sediments. Under natural conditions, the sharpest release of the non-residual mobile fractions of Fe were identified to occur within the first 24 hours with the maximum Fe leached being 0.14% on the 12th day. None of the metals in the sediments were found with a potential to pose ecological risk.

AB  - Invasive species are a major concern for the maintenance of ecosystem services and biodiversity but are difficult to mitigate. Upstream solutions to prevent their impact, including their detection, are needed. Wasmannia auropunctata, an invasive ant living in vagile supercolonies, is especially hard to track and is a major threat for tropical ecosystems and local animal communities. As part of such tropical communities, crickets are sensitive to ecological conditions, easy to collect, detectable and identifiable through their species-specific calls. Here, we evaluated the use of an acoustic community of crickets as an indicator of the presence of W. auropunctata in New Caledonia. We evaluated the dominance of the crickets in the soundscape, describe the cricket community structure and diversity along a shrubland to forest gradient, characterize these cricket communities structure and diversity in the light of ongoing invasion by W. auropunctata, and identify cricket species' indicators of the invasion. Acoustic recordings collected on 24 sites were described using humanlistening and spectrographic visualization. The results demonstrated a clear dominance of the cricket group in the New Caledonian nocturnal soundscapes. Each habitat harbored a specific acoustic cricket community related to specific environmental attributes including vegetation height, daily variation of humidity and temperature. The presence of W. auropunctata was significantly associated with a lower cricket acoustic activity and species richness at night. Of the 19 species detected, four nocturnal species were identified as indicator of non-invaded forests and preforests. This work supports the use of acoustic as an alternative method to detect invasion.

AB  - Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) a type of environmental appraisal lacks effective methods for modeling cumulative effects, evaluating indicators of ecosystem condition, and exploring the likely outcomes of development scenarios. Random forests are an extension of classification and regression trees, which model response variables by recursive partitioning. Random forests were used to model a series of candidate ecological indicators that described lakes and rivers from a case study watershed (The Muskoka River Watershed, Canada). Suitability of the candidate indicators for use in cumulative effects assessment and watershed monitoring was assessed according to how well they could be predicted from natural habitat features and how sensitive they were to human land-use. The best models explained 75% of the variation in a multivariate descriptor of lake benthic-macroinvertebrate community structure, and 76% of the variation in the conductivity of river water. Similar results were obtained by cross-validation. Several candidate indicators detected a simulated doubling of urban land-use in their catchments, and a few were able to detect a simulated doubling of agricultural land-use. The paper demonstrates that random forests can be used to describe the combined and singular effects of multiple stressors and natural environmental factors, and furthermore, that random forests can be used to evaluate the performance of monitoring indicators. The numerical methods presented are applicable to any ecosystem and indicator type, and therefore represent a step forward for CEA. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biological indicator organisms have been widely used for monitoring and banking purposes for many years. Although the complexity of the interactions between organisms and their environment is generally not easily comprehensible, environmental quality assessment using the bioindicator approach offers some convincing advantages compared to direct analysis of soil, water, or air. Measurement of air particulates is restricted to experienced laboratories with access to expensive sampling equipment. Additionally, the amount of material collected generally is just enough for one determination per sampling and no multidimensional characterization might be possible. Further, fluctuations in air masses have a pronounced effect on the results from air filter sampling. Combining the integrating property of bioindicators with the world wide availability and particular matrix characteristics of air particulate matter as a prerequisite for global monitoring of air pollution is discussed. A new approach for sampling urban dust using large volume filtering devices installed in air conditioners of large hotel buildings is assessed. A first experiment was initiated to collect air particulates (300-500 g each) from a number of hotels during a period of 3-4 months by successive vacuum cleaning of used inlet filters from high volume air conditioning installations reflecting average concentrations per 3 months in different large cities. This approach is expected to be upgraded and applied for global monitoring. Highly positive correlated elements were found in lichens such as K/S, Zn/P, the rare earth elements (REE) and a significant negative correlation between Hg and Cu was observed in these samples. The ratio of concentrations of elements in dust and Usnea spp. is highest for Cr, Zn and Fe (400-200) and lowest for elements such as Ca, Rb, and Sr (20-10). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Some moths species are considered good indicators of habitat quality because they are very responsive to human disturbance, vegetation type, and successional processes. However, Saturniidae moths have not yet been considered as indicators of environmental quality. Little is known on the distribution of moth species in different vegetation types and the moths' seasonal variations in the Brazilian savannah. Therefore, this study aims to describe the spatial distribution and temporal patterns of moths belonging to the Saturniidae family in two vegetation typesCerrado sensu stricto on rocky outcrops and semi-deciduous forestin both the rainy and dry seasons. It addresses the influence of the climatic seasons and vegetation types on abundance, richness, and species composition to describe the temporal and spatial distribution patterns and the relationship between the ecological aspects and the life history of these moths. This study was conducted in the Cerrado phytogeographical domain, in Pireneus State Park, Goias, Brazil. The results revealed that most Saturniidae species sampled are present during the rainy season and typically found in forest habitats. Furthermore, a clear positive connection was found between the abundance pattern and rainfall seasonality and humid habitats; this is apparently related to the physiological tolerance of these moths, due to rudimentary mouthparts during their adulthood. Thus, rainfall and a forest habitat are important to and fundamental requirements for the persistence of the Saturniidae species in the Cerrado domain. Based on the results of this study, we suggest the use of saturniid species as indicators of changes in vegetation and climatic conditions.

AB  - Climate change, land-use shifts, reservoir storage, and water withdrawals impact low flows in rivers, creating challenges for ecological integrity and human uses. A systematic investigation of river discharges was carried out for 79 stream gauges in Germany. Available time series between 1950 and 2013 were analysed for trends in annual minimum low flows, discharge deficits, and low-flow durations. The application of different low-flow indicators led to similar spatial patterns, although each metric is used for different purposes in water management applications. Statistical tests identified significant discharge trends at more than half of the stations investigated. Low-flow trends since 1950 tended to be catchment specific, suggesting that climate change has not been the dominant driver. Most of the gauges investigated showed statistically significant increases in low flows. This can be mainly attributed to reservoir management. For rivers showing snow- and icemelt-dominated flow regimes, such trends are probably overlain by climate-driven changes (increasing amounts of rainfall, earlier snowmelt in spring). In contrast, stations showing statistically significant decreases in low flows were correlated with areas of decreasing mining activity. Hydrologic impacts of climate change are widespread and significant, but the results here suggest that human river management remains the dominant hydrologic driver on many rivers.

AB  - Fish-based multi-metric indices are an integral tool in implementing effective water policy initiatives for transitional waters. This study analysed the behaviour of three fish indices (TFCI in the UK, ELFI in France and EFAI in Portugal) developed for monitoring in line with the European Water Framework Directive, by applying a supervised multi-way sensitivity analysis with national monitoring data. The relative variation in the index outcome was analysed under different simulation scenarios by setting metric values at various levels and accounting for the co-variation between metrics. Subsets of key metrics were identified based on their higher influence in determining the index output. Index results under manipulations of metric scores clearly indicated that metric type, number of metrics used and correlations between metrics are important in determining their behaviour. This has implications for implementing management/conservation plans, for example, by prioritising restoration and/or conservation of metrics influencing more the ecological status. Indices including uncorrelated metrics (e.g. EFAI) or metrics with a skewed distribution (e.g. TFCI) are less affected by extreme metric changes, reducing the effectiveness of management actions aimed at improving the ecological status of a water body and thus adjustments may be needed to increase their sensitivity to changes in their metrics.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify, in the lichen Ramalina lacera, antioxidants that could provide indications of air pollution stress, and respond earlier than traditionally used structural/physiological parameters. The pollution-sensitive lichen R. lacera was transplanted from its relatively unpolluted natural habitat to two air-polluted sites for a period of up to 6 months. The superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, total water- and lipid-soluble low-molecular-weight antioxidant capacities and chlorophyll b/chlorophyll a ratios were assessed every 6 weeks. The earliest signs of oxidative stress were detected in the activities of fungal copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase, algal iron-superoxide dismutase and water-soluble low-molecular-weight antioxidants, which increased significantly as early as 42 days after exposure to pollution. Catalase activity increased in lichens transplanted to the polluted sites after 90 days. All activities decreased towards the end of the experiment. The impact of air pollution on R. lacera, using the traditionally employed parameter of chlorophyll b/chlorophyll a ratio, was only detected after 6 months of exposure to air pollution. Our results indicate that antioxidant parameters may serve as improved early-warning indicators of air pollution stress in lichens.

AB  - Context The majority of ecological studies of roads have focused on their deleterious effects, and these preconceptions have hampered a full evaluation of the ecological functions of roads. As an integrated indicator, road width represents comprehensive effects, including anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Objectives We try to explore the different effects produced by various road widths by considering changes in forest vegetation and soil. Methods We selected six study forests spanning from Shandong Province in the north to Guangdong Province in the south of China, and we assessed the influences of wide and narrow roads on plant species diversity, biomass, and soil properties along transects running from the forest edges and adjacent forest interior. We used a "shape-dependent model" to explain the factors that determine the magnitude of road effects on forests. Results Three variables measured in this study changed significantly with increasing distance from the road to the forest interior along wide roads: tree biomass, herbaceous plant biomass, and soil pH. However, no measurable biological or environmental effects were found from narrow roads. The different shapes of glades in a forest may be one reason for the various effects caused by roads of different widths. Conclusions Forest roads of different widths may have quite different ecological effects. While wider roads with large glades tend to have substantial negative impacts, small-enough roads may cause little disturbance to the forest. This suggests that not all forest roads should be perceived as the same, and narrow roads may be compatible with forest conservation.

AB  - Ecological dynamics often show intricate variations in response to different spatial configurations of environmental conditions. For instance, efficient turnover of natural or anthropogenic compounds in soils strongly depends on the bioavailability of these compounds to metabolically active bacteria. Experimental and modelling studies have highlighted that fungal networks may considerably enhance bioavailability by facilitating bacterial dispersal. Therefore, such dispersal networks may play a key role in many soil processes, for example, in contaminant degradation. Particularly, simulation studies revealed that the spatial configurations of networks may be a crucial factor determining the bacterial access to contaminants. Since these spatial configurations are typically complex and not precisely known, suitable metrics describing them in an aggregated manner are required for assessing expected biodegradation benefits from different bacterial dispersal networks. Using a spatially explicit microbial model we randomly created various dispersal network configurations and simulated the resulting bacterial degradation of organic compounds. We investigated numerous spatial metrics for characterizing the manifold network configurations, and identified appropriate metrics based on nonparametric correlation measures. Our results show that single metrics can approximately indicate biodegradation performance, and that well-chosen combinations of two metrics offer very good assessments. Thus, our analysis provides characteristics to focus on when dealing with real fungal networks in future practical applications in environmental management. Moreover, the protocol we employed for deriving the appropriate metrics is suited to be adapted to other ecological studies of functional responses to spatial environmental characteristics, for instance, changes in ecosystem services or biodiversity aspects due to habitat loss and fragmentation.

AB  - Eutrophication is a major threat to coastal ecosystems. Within Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) has established the need of developing methods of assessment. Bulk chlorophyll "a" is used world-wide as an indicator of eutrophication. However, the size structure of the phytoplankton communities has not been investigated, in detail, in relation to eutrophication pressures. This study investigates the suitability of fractionated chlorophyll "a" (< 10 and > 10 mu m), as an indicator of eutrophication. Along the Basque coast (northern Spain) several water bodies, ranging from offshore waters to the heads of the estuaries, were surveyed during 2008. Physico-chemical conditions and chlorophyll "a" showed a distinct spatial gradient. Trophic richness increased towards the middle and inner parts of the estuaries, where nutrient inputs, from natural or anthropogenic sources, together with the residence time of the water are usually higher. In summer, phytoplankton biomass and abundance decreased, generally, in offshore and coastal waters; in estuaries, they tended to increase. The chlorophyll distribution within the two size fractions was coherent with the phytoplankton taxonomic composition. In summer, the relative abundance of small-sized cells (diatoms and non-siliceous taxa) increased. The relationships between size-fractionated chlorophyll and physico-chemical variables differed, when comparing the offshore and coastal waters, with the estuaries. In the offshore and coastal waters, a strong seasonality was observed; in estuaries, an important spatial component was found. Fractionated chlorophyll provided complementary useful information on anthropogenic pressures. However, more research is necessary to utilise this variable as a tool for ecological status assessment, within the WFD.

AB  - Comprehensive and standardized biodiversity monitoring schemes are needed to build scientifically sound decision-making tools for biodiversity conservation. Based on a thorough review of published literature, we propose a novel biodiversity monitoring framework to unify conservation theory and practice. The framework is built on the inter-connection among different types of indicators, and on the systematic articulation of their relationships into seven indicator approaches. Semi-natural grasslands and shrublands in Europe, which still lack a common biodiversity monitoring scheme, are used as a model for the framework. Different biotic indicators have been widely used to estimate the state of biodiversity, but we integrate these with biodiversity drivers, i.e. factors driving changes in biodiversity, to track biodiversity response to environmental changes. Precise information on biodiversity drivers (e.g. past and present management or disturbance regimes, environmental conditions, landscape patterns) has an effective indicator value, but this is often not taken into account in monitoring schemes. Our framework can be used to detect gaps in available data, translate indicator systems into practical conservation, identify combined sets of indicators to monitor biodiversity in target habitats, and recognize most suitable surrogates when information for some indicators is missing. We also take into account the effect of regional species pools in order to consider large-scale historical and biogeographical processes. We propose general guidelines to create validate and launch biodiversity monitoring frameworks for target habitats in the light of current examples of biodiversity conservation schemes (e.g. Natura 2000 in Europe).

AB  - Concerns of reduced productivity and land degradation in the Mitchell grasslands of central western Queensland were addressed through a range monitoring program to interpret condition and trend. Botanical and eclaphic parameters were recorded along piosphere and grazing gradients, and across fenceline impact areas, to maximise changes resulting from grazing. The Degradation Gradient Method was used in conjunction with State and Transition Models to develop models of rangeland dynamics and condition. States were found to be ordered along a degradation gradient, indicator species developed according to rainfall trends and transitions determined from field data and available literature. Astrebla spp. abundance declined with declining range condition and increasing grazing pressure, while annual grasses and forbs increased in dominance under poor range condition. Soil erosion increased and litter decreased with decreasing range condition. An approach to quantitatively define states within a variable rainfall environment based upon a time-series ordination analysis is described.
   The derived model could provide the interpretive framework necessary to integrate on-ground monitoring, remote sensing and geographic information systems to trace states and transitions at the paddock scale. However, further work is needed to determine the full catalogue of states and transitions and to refine the model for application at the paddock scale.

AB  - The biological trait analysis (BTA) is regarded as a promising approach to unravel how ecosystem functions respond to human-induced disturbances. This study considered the four sampling locations associated with different human activities in Daya Bay, that is, the domestic and industrial sewage discharge area (SED), mariculture area (MRC), nuclear power plants thermal discharge area (NTD), and an area with relatively low human disturbance as a reference (REF). Thirty modalities of nine traits were selected in BTA. Our results showed a clear shift in the functional structure of macrobenthic communities between the sampling locations, except for the case between NTD and REF. The trait composition in the communities did not highlight any seasonal patterns. Bioturbation, longevity, tolerance, body size, feeding habit, and environmental position were the key traits to characterize the functional structure of macrobenthic communities and demonstrated predictable responses along the environmental gradients. Water depth, DO, Chl-a, NH4+, and petroleum contaminants in sediments were the main variables influencing the trait composition. In addition, the taxonomic index (H ') and functional diversity index (Rao's Q) showed clear differences among the sampling locations. Although there were no significant differences between NTD and REF in terms of the trait composition and functional diversity, a potential function loss in NTD still can be detected through the integrated analysis with taxonomic diversity. We suggest that the traits (except for fragility, larval development, and living habits) selected and the diversity indices (H ' and Rao's Q) could serve as promising indicators of ecological conditions in Daya Bay.

AB  - The Canada-U.S. State of the Strait Conference is a biennial forum with a 22-year history of assessing ecosystem status and providing advice to improve research, monitoring, and management of the Detroit River and western Lake Erie. The 2019 conference focused on assessing ecosystem health based on 61 indicators. Although there has been considerable improvement in the Detroit River since the 1960s, much additional cleanup is needed to restore ecosystem health. Western Lake Erie is now at risk of crossing several potential tipping points caused by the interactions of a variety of drivers and their stresses. This assessment identified eight environmental and natural resource challenges: climate change; population growth/transportation expansion/land use changes; chemicals of concern; human health/environmental justice; aquatic invasive species; habitat loss/degradation; nonpoint source pollution; and eutrophication/harmful algal blooms. Specific recommendations for addressing each challenge were also made. Climate change is the most pressing environmental challenge of our time and considered a ``threat multiplier" whereby warmer, wetter, and more extreme climatic conditions amplify other threats such as poor air quality effects on vulnerable residents, species changes, and nonpoint source runoff and combined sewer overflow events that contribute to eutrophication and can manifest as harmful algal blooms. Our assessment found that investments in monitoring and evaluation are insufficient and that the region's intellectual and environmental capital is not being leveraged sufficiently to address current challenges. Continued investment in this transnational network is essential to support ecosystembased management. (C) 2021 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Water level regulation is one of the most common anthropogenic disturbances of lentic ecosystems, which is especially evident in shallow lakes. The objective of this study was to assess the ecological effects of water level regulation in a shallow lake using thermodynamic indicators to support decision makers in a dam decommissioning process. For that we tested three hypotheses: 1) the regulated lake supports lower taxonomic diversity than the naturally fluctuating lake; 2) the structure of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage is different in the regulated lake than in the naturally fluctuating lake; 3) the regulated lake supports less complex benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages than the naturally fluctuating lake. Our results show that the first hypothesis, tested using taxa richness, Shannon-Wiener and Simpson diversity indices, was not validated. The second hypothesis was tested using taxonomic composition and was validated, with the two types of lakes exhibiting dissimilar macroinvertebrate assemblages. The third hypothesis, tested using two thermodynamic based indicators, eco-exergy and specific eco-exergy, was partially supported, which was illustrated, overall, by higher eco-exergy (degree of complexity) of the benthic assemblages in the naturally fluctuating lake, although the specific eco-exergies (capacities to use external energy resources) were similar. As a whole, our results endorse the importance of natural water level fluctuations as a driving force in shallow lake ecosystems and reinforced the idea that dam decommissioning is a good option for restoring natural conditions in this type of ecosystem.

AB  - Information about evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for managing water resources, especially in areas with limited water and no irrigation facilities. In this study, based on ET observations made using an eddy covariance system, the variation of ET and its control factors are investigated on monthly and annual scales in the context of China's Loess Plateau. Monthly ET is determined by the reference ET (ET0) and surface conductance (g(s)), where ET0 is an indicator of both the energy available for ET and the atmospheric demand for evaporation and g(s) represents the environmental stress that limits ET. The correlations among volumetric soil water content (SWC), leaf area index (LAI), and monthly ET are weak across all the studied ecosystems. ET shows large inter-annual variability in the Loess Plateau, with a coefficient of inter-annual variation of 19.5%. The environmental variables of ET0, precipitation (P), SWC, LAI, and g(s) also show notable inter-annual variability. P is the original factor forcing the inter-annual variability of ET. LAI and g(s) are important for regulating ET and reduce the correlation between ET and SWC. Different ecosystems use different biological processes to regulate ET under conditions of water stress: for natural vegetation, g(s) responds directly to SWC and surface air vapor pressure (e) and controls ET by regulating transpiration; for cropland, LAI responds directly to SWC and e and determines g(s), thereby regulating ET. The present results suggest that LAI is useful for characterizing the physiological constraints on cropland ET but is not suitable for estimating the ET of semi-arid natural vegetation. Parameterizing g(s) with e could give better estimates of ET for natural vegetation.

AB  - This study focused on the combined effect of environmental conditions (temperature) and contamination (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) on the activity of soil microorganisms (nitrifying bacteria). Phenanthrene (Phe) at five contamination levels (0, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 mg kg(-1) dry mass of soil) was employed as a model PAH compound in laboratory experiments that were conducted at three temperatures (i.e., 20 degrees C (recommended by ISO 15685 method), 15 and 30 degrees C). Three soils with different properties were used in these studies, and the activity of the nitrifying bacteria was assessed based on nitrification potential (NP) determinations. For the statistical evaluation of the results, the ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) method for three independent variables (i.e., temperature, phenanthrene concentration, soil matrix (as a qualitative variable)) and their interactions was employed. The results indicated on the significant interaction of all studied factors. Temperature influenced the toxicity of Phe towards NP, and this effect was related to the Phe concentration as well as was varied for the different soils. A low content of soil organic matter (controlling bioavailability of phenanthrene to soil microorganisms) enhanced the combined effect of temperature and Phe toxicity, and a high biological activity of the soil (high NP values) increased the effect of high temperature on the Phe stimulatory influence. The results indicate that the temperature should not be neglected in tests evaluating PAH ecotoxicity, especially for reliable ecological risk assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Eutrophication is a major problem in coastal water bodies. Information about the trophic status of water bodies will enable proper management of coastal ecosystems. In this regard, biological organisms which are sensitive to environmental changes can serve as indicators of ecosystem trophic status. In this study, seasonal and spatial variations of picophytoplankton (PP; <3 mu m size) community structure was assessed in the Cochin backwaters (CB) with respect to the prevailing environmental conditions during three seasons, post-monsoon (PM-I; October 2011 and PM-II; November 2012), pre-monsoon (PrM; May 2012) and monsoon (MON; August 2012). CB, along the west coast of India, receives continuous load of nutrients throughout the year through anthropogenic wastes. Trophic status index (TRIX) scores showed that CB is highly eutrophic with a high phytoplankton biomass. Synechococcus was the dominant PP observed in-the study area. Seasonal and spatial salinity variations influenced the PP distribution, especially Synechococcus where PE-rich Synechococcus (SYN-PE) were dominant in higher saline (>30) and PC-rich Synechococcus (SYN-PC) in lower saline (<30) waters. SYN-PC showed a significant positive relation with chlorophyll a suggesting that this group contributes substantially to the total phytoplankton biomass. TRIX scores and SYN-PC: SYN-PE abundance ratio were negatively correlated with salinity suggesting an influence of the tidal amplitude. SYN-PC correlated positively and SYN-PE negatively with TRIX scores suggesting that these groups occupy contrasting ecological niches. These findings imply that PP distribution pattern can serve as an indicator of the trophic status of coastal water bodies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There have been significant diversions of water from rivers and streams around the world; natural flow regimes have been perturbed by dams, barriers and excessive extractions. Many aspects of the ecological 'health' of riverine systems have declined due to changes in water flows, which has stimulated the development of thinking about the maintenance and restoration of these systems, which we refer to as environmental flow methodologies (EFMs). Most existing EFMs cannot deliver information on the population viability of species because they: (1) use habitat suitability as a proxy for population status; (2) use historical time series (usually of short duration) to forecast future conditions and flow sequences; (3) cannot, or do not, handle extreme flow events associated with climate variability; and (4) assume process stationarity for flow sequences, which means the past sequences are treated as good indicators of the future. These assumptions undermine the capacity of EFMs to properly represent risks associated with different flow management options; assumption (4) is untenable given most climate-change predictions. We discuss these concerns and advocate the use of demographic modelling as a more appropriate tool for linking population dynamics to flow regime change. A 'meta-species' approach to demographic modelling is discussed as a useful step from habitat based models towards modelling strategies grounded in ecological theory when limited data are available on flow-demographic relationships. Data requirements of demographic models will undoubtedly expose gaps in existing knowledge, but, in so doing, will strengthen future efforts to link changes in river flows with their ecological consequences.

AB  - Comprehensive ecological and physiological studies (on the organism level) of plant response of Scots pine to changes in soil fertility were carried out in order to obtain quantitative parameters of the leaf apparatus and root system functioning and nature of their interrelation. Biological productivity was calculated according to V.M. Lebedev and E.V. Lebedev (2006), net productivity of photosynthesis - according to A.A. Nichiporovich (1955), and mineral productivity - according to V.M. Lebedev (1998). The response of 2-3-year-old scots pine plants was studied for fertilization with 30, 60, 120 and 240 kg/ha of nitrogen against the fertilizer application rate of P60K60 under the conditions of a microfield experiment on gray forest soil. An increase in the level of nitrogen nutrition led to a change in the ecological and physiological parameters of the root system and leaf apparatus functioning: the ratio between root and photosynthetic potential, nitrogen absorption by the unit of the active surface of roots per day, net productivity of photosynthesis, and biological productivity of plants. The nitrogen status slightly affected the net productivity of photosynthesis, however drove up an increase in biological productivity by 1.2-1.5 times. An increase in the nitrogen status led to a change in the ratio between the values of root and photosynthetic potentials in favor of the leaf apparatus. A high positive correlation (0.931-0.992) between the photosynthetic potential and increase in dry mass; and a high negative correlation (-(0.843-0.963)) between the ratio of root potential to photosynthetic potential and nitrogen uptake were established. The maximum of pine biological productivity was observed at a nitrogen rate of 120 kg/ ha. A further increase of the nitrogen status led to a decrease in biological productivity and was found to be toxic. The response of pine to a decrease in soil fertility (due to its slow response) was determined as a result of a retrospective comprehensive ecological and physiological analysis of tabular phytomass data compiled by V.A. Usol'tsev (2002) for tree stands growing in the European and Asian parts of Russia in the age range from 10-20 to 150-300 years. The natural decrease in soil fertility of pine stands with the age from 25 to 100 years in all the regions caused a decrease in nitrogen uptake by 18.5-84.5 times, and net productivity of photosynthesis by 3.4-18.0 times. The correlation between plant age, nitrogen uptake, and net productivity of photosynthesis ranged from -0.714 to -0.870 and -0.894 to -0.991, respectively. The decrease in the activity of photosynthetic apparatus and root system adversely affected the biological productivity, which fell from 2.8 to 4.0 times depending on the region. The relationship between biological productivity and age was high negative (correlation coefficient ranged from -0.572 to -0.783). The relationship between mineral productivity with biological productivity and net productivity of photosynthesis in all cases was high positive from 0.907 to 0.994 and from 0.757 to 0.932, respectively. Starting from the age of 25, the plants adapted to a decrease in soil fertility by increasing the ratio of root to photosynthetic potential, which grew from 4.8 to 12.5 times during ontogenesis depending on the region. This nonspecific reaction is confirmed by the high positive correlation (from 0.947 to 0.997) of the ratio of root to photosynthetic potential with the tree age.

AB  - Forests play an important role in biodiversity conservation, being one of the main providers of ecosystem services, according to the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity. The functions and ecosystem services provided by forests are various concerning the natural capital and the socio-economic systems. Past decades of remote-sensing advances make it possible to address a large set of variables, including both biophysical parameters and ecological indicators, that characterize forest ecosystems and their capacity to supply services. This research aims to identify and implement existing methods that can be used for evaluating ecosystem services by employing airborne and terrestrial stationary laser scanning on plots from the Southern Carpathian mountains. Moreover, this paper discusses the adaptation of field-based approaches for evaluating ecological indicators to automated processing techniques based on airborne and terrestrial stationary laser scanning (ALS and TLS). Forest ecosystem functions, such as provisioning, regulation, and support, and the overall forest condition were assessed through the measurement and analysis of stand-based biomass characteristics (e.g., trees' heights, wood volume), horizontal structure indices (e.g., canopy cover), and recruitment-mortality processes as well as overall health status assessment (e.g., dead trees identification, deadwood volume). The paper, through the implementation of the above-mentioned analyses, facilitates the development of a complex multi-source monitoring approach as a potential solution for assessing ecosystem services provided by the forest, as well as a basis for further monetization approaches.

AB  - Expansion of natural forest or woodland in forestry plantations can potentially provide insight about the behaviour of plant communities in human-modified ecosystems. Here, we investigate the expansion of native woody vegetation into abandoned areas within timber plantations, whereby management decisions (and consequently different conditions of land abandonment) had led to variation in vegetation composition and structure. These differences were assessed to identify native species suitable for agroforestry systems within forestry plantations. Elements of sub-tropical dry forest (the reference forest) had expanded into (i) clear-felled and then abandoned plantations, and (ii) unharvested abandoned plantations. Two-way indicator species analysis, Non-metric multidimensional scaling, and Indicator species analysis were used to describe compositional intergradation between natural forest and secondary vegetation, and to assess correlation with environmental variables of fire and stand structure. Areas of vegetation expansion contained 53 native woody species from 26 families, about half the number sampled in the reference forest. The understory composition of unharvested plantation sites closely resembled regrowth forest, whereas clear-felled plantations had developed a species composition resembling woodland, comprising savanna species. Substantial intergradation among compositions of woodland, plantations and regrowth forest implied that regrowth forest was a likely propagule source for native species, but that past plantation management practices acted as an environmental filter resulting in slightly different vegetation types. Useful woody species Sclerocarya birrea, Vangueria infausta, Trichilia emetica, Strychnos spinosa, Annona senegalensis, and Hyphaene coriaceae were considered ecologically suitable for testing in silvo-pasture agroforestry systems owing to their occurrence in disturbed, open-canopy, fire-exposed environments (see also the graphical abstract in the supplemental files).

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are highly susceptible to mercury (Hg) deposition, which impacts biotic health and leads to serious consequences through biomagnification. The keystone zooplankter, Daphnia, exerts disproportionate effects on food web dynamics, displaying high sensitivity to natural stressors, and thus serving as an indicator of the broader impairments of aquatic ecosystems. Combined with metabolomics, the study of metabolites and their chemical processes, we have developed a model that attempts to elucidate the interactive effects of Hg toxicity and nutrition on phytoplankton-Daphnia relationships. Our model stipulates a physiological hierarchy, prioritizing different metabolic processes in the order of neurological functions, bioenergetics, osmoregulatory maintenance, waste management, and growth investments. Daphnia resilience is controlled by both food quantity and quality and each physiological process is modulated by the somatic levels of different metabolites. By enriching food with metabolites associated with neurological and energetic physiological pathways, effects of toxicity can be alleviated. Specifically, we demonstrate that metabolites associated with bioenergetics (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and phosphorus) confer the greatest resilience to physiological changes induced by toxicity. Prey-predator dynamics can change significantly due to the detrimental impacts of toxicity on daphnid physiology and unfavourable nutritional stoichiometry. Under conditions of poor nutrition and extreme toxicity, our model demonstrates that daphnid populations may collapse and thus phytoplankton could escape intense grazing pressure. Founded upon the premise that response to stress can be more rapidly detected at the metabolic level, our study offers a new perspective to develop bioindicator systems and early warning signals for more efficient environmental monitoring.

AB  - The discipline of ecosystem oceanography provides a framework for assessing the role of mesoscale physical processes on the formation and occurrence of biological hotspots. We used shipboard surveys over nine years to investigate environmental determinants of seabird hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula, a region experiencing rapid climate change and an expanding krill fishery. We hypothesize that seabird hotspots are structured by mesoscale ocean conditions that reflect differences in prey distribution within oceanic and coastal waters. We used generalized additive models to quantify functional relationships of seabird hotspots with krill biomass, and a suite of remotely sensed environmental variables, such as eddy kinetic energy. The spatial organization, changes in intensity, and distribution shifts of seabird hotspots indicate different environmental drivers within coastal and oceanic domains and reflect the seasonal variability of the ecosystem. Our results indicate at least eight mesoscale hotspot zones that represent ecologically important areas where significant krill and predator biomass may be concentrated. Our ecosystem assessment of seabird hotspots identified critical foraging habitat and provided reference points to benefit research on estimating their trophic impacts on Antarctic ecosystems and potential effects from the krill fishery. Our approach is generally applicable to other pelagic ecosystems that are structured by hydrographic fronts and eddies, and containing schooling forage species shared by multiple wide-ranging predators. Furthermore, identification of biological hotspots is useful for the designation of marine protected areas most critical to potentially endangered wildlife and fisheries resources.

AB  - Marine eutrophication refers to an ecosystem response to the loading of nutrients, typically nitrogen (N), to coastal waters where several impacts may occur. The increase of planktonic growth due to N-enrichment fuels the organic carbon cycles and may lead to excessive oxygen depletion in benthic waters. Such hypoxic conditions may cause severe effects on exposed ecological communities. The biologic processes that determine production, sink, and aerobic respiration of organic material, as a function of available N, are coupled with the sensitivity of demersal species to hypoxia to derive an indicator of the Ecosystem Response (ER) to N-uptake. The loss of species richness expressed by the ER is further modelled to a marine eutrophication Ecosystem Damage (meED) indicator, as an absolute metric of time integrated number of species disappeared (species yr), by applying a newly-proposed and spatially-explicit factor based on species density (SD). The meED indicator is calculated for 66 Large Marine Ecosystems and ranges from 1.6 x 10(-12) species kgN(-1) in the Central Arctic Ocean, to 4.8 x 10(-8) species kgN-1 in the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf. The spatially explicit SDs contribute to the environmental relevance of meED scores and to the harmonisation of marine eutrophication impacts with other ecosystem-damage Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) indicators. The novel features improve current methodologies and support the adoption of the meED indicator in LCIA for the characterization of anthropogenic-N emissions and thus contributing to the sustainability assessment of human activities.

AB  - The European water legislation highlights the necessity of developing ecological criteria for assessing the quality of aquatic ecosystem. While a multitude of ecological indicators has been proposed and validated for streams, rivers and lakes, these indicators are not available for groundwater ecosystems. In the present study, we developed a method based on the measurements of the growth and activity of microorganisms developed on artificial substrates (glass beads) incubated in wells to characterize the trophic status of groundwater. Incubation sites were selected in an urban aquifer where previous works showed contrasting trophic conditions in groundwater due to artificial groundwater recharge practices. Total proteins, total carbohydrates, dehydrogenase and hydrolytic activities were measured on glass beads incubated in wells for two periods of 2 months (October-December 2010 and April-June 2011). Biofilm measured on glass beads was significantly more developed and active in wells where groundwater was enriched with dissolved organic matter due to artificial groundwater recharge. Indeed, most microbial variables (total proteins and dehydrogenase activities for the two incubation periods and hydrolytic activities for the second incubation period) were significantly and positively correlated with the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in groundwater. The availability of phosphorus also tended to influence biofilm growth (assessed by total carbohydrates) when PO43- concentrations were lower than 50 mu g/l. Overall, our study clearly demonstrated that artificial substrates acting as colonisable area for microorganisms could be used to efficiently monitor nutrient enrichment in aquifers.

AB  - This study compares the edaphic macroarthropod communities from experimental plantations of Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus grandis, both 7 years old, and from the primary forest, all located on the table-land region in the state of Espirito Santo (Brazil). Most of the taxonomic groups analyzed reach densities as high, or higher, in the plantations as in the primary forest. Four points however differentiate the communities of both plantations from that of the forest: the absence of Diplura and Pseudoscorpionida; the lower relative abundance of ants; the dominance of some non-social arthropods; and the concentration of a great percentage of macroarthropods in the litter layers. All these features seem to reflect a higher complexity in the decomposition subsystem of the primary forest, which is expected since it is a natural ecosystem. Regarding agroecosystems, the community under A. mangium shows a lower seasonal variation of total densities and a higher density of Blattaria, Isopoda, Coleopteran larvae and Lepidopteran larvae. These differences are apparently a consequence of the greater quantity of leaf litter, rich in nutrients, accumulated on the soil in this plantation. Therefore, both plantations create a propitious environment for macroarthropod communities. But A. mangium seems to provide better conditions to the soil communities, and thus it seems to be an important alternative to conciliate the wood production and the recuperation of edaphic communities in areas surrounding the remnants of the Atlantic forest.

AB  - A data set comprising 95 stands of desert vegetation, collected from the Wadi Allaqi Biosphere Reserve and its environs within the South-Eastern Desert of Egypt during 1985-90, was analysed using multivariate procedures (two-way indicator species analysis: TWINSPAN; detrended correspondence analysis: DCA; canonical correspondence analysis: CCA), to produce a classification of plant communities in the area, and to examine the relationships of these plant communities to natural and man-induced features of the physical environment of the area (in particular, the influence of Lake Nasser, a major impoundment of the River Nile formed in 1964). The vegetation classification produced groupings broader, in both floristic and ecological terms, than those found by earlier studies of this area. In total 78 plant species were recorded from four phytogeographic elements. Four principal vegetation groups were identified, of which one is new to the area, and is the result of major environmental changes affecting the downstream part of the Wadi Allaqi system; following periodic flooding of the wadi by Lake Nasser during the past 30 years. This community was indicated by Tamarix nilotica. There was a strongly-zoned (downstream-upstream) pattern to the vegetation within this lower part of Wadi Allaqi, which appears to be a function of the probability of flooding by the lake. The remaining three vegetation groups occur higher in the wadi basin, Groundwater-dependence appeared to be important in defining a group indicated by Acacia tortilis; as well as the Tamarix nilotica group. The two remaining groups, characterized respectively by Acacia ehrenbergiana and Cullen plicatum, represent vegetation groups which are precipitation-dependent, and which tolerate drier conditions within the Allaqi system.

AB  - Conservation biologists can use several criteria, such as species richness and incidence of range-restricted species, to prioritize allocation of conservation efforts and identify sites of high ecological value. Recently, ecological uniqueness has been proposed as an effective criterion because it allows the identification of species assemblages that are complementary and irreplaceable. This study aims to determine whether the ecological uniqueness of plant communities is an adequate criterion for assessing the conservation value of ecosystems. We used two large datasets of lake-edge wetlands located in southern Quebec (Canada) to achieve this objective. We computed the local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) as a measure of uniqueness and evaluated its relationship to more common conservation criteria (richness, rarity and specialization of species, as well as site area and connectivity) using Pearson correlations and independent effects. Uniqueness decreased with increasing plant species richness, suggesting a conservation trade-off, whereas it increased with the percentage of rare and disturbance-sensitive specialist species. Highly unique sites were mostly of high conservation value, although the overall integrity of the landscape affected the quality of sites singled out as unique. The species composition of unique sites should be examined closely to determine their conservation value and other criteria should be used in conjunction with uniqueness to identify which set of sites to protect in a given landscape.

AB  - In urban environments, climatic conditions and air pollution affect metal content, morphology and physiology of leaves with implications for litter morphology and palatability affecting structural and functional diversity of the soil microarthropod community. As leaf morphology rapidly responds to different environmental factors, recently, functional leaf traits are considered good indicators of plant health status. Aim of the research was to relate Quercus ilex (good monitor of air pollution) leaf, litter and soil microarthropod community characteristics taking into account metal pollution and climatic conditions. The research was performed in an urban environment of the Mediterranean area. Leaves and litter were characterized for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb concentrations and for the main functional traits. The soil microarthropod community was investigated for abundance and richness as well as for habitat and diet preferences. The main results were that leaf metal accumulation and climatic condition contextually affected the litter characteristics both in terms of metal composition and morphological traits. Litter quality discriminated different microarthropod taxa assemblages according trophic preferences whereas climatic conditions strongly affected microarthropod habitat distribution.

AB  - Effective stewardship of ecosystems to sustain current ecological status or mitigate impacts requires nuanced understanding of how conditions have changed over time in response to anthropogenic pressures and natural variability. Detecting and appropriately characterizing changes requires accurate and flexible trend assessment methods that can be readily applied to environmental monitoring datasets. A key requirement is complete propagation of uncertainty through the analysis. However, this is difficult when there are mismatches between sampling frequency, period of record, and trends of interest. Here, we propose a novel application of generalized additive models (GAMs) for characterizing multi-decadal changes in water quality indicators and demonstrate its utility by analyzing a 30-year record of biweekly-to-monthly chlorophyll-a concentrations in the San Francisco Estuary. GAMs have shown promise in water quality trend analysis to separate long-term (i.e., annual or decadal) trends from seasonal variation. Our proposed methods estimate seasonal averages in a response variable with GAMs, extract uncertainty measures for the seasonal estimates, and then use the uncertainty measures with mixed-effects meta-analysis regression to quantify inter-annual trends that account for full propagation of error across methods. We first demonstrate that nearly identical descriptions of temporal changes can be obtained using different smoothing spline formulations of the original time series. We then extract seasonal averages and their standard errors for an a priori time period within each year from the GAM results. Finally, we demonstrate how across-year trends in seasonal averages can be modeled with mixed-effects metaanalysis regression that propagates uncertainties from the GAM fits to the across-year analysis.

AB  - Repair of damaged areas in open-pit (opencast) coal mines has emerged as an important environmental concern. Our research investigated the mechanism by which different ecological restoration methods affected soil nematode communities in damaged areas of desert steppe coal mines. Using high-throughput sequencing technology, nematode community composition, diversity, and function were analyzed to determine the response of nematodes to different ecological restoration methods in damaged areas of coal mines. For slope rehabilitation, vegetation blanket restoration exhibited more favorable effects than those exhibited by vegetation bag restoration and natural restoration. For rehabilitation of the platform area under the slope, the diversity of soil nematodes and the soil fauna analysis under alien soil restoration conditions were performed and exhibited similar characteristics to those of the native vegetation. Findings based on Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) multi-level discriminant analysis and determination of shared genera suggest that Paraphelenchus, Cervidellus, Panagrolaimus, Microdorylaimus, Cephalobus, and Ecumenicus may be the key genera of soil nematodes in the damaged ecosystem of open-pit coal mines in the desert steppe. We found that reasonable water and fertilizer management in slope restoration and under-slope platform area restoration may play a key role in the restoration of damaged ecosystems in open-pit coal mines. We comprehensively analyzed the response of soil nematode communities and their functions to different ecological restoration methods, and provided a reference for evaluating the quality of underground ecosystem restoration of damaged areas in abandoned desert steppe open-pit coal mines.

AB  - Mangrove sediments act as natural biogeochemical reactors, modifying metals partitioning after their deposition. The objectives of the present study were: to determine distribution and partitioning of metals (Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr, Cu, Co and As) in sediments and pore-waters of Can Gio Mangrove; and to assess their ecological risks based on Risk Assessment Code. Three cores were collected within a mudflat, beneath Avicennia alba and Rhizophora apiculata stands. We suggest that most metals had a natural origin, being deposited in the mangrove mainly as oxyhydroxides derived from the upstream lateritic soils. This hypothesis could be supported by the high proportion of metals in the residual fraction (mean values (%): 71.9, 30.7, 80.7, 80.9, 67.9, 53.4 and 66.5 for Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr, Cu, Co, and As respectively, in the mudflat). The enrichment of mangrove-derived organic matter from the mudflat to the Rhizophora stand (i.e. up to 4.6% of TOC) played a key role in controlling metals partitioning. We suggest that dissolution of Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides in reducing condition during decomposition of organic matter may be a major source of dissolved metals in pore-waters. Only Mn exhibited a potential high risk to the ecosystem. Most metals stocks in the sediments were higher in the Avicennia stand than the Rhizophora stand, possibly because of enhanced dissolution of metal bearing phases beneath later one. In a context of enhanced mangrove forests destruction, this study provides insights on the effects of perturbation and oxidation of sediments on metal release to the environment.

AB  - Testate amoeba communities are influenced by temporal variation in the productivity levels in the environment, and may be used as an indicator group for these changing conditions. Here, we analysed the effect of temporal variation in the levels of productivity variables on testate amoeba community of the upper Parana River floodplain. We evaluated the hypothesis that the frequency and abundance of the testate amoeba community change along an environmental gradient, with different taxa establishing at different points along the gradient in response to changes in the levels of productivity variables. We predicted that the number of species would increase and decrease at points associated with higher and lower levels of productivity variables, respectively. Testate amoeba species were sampled quarterly between 2000 and 2012 from six lakes in the upper Parana River floodplain, Brazil. We recorded 110 species belonging to 11 families. Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis identified positive and negative significant shift points in response to the concentration of chlorophyll-a, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus on the frequency and abundance of the testate amoeba community. Our results indicated that change intervals in the levels of productivity variables were associated with the establishment of different taxa. The main bioindicator species of productivity were Diffiugia acuminata, D. amphoralis, D. helvetica multilobata,D. kempny, D. lobostoma multilobata, D. parva, D. schurmanni, D. ventricosa, and Lesquereusia ovalis. These species were linked to the increase and decrease in the levels of productivity, confirming the ecological importance of the role of these organisms as bioindicators in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Reclaimed wastewater reuse represents an effective method for partial resolution of increasing urban water shortages; however, reclaimed water may be characterized by significant contaminant loading, potentially affecting receiving ecosystem (and potentially human) health. The current study examined biofilm growth and nutrient adsorption in Olympic Lake (Beijing), the largest artificial urban lake in the world supplied exclusively by reclaimed wastewater. Findings indicate that solid particulate, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and metal oxide (Al, Fe, Mn) constituent masses adhere to a bacterial growth curve during biofilm formation and growth. Peak values were observed after approximate to 30 days, arrived at dynamic stability after approximate to days and were affected by growth matrix surface roughness. These findings may be used to inform biofilm cultivation times for future biomonitoring. Increased growth matrix surface roughness (10.0 mu m) was associated with more rapid biofilm growth and therefore an increased sensitivity to ecological variation in reclaimed water. Reclaimed water was found to significantly inhibit biofilm nutrient adsorption when compared with a "natural water" background, with elevated levels of metal oxides (Al, Fe, and Mn) and EPS representing the key substances actively influencing biofilm nutrient adsorption in reclaimed water. Results from the current study may be used to provide a quantitative baseline for future studies seeking to assess ecosystem health via monitoring of biofilms in the presence of reclaimed water through an improved quantitative understanding of biofilm kinetics in these conditions.

AB  - Primary productivity of ecosystem is important indicator about ecological assessment. Remote sensing technology has been used to monitor net primary productivity (NPP) of ecological system for several years. In this paper, the remotely sensed NPP simulation model of alpine vegetation in Qinghai Province of Tibet Plateau was set up based on the theory of light use efficiency. Firstly a new approach based on mixed pixels and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm were used to correct simulated NPP values derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Finally, spatial distribution and monthly variation characteristics of NPP in Qinghai Province in 2006 were analyzed in detail. The result showed that NPP of vegetation in Qinghai Province in 2006 ranged from 0 to 422 gC/m(2)/a and the average NPP was 151 gC/m(2)/a. NPP gradually increased from northwest to southeast. NPP of different vegetation types were obviously different. The average NPP of broad-leaved forest was the largest (314 gC/m(2)/a), and sparse shrub was the smallest (101 gC/m(2)/a). NPP in Qinghai Province significantly changed with seasonal variation. The accumulation of NPP was primarily in the period (from April to September) with better moist and heat conditions. In July, the average NPP of vegetation reached the maximum value (43 gC/m(2)). In our model, the advantage of traditional LUE models was adopted, and our study fully considered typical characteristics of alpine vegetation light use efficiency and environmental factors in the study area. Alpine vegetation is the most important ecological resource of Tibet Plateau, exactly monitoring its NPP value by remote sensing is an effective protection measure.

AB  - In the drylands of northern Kenya, as elsewhere in Africa, traditional pastoralist social-ecological systems are undergoing profound transformations. Diminishing resource availability, changing social values and governance systems, and new resource management institutions challenge the capacity of communities for effective common pool resource management. Individuals' values and environmental perceptions play a substantial role in decision making regarding resource use and management. Additionally, social capital within communities can influence cooperative and adaptive resource management. We studied five Laikipia Maasai communities in Kenya, which share a common natural environment, history, and political organization. We surveyed pastoralists' perceptions of the adequacy of two ecosystem services, forage availability and livestock abundance. We also assessed indicators of three forms of social capital: reciprocity, sanctioning, and norms of fairness. Four communities established set-aside conservation areas through partnership with external organizations. In those communities, we examined residents' perceptions of five different potential ecological and economic benefits from the conservation areas. We found that communities varied in residents' perceptions of grazing resource adequacy, the economic sufficiency of their livestock herds, and the benefits of conservation areas. Communities also varied in measures of social capital. We contextualize our findings in terms of the rules and conditions governing each conservation area, the roles of social capital, and the challenges of resource-use trade-offs when perceptions diverge. We conclude that taking stock of perceptions and values placed on ecosystem services is a crucial element of formulating plans for sustainable resource management and navigating trade-offs in the future.

AB  - We examined the relative impacts of socioeconomic and biophysical variables on understory vegetation in urban woodlands using the example of satoyama woodland in pen-urban areas of Tokyo, Japan to determine an appropriate institutional framework for enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services in urban woodlands. Satoyama woodland was historically managed, however, the recent abandonment endangers its biodiversity and ecosystem services. We addressed two main working questions: (1) Which variables (among conservation measures, management actors, and other environmental variables) are the main constraints on the current understory vegetation of urban woodland? (2) How does each management actor behave in the context of different conservation measures and how does this behavior affect the understory vegetation? We employed dwarf bamboo (Pleioblastus chino) as an indicator of the intensity of satoyama woodland management and combined ecological analysis with interviews of municipal officials. We found that the conditions of understory vegetation were mainly affected by differences in the behavior of management actors, as the height of dwarf bamboo was shortest at the woodland managed by community group, followed by municipality and private landowner. This suggests that it will be necessary to consider both biophysical variables and socioeconomic variables in urban ecosystem management. We also found that different management actors had different reasons to conduct or not conduct woodland management. To improve management by these multiple actors, we recommend: developing management plans for conserved areas, providing economic and non-economic support, and developing clear indicators for monitoring the effects of management, with their different behaviors in mind.

AB  - The Biodiversity and Bioindicators research group (BiBIO), based at the Natural Sciences Museum of Granollers, has coordinated four long-term faunal monitoring programmes based on citizen science over more than two decades in Catalonia (NE Spain). We summarize the historical progress of these programmes, describing their main conservation outputs, the challenges overcome, and future directions. The Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (CBMS) consists of a network of nearly 200 recording sites where butterfly populations have been monitored through visual censuses along transects for nearly three decades. This programme provides accurate temporal and spatial changes in the abundance of butterflies and relates them to different environmental factors (e.g., habitat and weather conditions). The Bat Monitoring Programme has progressively evolved to include passive acoustic monitoring protocols, as well as bat box-, underground- and river-bat surveys, and community ecological indices have been developed to monitor bat responses at assemblage level to both landscape and climatic changes. The Monitoring of common small mammals in Spain (SEMICE), a common small mammal monitoring programme with almost 80 active live-trapping stations, provides information to estimate population trends and has underlined the relevance of small mammals as both prey (of several predators) and predators (of insect forest pests). The Dormouse Monitoring Programme represents the first monitoring programme in Europe using specific nest boxes for the edible dormouse, providing information about biological and demographic data of the species at the southern limit of its distribution range. The combination and complementarity of these monitoring programmes provide crucial data to land managers to improve the understanding of conservation needs and develop efficient protection laws.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims at evaluating the ecological status of European coastal water bodies (CWBs). This is a rather complex task and first requires the use of long-term databases to assess the effect of anthropogenic pressure on biological communities. An in situ dataset was assembled using concomitant biological, i.e., chlorophyll a (Chl a) and environmental data, covering the years from 1995 to 2014, to enable a comprehensive assessment of eutrophication in the Western Iberia Coast (WIC). Given the temporal gaps in the dataset, especially in terms of Chl a, satellite observations were used to complement it. Positive relationships between Chl a 90th percentile and nitrogen concentrations were obtained. The Land-Uses Simplified Index (LUSI), as a pressure indicator, showed no relationship with Chl a, except in Galicia, but it highlighted a higher continental pressure in the Portuguese CWBs in comparison with Galician waters. In general terms, the trophic index (TRIX) showed that none of the CWBs were in degraded conditions. Nevertheless, the relatively high TRIX and LUSI values obtained for the water body in front of Tagus estuary suggest that this area should be subject to continued monitoring. Results highlighted the usefulness of satellite data in water quality assessments and set the background levels for the implementation of operational monitoring based on satellite Chl a. In the future, low uncertainty and harmonized satellite products across countries should be provided. Moreover, the assessment of satellite-based eutrophication indicators should also include metrics on phytoplankton phenology and community structure.

AB  - Progress towards combatting land degradation as intended by Sustainable Development Goal 15.3.1 will be monitored using three sub-indicators, of which productivity of vegetation is one. This indicator is to be measured using trends in a remotely-sensed vegetation index. The use of vegetation indices is well-established and remotely-sensed data are readily available. However, their uses for monitoring production that is relevant to sustainable livelihoods have received little attention. This review identifies four areas in the currently-proposed monitoring methodology that are in need of further development. The first is the derivation of primary production from vegetation indices, which requires attention to physiological processes such as light-use efficiency and plant respiration. The second concerns the subsequent steps, in which ecological processes transform the net production into production of goods and services, such as crop products. The third is the need for explicit baselines or reference conditions that specify the productivity in the absence of anthropogenic degradation. The fourth, and most difficult, is to distinguish anthropogenic causes of degradation from potentially similar effects of natural environmental processes. Some of these issues are difficult to tackle with remote sensing alone, although several improvements are available, and others are in development. However, the current use of vegetation indices alone to remotely-sense degradation of ecosystem services does not provide an adequate SDG 15.3.1 productivity indicator.

AB  - The development of mining and other resource-based industries are among key drivers of economic development in the Arctic. The fragile environment and the presence of nature-based livelihoods and indigenous communities pose challenges for mining development. Mining operations should be optimized so that the profitability is maintained in changing market conditions and to meet increasing societal and environmental demands. In this study we present the current understanding on the interplay between mining and the surrounding socio-ecological systems in the Arctic region. The existing academic literature on the Arctic region was reviewed, covering 127 peer-reviewed publications since 2000. We investigated the mining activities from four perspectives examining: 1) environmental, 2) economic, 3) social and 4) legal dimensions, covering three life-cycle stages: 1) pre-mining, 2) mining, and 3) post-mining. The publications on the environmental and economic aspects focused principally on the impacts of mining, whereas social and legal publications discussed the interaction between people and their rights and ways of controlling their environment. Besides the need for more balanced research between different life-cycle stages we uncovered five research gaps concerning the knowledge base needed to increase the sustainability of Arctic mining: 1) impacts and adaptation to climate change, 2) monitoring the sustainability of mining using standardized indicators, 3) holistic economic assessment of mining, 4) social sustainability and conflict management, and 5) mechanisms that mitigate or compensate for the adverse effects of mining on biodiversity.

AB  - Pollution, over exploitations, urban development and climate changes cause huge losses on our natural capital. The human race depends on healthy ecosystems to deliver essential services such as food, water, clean air and recreation. The need of quantifying the levels and values of these ecosystems services and incorporate them into resource management is increasing each and every day. According to EU biodiversity strategy up to 2020 (EC 2011), target 2, by 2020 ecosystems and their services must be maintained and enhanced by restoring at least 15% of degraded ecosystems. In order to measure the progress towards this target, is essential to map ecosystems and their condition. At EU and national level is proposed a general and analytical framework based on the DPSIR framework (Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact and Response) in order to integrate economic values into accounting and reporting system, but also to provide cross references with ecosystem services categories that are being used in assessments. The big challenge that European Commission is facing consists in using the large amount of geospatial data and other information that are available for building a feasible methodology and suitable data sets. The framework to be used is developed by CICES and it was evaluated among 4 pilot studies of MAES working group, same working group that came along with the proposal of indicators for mapping and assessing urban ecosystems and their services applicable to EU and most of its Member States. MAES outcome of the working group showed that when using data that already exist and combine it in a coherent and integrated ecosystem assessment yields a starting database consistency.

AB  - Ecological and conservation research has provided a strong scientific underpinning to the modeling of ecosystem services (ESs) over space and time, by identifying the ecological processes and components of biodiversity (ecosystem service providers, functional traits) that drive ES supply. Despite this knowledge, efforts to map the distribution of ESs often rely on simple spatial surrogates that provide incomplete and non-mechanistic representations of the biophysical variables they are intended to proxy. However, alternative data sets are available that allow for more direct, spatially nuanced inputs to ES mapping efforts. Many spatially explicit, quantitative estimates of biophysical parameters are currently supported by remote sensing, with great relevance to ES mapping. Additional parameters that are not amenable to direct detection by remote sensing may be indirectly modeled with spatial environmental data layers. We review the capabilities of modern remote sensing for describing biodiversity, plant traits, vegetation condition, ecological processes, soil properties, and hydrological variables and highlight how these products may contribute to ES assessments. Because these products often provide more direct estimates of the ecological properties controlling ESs than the spatial proxies currently in use, they can support greater mechanistic realism in models of ESs. By drawing on the increasing range of remote sensing instruments and measurements, data sets appropriate to the estimation of a given ES can be selected or developed. In so doing, we anticipate rapid progress to the spatial characterization of ecosystem services, in turn supporting ecological conservation, management, and integrated land use planning.

AB  - A metric was developed for assessing anthropogenic impacts on aquatic macrophyte ecology by scoring macrophyte species along the main gradient of community change. A measure of ecological quality was then calculated by Weighted Averaging (WA) of these species scores at a monitoring site, and comparison to a reference condition score. This metric was used to illustrate the difficulties of developing aquatic macrophyte indices based on indicator species in Mediterranean rivers. The response of the metric to a nutrient gradient was examined within two different river typologies: the national typology designed for the Water Framework Directive and a typology that segregates the environmental variables to produce maximum species similarity within a river type. Both typologies showed the strong north-south climatic divide in Portugal, with southern rivers having long periods without rainfall and often without flowing water in the summer. Overall, the metric responded well to nutrient impacts however it performed poorly in some southern lowland river types. This was thought to be due to low numbers of aquatic macrophytes in temporary rivers. Non-aquatic species that establish in the river channel of temporary rivers may have to be included in indices to improve performance. Also, simple Weighted Averaging (WA) metrics may be insensitive to abundance changes and loss of rarer indicators in lowland Mediterranean rivers. More sophisticated methods of using WA are suggested, as well as further research into developing assessment methods specific to the character of Mediterranean rivers. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Current state of the art in environmental risk assessment is based on the use of static risk metrics, which fail to account for the dynamic nature of ecological disasters. To obtain a better estimate of toxicity we need to consider the details of the disaster-impacted exposure conditions, i.e. the temporal profile of pollutant speciation in the external medium and the ability of the organism's physiology to handle the internalised concentrations within a given timeframe. This work presents a novel approach to addressing ecotoxicological risk in the case of ecological disasters, introducing biology-based concepts for assessing dose-response relationships between environmental concentrations of toxicants in the aquatic environment and health effects on aquatic organisms such as muscles, shellfish and other fishes. Our approach, which is based on biology-based dose-response modeling, takes into account the physiological processes controlling bio-uptake and metabolism of toxic chemical species in a dynamic time frame. This allows for creating dose-response-time estimates of toxicity, which extend the use of conventional "static" risk metrics. The dynamic toxicity model developed estimates target organ concentrations and physiological response as a function of time. This improves our understanding of the dynamic relationships between concentration exposure and hazard to aquatic species. Furthermore, we identify appropriate biological tissues that may serve as biomarkers sensitive to acute and transient exposure to waterborne contaminants such as heavy metals. The implementation of the methodology is shown using the mortality of tilapia (a tropical fish species) due to arsenic contamination as example case.

AB  - The effects of drought on stream invertebrates have been reviewed, but the effects of artificially reduced flows have not. We addressed this knowledge gap by reviewing the literature on the effects of natural low flows and artificially reduced flows (without complete cessation of flow). We considered the effects of low water volume on habitat conditions and on invertebrate community structure, behavior, and biotic interactions. Decreases in discharge usually cause decreased water velocity, water depth, and wetted channel width; increased sedimentation; and changes in thermal regime and water chemistry. Invertebrate abundance increases or decreases in response to decreased flow, whereas invertebrate richness commonly decreases because habitat diversity decreases. Invertebrates differ in their environmental tolerances and requirements, and any loss of habitat area or alteration of food resources from decreased flow can influence organism behavior and biotic interactions. Invertebrate drift often increases immediately after flow reduction, although some taxa are more responsive to changes in flow than others. Natural low flows and artificially reduced flows have similar effects on invertebrates, but the severity (duration and magnitude) of the flow decrease can influence invertebrate responses. Certain invertebrate taxa are especially sensitive to flow decreases and might be useful indicators for reduced flows or flow restoration. The effect of low flow on streams is an important issue, but few empirical studies of the impacts of decreased flow on stream ecosystems have been done, and more manipulative experiments are needed to understand the ecological consequences of decreased flow.

AB  - Wetlands conservation and resilience capacities are key issues in many places over the globe. Understanding these issues will benefit from a precise knowledge of seagrass species occupancy and coverage over time and over space. Such information can be obtained from remote sensing images and their classification thanks to a vegetation index, to be used in a complementary manner to field work inventories. Sentinel-2 data, which are available with a frequent revisit time (<5 days) and a high spatial resolution (10m pixel size) can be used to map grassbeds at the surface or slightly below the surface of permanent lagoons, hence enabling the characterization of its seasonal dynamics, which was not possible with previous remote-sensing tools. We have proved the feasibility of such a method in the natural reserve of the Bagnas (Herault, France) where Stuckenia pectinata coverage can be tracked over a full year thanks to Sentinel-2 images and field work. Inter-annual dynamics (seasonal growth and senescence) can be mapped over time with 10m resolution and will be extended to pluriannual studies thanks to the long-term objective of the Sentinel-2 mission. This opens the way to a concerted management of natural reserves based on data analysis and field knowledge, a better understanding of seagrass coverage with fluctuating environmental conditions, and predictive mechanistic and/or stochastic models of future qualitative trends.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the effects of two acid resin deposits on the soil microbiota of forest areas by means of biomass, microbial activity-related estimations and simple biological ratios. The determinations carried out included: total DNA yield, basal respiration, intracellular enzyme activities (dehydrogenase and catalase) and extracellular enzyme activities involved in the cycles of C (beta-glucosidase and chitinase), N (protease) and P (acid-phosphatase). The calculated ratios were: total DNA/total N; basal respiration/total DNA; dehydrogenase/total DNA and catalase/total DNA. Total DNA yield was used to estimate soil microbial biomass. Results showed that microbial biomass and activity were severely inhibited in the deposits, whilst resin effects on contaminated zones were variable and site-depenclant. Correlation analysis showed no clear effect of contaminants on biomass and activities outside the deposits, but a strong interdependence with natural organic matter related parameters such as total N. In contrast, by using simple ratios we could detect more stressful conditions in terms of organic matter turnover and basal metabolism in contaminated areas compared to their uncontaminated counterparts. These results stress that developed ecosystems such as forests can buffer the effects of pollutants and preserve high functionality via natural attenuation mechanisms, but also that acid resins can be toxic to biological targets negatively affecting soil dynamics. Acid resin deposits can therefore act as contaminant sources adversely altering soil processes and reducing the environmental quality of affected areas despite the solid nature of these wastes.

AB  - In conventional coffee farming, soil fauna can be negatively affected by the intensive management practices adopted and the use of an agroforestry system (AFS) is an alternative to reduce these impacts. In coffee AFS, soil nutrition is provided mainly using organic fertilizers. This soil management favors the microbiota and can alter the population dynamics of some organisms. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of organic fertilizers on the nematode community in coffee AFS and to determine their impact on soil ecology. Soil samples were collected from three coffee AFS and a nearby Atlantic rainforest fragment. Nematodes were extracted from the samples and identified to the genus. The identified populations were compared using several community and diversity indices to determine the environmental conditions of the systems under evaluation. No differences in total abundance among nematode communities were found in the four areas evaluated. Regarding trophic groups, the coffee AFS treated with either cow manure or poultry litter favored the trophic group of bacterivores. Plant-parasitic nematodes were more abundant in soils of both the naturally fertilized coffee AFS and the Atlantic rainforest fragment. The maturity and structural indexes indicated that the Atlantic rainforest fragment and the naturally fertilized coffee AFS had similar ecological functions. On the other hand, soils fertilized with cow manure were less diverse, had higher dominance in the community, and showed less ecological stability. The nematode communities found in the AFS were similar to those seen in the forest fragment indicating that is possible to produce coffee sustainably without negatively affecting soil quality.

AB  - The study of benthic macroinvertebrate communities is one of the most common methods for assessing the effects of stresses on the biological conditions of aquatic ecosystems and water quality monitoring. This research was conducted to study the changes in the macroinvertebrate communities in the Shanbeh-Bazar River, Anzali International wetland and the effects of environmental factors. Sampling was done seasonally from spring to winter in 2017 from the. Bio-indicators, MDS, PCA, correlation and ANOSIM were used in this study. A total of 3963 macroinvertebrate belonging to 3 phyla, 9 orders of 17 families were identified. The two families of Chironomidae and Tubificidae were the most abundant, and the dominant group of the Shanbeh-Bazar River. The bio-indicators analysis varied from medium pollution to heavy pollution at different stations. MDS plot showed that sampling stations were clearly separated into 3 groups. ANOSIM and PCA analysis were shown that the human activities and urban wastewater effects on benthic communities such as increasing the resistant families (Tubificidae). The increasing of agricultural activities and the destruction of marginal forests at Stations 3 and 4 were caused the abundance of Chironomidae and Tubificidae increased. Since the Shanbeh-Bazar River has urban disturbance, especially wastewater inputs, agriculture, fishing and recreational boats, macroinvertebrate diversity decreased with increasing contaminants and stresses, led to an increase in resistant species. With the increase of agricultural and the destruction of marginal forests, the amount of organic matter increased in the water body. Anthropogenic activities are indicated to have the most negative effects on the river ecosystem. Thus, it was concluded that the river health of Shanbeh-Bazar River is within unacceptable range.

AB  - The environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a compulsory evaluation instrument for environmental management and decision making processes and applies to different phases of activities (plans, programmes, projects and /or existing production or services), because it measures the natural and anthropogenic activities effects upon the environment. These impacts may affect the cultural richness, biodiversity, social-economic conditions and human health as well as the ecosystem equilibrium.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the environmental impact generated by the heavy metal pollution from the main sources located in the southern area of the Romanian Black Sea coast. Various pollution sources that discharge contaminated effluents were considered for the impact and risk assessment with concern to water and sediments. The main sources analyzed were the effluents of wastewater treatment plants (4 treatment plants of SC RAJA Constanta) and the effluents of a refinery. The methods applied in order to assess the impact of pollution sources with heavy metals were Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix (RIAM) and Integrated Environmental Impact and Risk approach.
   Environmental indicators used for impact quantification were correlated considering the concentrations of heavy metals from the effluents (generated by the 5 pollution sources), marine water and sediments.
   The results obtained in this study provide a general image for the heavy metal pollution caused by considered anthropogenic activities on the Romanian Black Sea Coast. The results showed that the analyzed pollution sources do not have a significant negative impact generated by the heavy metal pollution. However, the presence of other pollution sources should not be overlooked because the ecosystem equilibrium must be maintained even if the concentrations of the heavy metals are below the maximum allowed values.

AB  - Stomata are the channels by which plants exchange water vapor and carbon dioxide with the environment. Clarifying the change from stomatal limitations (SL) to non-stomatal limitations (NSL) of photosynthesis and their critical conditions is vital for accurately recognizing the degree of crop drought and formulating countermeasures. A field experiment was carried out from 2013 to 2015 to study the critical water conditions when maize photosynthesis changed from being limited by SL to NSL in different leaf positions under different degrees of water stress in different growth stages (3rd leaf stage, 7th leaf stage and jointing stage). Our results indicated that photosynthesis of maize leaves at different positions changed from being determined by SL to NSL under different water stress levels at different growth stages; moreover, maize photosynthesis changed from being directed by SL to NSL in the first fully expanded leaf at the top before the changes occurred in the third leaf. The effect of water stress during different growth stages on the maize leaf water content (LWC) at which photosynthesis changed from being limited by SL to NSL was not distinct. The changing point of SL at different leaf positions was closely related to the LWC, and the LWC at the changing point of SL was different at different leaf positions, which indicated that the change in SL is mainly determined by the leaf position and LWC, and its occurrence showed a decreasing trend from plant top to bottom. The LWC at which the SL transformation point occurred in the first fully expanded leaf at the top (75.5 % +/- 1.5 %-75.7 % +/- 1.3 %) was higher than that at which the change occurred in the third leaf at the top (73.2 % +/- 1.1 %-73.4 % +/- 1.6 %). The phenomenon of photosynthesis changing from being limited by SL to NSL occurred first in the first fully expanded leaf at the top; additionally, the LWC of the first fully expanded leaf at the top was the best indicator in maize under water stress and could be used as the critical condition marking the transformation of maize damage from water stress to damage from plant physiological and ecological stress. These results could provide a basis for the identification of crop drought disasters and their classification and provide a methodological reference for the identification and monitoring of drought in other crops.

AB  - The bioindicator notion is an appealing concept that has received more support in applied than in basic ecology, mostly due to the difficulty in deriving general ecological rules applicable to all target organisms. However, recognizing the mechanisms that determine the association between a particular species and the well-being of many other species is important for understanding the functioning of ecosystems and the relationship among different biological levels. We examined here the processes at the individual level that cause an association between species performance and biodiversity value, by analyzing attributes that can be studied in a variety of animals with sexual reproduction, namely breeding site selection and condition-dependent sexual signals. Our study model was the Capercaillie, an indicator of forest functioning and diversity, and the associated bird community, used here as a surrogate of broader forest biodiversity. At a regional scale Capercaillie occurrence was not associated with the most diverse forest patches, but at the scale of male spring territories the sexual display grounds (arenas) were located in the oldest and less disturbed forest portions, which also hosted the richest local bird communities. Social mechanisms and conspecific cueing likely concurred with habitat-driven processes in determining the long-term persistence of traditional display grounds, which were appealing to many other species because of their structural composition. Characteristics of male vocal display that honestly advertize male quality (low frequencies and rapid song rates) were significantly correlated with high diversity values, resulting in a spatial association between individual and community performances. Costly or risky activities such as reproductive or social behaviors, which more than other attributes match gradients in habitat quality, are therefore contributing to functionally connect individuals with ecosystem health.

AB  - We investigated how interacting multi-scale environmental variables affect taxonomic composition and functional feeding groups of macroinvertebrates in headwater streams of western Patagonia in southern Chile (45-47 degrees S), a region characterised by extreme climatic gradients, intact forested catchments, and recent intense land use change. The opportunity of establishing biological/functional diversity patterns for near-reference conditions of headwaters streams is paramount. We used multi-dimensional scaling ordination and boosted regression tree analysis to evaluate the link between reach, catchment, spatial, and regional climatic variables and macroinvertebrate community structure. The high diversity of predators in low productivity streams, together with genera previously unreported for this latitudinal range underscore the unique characteristics and very limited understanding of Patagonian freshwater stream communities. Two main groups of environmental variables were linked to both taxonomic and functional feeding group diversity. The strongly associated variables were related to forest cover (and inversely alpine zone) at the catchment scale, together with stream velocity at the local scale. The second group reflected local indicators of productivity and weathering inputs, associated with the regional east-west precipitation gradient. We present a conceptual model for the catchment scale effects on invertebrate functional groups in forested headwater streams. While the results highlight potentially singular characteristics of the study region, they also suggest a macro-ecological generalisation of how global change variables, operating on mountain catchments, may differentially affect stream ecosystems as a consequence of the variations in the forest/alpine gradient, across both deciduous and evergreen temperate biomes.

AB  - Predictive models based on invertebrate assemblages are a powerful tool for assessing water quality. Yet, few attempts have been made to build predictive models with diatoms although they are widely used in freshwater assessment and are among the mandatory biological monitoring elements indicated in the European Water Framework Directive. We built two predictive models for central Portugal, one for macroinvertebrates and the other for diatoms, using data sampled simultaneously from 43 sites in the Spring of 2004 and 2005. Our objective was to test the performance of models based on the diatom community and compare the assessments made by the two indicator communities for the same sites. Each model was tested with 17 sites. Both models showed good performance in predicting reference sites to the correct group: 76% for the macroinvertebrate model using the discriminant variables longitude, distance to source, alkalinity, depth, number of riffles and channel substrate diversity; 85% for the diatoms model using latitude, runoff, mineralization, distance to source, slope, discharge and hardness. The water quality assessments of test sites produced by the two models were similar in 76% of the cases. According to the predictive models, invertebrates were more sensitive to morphological alterations of the channel and habitat conditions (presence of dams and artificial walls, destruction of riparian corridor) while diatoms were more sensitive to changes in water chemistry. Moreover, in lowland streams, where the habitat and substrate heterogeneity are naturally low, assessment by diatoms was more useful than evaluations using invertebrates. We concluded that invertebrates and algae provide consistent and in some cases complementary information on environmental quality and recommend their simultaneous use for bioassessment.

AB  - Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger spore and Staphylococcus albus are typical biological indicators for the inactivation of airborne pathogens. The present study characterized and compared the behaviors of B. subtilis subsp. niger spores and S. albus in regard to inactivation by chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas under different gas concentrations and relative humidity (RH) conditions. The inactivation kinetics under different ClO2 gas concentrations (1 to 5 mg/liter) were determined by first-order and Weibull models. A new model (the Weibull-H model) was established to reveal the inactivation tendency and kinetics for ClO2 gas under different RH conditions (30 to 90%). The results showed that both the gas concentration and RH were significantly (P< 0.05) and positively correlated with the inactivation of the two chosen indicators. There was a rapid improvement in the inactivation efficiency under high RH (> 70%). Compared with the first-order model, the Weibull and Weibull-H models demonstrated a better fit for the experimental data, indicating nonlinear inactivation behaviors of the vegetative bacteria and spores following exposure to ClO2 gas. The times to achieve a six-log reduction of B. subtilis subsp. niger spore and S. albus were calculated based on the established models. Clarifying the kinetics of inactivation of B. subtilis subsp. niger spores and S. albus by ClO2 gas will allow the development of ClO2 gas treatments that provide an effective disinfection method.
   IMPORTANCE
   Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas is a novel and effective fumigation agent with strong oxidization ability and a broad biocidal spectrum. The antimicrobial efficacy of ClO2 gas has been evaluated in many previous studies. However, there are presently no published models that can be used to describe the kinetics of inactivation of airborne pathogens by ClO2 gas under different gas concentrations and RH conditions. The first-order and Weibull (Weibull-H) models established in this study can characterize and compare the behaviors of Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger spores and Staphylococcus albus in regard to inactivation by ClO2 gas, determine the kinetics of inactivation of two chosen strains under different conditions of gas concentration and RH, and provide the calculated time to achieve a six-log reduction. These results will be useful to determine effective conditions for ClO2 gas to inactivate airborne pathogens in contaminated air and other environments and thus prevent outbreaks of airborne illness.

AB  - Abundance and distribution of earthworms in agricultural fields is frequently proposed as a measure of soil quality assuming that observed patterns of abundance are in response to improved or degraded environmental conditions. However, it is not clear that earthworm abundances can be directly related to their edaphic environment, as noted in Darwin's final publication, perhaps limiting or restricting their value as indicators of ecological quality in any given field. We present results from a spatially explicit intensive survey of pastures within United Kingdom farms, looking for the main drivers of earthworm density at a range of scales. When describing spatial variability of both total and ecotype-specific earthworm abundance within any given field, the best predictor was earthworm abundance itself within 20-30 m of the sampling point; there were no consistent environmental correlates with earthworm numbers, suggesting that biological factors (e.g. colonisation rate, competition, predation, parasitism) drive or at least significantly modify earthworm distributions at this spatial level. However, at the national scale, earthworm abundance is well predicted by soil nitrate levels, density, temperature and moisture content, albeit not in a simple linear fashion. This suggests that although land can be managed at the farm scale to promote earthworm abundance and the resulting soil processes that deliver ecosystem services, within a field, earthworm distributions will remain patchy. The use of earthworms as soil quality indicators must therefore be carried out with care, ensuring that sufficient samples are taken within field to take account of variability in earthworm populations that is unrelated to soil chemical and physical properties.

AB  - Water quality management requires monitoring of the condition of natural waters by both biological and chemical indicators to assess the ecological health of a catchment. General water quality characteristics are extracted through a low-frequency dataset, which allows analyses of long-tenn trends and seasonality. Plitvice Lakes National Park freshwater ecosystem includes springs, rivers, streams and lakes with its specific process of tufa formation. The aim of this study was to determine, based on long-term water quality data, potential changes in physico-chemical parameters required for ongoing tufa deposition processes. The dataset encompasses a 12-year period (2006-2017), with measurements performed from April to October per each year on a weekly basis, covering thirteen sites belonging to karst springs, streams or lotic biotopes. Positive trends were observed for dissolved oxygen, conductivity, water hardness, alkalinity, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrites. Negative trends were observed for temperature, pH and most nutrients (nitrates, ammonia and orthophosphates). Temperature values showed different trend slopes among monitored types. Negative correlations between water level and/or discharge with conductivity and alkalinity probably indicate the effect of dilution. Conversely, nutrients and COD have a positive correlation with discharge, possibly indicating resuspension from sediment during high flows. The analyses of spatial and temporal variations in hydrochemistry through a longer period imply annual alterations, correlations between hydrological components and water chemistry, and significant differences among monitored types, while the tufa deposition process is stable. Long-term monitoring and continuous data analyses can help in future planning of monitoring programs and the improved understanding of climate changes.

AB  - Functional assessment approaches can identify indicators of environmental change and ecological response in estuaries. This study used a 24-year coastal fisheries dataset (1993-2016) and environmental data to evaluate fish assemblage changes in Galveston Bay, Texas (USA) in response to environmental parameters and freshwater inflows, drought, and flood. Functional classification categorized 107 fish species into eleven functional groups to determine if estuarine species serve as suitable indicators of environmental condition. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS), distance-based linear models, and graphing techniques using annual departures from period averages determined relationships between functional group abundance, freshwater inflows, and environmental parameters. Results show that estuarine-resident carnivore, estuarine-resident omnivore, marine migrant carnivore, and marine straggler carnivore functional groups exhibit highest species richness (mean = 21 species) and abundance (mean = 48,411 individuals) compared with other functional groups (mean species richness = 3; mean abundance = 1143 individuals). Declines in abundance of functional groups occurred during a 2011-2014 drought, with rebounds in 2015-2016. Relationships between inflows, salinity, and functional group abundance were evident in upper Galveston Bay, diminishing with increasing distance from major freshwater sources. Functional abundance in lower parts of the bay was decoupled from inflows and salinity changes. Findings support the conclusion that estuarine-resident and marine functional groups have limited potential to serve as bioindicators, while freshwater migrant carnivores are potential bioindicators for upper portions of the estuary. Functional methodologies provide insight into effects of environmental change on estuarine ecosystems and serve as management tools to assess changes in fish assemblages.

AB  - In the face of increasing cumulative effects from human and natural disturbances, sustaining coral reefs will require a deeper understanding of the drivers of coral resilience in space and time. Here we develop a high-resolution, spatially explicit model of coral dynamics on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Our model accounts for biological, ecological and environmental processes, as well as spatial variation in water quality and the cumulative effects of coral diseases, bleaching, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris), and tropical cyclones. Our projections reconstruct coral cover trajectories between 1996 and 2017 over a total reef area of 14,780 km(2), predicting a mean annual coral loss of -0.67%/year mostly due to the impact of cyclones, followed by starfish outbreaks and coral bleaching. Coral growth rate was the highest for outer shelf coral communities characterized by digitate and tabulate Acropora spp. and exposed to low seasonal variations in salinity and sea surface temperature, and the lowest for inner-shelf communities exposed to reduced water quality. We show that coral resilience (defined as the net effect of resistance and recovery following disturbance) was negatively related to the frequency of river plume conditions, and to reef accessibility to a lesser extent. Surprisingly, reef resilience was substantially lower within no-take marine protected areas, however this difference was mostly driven by the effect of water quality. Our model provides a new validated, spatially explicit platform for identifying the reefs that face the greatest risk of biodiversity loss, and those that have the highest chances to persist under increasing disturbance regimes.

AB  - Theoretical studies of the resilience of ecological systems to environmental change predict that the size distributions of species in ecosystems should have discontinuities that reflect similar discontinuities in ecosystem processes. Body size distributions should have many peaks and troughs (modes) for natural, undisturbed ecosystems, but that as disturbances increases, so the number of modes declines. If so, this prediction has implications for assessing the quality of real ecological systems and has potential for environmental monitoring.
   This paper explores the relationship between water quality and body size patterns in stream communities in order to establish the potential of size based indicators for assessing environmental conditions as well as testing Holling's (1992) proposition that lumpiness occurs in body size distributions across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. Samples of the stream benthos were collected at different station in River Aire, Yorkshire, UK, which varies in water quality. All sites showed skewed distributions towards smaller size classes and most had two very obvious modes at medium and large size classes except for most polluted habitats. Analysis of the number of gaps using Holling's (1992) BMDI, revealed wide variation in clean and intermediate water quality sites, though the most polluted site had the fewest gaps. However other disturbed sites had more gaps and for some clean site had fewer gaps. It is clear that size distributions in stream communities are lumpy in the sense that most sites showed more than one mode or many gaps but the number of gaps (discontinuities) is not correlated with disturbances, at least for freshwater quality.

AB  - For several decades there has been recognition that water resource development alters river flow regimes and impacts ecosystem values. Determining strategies to protect or restore flow regimes to achieve ecological outcomes is a focus of water policy and legislation in many parts of the world. However, consideration of existing environmental flow assessment approaches for application in Queensland identified deficiencies precluding their adoption. Firstly, in managing flows and using ecosystem condition as an indicator of effectiveness, many approaches ignore the fact that river ecosystems are subjected to threatening processes other than flow regime alteration. Secondly, many focus on providing flows for responses without considering how often they are necessary to sustain ecological values in the long-term. Finally, few consider requirements at spatial-scales relevant to the desired outcomes, with frequent focus on individual places rather than the regions supporting sustainability. Consequently, we developed a risk-based ecohydrological approach that identifies ecosystem values linked to desired ecological outcomes, is sensitive to flow alteration and uses indicators of broader ecosystem requirements. Monitoring and research is undertaken to quantify flow-dependencies and ecological modelling is used to quantify flow-related ecological responses over an historical flow period. The relative risk from different flow management scenarios can be evaluated at relevant spatial-scales. This overcomes the deficiencies identified above and provides a robust and useful foundation upon which to build the information needed to support water planning decisions. Application of the risk assessment approach is illustrated here by two case studies.

AB  - In modern conditions, when more and more countries build their national policies in the field of socio-economic long-term development on the principles of sustainable development, the problem of evidence-based assessment of natural resource potential of regional is extremely important. Methodological support to the processes of calculation and evaluation of all components of the natural-resource potential is a prerequisite for the development of effective management decisions made at both national and regional levels. The purpose of this study was to substantiate the list of criteria that will help to be used both for assessing the natural resource potential of territorial ecosystems of regions and for evaluating their effectiveness, as well as defining a set of promising measures to improve the natural resource potential of regional territorial ecosystems. For the study, the methods of content analysis, factor analysis, data systematization, method of expert assessment, the method of expert assessment coordination, SWOT analysis, and other scientific approaches were used, allowing to comprehensively consider the problem under study. As a result of the study, scientific approaches to the definition of the concepts of "natural resource potential" and "ecosystem" were clarified, as well as to determine the main groups of factors influencing the natural resource potential of territorial ecosystems of the region. "Natural resource potential" and "ecosystem". In addition, based on a study of existing research in this area, the main groups of factors that influence the natural resource potential of the region's territorial ecosystems were identified. The materials of the article can be used in the development of an environmental-oriented strategy for the development of regions, as well as a set of environmental measures to preserve territorial ecosystems.

AB  - Both physical-chemical and biological indicators are used to assess the ecological health of ecosystems. The functional trait composition of communities has the potential to predict the impact of environmental change on ecosystems, yet, we miss evidence that information on pollution can be used to forecast the functional responses of freshwater communities. We used chemical and ecological data collected in the Nestore river basin (Central Italy) to test whether (i) there are generalities in the response of macroinvertebrate functional diversity to river pollution; (ii) water pollution filters certain functional traits and (iii) traits do better than chemical analyses at revealing ecological stress in rivers. Due to interactions with hydrology, chemical variables showed higher seasonal variation at impacted sites, so occasional water samples represented snapshots. Functional traits did well at detecting water pollution by various chemicals, and there was a clear shift of trait combinations from unimpacted to impacted sites. Anthropogenic disturbances homogenized benthic communities in terms of taxonomic and functional composition, both in space (impacted sites) and time (seasons). Traits related to feeding habits (mainly reliance on fine particulate organic matter) and tolerance to organic pollution were prevalent at impacted reaches, and functional trait compositions were more stable than water chemistry over seasons because they integrate environmental conditions over longer time periods. Functional traits can play a relevant role in the bioassessment of polluted river ecosystems, even under low to moderate disturbance. Trait-based assessment can be complemented by chemical analyses, notably at highly polluted sites where biological diversity drops to its lowest levels. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Information on naturally occurring thyroid disease in wild animals in general and in small mammals specifically is extremely limited. In the present field-based work, we investigated the structure and function of thyroid glands of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculata) studied as sentinels of ecosystem sustainability on reclaimed areas post-mining on the oil sands of northeastern Alberta, because of their greater sensitivity to contaminants relative to meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) on the same sites. Extraction of bitumen in the oil sands of northeastern Alberta, results in the release of contaminants including polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), metals, and metalloids to the environment that have a measurable biological cost to wildlife living in the affected areas. In previous investigations, deer mice exposed to pollution at reclaimed areas showed compromised ability to regenerate glutathione indicating oxidative stress, together with decreased testicular mass and body condition during the breeding season. In the present study, thyroid glands from those deer mice from the reclaimed site had markedly increased follicular cell proliferation and decreased colloid compared to animals from the reference site. This pathology was positively associated with the greater oxidative stress in the deer mice. Thyroid hormones, both thyroxine and triiodothyronine, were also higher in animals with greater oxidative stress indicating increased metabolic demands from contaminant related subclinical toxicity. This work emphasizes the value of using a combination of endocrinological, histological and oxidative stress biomarkers to provide sensitive measures of contaminant exposure in small mammals on the oil sands.

AB  - The advent of an ecosystem-based approach dramatically expanded the scope of fisheries management, creating a critical need for new kinds of data and quantitative approaches that could be integrated into the management system. Ecosystem models are needed to codify the relationships among drivers, pressures and resulting states, and to quantify the trade-offs between conflicting objectives. Incorporating ecosystem considerations requires moving from the single-species models used in stock assessments, to more complex models that include species interactions, environmental drivers and human consequences. With this increasing model complexity, model fit can improve, but parameter uncertainty increases. At intermediate levels of complexity, there is a sweet spot' at which the uncertainty in policy indicators is at a minimum. Finding the sweet spot in models requires compromises: for example, to include additional component species, the models of each species have in some cases been simplified from age-structured to logistic or bioenergetic models. In this paper, we illuminate the characteristics, capabilities and short-comings of the various modelling approaches being proposed for ecosystem-based fisheries management. We identify key ecosystem needs in fisheries management and indicate which types of models can meet these needs. Ecosystem models have been playing strategic roles by providing an ecosystem context for single-species management decisions. However, conventional stock assessments are being increasingly challenged by changing natural mortality rates and environmentally driven changes in productivity that are observed in many fish stocks. Thus, there is a need for more tactical ecosystem models that can respond dynamically to changing ecological and environmental conditions.

AB  - Modern reef sediments reflect the physical and chemical characteristics of the environment as well as the local reef fauna. Analysis of sedimentary reef fades can thus provide a powerful tool in interpreting ancient reef deposits. However, few studies have attempted to differentiate sedimentary facies in mesophotic coral ecosystems, low light habitats defined as residing 30-150 m below sea level. The low-angle shelf mesophotic coral ecosystem south of the northern U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) consists of reefs with different structural characteristics ideal for studying the relationship between habitat variability and sedimentary facies. Textural, compositional, and geochemical analyses of surface sediments were used to identify mesophotic reef subfacies associated with distinct benthic communities and structural habitats. Sediment grain composition and bulk geochemistry were found to broadly record the distribution and abundance of coral and macroalgae communities, foundational mesophotic reef benthic organisms. Overall, sediment composition was found to be a good indicator of specific reef environments in low-angle mesophotic reef habitats. Sedimentological analyses indicate that hydrodynamic forces do not transport a significant amount of allochthonous sediment or potentially harmful terrigenous material to USVI mesophotic reefs. Episodic, maximum current velocities prevented deposition of most silt-size grains and smaller, but biological processes were found to have a greater influence on subfacies partitioning than hydrodynamic processes. Results provide a new analog for studies of ancient mesophotic coral ecosystem geological history and document the relationship between mesophotic reef subfacies, structural complexity, and habitat heterogeneity. They also demonstrate how mesophotic reefs along the same shelf system do not always share similar sedimentary characteristics and thus record a diverse set of ecological and environmental conditions.

AB  - Our paper describes a method for determining environmental flows based on the use of the Tennant and Tessman methods - based on flow duration curves as well as instream flows using the methods of Kostrzewa, the National Foundation for Environmental Protection and Water Management, and the Malopolska method. Calculations were conducted for the catchments of three rivers: the Ochotnica, the Wielki Rogoznik, and the Mlyniska all located in the basin of the Upper Dunajec. Input data obtained from the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management, the National Research Institute, were observation series of daily flows for the years 2000-09. The hydrometric data were evaluated in terms of homogeneity and independence using the Mann-Kendall-Sneyers test. The following characteristic flows were determined: minimum flow, mean annual low flow, and mean annual flow.
   The authors were inspired to perform this analysis by Polish regulations requiring that the instream flow refers to needs of aquatic ecosystem organisms, but they do not take into account the needs of waterdependent ecosystems (wetlands). Therefore, we assessed the possibilities of applying hydrological methods to determine the environmental flow, taking into account the needs of both aquatic ecosystems and floodplains.
   The calculations revealed differences between the values of the instream and environmental flows and also allowed us to conclude that in all the analyzed catchments the computed instream and environmental flows were below the level determined by the average monthly flow. Based on the indicated ecological criterion, the Tessman method was recommended to determine environmental flow in the Upper Dunajec basin, but emphasizing that adaptation of methods should be carried out to calculate environmental flow, which will take into account physiographic, climatic, and natural conditions of studied basins.

AB  - The decision-making environment in forest management (FM) has changed drastically during the last decades. Forest management planning is facing increasing complexity due to a widening portfolio of forest goods and services, a societal demand for a rational, transparent decision process and rising uncertainties concerning future environmental conditions (e.g., climate change). Methodological responses to these challenges include an intensified use of ecosystem models to provide an enriched, quantitative information base for FM planning. Furthermore, multi-criteria methods are increasingly used to amalgamate information, preferences, expert judgments and value expressions, in support of the participatory and communicative dimensions of modern forestry. Although the potential of combining these two approaches has been demonstrated in a number of studies, methodological aspects in interfacing forest ecosystem models (FEM) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) are scarcely addressed explicitly. In this contribution we review the state of the art in FEM and MCDA in the context of FM planning and highlight some of the crucial issues when combining ecosystem and preference modeling. We discuss issues and requirements in selecting approaches suitable for supporting FM planning problems from the growing body of FEM and MCDA concepts. We furthermore identify two major challenges in a harmonized application of FEM-MCDA: (i) the design and implementation of an indicator-based analysis framework capturing ecological and social aspects and their interactions relevant for the decision process, and (ii) holistic information management that supports consistent use of different information sources, provides meta-information as well as information on uncertainties throughout the planning process.

AB  - Background: Ecosystem management requires organizing, synthesizing, and projecting information at a large scale while simultaneously addressing public interests, dynamic ecological properties, and a continuum of physicochemical conditions. We compared the impacts of seven water level management plans for Lake Ontario on a set of environmental attributes of public relevance.
   Methodology and Findings: Our assessment method was developed with a set of established impact assessment tools (checklists, classifications, matrices, simulations, representative taxa, and performance relations) and the concept of archetypal geomorphic shoreline classes. We considered each environmental attribute and shoreline class in its typical and essential form and predicted how water level change would interact with defining properties. The analysis indicated that about half the shoreline of Lake Ontario is potentially sensitive to water level change with a small portion being highly sensitive. The current water management plan may be best for maintaining the environmental resources. In contrast, a natural water regime plan designed for greatest environmental benefits most often had adverse impacts, impacted most shoreline classes, and the largest portion of the lake coast. Plans that balanced multiple objectives and avoided hydrologic extremes were found to be similar relative to the environment, low on adverse impacts, and had many minor impacts across many shoreline classes.
   Significance: The Lake Ontario ecosystem assessment provided information that can inform decisions about water management and the environment. No approach and set of methods will perfectly and unarguably accomplish integrated ecosystem assessment. For managing water levels in Lake Ontario, we found that there are no uniformly good and bad options for environmental conservation. The scientific challenge was selecting a set of tools and practices to present broad, relevant, unbiased, and accessible information to guide decision-making on a set of management options.

AB  - Mine reclamation has long relied on reusing topsoil to mitigate mining impacts but recently constructed soils (i. e., Technosols) have emerged as novel technologies for restoring post mining landscapes. However, their success depends on their ability to sustain soil functions. To assess the efficiency of a limestone mine reclamation, we measured the soil quality (SQ) of a three(SC3) and seven-year-old (SC7) Technosol under sugarcane, and one 20-year-old (P20) Technosol under pasture, constructed with limestone spoil in southeastern Brazil. Soil chemical, physical, and biological attributes were evaluated and compared with those of an adjacent natural soil (NS; Rhodic Lixisol). We also tested the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) for assessing the SQ of the studied soils. SMAF was suitable to detect SQ changes over the years of reclamation. After three and seven years under sugarcane cultivation, the Technosols showed similar SQ indexes (= 0.70 and 0.67) to that of the native soil (SQ = 0.69), whereas after 20 years under pasture the SQ (= 0.88) of P20 was superior to that of NS. Overall, the Technosols recovered most of the ecosystem services expected for healthy soils, especially in P20, where carbon stocks were 2.7 times higher than in NS (82.1 vs 30.35 Mg C ha(-1)). We highlight the importance of using soil quality assessment tools, such as SMAF, in mine reclamation. In summary, Technosols from limestone wastes could restore basic soil functions under tropical environmental conditions within only 20 years.

AB  - Faro Lake is a coastal meromictic lagoon with singular characteristics in the Mediterranean (Messina, Sicily - Italy). It is part of the Natural Oriented Reserve of Capo Peloro (38 degrees 15 57 N; 15 degrees 37 50 E). In this area, traditional mollusc farming activity persists, producing autochthonous' mussels. This study reports of the Mytilus galloprovincialis haemolymph chemical profile and water variables determination of 1 year-lasted survey (April 2016 - March 2017). The determinations of electrolytes (Na+, Cl-, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, P inorganic) and heavy metals in both Faro lake water and haemolymph have been carried out. Heavy metals are elements with high density and are quite toxic in low concentrations, such as Aluminum (Al), Arsenic (As), Cobalt (Co), Chrome (Cr), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Magnesium (Mg), Manganese (Mn), Lead (Pb), Tin (Sn), Zinc (Zn). Heavy metals toxicity depends, principally, on bioaccumulation processes. M. galloprovincialis is a good bio-indicator, ideal for assess levels of environmental pollution thanks to its biological, ecological and physiological characteristics. The results of this study showed a typical fluctuation range in haemolymph and water parameters, related to the water ones; chemical-physical parameters affected the ions (electrolytes and metals) levels in some period of the year. The study reports the interactions between biotic (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and abiotic (water parameters) components of Faro Lake, and creates reference data for further future study on the same area or on similar ones.

AB  - 'Background' is the Concentration of metals in pristine sediment, unaltered by human activity and 'enrichment is the extent present-day sediment metal concentrations exceed pre-anthropogenic levels (the magnitude of human-induced change). Background and enrichment are becoming more frequently used for management measures to bring sediment and the environment back to near-pristine levels. Of the six empirical methods reviewed for determining background (global values, pristine marine and fluvial sediments, catchment soils and rocks), the use of sedimentary cores has the greatest advantage. Most of the eight statistical methods reviewed are adversely affected by the polymodality and an absence of normality or log-normality, however robust regression procedures are most commonly used. Sorption hypothesis techniques require further development.
   Indices used to determine enrichment incorporate background levels (enrichment indices) or do not (contamination indices). Of the 20 indices reviewed, the New Nemerow Index and the Mean Enrichment Quotient rate highly in performance, based on 5 beneficial attributes assessed: use of background and normalised data, provision of thresholds, a classification scheme, and inclusion of multiple metals.
   Variance in background metal concentrations determined in the 43 global projects reviewed is surprisingly moderate, however regional variability may be considerable due to local catchment mineralisation. Chemical analysis of sediment should not include metals bound in the mineral matrix and weak acid extractions are advisable. The use of appropriate and effective indicators of environmental condition are critical to the protection and restoration of marine regions and ensuring that human activities are carried out in a sustainable manner to promote safe, healthy and productive ecosystems.

AB  - The human-mediated translocation of species poses a distinct threat to nature, human health, and economy. Although existing models calculate the invasion probability of any species, frameworks for species-specific forecasts are still missing. Here, we developed a model approach using global ship movements and environmental conditions to simulate the successive global spread of marine alien species that allows predicting the identity of those species likely to arrive next in a given habitat. In a first step, we simulated the historical stepping-stone spreading dynamics of 40 marine alien species and compared predicted and observed alien species ranges. With an accuracy of 77%, the model correctly predicted the presence/absence of an alien species in an ecoregion. Spreading dynamics followed a common pattern with an initial invasion of most suitable habitats worldwide and a subsequent spread into neighboring habitats. In a second step, we used the reported distribution of 97 marine algal species with a known invasion history, and six species causing harmful algal blooms, to determine the ecoregions most likely to be invaded next under climate warming. Cluster analysis revealed that species can be classified according to three characteristic spreading profiles: emerging species, high-risk species, and widespread species. For the North Sea, the model predictions could be confirmed because two of the predicted high-risk species have recently invaded the North Sea. This study highlights that even simple models considering only shipping intensities and habitat matches are able to correctly predict the identity of the next invading marine species.

AB  - Experience demonstrates that none of the available measures on biological effects of pollution should be considered ideal. The use of a single approach does not seem appropriate due to the complexity inherent in assessing the environmental quality of a system. Rather, this should be evaluated by combining a suite of indices providing complementary information.
   Having this in mind, a key table is proposed in this work with the aim of helping managers and authorities of coastal areas in selecting the most suitable ecological indicators taking into account the type of disturbance and the data available. Such key includes numerous indices based on benthic invertebrate fauna information, because in the case of coastal and transitional waters ecosystems there is a clear preference for benthic communities, which integrate environmental conditions and changes in an a very effective way if we want to monitor long-term responses and site-specific impacts.
   The development of this key was based not only on theoretical approaches, but also on results from its application using data bases corresponding to different geographical areas (the Mondego estuary, in the North-Western Coast of Portugal, and Mar Menor coastal lagoon, Escombreras basin, and Cabo Tinoso in the South-Eastern coast of Spain).
   Some recommendations are provided with regard to the most adequate application of the indices, as for example, in what situations it is not advisable the use of some of them, depending on the type of disturbance or the level of taxonomic identification of the organisms.

AB  - From 1941-1944 nearly 30 phytosociological releves were completed by F. K. Hartmann in the Rychlebske Mountains, a typical mountainous area in northeastern Czech Republic. Of the original plots still covered with adult grown beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest, 22 were resampled in 1998 and 1999. In order to describe the recent vegetation variability of the sites 57 releves were recorded. Changes in vegetation were estimated using relative changes in species density and ordinations (PCA, RDA). Environmental changes were assessed using Ellenberg indicator values when no direct measurements were available. A decline in species diversity has been documented, particularly, many species occurring frequently in deciduous forests with nutrient and moisture well-supplied soils around neutral have decreased. In contrast, several light-demanding, acid- and soil desiccation-tolerant species have increased. Natural succession, quantified as forest age, contributed slightly to these changes. In Ellenberg indicator values, a decline in F (soil moisture), R (soil calcium) and N (ecosystem productivity), and an increase in L (understorey light) were shown. This is interpreted as the influence of modified forestry management and of airborne pollutants. Intensified logging caused the canopy to open and soil conditions to worsen. The latter is most likely also due to acid leaching of soil cations (Ca, K, Na). This caused a decline in soil productivity, thus the effect of nitrification could not be detected. The original releves may have differed in size influencing the results.

AB  - Managing riparian corridors for flood resilience requires understanding of linkages between vegetation condition and stream geomorphology. Stream assessment approaches increasingly use channel morphology as an indicator of stream condition, with only cursory examination of riparian vegetation. Our research (i) examines relationships between stream geomorphic condition, as assessed by Rapid Geomorphic Assessment (RGA) scores, and riparian forest structure, and (ii) investigates scale dependencies in the linkages between land cover and stream geomorphology. Wesampled vegetation structure and composition and assessed geomorphic condition at 32 stream reaches within the Lake Champlain Basin, USA. RGA scores were modeled as a function of structural attributes using classification and regression trees. Landsat coverages were used to delineate land uses within five nested spatial scales. Generalized linear models (GLM) evaluated relationships between land cover and RGA scores. Standard deviation of basal area partitioned the greatest variability in RGA scores, but dead tree density and basal area (positively) and shrub density (negatively) were also significant predictors. RGA was related to forest and agricultural cover at the two finest scales. Riparian forest structure is highly dynamic in relation to stand development and disturbance history; simple forest cover information does not capture these differences or their influences on stream geomorphic condition.

AB  - Salt contamination of lakes, due to the application of winter de-icing salts on roads, presents a significant environmental challenge in the "salt belt" region of eastern North America. The research reported here presents the first deployment of a previously published proxy tool based on Arcellinida (testate lobose amoebae) for monitoring road salt contamination. The research was conducted at Silver Lake in Eastern Ontario, a 4-km-long lake with the heavily traveled Trans-Canada Highway (HWY 7) transiting the entire southern shore. The lake showed elevated conductivity (297-310 mu S/cm) and sub-brackish conditions (0.14-0.15 ppt). Sodium levels were also elevated near the roadside (median Na = 1020 ppm). Cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling results revealed four distinct Arcellinida assemblages: "Stressed Cool Water Assemblage (SCWA)," "Deep Cold Water Assemblage (DCWA)," both from below the 8-m thermocline, and the shallower water "Shallow Water Assemblage 1 (SWA-1)" and "Shallow Water Assemblage 2 (SWA-2)". Redundancy analysis showed a minor response of Arcellinida to road salt contamination in shallower areas of the lake, with confounding variables significantly impacting assemblage distribution, particularly beneath the thermocline (e.g., water temperature, water depth, sediment runoff from catchment [Ti], sediment geochemistry [Ca, S]). The results of this study indicate that the trophic structure of the lake has to date only been modestly impacted by the cumulative nature of road salt contamination. Nonetheless, the Silver Lake results should be considered of concern and warrant continued arcellinidan biomonitoring to gauge the ongoing and long-term effects of road salt on its ecosystem.

AB  - Conventional methodologies used to estimate biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems can be nonselective and invasive, sometimes leading to capture and potential injury of vulnerable species. Therefore, interest in noninvasive surveying techniques is growing among freshwater ecologists. Passive acoustic monitoring, the noninvasive recording of environmental sounds, has been shown to effectively survey biota in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. However, knowledge of the sounds produced by freshwater species is relatively scarce. Furthermore, little is known about the representation of different freshwater taxonomic groups and habitat types within the literature. Here we present results of a systematic review of research literature on freshwater bioacoustics and identify promising areas of future research. The review showed that fish are the focal taxonomic group in 44% of published studies and were studied primarily in laboratory aquaria and lotic habitats. By contrast, lentic habitats and other taxonomic groups have received relatively little research interest. It is particularly striking that arthropods are only represented by 26% of studies, despite their significant contributions to freshwater soundscapes. This indicates a mismatch between the representation of taxonomic groups within the freshwater bioacoustic literature and their relative acoustic contribution to natural freshwater soundscapes. In addition, the review indicates an ongoing shift from behavioral studies, often with focus on a single taxonomic group, towards field-based studies using ecoacoustic approaches. On the basis of this review we suggest that future freshwater bioacoustics research should focus on passive acoustic monitoring and arthropod sound, which would likely yield novel insights into freshwater ecosystem function and condition.

AB  - Periphyton is increasingly used to assess the biological condition of lakes. The predominance of relatively shallow exposed waterbodies in Ireland implies that epilithic diatoms should have a prominent role as bioindicators for the WFD; but epilithic diatom ecology in these Irish systems is poorly described. We characterised spring and summer diatom populations in diverse periphyton communities in 91 Irish lake waterbodies. Six assemblage clusters of diatom species were identified, and variation in their assemblages was predominately associated with environmental gradients of acidity-alkalinity, total phosphorus, and true colour. Diatom composition differed amongst high status lakes in three a priori defined lake alkalinity groups commonly used as a diatom typology for lake classification. However, when waterbodies were evaluated with a lake trophic diatom index (LTDI) their distribution of 'expected-values' was equivalent. The LTDI was highly correlated with total phosphorus but also had similar responses in the three lake alkalinity types. These findings indicated that lake typology had a limited role for diatom classification with the LTDI in Ireland. Matched spring and summer sampling across wide environmental gradients allowed the role of seasonality to be investigated. Relatively few benthic diatoms had a significant seasonal indicator value suggesting that unbiased monitoring of the epilithon is possible during any month of the growing season in comparable temperate waterbodies. However, temporal variability was lower at low values of the LTDI and increased unpredictably on a lake by lake basis thereafter. Given that lake diatom classification has been validated we suggest that the approach could be developed and used for more targeted assessment objectives.

AB  - The principal environmental factors influencing the monthly dynamics of phytoplankton were examined from April to October in 2016 in 12 stations of Lake Wuliangsuhai (northwest China). Interestingly, in this lake, nutrient did not exhibit to be limiting for the phytoplankton growth. From April to October, the volume of total nitrogen (TN) range 0.66 similar to 22.22 mg/L, maximum volume was in W1 station in October; total phosphorus (TP) range 0.008 similar to 0.339 mg/L, maximum volume was in W2 station in April; NH4-N range 0.11 similar to 1.74mg/L, maximum volume was in W12 station in October. The most critical forcing factors were water quality physicochemical parameter variables, mainly water temperature (WT), salinity (Sal), conductivity (CON), total dissolved solids (TDS), pondus hydrogenii (pH), and water transparency (SD). The highest phytoplankton density (2.99 x 10(8) cells/L) was recorded in station W12 in June, and the lowest phytoplankton density (4.84 x 10(5) cells/L) in station W8 in May, in conditions of increasing water temperature in summer and lower water temperature in spring. Conversely, the highest species number (61 species) exhibited in station W5 in September, and the lowest species number (6 species) exhibited in station W1 in May. The physicochemical parameter variables, mainly WT, Sal, CON, TDS, pH, and SD, had a significant and measurable effect not only on the development of phytoplankton density but also on the monthly dynamics of the phytoplankton community. Our results revealed that the species number and density of the phytoplankton could serve as biological water quality indicators, which would give overall descriptions of water quality in Wuliangsuhai Lake.

AB  - Ecological restoration of riparian forest corridors at the landscape scale can facilitate recruitment of certain flora and fauna, thus possibly helping to maintain viable wildlife populations. We evaluated ecological restoration of three corridors between two protected Andean forests. Soil ants and eight environmental variables focused on edaphic conditions were monitored for 8 years following restoration activity. Soil ants were collected in pitfall traps and by leaf litter extraction on 21 plots classified into five types of habitat: large forest patches, riparian forests, two types of restoration corridors on former timber and pasture land (R-Forestry and R-Pasture, respectively), and Pasture. A total of 132 ant species belonging to 40 genera were found. Among these, 112 species were found in Forests, 105 in Riparian, 80 in R-Forestry, 79 in R-Pasture and 63 in Pasture. Composition analyses (canonical correspondence analysis and NMDS) showed that the ant community in restoration corridors and pastures is far from resembling that of the forests. Yet, there is biological progress with respect to the Pasture. Gnamptogenys bisulca and Pheidole pygmaea were indicator species for advanced restoration progress because of their close association to forests, while Linepithema piliferum indicated a reversal of restoration progress due to its preference for open habitats. Since both ant richness and composition in restored areas do not yet resemble the reference forest ecosystem, we suggest that other interventions such as restoring wider corridors and changing to wild-friendly agriculture around the reserves might improve restoration efforts in Andean landscapes.

AB  - Some widely used pesticide mixtures produce more than additive effects according to conventional combined effect models. However, synergistic effects have been so far generally observed at unrealistically high pesticide concentrations. Here, we used Daphnia magna as a test organism and investigated how food limitation-a common ecological stressor-affects the mixture toxicity of a pyrethroid insecticide and azole fungicide. We also compared three models regarding the prediction of mixture effects, including concentration addition (CA), effect addition (EA), and stress addition model (SAM). We revealed that especially under low food, the strength of synergism between esfenvalerate and prochloraz increased with an increasing concentration of prochloraz independent of the null model. Under high food conditions and at concentrations of prochloraz >= 32 mu g/L, we observed a marginal synergistic effect with a model deviation ratio (MDR) = 2.1 at 32 mu g/L prochloraz and 2.2 at 100 mu g/L prochloraz when using CA as the null model. In contrast, the combination of both pesticides and food stress caused synergistic effects shown by an MDR = 10.9 even at 1 mu g/L of prochloraz that is frequently detected in the environment. The combined effects of pesticides and food stress could be predicted best with the SAM that showed the lowest mean deviation between effect observation and prediction (mean deviation SAM = 16 [SD = 28], EA = 1072 [2105], CA = 1345 [2644]). We conclude that common environmental stressors can strongly increase the synergistic effects of toxicants. This knowledge is especially relevant considering current efforts to include the additional risk of pesticide mixtures and environmental stressors into the environmental risk assessment of pesticides.

AB  - Assessment of ecosystem responses to coupled human and environmental impacts is increasingly acknowledged as an important research of environmental informatics. However, current ecological and environmental models are not effective for capturing the coupled influences due to prevalent approaches of separating human interferences from environmental changes, common uses of time-averaged or cumulative data, and the lack of efficient methods integrating environmental observations with socioeconomic statistics that are tabulated over different spatial units. In this paper, we presented an integrated modeling framework to tackle these limitations. We developed data-assimilation techniques to integrate ecological and climate data with socioeconomic statistics into a coherent dataset on the basis of conforming spatial units. These data were used in panel regressions to estimate responses of grassland productivity to coupled climate factors (seven) and socioeconomic indicators (ten) across 37 counties for nine 16-day growing periods each year from 2000 to 2010. We also advanced the analysis of climate impacts by allowing for quadratic rather than linear impacts and by incorporating lagged time effects for the dependent variable. The case study was conducted in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. Our findings provided strong evidence that the grassland productivity responded significantly to variations in both climate factors and socioeconomic variables; displayed significant seasonal, annual, and regional variation; and revealed cumulative influences from prior climate conditions and extreme climate fluctuations. The assimilation of climatic, ecological and socioeconomic data into a big-data set and the application of multi-spatial-and-temporal panel regression model were much more comprehensive than prior studies.

AB  - Recovery of organisms is an important attribute for evaluating the acceptability of chemicals' effects in ecological risk assessment in Europe. Recovery in the field does not depend on the chemical's properties and type of exposure only, but it is strongly linked to important environmental variables and biological interactions as well. Yet, these remain only marginally considered in the European risk assessment of chemicals. Here, we use individual-based modelling to investigate how the environmental scenario affects Daphnia magna population recovery from chemical exposure. Simulation experiments were performed for chemicals with lethality levels ranging from 40% to 90% at different food and temperature conditions. The same toxicity levels were then tested in combination with biological interactions including predation or competition. Results show that for the same chemical effect strength, populations often exhibited different recovery times in a different environmental context. The interactions between the chemical and the environmental variables were the strongest determinants of population recovery. Most important, biotic interactions even induced opposite effects on recovery at low and at high mortality levels. Results of this study infer that no specific role can be attributed to any abiotic or biotic variable in isolation. We conclude that unless the complex interactive mechanisms between the different factors constituting the full environmental scenario are taken into account in risk assessment, we cannot achieve a complete understanding of recovery processes from chemical effects.

AB  - The region of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz hosts one of the largest and most important industrial areas of Mexico and Latin America. Industrial development and rapid population growth, have triggered a severe impact on aquatic ecosystems of the region. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of POPs in sediment and in muscle tissue of five fish species from different trophic levels in downstream residents of the Coatzacoalcos River, and their integration with DNA damage in the fish, evaluated with the comet assay in whole blood as a biological indicator of stress, in order to obtain a baseline of the ecological condition of the region. The compounds detected in sediment and in muscle tissue were hexachlorobenzene (HCB), alpha-, beta-, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), dichlorodiphenyltri-chloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), mirex and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Sediment concentrations of these pollutants (except for mirex) exceeded the values of protection provided by international guidelines, suggesting a potential risk to aquatic life in the region. DNA damage recorded in the fish species is evidence of exposure to a mix of genotoxic pollutants, which combined with exposure to POPs, reflects the degree of environmental stress of aquatic organisms in the region. The results of this study show the importance of determining the presence of contaminants in the environment, the bioaccumulation in tissues and their effects on exposed organisms, providing an integrated approach in assessing the health of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The microbial biomass of soil is being increasingly recognized as a sensitive indicator of soil quality. Its knowledge is fundamental for sustainable environmental management. This study aimed to determine the impact of different land uses (forest, pasture, and agricultural lands) on soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen using the chloroform fumigation extraction (CFE) method. This study also aimed to determine interrelationships between microbial biomass C (C-mic) and N (N-mic) and the physicochemical characteristics of the soil. For this purpose, a total of 45 soil samples were taken from 3 different land uses located in the Agdaci Village in Bartin. Additional core samples were collected from each sample site to determine other physico-chemical characteristics of the soils. The average microbial biomass C were found as 1028.29 mu g g(-1), 898.47 mu g g(-1), and 485.10 mu g g(-1) respectively, for forest, pasture, and agricultural soils. As with microbial biomass C, the average microbial biomass N was found as 129.99 mu g g(-1), 100.90 mu g g(-1), and 42.60 mu g g(-1), respectively, for forest, pasture, and agricultural soils. One-Way ANOVA showed a significant difference in microbial biomass C and N among the study areas. Microbial biomass C and N were shown to be significantly correlated to the physico-chemical properties of the soil, such as organic C, total N, clay, and pH. Present study clearly shows that land use has a significant effect on microbial biomass C and N in soil by altering natural soil characteristics under the same ecological conditions.

AB  - Despite the importance of considering arthropods in monitoring programs and conservation planning given their diversity in terrestrial ecosystems and potential in revealing environmental disturbances, most studies on the effects of habitat disturbances in tropical forests focused on vertebrates, plants and a few arthropod groups. By sampling 16 sites evenly distributed in four habitat categories (continuous mature and secondary forest and large and small secondary forest fragments), we investigated how harvestmen (Opiliones), which represent the third largest order of arachnids and have been poorly studied in tropical forests, are affected by habitat quality and quantity. Richness and abundance of rare species were strongly affected by habitat quality.(first axis of principal component analysis on forest structure), increasing in less disturbed/mature forests. Richness, total abundance, abundance of rare species and of one of the three common species were higher in continuous forest, while only total abundance differed between large and small fragments. Detrended correspondence analysis revealed that just one species increased in abundance in fragments, while several others were associated with continuous and/or mature forest and that harvestman composition did not vary between large and small fragments. Our results suggest that harvestmen (1) are strongly affected by habitat quality and quantity, probably because, compared to other arthropod groups, they are relatively uniform in some relevant biological aspects (nocturnal predators dependent on microclimatic conditions that present low vagility); (2) are probably more indicative of intermediate-level disturbances, given the absence of species associated with highly-disturbed areas.

AB  - Cumulative environmental impact assessment (CEIA) at river basin level for hydroelectric projects is an evolving concept and has proved to be a useful tool to assess the cumulative impact of developmental projects on the natural ecosystems. However, the generality of CEIA studies is often contested because of methodological limitations, especially in the domain of biodiversity conservation and conservation planning. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) can be a useful tool in CEIA studies for conservation planning of threatened plants in hydroelectric project (HEP) areas. We elucidate this hypothesis taking the example of Lagerstroemia minuticarpa Debberm. ex P.C. Kanjilal, a critically endangered tree species in the Indian Eastern Himalaya. Standard ecological methods were employed to document occurrence records, estimate population size, and characterize habitats. ENM was used to estimate the species potential environmental niche and distribution areas. The possible impacts of HEPs on the potential habitats were predicted by overlaying the HEPs on the potential area map as well as using the conceptual network diagram. The study revealed that the species occupies an environmental niche characterized by humid to per-humid conditions, and is distributed mostly in the Lohit and Teesta basins. Potential areas of the species with high environmental suitability coincide with 19 HEPs, which point to a potential threat to the survival of the species. Network diagram indicated that project activities might deteriorate the habitats thereby affecting the population and regeneration of the species. Our study provides a framework for developing appropriate measures for species conservation and reintroduction at basin level using ENM.

AB  - The results of a study of the biological and ecological features of the invasive species Elaeagnus angustifolia L. in the territory of Southern Ural are provided. This species is actively naturalized mainly in river floodplains and around other reservoirs. It is included in the Black Book of Flora of Central Russia and Siberia, and black lists of the Middle Volga region and Voronezh, Orenburg, and other oblasts. The total number in the investigated coenopulations was estimated as 18 000-20 000 specimens. It is naturalized in various types of phytocoenoses, from steppe meadows to halophytic communities. Most of the investigated coenopulations are located in an arid climate with little precipitation. The northernmost coenopopulations are in more favorable natural and climatic conditions. DCA ordination of communities reveal the leading environmental factors: continental climate, moisture, soil acidity, rich soils with nitrogen, and moisture variability. E. angustifolia specimens vary in height from 2 to 8 m. Tall plants are noted mainly on unsalted habitats with sufficient moisture. Lower plants are found in saline or dry habitats. A study of reproductive biology revealed that the highest indicators of fruit parameters are observed in Aslykul, Izobilnoye, and Sol-Iletsk coenopulations, and the minimum indicators of fruit parameters are noted in the Tatarskaya Kargala coenopulation. Regression analysis of the dependence of the nucleus fraction on the fruit weight showed that, with an increase in fruit weight, a decrease in the nucleus fraction is observed. The naturalization of E. angustifolia in river floodplains negatively affect the growth, development, and resumption of native forest-forming species, which leads to irreversible consequences of the degeneration of floodplain forests.

AB  - As road traffic conditions worsen due to the constantly increasing number of cars, traffic management systems are struggling to provide a suitable environment, by gathering all the relevant information from the road network. However, in most cases these are obtained via traffic detectors placed near road junctions, thus providing no information on the conditions in between. A large-scale sensor network using detectors on the majority of vehicles would certainly be capable of providing useful data, but has two major impediments: the equipment installed on the vehicles should be cheap enough (assuming the willingness of private car owners to be a part of the network) and be capable of transferring the required amount of data in due time, as the vehicle passes by the road side unit that acts as interface with the traffic management system. These restrictions reduce the number of technologies that can be used. In this article a series of comprehensive tests have been performed to evaluate the Bluetooth and ZigBee protocols for this purpose from many points of view: handshake time, static and dynamic data transfer (in laboratory conditions and in real traffic conditions). An assessment of the environmental conditions (during tests and probable to be encountered in real conditions) was also provided.

AB  - Sarcophagidae (Diptera) are of great interest from a veterinary, medical, and forensic viewpoint, and are potential bioindicators for environmental impact assessments. In this study, we evaluated changes in abundance, species richness, and diversity of flesh flies in different habitat types in the Humid Chaco ecoregion of South America: 1) anthropized habitats: urban, cattle farm, and alfalfa crop, and 2) natural habitats: savanna and forest. We hypothesized that sarcophagid fly community parameters are affected by the anthropization and that spatial turnover will contribute more to the overall beta diversity than nestedness between habitats. In each habitat, samplings were conducted monthly from March 2015 to February 2016 in 25 sites, 5 per habitat, totaling 300 independent samples at the end of the study. We collected 5,790 Sarcophagidae (55 species). Community parameters of Sarcophagidae were evaluated and compared.The ecological effects of anthropization and habitat type were observed in the present study. As expected, our results showed the highest abundance, species richness, and diversity in the savanna and forest habitats (natural), whereas the lowest values were registered in the urban and alfalfa crop habitats, supporting the hypotheses of anthropization as the main driver of diversity loss. In addition, sarcophagid assemblages differed between all habitats and the overall dissimilarity was structured by spatial turnover.The main conclusion of this research is that flesh fly community structure is greatly affected by anthropization and habitat type, and this would be related to canopy cover and microclimate conditions of each environment.

AB  - Polder watercourses within agricultural areas are affected by high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD5) concentrations, due to intensive farming activities and runoff. Practical cases have shown that constructed wetlands (CWs) are eco-friendly and cost-effective treatment systems which can reduce high levels of organic and nutrient pollution from agricultural discharges. However, accumulated recalcitrant organic matter, originated by in-situ sources or elements of CWs (i.e., plants or microbial detritus), limits the fulfilment of current COD discharge threshold. Thus, to evaluate its relevance regarding rivers ecosystem health preservation, we analysed the response of bio-indicators, the Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders (MMIF) and the occurrence of organic pollution sensitive taxa towards organic pollutants. For this purpose, statistical models were developed based on collected data in polder watercourses and CWs located in Flanders (Belgium). Results showed that, given the correlation between COD and BOD5, both parameters can be used to indicate the ecological and water quality conditions. However, the variability of the MMIF and the occurrence of sensitive species are explained better by BOD5, which captures a major part of their common effect. Whereas, recalcitrant COD and the interaction among other physico-chemical variables indicate a minor variability on the bio-indicators. Based on these outcomes we suggest a critical re-evaluation of current COD thresholds and moreover, consider other emerging technologies determining organic pollution levels, since this could support the feasibility of the implementation of CWs to tackle agricultural pollution.

AB  - The use of biological indicators to monitor the health and functioning of wetlands has been an ongoing goal of wetland scientists and managers, and has focused primarily on monitoring the changes in macroorganisms, due to the relative ease of identifying and counting them. In recent years, the establishment of high-throughput sequencing techniques, development of assays for specific functional genes, and better quantitative measures are making it easier to get extensive diversity profiles and more robust abundance estimates of various microbial communities, and empowers us to explore wetland micro-biomes and their role in ecosystem function. This heuristic search enables us to illuminate a spot light on minor populations of microbial communities, which were difficult to be scrutinized by more traditional molecular tools. Monitoring microbial indicators in response to nutrient loading, pollutants and redox potential is beneficial for wetland ecosystem management. Microbial populations can serve as the most sensitive and rapid bioindicator in response to various environmental changes. Evaluation of wetland condition and restoration cannot be met effectively by a single physical, chemical or biological parameter but a combination of multiple attributes is effective for robust wetland assessment and management. Various functional groups of microorganisms can be used as wetland assessment tools and provide a more profound understanding of microbial population dynamics and various direct microbial activity measurements. Understanding of the microbial communities controlling biogeochemical cycles in constructed wetlands could support optimizing performance of these promising treatment systems. This review focuses on a potential use of microorganisms as effective biological indicators for wetland management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal eutrophication models have proposed that various environmental conditions can serve as filters mediating the effects of nutrient loading on coastal ecosystems. Variation in such filters due to natural or anthropogenic causes can potentially lead to varied responses in overall eutrophication expression as well as in individual eutrophication indicators. In this study, we sought to identify factors that affect eutrophication expression at contrasting sites within one nutrient-loaded estuary in central California. We developed and applied a eutrophication expression index to 18 sites in the Elkhorn Slough estuary and then used principal components analysis of environmental drivers (nutrients) and filters to determine how they relate to overall eutrophication expression as well as to individual eutrophication indicators. We also examined the relationship between one key filter, tidal range, and eutrophication indicators. Elkhorn Slough was determined to be a moderately eutrophic estuary, with individual sites varying from being low to hypereutrophic. Eutrophication expression was explained mostly by tidal range, depth, temperature, salinity, distance to estuary mouth, and turbidity, but not by nutrient concentrations. Tidal range in particular correlated strongly with most eutrophication indicators. Sites with artificially dampened tidal range through water control structures were more eutrophic than sites with full tidal exchange. Results from this study emphasize the importance of filters in mediating the negative ecological effects of eutrophication. Coastal managers can decrease eutrophication expression at a local scale by managing for filters (e. g. increasing tidal exchange to managed wetlands), complementing efforts to reduce eutrophication at a regional scale by decreasing nutrient loading.

AB  - Community measures collected at a single instance or over a short temporal period rarely provide a complete accounting of biological diversity. The gap between such snapshot measures of diversity and actual diversity can be especially large in systems that undergo great temporal variation in environmental conditions. To adequately quantify diversity in these temporally varying ecosystems, individual measures of diversity collected throughout the range of environmental variation, i.e., temporal alpha-diversity measures, must be combined to obtain temporal gamma-diversity. Such a time-integrated gamma-diversity measure will be a much closer approximation of a site's true alpha-diversity and provide a measure better comparable to spatial alpha-diversity measures of sites with lower temporal variation for which a single or a few snapshot measures may suffice. We used aquatic-macroinvertebrate community-composition data collected over a 24-year period from a complex of 16 prairie-pothole wetlands to explore the rate that taxa accumulate over time at sites with differing degrees of temporal variation. Our results show that the rate of taxa accumulation over time, i.e., the slope of the species-time relationship, is steeper for wetlands with ponds that frequently dry compared to those with more-permanent ponds. Additionally, we found that a logarithmic function better fit species accumulation data for seasonally ponded wetlands whereas a power function better fit accumulations for permanently and semi-permanently ponded wetlands. Thus, interpretations of ecological diversity measures, and conservation decisions that rely on these interpretations, can be biased if temporal variations in community composition are not adequately represented.

AB  - A number of ecologically and economically important species in the southern Benguela, including the forage fish sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, have undergone southward/eastward shifts in their distribution in the 1990s/early 2000s. In addition to the effects of changes in prey availability to top predators, the spatially-distinct nature of the system means the location of a stock has implications for its productivity. The spatial dynamics of small pelagic fish are of particular importance because they are thought to exert wasp-waisted trophic control on the system. An objective-driven frame-based model was constructed to investigate the ability of the approach to represent spatial and population dynamics of sardine and anchovy, and to explore the implications of possible management strategies. Climate variability and fishing pressure were assumed as drivers. Sensitivity analyses were performed and a number of scenarios tested. A frame-based approach appears to be useful within this context. Results suggest that the productivity of the sardine resource within the model is highly dependent on the spatial characteristics of fishing pressure. The role of anchovy within the model system has not yet been fully developed. Increasing our understanding of the relative suitability of environmental conditions of different regions is also important if we are to increase our capacity to predict trends in abundance and distribution. This study shows support for continued careful consideration of spatialized management approaches to the South African sardine fishery. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current classifications used in bioassessment programs, as defined by the Water Framework Directive (WFD), do not sufficiently capture the variability present in temporary Mediterranean streams. This may result in inaccurate evaluation of the water quality biological metrics and difficulties in setting reference conditions. The aim of the study was to examine if aquatic invertebrate data of increased taxonomical resolution but expressed on a binary abundance (frequent/rare) scale and referring to good bioindicator species only suffice to indicate clear gradients in water courses with high natural variability such as intermittent Mediterranean streams. Invertebrate samples were collected from 74 sites in the Quarteira River basin, located in southern Portugal. Their classification with the use of a Kohonen artificial neural network (i.e., self-organising map, SOM) resulted in five categories. The variables that drove this categorization were primarily altitude, temperature and conductivity, but also type of substrate, riparian cover and percentage of riffles present. According to the indicator species analysis (ISA), almost all the studied taxa were significantly associated with certain SOM categories except for the category that included sites with disrupted flow regime. The SOM and ISA allowed us to effectively recognize biotic and abiotic patterns. Combined application of both methods may thus greatly enhance the effectiveness and precision of biological surveillance and establish reference sites for specific channel units in streams with high natural variability such as intermittent Mediterranean streams.

AB  - The implementation of the European Water Framework Directive has provoked enthusiastic debate between scientists and stakeholders, as they try to define the ecological quality status (EcoQS) of all water bodies, including estuaries (i.e., transitional waters). The issue is complex because estuarine environments are variable, due to fresh and marine water input and anthropogenic impacts. Benthic species and communities have adapted to tolerate temporal physico-chemical changes (e.g., salinity, substrata, depth, fine particles and a Maximum Turbidity Zone that is rich in organic matter). However, anthropogenization affects not only the water quality, but also estuarine surface size and navigation channel management. Though numerous bio-indicators and indices are used to define estuarine system EcoQS, very few of them were developed specifically for such variable anthropogenized systems comprising a variety of conditions. The critical question is: 'Is it possible to define an EcoQS for such specific modified and naturally stressed ecosystems?' Indicators must be chosen pragmatically so that they will be environmentally sustainable, economically viable, technologically feasible, socially desirable/tolerable, legally permissible and politically expedient. This contribution proposes an adaptation of the BOPA index, the Benthic Opportunistic Annelida Amphipod index (BO2 A), for use in the freshwater zones of transitional waters (i.e., up to the upper limit of tidal range). Several possibilities are discussed in light of the diverse disturbances and the heterogeneity of such stressed zones. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Middle Bathonian iron-bearing dark grey mudstones and claystones from the Krakow-Czestochowa Upland (southern Poland) were subjected to geochemical and mineralogical Study in order to evaluate palaeo-redox conditions of their deposition and diagenesis. They are mainly composed of kaolinite, with smaller amounts of other clay minerals and detrital quartz. Organic matter is composed of type III and/or IV kerogen and its delta C-13 is between -23 and -24 parts per thousand, suggesting a mainly terrigenous Source, with a possible admixture of marine input. Most geochemical parameters: (total organic carbon) TOC/S, U/Th, Ni/Co, V/Cr, (Cu+Mo)/Zn ratios, authigenic uranium content, and Fe-TOC-S relationship, indicate deposition Under oxygenated bottom water conditions. By contrast, DOP (degree of pyritization) and V/V+Ni indices Suggest a dysoxic environment. However, DOP probably reflects redox conditions in the sediment during diagenesis rather than in the overlaying water column. The composition of the organic matter and the domination of pyrite euhedra over framboids indicates that the V/V+Ni ratio may not be reliable for determination of redox conditions in the rocks Studied. There is no significant difference between the geochemical indices of host rocks with nodules and those without them.

AB  - Assessing ecosystem integrity by monitoring populations and communities is an important management tool, but is often limited by the immense variety of species and the rarity of many of them. Grouping species by their responses to variation in the environment is one approach to choosing species to serve as effective indicators of community change. Moreover, identifying species that are characterized by similar archetypical responses to the environment increases the power to predict their occurrence and simplifies management of diverse species assemblages by focusing on a much smaller number of archetypes. To this end, we used the species archetype model (SAM) to fit generalized linear models of environmental covariates to species distribution data in order to identify environmentally correlated groups of kelp forest species in the Santa Barbara Channel region. Eighty-two species of macroalgae, invertebrates, and fish monitored in kelp forests across the channel were grouped into one of 10 archetypes based on their similar responses to environmental parameters, with water temperature emerging as one of the strongest drivers of archetype differences. Predictive maps of the distribution of species archetypes identified sites where multiple archetypes are common, indicating high diversity, as well as sites where rare species are more likely to occur. Potential indicator species were identified for each archetype. New monitoring efforts across the growing Marine Biodiversity Observation Network could use modeling approaches like SAM to guide their designs, optimizing the cost-to-benefit ratio of monitoring whole communities.

AB  - Several international organisations have recommended the use of bioindicators to improve the evaluation of ecological risk in marine ecosystems. In this context, wild mussels, a recognised bioindicator, were collected from thirty sampling points along the Asturias coastline and studied in order to identify any relationship between metal(oid) concentrations in wild mussel tissues and the geological and environmental conditions of the coastal area via biochemical analyses. Two main concentration trends were observed: Concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn slightly decrease from the western to the eastern areas of the region, while the opposite occurred for Fe, Hg and Se whose concentrations increased from the westernmost part of Asturias to the east. Correlations between the elements showed how essential metals for organisms such as Fe, Ni and Cr have good correspon-dences among them but not with other metal(oid)s. On the other hand, Cd, Hg, Se and Zn were found to be correlated with each other, suggesting the presence of the mussels' natural bio-defence against Cd and Hg. In addition, samples were also grouped by a cluster analysis based on their element concentrations, showing two independent groups. Group 1 was associated with the sampling sites whose concentrations were related to an-thropic sources, while mussel concentrations in Group 2 were attributed to natural sources. This last group was divided into two subgroups based on the lithology of the dominant geological materials of each area. Both geological and anthropic sources have caused an increase in the metal loads of mussels which at times surpassed international environmental criteria.

AB  - Developing population models is of great interest as these models enable to extrapolate toxicity observed at the molecular or individual levels to the population level, and thus improve environmental risk assessment of chemical substances. For this purpose, accounting for natural variations of environmental conditions and prey dynamics along with the chemical stress is needed. In this study, an individual-based model (IBM) coupled to a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model was developed in order to predict three-spined stickleback population dynamics in semi-controlled stream experiments (in mesocosms). Datasets obtained in mesocosms offer the opportunity to develop and evaluate the model predictions. The most sensitive parameters of the DEB-IBM were identified by sensitivity analyses and were calibrated based on data from two independent mesocosm experiments. The predictive capacities of our model were subsequently evaluated using three independent mesocosm datasets under different environmental scenarios. Finally, our model was applied to a theoretical case of toxic effects to show an example of application of the model in a regulatory context. While the most uncertain population processes (in particular, competition for food in mesocosms) in our three-spined stickleback DEB-IBM could be modelled more accurately, our model can already serve to assess the impacts of toxicants at the population level by improving the analyses of mesocosm experiments, in decreasing the uncertainty of the experimental results. Therefore, in a second step, it could be used to predict the consequences on viability of a population exposed to a contaminant under various environmental and exposure scenarios.

AB  - Conservation decisions often rely on defining a reference status for habitat and species to enable targets to be set and progress measured. Long-lasting and continual anthropogenic impacts on habitats and species make the setting of undisturbed reference values such as diversity, distribution, population size or other ecological characteristics, difficult. In turn this hampers assessment of ecological status.
   Within the Wadden Sea, intertidal blue mussel beds are important biogenic structures which can be clearly defined from the surrounding flats. As mussel beds are highly productive habitats, they are considered as biological quality indicators for coastal waters. Nonetheless the reference status provokes controversy in discussions between policymakers, stakeholders and researchers. In order to build on existing knowledge of intertidal blue mussel beds in the North Frisian Wadden Sea, we analysed aerial photographs from the 1930s, 1958, 1989, 1998 and 2010. We supplemented this remote sensing data with annual monitoring data from 1999 to 2009 obtained from analysis of aerial photographs and field surveys.
   Results show a generally high persistency of blue mussel beds likely over eight decades, although sites were probably not permanent throughout the time period and their areal extent had changed. Mussel beds occur mainly on the east side of the islands which provide shelter against storms from the west.

AB  - Bioassessments are used to measure system health and assess disturbance. While fish-based freshwater bioassessments are cost-effective and perform well in speciose systems, such bioassessments remain difficult to implement in species-poor Mediterranean regions. Population size structure metrics may provide meaningful biological information where depauperate communities preclude the richness and composition measures generally used. We focus our assessments of population size structure responses to anthropogenic perturbation on one of the most widespread native stream fish (Squalius laietanus). We explore a number of population size statistics as metrics for a Mediterranean region, where current bioassessments perform poorly. Our sampling encompassed 311 sites across Catalonia (NE Spain) where we characterized anthropogenic perturbation using a summary of impacts, including local data on stream condition and landscape indicators of degradation, via a principal component analysis. Anthropogenic perturbation in streams was collinear with altitudinal gradients and highlights the importance of appropriate statistical techniques. Of the population size structure metrics explored, average length was the most sensitive to anthropogenic perturbation and generally increased along the disturbance gradient. Although we expected to find consistent changes in variance, kurtosis, and skewness, the observed relationships were weak. River basin mediated responses suggest the importance of environmental landscape factors. The unexpected increases of mean S. laietanus body size with anthropogenic perturbation, strong effects of river basin, collinearity with spatial gradients and the species-specific nature of responses preclude the direct application of size structure in freshwater bioassessments. Although its application in fish-based freshwater bioassessments appears difficult, population size structure can provide insights in species-specific applications and management.

AB  - NORTI (NORThem Spain Indicators system) is a predictive model for assessing the ecological status of rivers of Northern Spain based on invertebrates. The system can be used to assign any test site to a type of river under minimal disturbed conditions. Macroinvertebrates were sampled with a multihabitat approach from 676 sites covering the variation in environmental conditions across Northern Spain, between 2000 and 2008 (n = 1421 samples), including a spatial network of 108 reference sites selected by the absence of significant pressures. A multinomial logistic regression was conducted using the GAAC cluster-derived groups of reference sites as response variable. Obligatory typology factors, following WFD System A, were included as forced entry terms in the model, other potential predictors were selected using a forward stepwise procedure. Ecological quality ratios (EQRs) were estimated from the observed similarity between the faunal composition of the sample of interest (test sample) and the expected median similarity for the reference community of each river type. The model predictions as EQRs responded significantly to the most important pressures: sewages inputs, eutrophication, hydromorphological alterations, and intensive and low intensity agriculture, demonstrating its accuracy in detecting impact in Northern Spanish streams and rivers.

KW  - POLICY
KW  - WEEDS
AB  - The importation and release of biological control agents against invasive alien plants in South Africa are subject to regulation by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), under its Agricultural Pests Act, and by the Department of Environmental Affairs, (DEA), initially under its Environment Conservation Act, subsequently under the National Environmental Management Act and eventually, as soon as the relevant regulations have been developed, under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act. Peer review, both within South Africa, and with colleagues in other countries, has helped to ensure the integrity of the science and practice of weed biological control in South Africa. This paper traces the development of the regulatory system from the first weed biological control project in 1913, through a dispensation when importations and releases were authoriied by DAFF only to a dual regulatory system involving two government departments. Inappropriate legislation, lack of knowledge about biological control amongst the relevant authorities and the costs of employing compulsory private consultants are some of the reasons for significant delays that have become a feature in the authorization of biological control agent releases. These delays have set back several control programmes. Holding agents in quarantine while awaiting decisions ties up expensive space and staff time and increases the risk of losing colonies through accidents or decreased genetic vigour. It seems likely that changes in legislation within DEA will streamline the regulatory process in the near future.

AB  - Dieldrin is a persistent organochlorine pesticide that induces neurotoxicity in the vertebrate central nervous system and impairs reproductive processes in fish. This study examined the molecular events produced by subchronic dietary exposures to 2.95 mg dieldrin/kg feed in the neuroendocrine brain of largemouth bass, an apex predator. Microarrays, proteomics, and pathway analysis were performed to identify genes, proteins, and cell processes altered in the male hypothalamus. Fifty-four genes were induced, and 220 genes were reduced in steady-state levels (p < 0.001; fold change greater than +/- 1.5). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the biological gene ontology categories of stress response, nucleotide base excision repair, response to toxin, and metabolic processes were significantly impacted by dieldrin. Using isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation, 90 proteins in the male hypothalamus were statistically evaluated for changes in protein abundance. Several proteins altered by dieldrin are known to be associated with human neurodegenerative diseases, including apolipoprotein E, microtubule-associated tau protein, enolase 1, stathmin 1a, myelin basic protein, and parvalbumin. Proteins altered by dieldrin were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, differentiation, proliferation, and cell survival. This study demonstrates that a subchronic exposure to dieldrin alters the abundance of messenger RNAs and proteins in the hypothalamus that are associated with cell metabolism, cell stability and integrity, stress, and DNA repair.

AB  - The frustrations of forage producers attempting to conserve high-quality alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) silage during periods of unstable or inclement weather are widely known. Our objectives for this series of studies were to (1) assess indicators of ensilability, such as pH, buffering capacity, water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), and starch for wilting alfalfa forages receiving no rainfall or damaged by simulated or natural rainfall events; (2) use these data as inputs to calculate the threshold moisture concentration that would prohibit a clostridially dominated fermentation; and (3) further evaluate the effects of rain damage or no rain damage on measures of forage nutritive value. Rainfall events were applied to wilting forages by both simulated and natural methods over multiple studies distributed across 4 independent forage harvests. Generally, simulated rainfall was applied to alfalfa under controlled conditions in which forages were relatively wet at the time of application, and subsequently were dried to final moisture endpoints under near ideal conditions within a constant temperature/humidity environmental chamber, thereby limiting postwetting wilting time to <= 21 h. As a result, indicators of ensilability, as well as measures of nutritive value, changed only marginally as a result of treatment. Consistently, reductions in concentrations of WSC and starch occurred, but changes in WSC were relatively modest, and postwetting concentrations of WSC may have been buoyed by hydrolysis of starch. When forages were subjected to natural rainfall events followed by prolonged exposure under field conditions, indicators of ensilability were much less desirable. In one study in which alfalfa received 49.3 mm of natural rainfall over a prolonged (8-d) field-exposure period, fresh pH increased from 6.48 to 7.43 within all forages exposed to these extended, moist wilting conditions. Furthermore, sharp reductions were observed in buffering capacity (410 vs. 337 mEq/kg of DM), WSC (6.13 vs. 2.90%), starch (2.28 vs. 0.45%), and clostridially dominated fermentation (62.7 vs. 59.4%). Based on these experiments, the potential for good fermentation is affected only minimally by single rainfall events applied to relatively wet forages, provided these events are followed by rapid dehydration; however, attaining acceptable silage fermentations with forages subjected to prolonged exposure under poor drying conditions is likely to be far more problematic.

AB  - Phylogenetic ecology uses evolutionary history to improve understanding of plant interactions. Phylogenetic distance can mediate plant interactions such as competition (e.g., via limiting similarity) and facilitation (e.g., via niche complementarity), influencing community assembly patterns. Previous research has found evidence both for and against a relationship between phylogenetic distance and the strength of plant interactions, and has found that other factors, such as trait differences, may be more influential. In addition to phylogenetic distance and species' traits, environmental conditions can also influence competition, with facilitative interactions-particularly among distantly related species-potentially becoming more pronounced under stressful, resource-limited conditions. We tested the prediction that greater phylogenetic distance is associated with decreased competition in a greenhouse experiment using plant species of the North American tallgrass prairie. We calculated the Relative Interaction Index for 81 species pairs using plant height, leaf length, and biomass as indicators of performance. We found that phylogenetic distance alone did not significantly affect competition. However, the interaction between phylogenetic distance and stressful conditions (sandier soils with low nutrient availability and water retention vs. resource-rich potting soil) altered plant traits and competition. Under stressful conditions, more distantly related species competed more strongly, leading to smaller plants. Conversely, under benign conditions more distantly related species pairs competed less and were larger. These results were contrary to our expectations that distant relatives would compete less under stressful conditions. Our experiment provides evidence that, while relatedness alone may not drive competition, phylogenetic distance can nonetheless be influential through interactions with environmental conditions.

AB  - Changes in morphological traits, such as body size, body condition, and leg length, are important indicators of changes to life history or habitat quality, which can affect the performance of individuals and therefore the persistence of populations under environmental change. Only very few studies assessed the effect of fragmentation on morphological traits. The few available studies on anurans found that in landscapes with less forest cover body size decreased. Therefore, we predict that body size should also be smaller in fragments compared to continuous forest. Body condition is a further trait closely related to individual performance and thus should decline with more adverse conditions, as is expected in fragments. We tested these hypotheses using snout-vent length, body mass, body condition, and tibia length as response variables. We collected data of a habitat generalist (Rhinella ornata) and a habitat specialist (Ischnocnema guentheri), both leaf-litter amphibian species, from three sites in a fragmented landscape (two isolated and one connected site) and one site in a contiguous part of the Atlantic Forest of Southeast Brazil. In the generalist species, snout-vent-length (SVL) and body mass were significantly lower in fragments compared to the contiguous forest control, whereas tibia length and body condition did not differ among sites. In contrast, SVL, body mass, and tibia length of the specialist species did not differ among sites, but body condition was marginally different among sites, being relatively low in one but not the other isolated fragment. The results indicate that different processes affect the morphology of the two species following habitat fragmentation.

AB  - In Europe, coastal dune systems with Juniperus spp. (Natura 2000 habitat code 2250) are a priority habitat for conservation according to the Natura 2000 policies. Currently, anthropogenic pressure is threatening the biodiversity of this habitat. While the impact of human pressure on animals and vascular plants is already documented, information is still scanty for other organisms such as epiphytic lichens. The main aim of this study is to test the effect of human disturbance on the occurrence and abundance of the red-listed macrolichen Seirophora villosa. We also tested the effect of human disturbance on the whole community of epiphytic lichens in terms of species richness and composition. The study was performed along the coast of Tuscany by comparing both disturbed and undisturbed Juniperus stands according to a stratified random sampling design. Our results provided evidence that in coastal systems the long-term conservation of the red-listed macrolichen S. villosa and its characteristic community composed by several Mediterranean species of conservation concern depends on the maintenance of undisturbed Juniperus habitats. Results also support the possibility of using S. villosa as an indicator species of habitat conservation importance and habitat integrity since its occurrence is predicted on nestedness in term of species composition, assemblages of species poor disturbed stands being subsets of those of richer undisturbed stands.

AB  - (Morphological alterations in leave of micropropagated pineapple plants cv. IAC "Gomo-de-mel" acclimatizated in different conditions of luminosity). Microprapagated plants usually show difficulties to adapt to ex vitro conditions, and many times are submitted to the rustication process to aim the reduction of all the impacts resulting from the environmental changes. Once the leaf and its annexes are important indicators of adaptability strategies of the plants to adverse environmental conditions, the objective of this work was to compare the leaf anatomy of pineapple cv. IAC "Gomo-de-mel" in vitro cultivated plants with microplants acclimatized in different conditions of luminosity, under mesh, with 50% of shading and directly exposed to sunlight, to verify the needed of rustication process on this cultivar. Evaluations of the leaf epidermis using light and electronic scanning microscopy showed an increase on scale density in both leaves surfaces of the ex vitro microplants, mainly related to the ones directly exposed to sunlight. Subsequent observations showed an increase on cuticle thickness, on wavy contours of epidermal cells, and on the distribution and quantity of mesophyll fibers, evidencing the light conditions interference in morphological characteristics of these microplants. These alterations had not harmed microplant development, showing that are not need of rustication stages on the acclimatization process of this cultivar.

AB  - Bees are prolific pollinators and are responsible for the pollination of most wild and cultivated plants. This study aimed to learn about the flight activity of the stingless bee Plebeia aff. flavocincta in tropical conditions as a parameter to evaluate the general state of the colonies, and to investigate the role of food resources and environmental factors in their flight activities. We recorded the worker flight activity (exit-when they leave the hive; trash-when they discard litter; entry with pollen; and entry without pollen) of four colonies throughout the year and monitored biotic and abiotic conditions that could affect the bee's external activities such as blooming and meteorological conditions. Results show that colonies remained active throughout the year and presented two major periods of external activity; one corresponded to greater food supply in the foraging area, and the other correlated with the time of year when fewer food resources were available. In addition, the four flight activities were all strongly correlated with each other. We concluded that in tropical conditions external activities of P. aff. flavocincta are regulated mainly by food availability rather than the prevailing weather conditions. We have found flight activities are an important indicator of the general health of the colony.

AB  - Machine failures decrease up-time and can lead to extra repair costs or even to human casualties and environmental pollution. Recent condition monitoring techniques use artificial intelligence in an effort to avoid time-consuming manual analysis and handcrafted feature extraction. Many of these only analyze a single machine and require a large historical data set. In practice, this can be difficult and expensive to collect. However, some industrial condition monitoring applications involve a fleet of similar operating machines. In most of these applications, it is safe to assume healthy conditions for the majority of machines. Deviating machine behavior is then an indicator for a machine fault.
   This work proposes an unsupervised, generic, anomaly detection framework for fleet-based condition monitoring. It uses generic building blocks and offers three key advantages. First, a historical data set is not required due to online fleet-based comparisons. Second, it allows incorporating domain expertise by user-defined comparison measures. Finally, contrary to most black-box artificial intelligence techniques, easy interpretability allows a domain expert to validate the predictions made by the framework.
   Two use-cases on an electrical machine fleet demonstrate the applicability of the framework to detect a voltage unbalance by means of electrical and vibration signatures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Remote sensing tools have been long used to monitor landscape dynamics inside and around protected areas. Hereto, scientists have largely relied on land use and land cover (LULC) data to derive indicators for monitoring these dynamics, but these metrics do not capture changes in the state of vegetation surfaces that may compromise the ecological integrity of conservation areas' landscapes. Here, we introduce a methodology that combines LULC change estimates with three Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-based proxy indicators of vegetation productivity, phenology, and structural change. We illustrate the utility of this methodology through a regional and local analysis of the landscape dynamics in the Cerrado Biome in Brazil in 2001 and 2016. Despite relatively little natural vegetation loss inside core protected areas and their legal buffer zones, the different indicators revealed significant LULC conversions from natural vegetation to farming land, general productivity loss, homogenization of natural forests, significant agricultural expansion, and a general increase in productivity. These results suggest an overall degradation of habitats and intensification of land use in the studied conservation area network, highlighting serious conservation inefficiencies in this region and stressing the importance of integrated landscape change analyses to provide complementary indicators of ecologically-relevant dynamics in these key conservation areas.

AB  - Despite their complexity, ecotoxicological measurements using higher level responses remain a major tool in the assessment of ecosystem integrity. Nevertheless, the past decade saw an increasing number of cell based testing systems have found widespread application in ecotoxicology. One such test is bacterial bioreporters carrying a stress sensitive promoter fused to an easily detectable reporter gene. In the presence of a specific toxic stress, the expression cassette is switched on and the reporter gene is produced. This study evaluated the use of 14 different Escherichia coli bioreporter strains sensitive to different types of toxicity in the assessment of the ecological status of a small river basin in Flanders, Belgium. The river is fed at two geographically separate locations by two distinct and well-described effluents, one from a household sewage treatment facility and one from the discharge of the wastewater treatment facility of a large chemical plant. The results of the bacterial gene profiling assay were related to active biomonitoring results obtained through higher-level responses of caged Dreissena polymorpha, Chironomus riparius, and Cyprinus carpio deployed at the locations sampled for the bacterial assay. The results of the gene induction assay and the active biomonitoring data correlated well and corresponded to the flow dilution data, which is used here as a surrogate for the chemical pollution gradient present in the river basin.

AB  - A diverse array of environmental data from Ohio were placed into a geographical information system (GIS). This GIS allowed for the investigation of approaches and paradigms currently advocated for ecological risk assessment. The paradigm of chemical mixture additivity was investigated in this project. Toxic units (toxic unit = concentration of a chemical in an organism/chemical concentration causing a specified effect) for 12 organic and 11 metal contaminants were calculated from 2878 fish samples collected at 1010 sites throughout the state of Ohio. Additive analysis of TUs for organic chemicals based on regulatory-based protective limits (toxicity reference value = USEPA water quality criterion*bioconcentration factor) overpredicted adverse effects to individual fish and fish communities. However, addition of organic chemical molar units did not overpredict adverse effects, thus, supporting the concept of baseline toxicity. Molar units of organic chemicals with diverse modes of action may be added together, so long as they are at concentrations below levels deemed protective of most species (e.g., 95%, water quality criterion). Analysis of metal TUs benchmarked against regulatory/based limits overpredicted adverse effects, whereas benchmark concentrations from population response (survival, growth, reproduction) data from the literature and Ohio reference site fish community responses corresponded better to field observations. Of the factors analyzed, habitat quality is the best single predictor of fish community integrity in Ohio, not body burdens of metals or organic chemicals.

AB  - Recent studies of pan sediment stratigraphy in southern Africa have indicated the potential of geophysical and geochemical analysis for elucidating the evolution of pans and the environmental conditions under which formation took place. We hair investigated three sorts, of 1.8 to 2.6 m in length, from Lebatse Pan in southeast Kalahari, Botswana, and compare the results with the few other similar studies available. Through the sedimentological characteristics of Lebatse we identify cycles of deposition chemical precipitation and post-depositional alteration under shifting environmental conditions from c. 60,000 years ago to the present. Four periods are separated by depositional hiatuses, marking dry conditions during which deflation of the pan cannot he excluded. During the two oldest periods the sequence of finely laminated, magnesia-rich sediments suggests deposition in a permanent shallow waterbody under evaporative conditions, causing chemical precipitation of dolomite from groundwater. Less evaporative conditions are inferred for the third period of deposition between hiatuses H2 and H1. The youngest period. C-14-dated to 29,000 years BP, is characterised by water-logged conditions and the development of reed beds. It is believed to have been laid down under fluctuating water levels. The cycles of deposition exhibited in the pan cores appear synchronous with wetter periods in the Southern Kalahari, indicated by the limited evidence currently available.

AB  - Acidification of the ocean due to high atmospheric CO2 levels may increase the resilience of diatoms causing dramatic shifts in abiotic and biotic cycles with lasting implications on marine ecosystems. Here, we report a potential bioindicator of a shift in the resilience of a coastal and centric model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana under elevated CO2. Specifically, we have discovered, through EGFP-tagging, a plastid membrane localized putative Na+(K+)/H+ antiporter that is significantly upregulated at >800 ppm CO2, with a potentially important role in maintaining pH homeostasis. Notably, transcript abundance of this antiporter gene was relatively low and constant over the diel cycle under contemporary CO2 conditions. In future acidified oceanic conditions, dramatic oscillation with >10-fold change between nighttime (high) and daytime (low) transcript abundances of the antiporter was associated with increased resilience of T. pseudonana. By analyzing metatranscriptomic data from the Tara Oceans project, we demonstrate that phylogenetically diverse diatoms express homologs of this antiporter across the globe. We propose that the differential between night- and daytime transcript levels of the antiporter could serve as a bioindicator of a shift in the resilience of diatoms in response to high CO2 conditions in marine environments.

AB  - In Mediterranean temporary ponds, the timing of annual flooding is highly variable and depends on heavy seasonal rains. Ponds can flood in the autumn, winter, or spring, and thus the environmental conditions faced by emerging zooplankton can be very different. We performed an experiment in a climatic chamber where we simulated annual variation in natural temperature and light conditions to study how differences in pond-filling season affected zooplankton assemblage composition. We sampled sediments from a temporary pond and placed them in aquariums that were filled with water during three different seasons: autumn (October), winter (January), and spring (March). Zooplankton abundance, species richness, diversity, and assemblage composition differed significantly among treatments, and post-inundation temperature and pH appeared to be the main drivers of these differences. Diversity was highest in the winter treatment. It was lower in the autumn treatment and the spring treatment, and no indicator species were present in the latter. Our results suggest that interannual variability in initial inundation conditions favours the emergence of different species and thus contributes to high species richness in the egg bank. However, climate change and/or groundwater drawdown could delay pond flooding, impoverishing the zooplankton assemblage in the long term.

AB  - This paper provides values of economic, energy and environmental assessments of 20 crops and assesses the relationships of soil-climatic conditions in the example of the Czech Republic. The comparison of main soil quality indicators according to the configuration of land and climate regions is performed on the basis of energy and economic efficiency as well as a comparison of the level of environmental impacts. The environmental impacts are identified based on the assessment of emissions from production and also in the form of soil compaction as an indicator of the relationship to soil quality. As concerns soil properties, of major importance is soil skeleton, slope of land and the depth of soil, which cause an increase in emissions from the energy produced. Substantially better emission parameters per 1 MJ through energy crops, the cultivation of perennial crops and silage maize has been supported. Among energy crops, a positive relationship with the quality of soil is seen in alfalfa, with a significant reduction in soil penetrometric resistance; energy crops are also politically justifiable in competition with other crops intended for nutrition of population. The main advantage of energy crops for the low-carbon economy is their CO2 production to MJ, which is almost half, especially in marginal areas with lower soil depths, slopes and stoniness, which can be included in the new agricultural policy.

AB  - Species invasions often occur on coasts and estuaries where abiotic conditions vary, e.g. salinity, temperature, runoff etc. Successful establishment and dispersal of non-indigenous species in many such systems are poorly understood, partially since the species tend to show genetic and ecological plasticity at population level towards many abiotic conditions, including salinity tolerance. Plasticity may be driven by shifting expression of heat shock proteins such as Hsp70, which is widely recognized as indicator of physical stress. In this study, we developed a qPCR assay for expression of the hsp70 gene in the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and tested the expression response of fish collected from a brackish environment in the western Baltic Sea to three different salinities, 0, 10 and 30. hsp70 expression was highest in fresh water, indicating higher stress, and lower at brackish (ambient condition for the sampled population) and oceanic salinities, suggestive of low stress response to salinities above the population's current distribution. The highest stress in fresh water was surprising since populations in fresh water exist, e.g. large European rivers and Laurentian Great Lakes. The results have implications to predictions for the species' plasticity potential and possible range expansion of the species into other salinity regimes.

AB  - The complexity of ecological conditions in urban areas imposes the plant species need for the development of various biochemical and physiological adaptive strategies. The aim of our research was to examine the antioxidative and antifungal metabolism of species Pinus nigra, Picea omorika, Tilia cordata and Betula pendula from the area of Banja Luka City (urban area) during two vegetation seasons (spring and autumn) and compared with the same species from forest habitats. Changes in the protein concentration, activity and isoenzyme profiles of peroxidases (POD, EC 1.11.1.7), content and antioxidative activity of total phenols and antifungal activity in leaves and needles of the plants from the urban area and forest habitats were monitored. The obtained results indicate that urban areas induce changes in antioxidative metabolism in all examined species, but that the response is species specific. The most sensitive parameter that indicates different adaptation strategy of Pinus nigra, Picea omorika, Tilia cordata and Betula pendula to environment conditions in the urban area were peroxidase isoenzyme patterns. Less specific parameter was phenol content even though there are some indications for role of their antioxidative capacity in the adjustment to specific habitat. In addition, each species had different metabolic strategy to cope with the changes caused by the urban environment.

AB  - A climatic change was simulated transplanting samples of the lichens Evernia prunastri (L.) Ach. and Pseudevernia furfuracea (L.) Zopf v. furfuracea along a 1,400 m altitudinal gradient in the northern side of the island of Crete (Greece). The working hypothesis was that the photosynthetic performance (i.e. pigment content, chlorophyll degradation and photosynthetic efficiency) of transplanted lichens varies along the altitudinal gradient. The overall effect observed was a general depression of the photosynthetic performance along the gradient. Concentrations of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids decreased with decreasing elevation and along with the hottest and driest months of the year, with chlorophyll b being the most sensitive parameter to dry conditions. Chlorophyll degradation decreased with increasing elevation. The exposure period was the main factor affecting photosynthetic efficiency, with lower values during summer months. We argued that the water content of lichen thalli is the most important factor determining differences in photosynthesis under the experimental conditions. This allowed to suggest that the lichen photosynthetic performance deserves further investigation as early biological indicator of atmospheric stress induced by dry conditions and, to a greater extent, for the assessment of the desertification risk in the arid Mediterranean environment.

AB  - River embankments are the basic and the oldest measures of protecting areas potentially subjected to flooding, and at the same time pose a serious threat to their environment in the event of damage or failure. The technical condition of the levees and its regular evaluation is a key element of their safety. A general assessment of the technical condition of a levee is the result of many interacting factors and parameters that depend on each other to a varying degree. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the cause-and-effect links between the interrelationships of numerous parameters and sensors of significant impact. In this article the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method was applied to develop a cause-and-effect model for factors impacting the condition and safety of levees. Effective factors impacting the technical condition of a levee were identified; relationships between these factors were determined; a cause-and-effect model was developed based on identified factors; factors were categorized based on the dependence scale and influential indicators of each factors used in the DEMATEL method. The obtained results demonstrate that three following factors: hydrological factor, type and condition of soils in levee body and condition of levee areas (inter-levee and landside) play the most important role for levee safety. The results of this study can support traditional assessments of hydrotechnical structure or assist entities managing levees.

AB  - Accumulated evidence on health-adverse effects of stressful psychosocial and physical work environments is considered a major breakthrough in recent social epidemiological research. However, research on adverse health effects of repeated exposure over time is lacking. In this contribution we analyse associations of characteristics of adverse employment histories with stressful psychosocial and physical current working conditions. We use data from the French CONSTANCES study and restrict the sample to employed men and women aged 45-60 (n = 23652). Current working conditions are assessed by effort-reward imbalance as well as stressful physical working tasks and positions. Previous employment histories (between age 25 and 45) are retrospectively assessed and measured by indicators of precarious, discontinuous and disadvantaged working careers. We found consistent associations of precarious, discontinuous or disadvantaged careers with strenuous physical working conditions and with low occupational rewards. However, low effort rather than high effort was associated with adverse employment histories. Therefore, associations with the effort-reward ratio turned out to be inconsistent. By extending the scope of analysis beyond single time-point measures, we identified three types of adverse employment histories among employees between age 25 and 45 in a stress-theoretical framework, and we demonstrated their associations with employees' current adversity at work between the age of 45-60.

AB  - In this review we describe patterns and mechanisms by which habitat complexity is crucial for the functioning of shallow lakes and ponds, and for the abundance and diversity of biological communities in these ecosystems. Habitat complexity is affected by processes acting at different spatial scales, from the landscape to the ecosystem level (i.e., morphometric attributes) that generate different complexities, determining the potential for organisms to succeed and processes to occur, such as energy and nutrient transfer, and fluxes of greenhouse gases, among others. At the local scale, the three major habitats, pelagic, littoral, and benthic, are characterised by different degrees of structural complexity and a particular set of organisms and processes. Direct and indirect effects of changes in within-lake habitat complexity can either hinder or promote regime shifts in these systems. We also review several anthropogenic pressures (eutrophication, urbanisation, introduction of exotic species, and climate change) that decrease lake resilience through changes in habitat complexity and strategies for habitat complexity restoration. Overall, we emphasize the need to preserve and/or restore habitat complexity as key challenges to account for ecosystem integrity, maintenance of local/regional biodiversity, and for the provision of crucial ecosystem services (e.g., biodiversity, self-purification, and carbon sequestration).

AB  - In high voltage engineering, dielectric response analysis is a widely used tool for insulation diagnostic. Voltages used for studying dielectric response in the laboratory are usually sinusoidal in nature. But the insulation system in operation on site is often stressed by voltages that may deviate significantly from a sinusoid. Thus the use of non-sinusoidal waveform in obtaining the dielectric response is a desirable study for advanced insulation diagnostic technique. Present work involves assessing the condition of electrical insulation using dielectric response analysis under the influence of non-sinusoidal voltage waveform. In dielectric response analysis, characteristics curve of phase response over a frequency band is used to predict the insulation condition, which involves expertise. In this respect parameterization of insulation condition can make the assessment technique much simpler. But the nonlinear behavior of insulation restricts such an attempt to be accurate enough for reliable assessment of minute degradation of insulation condition. Therefore, the present work proposes a non-linear system identification technique, in an attempt to parameterize insulation condition. In this work, a suitable excitation signal has been designed so that the observed response becomes representative of the behavior of the whole system dynamics over the frequency band of interest. Tests have been performed with insulations having different moisture contents. The obtained system parameters, through nonlinear Hammerstein model, were found to be consistent over several experiments, and also accurate enough to detect small variation of moisture content. The proposed method is based on the time domain measurement of input excitation voltage and corresponding response current through the insulation.

AB  - This study evaluates the link between sea warming and three important aspects of the population dynamics of bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix, in the north-western (NW) Mediterranean: condition (health measures), reproduction and abundance (as reflected in catch per unit effort, CPUE). We compared the bluefish populations from two areas with different thermal regimes: the Gulf of Roses and the Ebre Delta. First, in order to compare the condition and reproduction parameters of the two populations, specimens were collected from the commercial catch landed in two ports located in these areas. Several indicators of fish condition and reproduction such as hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index, maturation timing, length-at-first maturity, fecundity, egg quality and atresia (ovarian follicle resorption) were analysed and compared between study areas. Second, time series analyses of sea surface temperatures (SST) and monthly bluefish CPUEs in the two study areas were assessed using Box-Jenkins transfer function models. Our results indicate that bluefish benefit from sea warming in the NW Mediterranean, particularly in the northernmost zone, as evidenced by increasing fish condition in these waters. Sea warming may favour the changes in spawning phenology and the northward expansion of this species. This study provides evidence that a marine fish species that is able to expand or is forced to shift its distribution as a result of sea warming may take advantage of other environmental conditions of new habitats, contributing to the enhancement of the population's productivity in these areas.

AB  - Biodiversity is recognizably affected by land conversion for agriculture. However, the assessment of impacts on wildlife often lacks information on populations structure and individuals' condition, allowing only a limited view of the problem. Individual body condition/health can influence animal's reproductive success or survival. Eucalyptus globulus plantations are important forestry systems in Iberia, being the widest forested-land use in Portugal, which hosts the broadest European E. globulus coverage. We tested Eucalyptus plantations' effects on small mammals' body condition (using the Scaled Mass Index-SMI as surrogate) and ectoparasite abundance (number of mites, ticks and fleas per host). We applied a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) approach for testing the influence of gender, habitat, species, season and understory cover on SMI and ectoparasites abundance. We captured 681 individuals, hosting overall 521 fleas (n =305), mites (n =159) and ticks (n =57). Animal's body condition was not affected by plantations, but was lower for males and higher in spring. However, animals captured in Eucalyptus plantations and spring had higher parasite abundance (namely ticks and fleas), as well as males. Mites results were inconclusive. Body condition patterns seem to be determined by males demanding spatial/reproductive behavior (i.e., wider home-ranges and search for females), while plantations promote ectoparasites abundance (e.g., induced by habitat disturbance and dilution effect). Results highlight that plantations may have negative effects on wildlife, but the evaluation of anthropic landscapes impact upon wildlife should encompass several bio-ecological indicators, since the use of a restricted set (e.g., body condition) may induce a biased view.

AB  - Coal microbial communities have not been well examined, despite their importance in the formation and maintenance of terrestrial ecosystems. Microorganisms are geographically versatile, exhibit wide morphological diversity and provide a rich platform for studying energy and carbon flows through different ecosystems. The coal characteristics, in turn, arc important environmental factors that control the composition, structure and activity of terrestrial bio-communities through various endogenous physiological and biochemical processes. The total phylogenetic structure of prokaryotes is closely related to their functional diversity and, ultimately, to the variety of environmental conditions in oxidized coal (lconarditc). Metagenomic studies in this area attempt to assess the relationship between the coal properties and its microbiome. The microbial community of the coal profiles, collected from various Kazakhstan coal deposits, have been studied in detail for the first time using high-throughput sequencing. As part of this study, a wide range of leonardites generated in various bioclimatic and geomorphological conditions are considered. A comprehensive characterization of the phylogenetic structure and diversity of coal was given on the basis of the 16S rDNA gene analysis. The revealed features of the prokaryotic composition can be used as bioindicators of the leonardite condition. In addition, metagenomic characteristics of coals of different origin can serve as valuable platform to assess the terrestrial ecosystem health.

AB  - When studying plankton distribution, it is necessary to investigate the biology of the target organisms and the surrounding physical environment. Station and species groupings are only useful if they provide insight into the environmental associations of the species in the group. The study covers two geographic regions: the Pacific Coast (Bicol Shelf) and inland waters (San Bernardino Strait, Ticao Pass, Sibuyan, and Visayan Seas) of the Philippines. Comprehensive information is provided on chaetognath assemblages and distribution within the regions. The findings are integrated with oceanographic conditions and phenomena that define the characteristics of the subareas and consideration given to how these conditions affect chaetognath ecology. A comparison is also provided of the community structure of the two regions, and the possible use of chaetognaths as indicator species of water mass movement and oceanographic phenomena explored. In all, 28 284 specimens were examined, and 33 species from 17 genera were identified. Chaetognath distributions, abundance, and community structure were analysed using dissimilarity indices and multiple regression. The results show that the distribution of chaetognaths agrees well with the movement of oceanic water from the Pacific into the central part of the archipelago.

AB  - An understanding of the interactions among local environmental factors (e.g., physical habitat and water quality) and aquatic assemblages is essential to conserve biodiversity in tropical and subtropical headwater streams. We evaluated the relative importance of multiple physical and chemical habitat variables that influence the richness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) assemblages in wadeable Brazilian Cerrado (savanna) streams. We sampled macroinvertebrate assemblages and quantified physical and chemical habitat in 79 randomly selected sites in 2 Cerrado basins in southeastern Brazil. The environmental variables selected by multiple regression models (MLRs) via corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) contributed significantly to variation in EPT taxon richness. The variance explained by physical-habitat variables was slightly greater in the Upper Sao Francisco Basin (adjusted R-2 = 0.53) than in the Upper Araguari Basin (adjusted R-2 = 0.46), and both were greater than the variance explained by a combined basin model (adjusted R-2 = 0.39). Physical-habitat variables were more important than water-quality variables in structuring EPT genera in streams with catchments dominated by agriculture or pasture land uses. Regional models can be improved by incorporating basin-specific information to refine biological assessments and to provide better understanding of the interactions that maintain biodiversity in stream networks.

AB  - This study investigated biomarker responses of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris in order to evaluate the soil pollution along Porsuk River Basin. Samples consisted of animals from six sites that are agricultural regions and a forested control. Histopathological and biochemical alterations were examined. Significant histopathological alterations were observed in animals from three of the sampling sites. There was an enlargement of epithelial cell lining, mucus cell hyperplasia and increase in mucus secretion. Circular and longitudinal muscles lost their structural integrity. Chloragogenous tissue was dilated and vocuolized. Necrosis was observed in the cells and tissues of some affected worms. A load of heavy metals in tissues of animals was determined. Heavy metals were found to be accumulated particularly in longitudinal muscles of animals. CAT activity was found to be increased in animals from three of the experimental sites. GST activity was also increased in five sites while it was stable in one site. The results have shown that animals from locations particularly that are close to urbanized and industrialized regions were seriously affected from the soil pollution around the basin. These results are reflecting the biological effects of soil pollution around Porsuk River Basin on the indicator organism L. terrestris and constitute an early warning of ecological change in relation to human health.

AB  - We review evidence for and against the use of erythrocyte indicators of health status and condition, parasite infection level and physiological stress in free-living vertebrates. The use of indicators that are measured directly from the blood, such as haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and parameters that are calculated from multiple measured metrics, such as mean cell volume, mean cell haemoglobin content or mean cell haemoglobin concentration is evaluated. The evidence for or against the use of any given metric is equivocal when the relevant research is considered in total, although there is sometimes strong support for using a particular metric in a particular taxon. Possibly the usefulness of these metrics is taxon, environment or condition specific. Alternatively, in an uncontrolled environment where multiple factors are influencing a metric, its response to environmental change will sometimes, but not always, be predictable. We suggest that (i) researchers should validate a metricfres utility before use, (ii) multiple metrics should be used to construct an overall erythrocyte profile for an individual or population, (iii) there is a need for researchers to compile reference ranges for free-living species, and (iv) some metrics which are useful under controlled, clinical conditions may not have the same utility or applicability for free-living vertebrates. Erythrocyte metrics provide useful information about health and condition that can be meaningfully interpreted in free-living vertebrates, but their use requires careful forethought about confounding factors.

AB  - The objects of the study are parallel-structure machine systems with redundancy associated with safety assurance of continuous material flow. The problem concerns systems in which the supply of materials takes place continuously (24 hours a day), and the system of operated machines must ensure the receipt and movement of the material at a strictly defined time and in the desired quantity. It is a system where the presence of a failure poses a threat to hu-man life and environmental degradation. This paper presents a method for system condition assessment and upgrading for maintaining proper operation under conditions of continuous operation. A database of information about the current parameters of the system components (measurements, monitoring) is necessary for condition assessment. The method also uses lean techniques (including TPM). System evaluation and selection criteria for a suitable structure in terms of further operation were proposed. Exemplification was performed for an underground mine drainage system. As a part of the identification, selected parameters of the system components were measured, and their characteristics (motors, pumps, pipelines) were developed. The results of the analysis and the values of the adopted criteria were com-pared to the indicators for new pump sets. A two-option system upgrade was proposed, in addition to machine operating schedules, maintenance periods, and overhaul cycles.

AB  - New firms face challenges regarding pace, time, scalability, and societal changes, requiring increased attention to sustainable work prerequisites. However, this dimension of social sustainability is less studied than economic and ecological sustainability. This paper addresses how sustainable work is considered in an entrepreneurial startup carrying out a greenfield project within a new industrial domain. Data were collected for 30 months in a longitudinal case study. The study shows that (i) working condition challenges were drivers for innovative solution-oriented approaches with potential for rapid decision-making, flexibility, and to attract, recruit, retain, and develop talented people; (ii) a strategic focus on sustainability and collective contribution to a purpose-driven vision were important enablers for taking steps of operationalising sustainable work dimensions during the startup; and (iii) the firm's early stakeholder collaboration addressing working conditions was an important means for design for sustainable work and their role as agents of sustainable work. Research implications are how sustainable work can be considered during startups and through stakeholder collaboration. Furthermore, the case contributes to increased knowledge of how the three pillars of sustainability-economic, ecological, and social sustainability-are interrelated and are suggested to be continuously considered over time, specifically during rapid major changes.

AB  - The stature of the first anatomically modern Europeans decreases dramatically following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the culminating point, around 20.000 BP, of a period of climatic deterioration that had profound effects on demographic, biological and economic aspects of Upper Palaeolithic populations. Declines in nutritional and life conditions are commonly assumed to play a major role in stature reduction. The aim of this paper is to test this hypothesis using skeletal indicators of biological and functional stress in samples from the early and late phases of Upper Paleolithic (respectively EUP and L UP), and integrating the results with the relevant archeological and paleoecological information. Analysis of biological stress markers indicates that after the LGM only a minor decline occurred in health conditions. This and the absence of marked or frequent growth disruptions suggests that nutritional deficiencies alone do not explain the observed trend. Biomechanical data, however, show an increase in upper limb robusticity, indicating that LUP populations were devoting more effort to subsistence activities. Those results dovetail with archaeological information pointing to increased competition for access to resources by growing populations living in a less productive environment. Based on that, we suggest that a microevolutionary adaptive process, involving reduction in body size to reduce energy requirements and hence nutritional demands, took place in the moderately adverse conditions following the LGM.

AB  - One of the major present preoccupations of ecologists is to foresee the effect of the predicted sea level change on the coastline, and therefore on the biosphere. Prospective studies first require a thorough knowledge of present conditions and of past evolution. Paralic environments are very sensitive to coastline variations, and provide one of the most sensitive tools for studying sea level change. One of their main characteristics is the degree of marine influence, named confinement, that depends on climatic conditions and on the coastline morphology and evolution. However, these environments are under the influence of complex interacting parameters, and their study requires a set of complementary tools. A confinement index (Ic), calculated on the basis of the main species of foraminifers, has been worked out in the paralic environments of west Africa. It provides a numerical value that can be calculated rapidly, and gives an immediate objective indication of slight changes in the environment, with a tendency toward more restricted (Ic increases) or less restricted (Ic decreases) conditions. This tendency might be in relation with sea level change. Thus, Ic is proposed as a preliminary tool for quantifying changes in the paralic ecosystems. Used together with a set of complementary indicators (sedimentology, geochemistry, and so on) it can be used for the detection of sea level change.

AB  - Channel reservoirs have the characteristics of both rivers and lakes, in which hydrodynamic conditions and the factors affecting the eutrophication process are complex and highly affected by weather conditions. Water age at any location in the reservoir is used as an indicator for describing the spatial and temporal variations of water exchange and nutrient transport. The hyper-eutrophic Changtan Reservoir (CTR) in Southern China was investigated. Three weather conditions including wet, normal, and dry years were considered for assessing the response of water age by using the coupled watershed model Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the three-dimensional hydrodynamic model Environmental Fluid Hydrodynamic Code (EFDC). The results showed that the water age in CTR varied tremendously under different weather conditions. The averaged water ages at the downstream of CTR were 3 d, 60 d, and 110 d, respectively in the three typical wet, normal, and dry years. The highest water ages at the main tributary were >70 d, >100 d, and >200 d, respectively. The spatial distribution of water ages in the tributaries and the reservoir were mainly affected by precipitation. This paper provides useful information on water exchange and transport pathways in channel reservoir, which will be helpful in understanding nutrient dynamics for controlling algal blooms.

AB  - Axle box bearing condition monitoring is important for the prognostics and health management (PHM) of high-speed trains. Temperature is an important indicator of the health of rotating machinery. It increases significantly when the machinery reaches a certain stage of failure. However, technologies based on temperature sensor signals for monitoring the status of high-speed train's axle-box bearings have rarely been reported to date. This paper proposes a novel condition-monitoring method called the "abnormality index model," which is based on the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm, for detecting the potential failures in the axle-box bearings of high-speed trains using temperature sensor signals obtained from a wireless transmission device system (WTDS). The proposed method is capable of quantifying the bearing condition as well as reducing any random noise from the external environment that may interfere with the measurement of the temperature signals of the train. WTDS temperature sensor signals for different failure modes were utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the LOF-based condition-monitoring approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect temperature signs associated with the health state of the axle-box bearings and uncover the potential failures, even beforehand.

AB  - Temperature is the most pervasive abiotic environmental factor for aquatic organisms. Fluctuations in temperature range lead to changes in metabolic performance. Here, we aimed to identify whether surpassing the thermal preference zones is correlated with shifts in universal cellular stress markers of protein integrity, responses to oxidative stress and lactate content, as indicators of anaerobic metabolism. Exposure of the Lake Baikal endemic amphipod species Eulimnogammarus verrucosus (Gerstfeldt, 1858), Ommatogammarus flavus (Dybowski, 1874) and of the Holarctic amphipod Gammarus lacustris Sars 1863 (Amphipoda, Crustacea) to increasing temperatures resulted in elevated heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and lactate content, elevated antioxidant enzyme activities (i.e., catalase and peroxidase), and reduced lactate dehydrogenase and glutathione S-transferase activities. Thus, the zone of stability (absence of any significant changes) of the studied molecular and biochemical markers correlated with the behaviorally preferred temperatures. We conclude that the thermal behavioral responses of the studied amphipods are directly related to metabolic processes at the cellular level. Thus, the determined thermal ranges may possibly correspond to the thermal optima. This relationship between species-specific behavioral reactions and stress response metabolism may have significant ecological consequences that result in a thermal zone-specific distribution (i.e., depths, feed spectrum, etc.) of species. As a consequence, by separating species with different temperature preferences, interspecific competition is reduced, which, in turn, increases a species' Darwinian fitness in its environment.

AB  - This contribution reviews the current status of the macroinvertebrate methodologies proposed for European coastal and transitional waters under the Water Framework Directive (WFD), showing the weaknesses and strengths of the WFD implementation process and proposing future research topics and challenges. In total, 12 different methodologies have been officially accepted by European Member States (MSs). Most of these methods are multimetric, i.e. including several metrics into an equation, others are multivariate and some others are univariate. The methodologies vary in their use of the parameters included in the WFD (e.g. disturbance-sensitive species composition, richness, diversity, density, etc.), and they are described in this contribution. The results from the intercalibration undertaken by MSs are shown, including the boundaries between the quality classes, for each European eco-region and type. Finally, four areas in which scientific agreement is needed to satisfy future macroinvertebrate quality management are identified and discussed: (i) reduction of the present bewildering array of available indices by identifying the index approaches, components and formulations that are most widely successful; (ii) establishing minimum criteria for index validation processes that demonstrate index accuracy and reliability; (iii) comparing and intercalibrating methods to achieve uniform assessment scales across geographies and habitats and (iv) integrating indices across media and ecosystem elements.

AB  - South Africa has committed to address freshwater conservation at the catchment scale, using a combination of landscape-level and species-level features as surrogates of freshwater biodiversity. To support this work, we examined fishes in the Olifants River catchment, where multiple anthropogenic pressures affect streams. Patterns in fish assemblage data across 88 sites were analysed and related to landscape environmental variables using statistical techniques of multivariate ordination, cluster analysis, and regression tree analysis. We identified 6 distinct fish assemblage types, which were separated by altitude and human influence, primarily dry-land cropping and dams. In the tipper reaches of the catchment, we identified a faunal shift from Barbus neefi, which occurred in less impacted sites, to B. anoplus and Tilapia sparrmanii, which were favored in cropland and mixed cropland/urban settings, respectively. The fish assemblage of the middle section of the catchment was not unique, but supported one species, Chiloglanis pretoriae, that could be considered a focal species for conservation. The low altitude, high-runoff section of the catchment supported the most species. However, species richness increased in association with dams, through the addition of species that are more tolerant of flow and physicochemical modifications. Thus, species richness may not be an optimal conservation target for this system. Rather, a series of indicators will be necessary to track and measure conservation success in the Olifants catchment.

AB  - We explored the key issues that are most likely to influence any set of guiding principles for developing biodiversity monitoring programmes in Australia's rangelands. We defined the Australian rangelands and came up with an overview of their climate extremes, land-use pressures and biodiversity loss, and then focussed on issues underpinning the design phase of any monitoring programme. Using Noss's 1990 framework of compositional, structural and functional attributes of biodiversity and its new revisions by others, we showed how the elusive, abstract concept of biodiversity can be used to identify many measurable attributes that can form a minimum and necessary set of indicators for any biodiversity monitoring task. We then described the steps in the monitoring process, with a particular focus on the reasons for monitoring biodiversity as they strongly influence the selection of indicators. We concluded by compiling a table of key issues as background information for developing guiding principles (Table 4). The list is by no means an exhaustive list for the design phase but it does indicate that considerable attention needs to be given to this phase when developing monitoring programmes. We have intentionally not addressed the equally important issues associated with the planning and delivery phases of developing a monitoring programme, as Wallace et al. and Watson and Novelly cover these in their papers in the present issue of Austral Ecology.

AB  - Spatially detailed information on permafrost distribution and change with climate is important for land use planning, infrastructure development, and environmental assessments. However, the required soil and surficial geology maps in the North are coarse, and projected climate scenarios vary widely. Considering these uncertainties, we propose a new approach to mapping permafrost distribution and change by integrating remote sensing data, field measurements, and a process-based model. Land cover types from satellite imagery are used to capture the general land conditions and to improve the resolution of existing permafrost maps. For each land cover type, field observations are used to estimate the probabilities of different ground conditions. A process-based model is used to quantify the evolution of permafrost for each ground condition under three representative climate scenarios (low, medium, and high warming). From the model results, the probability of permafrost occurrence and the most likely permafrost conditions are determined. We apply this approach at 20 m resolution to a large area in Northwest Territories, Canada. Mapped permafrost conditions are in agreement with field observations and other studies. The data requirements, model robustness, and computation time are reasonable, and this approach may serve as a practical means to mapping permafrost and changes at high resolution in other regions.

AB  - Coastal dunes are recognized as one of the most threatened ecosystems, the formation of which mainly depends on two opposite processes-sand dunes overgrowth and formation of open dunes. The application of cost-effective remote sensing methods permits monitoring the interaction of these two processes over a large area and long periods of time. Therefore in this study we assessed the links between hydro-meteorological parameters and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in Curonian spit coastal dunes landscape-a creation of human and nature integrity situated in the South eastern part of the Baltic Sea. Time series of NDVI (2000-2019) were obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer and compared with hydro-meteorological parameters in three different ecosystems-forest, herbaceous and open sands. Moderate and strong positive correlation between NDVI and average wind speed was detected in non-forested ecosystems. Moderate positive correlation was detected between NDVI and the Baltic sea water level in all three analyzed ecosystems. Moderate positive correlation between NDVI and air temperature was found in forest ecosystem. This confirms that NDVI could be treated as an appropriate indicator, showing the interaction of coastal dunes overgrowth and formation of open dunes, and could be applied in its management that should be reconsidered under nowadays climate change.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment was carried out in two urban streams, viz. Gap Stream (GS) and Miho Stream (MS), in the Geum River Watershed during July 2013-October 2014. The techniques used in this study included multi-level fish biomarkers of DNA damage based on single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) coupled with the study of physiological responses based on 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in fish species. Biomarker values of tail DNA (tDNA), tail length (T-L), and tail extent moment (TEM) in impacted zone (I-z) were 2.0-3.6-fold greater than in controls (C-z). Nucleus image analysis showed that the nucleus had circular particle forms in the C-z as compared with a longitudinal oval form with broken particles from the nucleus in the I-z. Physiological response analysis of EROD and AchE activities indicated that their levels were higher in the I-z than in the C-z. Such DNA damages and greater physiological responses in the I-z were attributed to chemical contaminants discharged from the wastewater disposal plants and industrial complex. This combination of DNA damage and physiological responses approach can be used as a key tool for early-warning detection of chemical contaminants and concomitant risks to the ecological health of urban streams.

AB  - The current Water Abstraction License (WAL) regime in Italy is no longer flexible enough to cope with the challenges posed by human-induced climate and global environmental changes. The cornerstones of the current regime were laid down in the 1930s and have remained essentially unchanged ever since. The sole noteworthy reform of the Italian WAL regime was the decentralization of the regulatory competences from the state to the regional authorities in the late 1990s. In this paper, we review the WAL regimes across the administrative regions comprising the Po River Basin District (PRBD), the largest and economically most important in Italy. PRBD's WAL regime includes a rigid and scattered WAL normative that hinders the performance of bottom-up conflict resolution mechanisms at a basin scale; a water pricing scheme that does not reflect the cost of water conveyance and use, and does not encourage efficient water allocation; and the lack of a central WAL register, which delays and in some cases impedes an environmental impact assessment for issuing new licenses or renewing existing ones, and does not allow prioritizing applications according to their full economic value. We argue these deficiencies may compromise both the integrity of riverine and water dependent ecosystems and the economic uses of water. This paper offers insights that can inform reform of water allocations in the PRBD and elsewhere in Italy and in Europe.

AB  - With this study, the existence of the mammalian species were used as a tool to reveal rehabilitation suggestions for the Anatolian (Oriental) Sweetgum Forests which are tertiary relict endemic for the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, heavily fragmented and in danger of becoming extinct. As the survey methodology; 2976 camera trap days with 9 different camera traps had been applied on three different forest patches (non-isolated, semi-isolated and isolated) to assess their ecological status by following some indices of mammalian community properties. Fragmentation is a major factor to assess diversity of species because numerous ecological variables are highly similar for this unique ecosystem. The findings of richness and diversity indices for both ecosystems are consistent with each other. According to richness index results; as isolation and fragmentation increase, richness decrease relatively, together with decreasing frequency (0,29 < 0,57 < 0,87). As well as the richness index, the diversity is decreasing inversely with the isolation and fragmentation (0,24 < 0.81 < 1.03). According to the results; as isolation and fragmentation increase, species diversity and number of observations decrease relatively. As a consequence of this current problem, corridor methodology was utilised to stop the fragmentation and various necessary conservation actions were suggested for the indicator mammals to live inside those forests. These results have important implications for the conservation of this ecosystem sustainability.

AB  - Objectives
   This article has as main objective to check how some entrepreneur's and venture characteristics are related to new social venture survival. Specifically, related to the venture, five conditions have been studied, these conditions are: venture workforce, initial capital and three variables that assess the quality of the social venture plan (business plan). Regarding the entrepreneur's conditions, the experience related to the new venture activity, training level and specific training, and entrepreneurship motivation have been taken into account.
   Study design and methodology
   The study uses a sample that oscillates between 291 and 212 start-ups according to the period considered. The two outcome original variables are survival at 31 December of the third year (ST+3) and at 31 December of the sixth year (ST+6) after the new venture foundation. Both variables are dichotomous (1 = survival; 0 = failure).
   The access to this sample has been possible with the collaboration of the Program Management and Planning Service from the Valencia Institute of Youth (IVAJ). This institution provided data on these ventures, whose creators were young entrepreneurs under 30 years old, or under 30 years but partnered with co-workers aged over 30 years, who applied for a grant.
   Our propositions or tenets imply the existence of an interplay between business plan quality and entrepreneur and firm characteristics. In this case, different combinations of causal conditions could lead to the same outcome. Therefore, taking into account the limitations of conventional quantitative methods to study the effect of different possible causal recipes on survival, this study uses Qualitative Comparative Analysis, specifically fsQCA. QCA methods build and test theories of complex antecedent conditions that are sufficient or necessary to explain an outcome condition (e.g., firm survival). That is, the goal is to determine if any of the conditions, or a combination of the conditions that have been numbered in the previous section are sufficient or necessary to explain new social ventures' survival.
   Results
   Due to the nature of the analysis that has been applied, the results can be divided into two blocks. The first one come from testing whether any of the causal conditions and their negation are necessary for the 3-year and 6-year survival. Our results show that any of the antecedent conditions is necessary or "almost necessary" for any outcome condition because any consistency score exceeds the threshold of 0.9.
   The second group of results shows models of sufficiency analysis. In ST+3 there are four main causal configurations that lead to firm survival. There are some conditions that are present in the four combinations, these conditions are both specific training and the level of entrepreneur's training, economic and organizational viability and initial capital. On the other hand, one of the combinations shows a curious characteristic, that is, the lack of financial viability makes the likelihood of survival grow. The most logic explanation is that as we are analyzing social ventures, and that these organizations trust more on subventions and public helps that on self-financing.
   At t+6, as at t+3 there are also 4 causal configurations that lead to firm survival. From the results it can be extracted that, specific or related training and training level, and economic and organizational viability are important conditions in explaining new venture survival. These results are similar to those obtained in the short run. However, there are one of the conditions that loose importance in the medium run, initial capital. Contrarily, related experience, which was not a key antecedent condition at ST+3 appears in the four relevant causal combinations in ST+6.
   Limitations of the study
   The limitations of the study are mainly related to the sample. The first limitation comes from the nature of the entrepreneurs; the sample is composed by entrepreneurs who live in the Valencian Community and who are all under 30, or under 30 but partnered with co-workers aged over 30 years. That characteristic of the sample makes difficult the extrapolation of the results at other territories and types of entrepreneurs. It is therefore advisable for subsequent research to replicate the study in a different geographical area, employing a sample comprising entrepreneurs of any age, which would probably make previous experience play a more determinant role when explaining new social venture survival. Likewise, it would be advisable to examine the real role played by the business plan, that is, if new ventures use it for something more than as a means of obtaining public support.
   Conclusions
   The most important conclusion is that any of the studied antecedent conditions alone is necessary or almost necessary, but these conditions take part of diverse overlapping causal configuration sufficient for displaying survival of both new and established social ventures. In fact, there are some antecedent conditions that are relevant in the short and medium run. These conditions are related to the entrepreneur's background, his/her training and experience. Moreover, the economic and organizational viability of the social venture plan are also important. One of the most important conditions at the short run, initial capital, loses importance at the long run. Probably because there are new social ventures that survive in the short run because of their amount of financial capital, but are not able to generate resources to be reinvested in a longer run.
   fsQCA offers a deeper understanding of the role of the different antecedent conditions, because it allows analyzing the effects of combining indicators of the quality of the business plan with entrepreneur and business characteristics. Furthermore, this technique allows researchers to consider different combinations of initial conditions that are able to foster firm survival probabilities, a result impossible to obtain with, for example, multivariate logistic analysis.
   Practical implications and original value
   The results are especially interesting for institutions responsible for the management of public or private aid programs aiming to foster entrepreneurship. They offer a guide for the assessment of new entrepreneur projects, taking into account variables or conditions that are particularly relevant to predict survival probabilities, at least at the short and medium run.
   This study highlights the fact that the entrepreneur's background should be object of consideration due to two reasons. Firstly, because it should be taken to account when deciding the projects to bet on, and, secondly, because theoretical and practical training of actual and potential entrepreneurs is shown as a profitable investment of public and private funds, especially in the case of social ventures. Finally, a real and flexible social venture plan could be a very interesting management tool, if managers have the knowledge and the will for an adequate implementation.

AB  - Riparian forests have positive effects on water quality and biodiversity. However, most studies have only tested the effects of distinct vegetation types or streams with and without forests, despite the fact that riparian forests differ in degrees of complexity. The aim of the present study was to test whether riparian forest complexity affected the composition and abundance of the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa across a small environmental gradient. Wealso measured whether EPT genera or feeding groups responded to changes in riparian forest complexity. The study was conducted in two protection areas (i.e. Lagoa do Peri Municipal Park, PERI; and the Permanent Protection Area of Ratones, RAT) of Santa Catarina Island, Brazil. Primary production increased in streams with lower canopy percentage, and EPT assemblages differed among streams with different riparian forest complexity. In RAT, the water quality and forest variables affected EPT composition; however, in PERI, only water quality variables were important. Indicator species analysis based on genera suggested Kempnyia (Plecoptera) and Zelusia (Ephemeroptera) to be indicative of streams with greater forest complexity, whereas Farrodes (Ephemeroptera) was significant in streams of intermediate riparian forest complexity; however, no one functional group dominated. The results of the present study show that small changes in riparian forest complexity influence the composition of EPT insects in subtropical streams.

AB  - We developed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models to predict fish species richness as a function of two simple landscape-scale, binary variables (surface water connectivity to other aquatic systems and human riparian development), with lake surface area as the covariate. All three variables were significantly related to species richness and explained 61% of the variance in a data set from 55 limnologically similar lakes in northern Wisconsin. We developed additional ANCOVA models to assess the relative effects of these three variables on four functional species groups, including gamefish, riverine, tolerant, and intolerant species. The number of gamefish species was greater in lakes with riparian development than in undeveloped lakes; this is probably related to introductions by management agencies and anglers. Connectivity increased the number of riverine species and intolerant species. Intolerant species may be more abundant because connecting streams provide colonization routes and decrease time between periodic extirpation and recolonization events. In addition, flowing water connections may provide a refuge from winter hypoxia and decrease extirpation rates of intolerant A species. Tolerant fishes were ubiquitous on the landscape and unaffected by the measured variables. Because simple landscape variables can dominate assemblage dynamics of small takes, and human-mediated introductions can increase species richness at low and moderate levels of disturbance, the use of fish as biological indicators for small lake assessment is not practical.

AB  - Exergy analysis is applied to assess the quality of the energy conversion processes that take place in the human body, aiming at developing indicators of thermal comfort based on the concepts of destroyed exergy rate, exergy transfer rate to the environment and exergy efficiency. In literature only destroyed exergy has been used to evaluate thermal sensation. To perform the exergy balance it is necessary to calculate the exergy variation of the body over time which is a composition of metabolic exergy and the exergy variation due to transient environmental conditions. The exergy transfer to the environment is calculated as the sum of the terms associated with radiation, convection, evaporation and respiration. The thermal behavior of the human body is simulated by a model composed of 15 cylinders, naked and dressed for winter seasons, as a function of the air temperature, mean radiant temperature and relative humidity. The energy equation is solved to obtain transitory response of the body due to a variation in environmental conditions and the energy transfer to the environment. For relative humidities between 40% and 60%, results indicate that the destroyed exergy is minimal for thermal comfort conditions. Nevertheless, for low relative humidities and high temperatures the destroyed exergy is also minimal, indicating the necessity of another physical quantity to evaluate thermal comfort conditions. At this point the exergy transfer to environment is high, showing that the body may not be at thermal comfort condition. This article proposes is to use two terms of the exergy analysis to evaluate the thermal comfort condition: destroyed exergy and exergy transfer to environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To investigate the role of environmental conditions on the selection of virulent Potato virus Y (PVY) isolates subject to pressure from the recessive resistance gene va in tobacco, a field survey was performed in Brazil where va-derived genotypes have been recently introduced and now represent less than one-third of cultivated tobacco genotypes. A serological analysis of 397 leaves collected from different Brazilian tobacco-growing areas and mainly from plants with symptoms indicated that 52-4% of samples were infected by at least one of the viral species tested. PVY was present in 72.1% of infected samples. The probability of a plant being infected with PVY was reduced in va hosts. However, the biological characterization of PVY isolates on indicator hosts showed that 20 of the 29 tested isolates were able to overcome the alleles of the va gene. Moreover, the observed biological diversity of isolates was higher in susceptible tobacco genotypes than in va-resistant ones. Comparison of these data with the PVY diversity in French tobacco fields shows that the use of va-derived genotypes in two environments with contrasting climatic conditions, local hosts and cultural contexts, leads to a similar outcome: the prevalence of virulent isolates. These results strongly suggest an important role of the va gene in the modification of PVY populations.

AB  - Pollen analysis of a core in Princess Vlei in the Fynbos Biome near Cape Town gives a 4150 year record of vegetation and climate changes followed by disturbance by colonial settlers since c. 300 years ago. Their impact replaced climate as a major factor in changing the vegetation. The chronology is based on eight radiocarbon dates. Pollen types such as Restionaceae, Ericaceae, and Proteaceae reflect changes in fynbos. Pollen indicators at the bottom of the core suggest drier conditions followed by an increase in Morella, Cyperaceae and Carpacoce pollen, which might indicate moist conditions c. 3400-2600 cal. yr BP. Drier conditions prevail c. 2600-1900 cal. yr BP. Apparent light disturbance after c. 2000 cal. yr BP might be attributed to Khoi herders. Deeper water and damp surroundings are indicated c. 1900-1000 cal. yr BP. The top of the core shows an increase of Poaceae while Restionaceae decrease with anthropogenic disturbance, including the introduction of neophytes such as Pinus (c. 300 years ago) and Zea mays. Charcoal percentages point to intense fires after the arrival of the Europeans. Water between 105 and 75 cm indicates the development of a floating mat resulting from changes in the hydrological system possibly connected to disturbances by settlers.

AB  - Microplastics are formed by the degradation of plastic wastes under the action of physicochemical mechanisms in environment, and they are becoming a new type of pollutant that is attractings global attention. However, research on the aging characteristics and mechanism of microplastics is limited. The aging mechanism of Polystyrene (PS) with UV irradiation under different conditions (air, pure water and seawater) and the effect of aging on heavy metal adsorption were studied. The results show that PS have different characteristics with UV irradiation under different conditions, and the aging of PS is the most obvious in air. Based on the 2D-COS analysis, different aging mechanisms were identified under different aging conditions, aging sequence of aged PS functional groups in air and water were clearly definited. An isothermal adsorption model shows that aging can significantly increase the adsorption of heavy metals by PS. The adsorption of heavy metals is also affected by different aging methods. Over all, a 2D-COS analysis was an effective method for understanding the aging process of PS. These results further clarify the aging mechanism of PS, and provides a theoretical basis for the assessment of environmental behavior and ecological risk when microplastics and heavy metals coexist.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) refers to small random differences that occur between the right and the left sides of bilateral characters. Under the hypothesis that the degree of FA in secondary sex traits reflects the ability of males to cope with environmental stress, and consequently reflects individual quality, a negative relationship is expected between FA and the trait size. Additionally, selective mortality acting preferentially on individuals in poor condition, presumably more asymmetric, should lead to a decrease in FA with age. We tested these hypotheses on roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) antlers, analysing the FA pattern in antler size from individuals culled over 18 years in a single population. Absolute asymmetry significantly decreased with age, and tended to decrease with antler size, at constant carcass mass, within age classes. Moreover, increase in the population density negatively affected carcass mass and antler size, and resulted in a significant increase in the degree of asymmetry in antlers. These results suggest that antler development in roe deer represents a reliable signalling of individual quality. Moreover, due to the deciduous nature of antlers, asymmetry in antler size appears to be a valuable indicator of the current environmental conditions encountered by populations.

AB  - Within the framework of this article, we consider the investment climate of individual Russian regions, the regions of the Siberian Federal District of the Russian Federation, which are currently attractive for investment due to the natural resource reserves. The concept of investment climate is considered as a complex concept, including the evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative indicators that predetermine the investment conditions in the economy of a particular territory. The quantitative indicators are divided into blocks of indicators of investment potential (innovative, labor, financial and production, infrastructure potential, etc.) and investment risk (social, economic and environmental risks). The qualitative indicators of assessment reflect the investment policy of the authorities of the regions of the Russian Federation. The research is based on such methods as the method of ranking, integral evaluation, comparative analysis. The work is aimed at identifying the weak and strong points of the Russian regions studied, comparing regions with each other in order to identify regions with the favorable and unfavorable investment climate. The analysis of qualitative indicators makes it possible to find out in which regions the regional authorities create the most favorable investment conditions. These methods make it possible to identify the region's most attractive for investment in the Siberian Federal District of the Russian Federation in a single set.

AB  - The aim of this review is a wide description of the relationships between growing conditions and bulb yield and quality of onion (Allium cepa L.), focused particularly on long-day cultivars suitable for storage. Marketable yield decreases according to the reduction of crop length caused by the increase of growth temperature. The nutritive requirements of storage onion are highest during the vegetative growth. The application of humic substances and the inoculation of mycorrhizae may enhance bulb growth and quality, mainly under stress conditions. Onion is a slow-growth, shallowrooted crop with non-shading habitus and therefore its productivity is highly dependent on water availability in the soil, proper fertilization and weed control. The shelf-life of onion bulbs is a genetic trait, improvable by efficient crop and post-harvest management, and adequate conditions of bulb storage. The quality of storage onion bulbs is ascribed to several indicators, such as thiosulfonates, pyruvic acid, soluble solids, sugars, and many other biological compounds. This review is also focused on onion quality as affected by the interactions among genotype, environment, farming practices and post-harvest management.

AB  - The last few decades have seen an increased reliance on the use of stream attributes to monitor stream conditions. The use of stream attributes has been criticized because of variation in how observers evaluate them, inconsistent protocol application, lack of consistent training, and the difficulty in using them to detect change caused by management activity. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of environmental heterogeneity and observer variation on the use of physical stream attributes as monitoring tools. For most stream habitat attributes evaluated, difference among streams accounted for greater than 80 percent of the total survey variation. To minimize the effect that variation among streams has on evaluating stream conditions, it may be necessary to design survey protocols and analysis that include stratification, permanent sites, and/or analysis of covariance. Although total variation was primarily due to differences among streams, observers also differed in their evaluation of stream attributes. This study suggests that if trained observers conducting a study that is designed to account for environmental heterogeneity can objectively evaluate defined stream attributes, results should prove valuable in monitoring differences in reach scale stream conditions. The failure to address any of these factors will likely lead to the failure of stream attributes as effective monitoring tools.

AB  - Ensuring the efficiency and robustness of a power system stabiliser is indebted to provide a comprehensive scheme that considers significant uncertainties in variables and parameters of the model. This study proposes a robust type-II fuzzy logic-based power system stabiliser scheme that can handle the uncertainties in both loading condition and line parameters. Unlike loading condition, there are many lines in a typical power system and it is necessary to introduce an indicator that can mark lines with significant uncertainty in the parameters. Hence, a criterion based on Oscillatory Stability Index is presented in the study. On the other hand, random samples from line parameters and loading conditions are generated by the roulette-wheel using probability density functions (PDF) to form the elements of the weighting matrix. Two objective functions including weighted eigenvalue deviations and damping ratios are defined and then optimised to find the parameters of the proposed stabiliser in the uncertain environment. Simulations are carried out in different scenarios and in terms of both load condition and line parameters changes. Finally, the performance of the proposed stabiliser is assessed through comparisons with an optimised lead-lag power system stabiliser and a robust lead-lag power system stabiliser.

AB  - Objective: In natural populations, infection and condition may act synergistically to trigger a vicious circle: poor condition predisposes to host infections, which further reduce condition, and so on. If this vicious circle originates from a reduced resistance to infection, it will not only result in greater proneness to becoming infected of those that are in poorer condition, but it may also cause infections of higher intensity. Here, we investigate the temporal relationship between host condition and intensity of infection by a specific pathogen using as a system the dynamics of the protozoan Trypanosoma microti in field vole (Microtus agrestis) populations.
   Methods and results: With two years of longitudinal data from three monthly-sampled populations, we evaluated if individuals acquiring a high intensity of infection previously had lower haematological indicators of condition (red blood cells [RBCs] and lymphocyte counts) than those that acquired lower infection intensities. Also, the association of these indicators with past and present trypanosome blood levels was investigated. The individuals that developed high levels of parasitaemia were those that previously had low lymphocyte counts. Greater intensity of infection corresponded with lower RBCs only in low to moderate weight females, and no effect of intensity of infection on lymphocyte counts was observed. However, delayed effects of high trypanosome intensity were seen on both RBCs and lymphocytes.
   Conclusions: The vicious circle may also result in high infection intensity: individuals in poor condition are not only more likely to become infected by one pathogen; they may also be the most important source of infection for that and for other pathogens, and thus key protagonists for parasite dynamics.

AB  - The influence of humidity on surface energetics and flow behavior of fine pharmaceutical powders was investigated. Amorphous and crystalline fine powders with hydrophilic (Corn starch and Avicel PH105) and hydrophobic (ibuprofen) nature were considered for this study. The surface energy was determined using surface energy analyzer and flow behavior was measured in terms of unconfined yield stress (UYS) using a shear tester. The study showed that unlike hydrophobic ibuprofen powder, surface energy and flow of hydrophilic excipient powders were affected by relative humidity (RH). The Lifshitz-van der Waals dispersive (gamma(LW)) component of surface energy barely changed with varying RH for all pharmaceutical powders. For hydrophilic excipients, the specific component of surface energy (gamma(SP)) was found to increase with increasing RH. Furthermore, for these excipients, flow deterioration at elevated RH was observed due to increased capillary bridge formation. Detailed analysis showed that gamma(SP) component of surface energy can be an effective indicator for flow behavior of fine powders under varying humid conditions. The present study also brought out the existence of different regimes of probable interparticle forces which dictate the bulk flow behavior of fine hydrophilic powder under humid conditions.

AB  - We examined trade-offs between current reproduction and future reproductive potential in a terrestrial salamander (Plethodon cinereus) in outdoor enclosures. We raised females that differed in brooding status under manipulations of food level and tail condition in two years (1993 and 1994), and measured the effects of our treatments on current reproductive success (egg survival) and indicators of future reproductive potential (female growth and production of ova). Current reproductive success depended strongly on clutch size but not resource availability. Brood abandonment was higher among females with small clutches. Both brooding status and tail condition affected future reproductive potential. Brooding females gained less mass and produced fewer new ova than nonbrooders. Tail loss resulted in increased tail regeneration but decreased production of new ova. These strong main effects were consistent between years, despite differences in experimental protocol and limited sample sizes. Food levels affected female growth only in interaction with brooding status, and these effects differed between years. Gain in mass was affected by this interaction more strongly in 1993 than in 1994, and tail regeneration was only affected in 1994. Understanding costs of reproduction in natural populations will require understanding how the condition of both the organism and its environment influence energy allocation to current reproduction and different components of future reproductive potential.

AB  - The hyporheic zone-the transition region beneath and alongside the stream bed-is a central compartment for attenuation of organic micropollutants in rivers. It provides abundant sorption sites and excellent conditions for biotransformation. We used a bench-scale flume to study the fate of 19 parent pharmaceuticals (PPs) and the formation of 11 characteristic transformation products (TPs) under boundary conditions similar to those in hyporheic zones. The persistence of PPs ranged from readily degradable with a dissipation half-life (DT50) as short as 1.8 days (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) to not degradable (chlorthalidone, fluconazole). The temporal and spatial patterns of PP and TP concentrations in pore water were heterogeneous, reflecting the complex hydraulic and biogeochemical conditions in hyporheic zones. Four TPs (carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, metoprolol acid, 1-naphthol, and saluamine) were exclusively formed in the sediment compartment and released to surface water, highlighting their potential to be used as indicators for characterizing hyporheic transformation of micropollutants in streams. The accumulation of certain TPs over the experimental period illustrates that we might face a peak of secondary contamination by TPs far from the point of release of the original contaminants into a stream. Such TPs should be considered as priority candidates for a higher-tier environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Stable isotopes provide an independent assessment of paleoenvironments in the Omo-Turkana Basin. Stable isotopes track the flow of oxygen and carbon through ecosystems and accordingly are not directly related to changes in mammalian faunal composition or sedimentology. Therefore, isotope studies give insight into the paleoenvironmental conditions in which human evolutionary trends have been recorded. The development of stable isotopes as indicators of continental environmental conditions has proceeded in parallel with questions about the conditions of human environment. What was the vegetation? How hot was it? How dry? What were the diets of animals living among early humans? And most persistently, how important were savannas to early hominids? In this review, we take the opportunity to provide extensive background on the use of isotopes in anthropological sites. The application of stable isotope ecology to anthropological sites in the Turkana Basin has a long history, but in many ways the Omo-Turkana Basin has been a proving ground for the development of new proxy methods for understanding tropical terrestrial environments in the Neogene and Quaternary. For that reason, we also describe some of the fundamental aspects of isotope ecology that developed outside the field of paleoanthropology. (C) Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This review on copper runoff dispersed from unsheltered naturally patinated copper used for roofing and facades summarizes and discusses influencing factors, available literature, and predictive models, and the importance of fate and speciation for environmental risk assessment. Copper runoff from. outdoor surfaces is predominantly governed by electrochemical and chemical reactions and is highly dependent on given exposure conditions (size, inclination, geometry, degree of sheltering, and orientation), surface parameters (age, patina composition, and thickness), and site-specific environmental conditions (gaseous pollutants, chloride, rainfall characteristics (amount, intensity, pH), wind direction, temperature, time of wetness, season). The corrosion rate cannot be used to assess the runoff rate. The extent of released copper varies largely between different rain events and is related to dry and wet periods, dry deposition prior to the rain event and prevailing rain and patina characteristics. Interpretation and use of copper runoff data for environmental risk assessment and management need therefore to consider site-specific factors and focus on average data of long-term studies (several years). Risk assessments require furthermore that changes in copper speciation, bioavailability aspects, and potential irreversible retention on solid surfaces are considered, factors that determine the environmental fate of copper runoff from outdoor surfaces.

AB  - The benthic foraminiferal assemblages in Lake Varano (southern Italy) have been investigated in detail. Statistical analyses enable us to recognize two main biotopes and five sub-biotopes that reflect different ecological and environmental conditions. The assemblages mainly seem to be influenced by the hydrological (namely salinity) and sediment conditions in the lake. These biotopes are characterized by specific sub-assemblages and variations in relative species' abundances. The Outer Lake Biotope is affected by marine influence and is dominated by the foraminiferal species: Ammonia beccarii, Ammonia parkinsoniana and Aubignyna perlucida, which are more common in open water environments. In contrast, the Inner-Marginal Lake Biotope reflects more restricted conditions where low salinity values and sand are associated with high numbers of miliolids. These two main biotopes are thus subjected to different degrees of confinement and water residence times, both of which are related to the water exchange time of the lake with the Adriatic Sea. In addition five sub-biotopes (Intermediate Marine, Mixing, "Urban", Marginal, and Innermost) represented by particular foraminiferal assemblages are identified that characterize particular sub-environments. These sub-biotopes are, to some extent, separated by salinity gradients as well as the grain-size and the organic matter of sediments.

AB  - This study identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with 15 complex traits in a breeding population of barley (Hordeurn vulgare L.) consisting of 137 recombinant chromosome substitution lines (RCSL), evaluated under contrasting water availability conditions in the Mediterranean climatic region of central Chile. Given that markers showed a very strong segregation distortion, a quantitative trait locus/loci (QTL) mapping mixed model was used to account for the heterogeneity in genetic relatedness between genotypes. Fifty-seven QTL were detected under rain-fed conditions, which accounted for 5-22% of the phenotypic variation. In full irrigation conditions, 84 SNPs were significantly associated with the traits studied, explaining 5-35% of phenotypic variation. Most of the OIL were co-localized on chromosomes 2H and 3H. Environment-specific genomic regions were detected for 12 of the 15 traits scored. Although most QTL-trait associations were environment and trait specific, some important and stable associations were also detected. In full irrigation conditions, a relatively major genomic region was found underlying hectoliter weight (HW), on chromosome 1H, which explained between 27% (SNP 2711-234) and 35% (SNP 1923-265) of the phenotypic variation. Interestingly, the locus 1923-265 was also detected for grain yield at both environmental conditions, accounting for 9 and 18%, in the rain-fed and irrigation conditions, respectively. Analysis of QTL in this breeding population identified significant genomic regions that can be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) of barley in areas where drought is a significant constraint.

AB  - Factors that determine the condition of migratory birds at their wintering sites are poorly known. Age, sex, and morphological characteristics of birds may have an influence on their winter condition by affecting their foraging and competitive abilities. Winter body condition could have long-term consequences on the reproductive success of migratory birds during the subsequent breeding season. Using 3 yr of data from Collared Flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), we examined the characteristics of winter-grown tail feathers, as indicators of winter body condition, in relation to sex, age, morphological traits, and future breeding variables. Tail feather mass was highly repeatable between years, but feather growth rate was not repeatable, which suggests that the latter trait mainly indicates environmental circumstances during molt, whereas feather mass may more strongly reflect genetic effects. Tail feathers of males and adults showed better quality than those of females and juveniles, possibly because of differences between age classes and sexes in individual quality and foraging skills or because of winter habitat segregation. Birds with longer wings produced better-quality tail feathers, which suggests that wing and tail feather characteristics are similarly affected, presumably by individual genetic quality. Smaller Collared Flycatchers grew their tail feathers faster during the winter molt, possibly because they had better foraging ability due to better flight maneuverability. Tail feather quality showed no relationship with laying date; however, females that had produced heavier tail feathers during winter laid larger clutches during the following breeding season, which suggests that tail feather mass potentially reflects intrinsic individual quality.

AB  - Calcified structures are valuable indicators being used in fisheries research for the estimation of fish ages or backcalculations of fish lengths. Such back-calculations typically assume constant proportional growth of fish and calcified structures independent of internal or environmental factors. We analyzed extensive data (1935-2020) of scale measurements from Norwegian spring-spawning herring. We applied linear quantile regressions to investigate the fish length - scale size relationship and environmental influences on individuals growing at different rates. We demonstrated that the fish length - scale size relationship varied over time and between cohorts, individuals of the same year-class. Parts of this variation can be attributed to changing environmental conditions. We identified a negative effect of stock total biomass and a positive effect of temperature on fish length when conditioned on scale size. The effect of stock total biomass varied considerably but the effect of temperature was similar between fish characterized by different growth rates. Our results are essential for longterm studies highlighting potential biases associated with environmental effects and different growth rates of individuals. These biases should be accounted for in growth history reconstructions and applications of the calcified structures as ecological indicators.

AB  - The rate of land-use conversion from forest to nonforest or natural forest to forest plantation is of interest for forest certification purposes and also as part of the process of assessing forest sustainability. Conversion rates can be estimated from remeasured inventory plots in general, but the emphasis here is on annual inventory data. A new estimator is proposed based on analysis of plot-level variables that indicate when a change in forest condition occurs between inventory remeasurements. A weighted maximum likelihood estimator is derived that incorporates the binomial nature of the indicator variables, mapped plot conditions, and varying remeasurement periods. Example applications demonstrate the utility of the proposed methodology. This approach is broadly useful for estimating the annual rate of change from an initial condition to another condition from annual forest inventory data.

AB  - The enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) holds a key position in the microalgal antioxidant network. The present research focused on oxidative stress responses in the Antarctic diatom Chaetoceros brevis F. Schutt during transition to excess (including ultraviolet radiation [UVR]) and limiting irradiance conditions. Over a 4 d period, cellular responses of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS, a general oxidative stress indicator), SOD activity, photosynthetic and xanthophyll cycle pigments, PSII efficiency, and growth were determined. In addition, oxidative responses were measured during a daily cycle. Changing irradiance conditions significantly affected growth rates of C. brevis. PSII efficiency decreased significantly during periodic excess irradiance and increased under low irradiance conditions. Transition to excess irradiance increased the ratio of xanthophyll to light-harvesting pigments, whereas the opposite was observed for cultures transferred to low irradiance. This acclimation process was completed after 2 d in the new irradiance environment. SOD activity increased significantly after the first day regardless of the new irradiance environment but returned to preexposure values on the fourth day. We hypothesize that SOD activity may be temporarily elevated in C. brevis after irradiance shifts, thereby reducing oxidative stress when photoacclimation is in progress.

AB  - An ecologico-mathematical models system has been formulated that takes into account biological processes such as feeding, food assimilation, respiration and organic release, growth, juvenile and adult mortality, and reproduction. The model also takes account of physical circulation of the Azov Sea and meteorological conditions. The aim of the study has been to predict ctenophore population dynamics in the Azov Sea ecosystem. The results of preliminary simulations compare favourably with observational data. In the future, we hope to be able to predict ctenophore population dynamics over an entire year and to evaluate the impact of Mnemiopsis on the ecosystem.

AB  - Rangeland degradation is a growing problem throughout the world. An assessment process for comparing the trend and state of vegetation productivity to objectively derived reference conditions was developed. Vegetation productivity was estimated from 2000 to 2012 using annual maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the MODE satellite platform. Each pixel was compared with reference conditions derived from surrounding pixels on similar sites with nearly identical potential species assemblages, vegetation structure and productivity. Trends in degradation were determined by comparison between the slopes of the linear trends in mean annual maximum NDVI at each pixel and reference conditions with a one-sample t-test. In contrast, the state or "status" of degradation at each pixel was evaluated by comparing the mean annual response of NDVI between 2000 and 2012 to that of reference conditions over the same time period using a one-sample t-test. These procedures to evaluate trends and status of rangelands were applied across northern and southern Great Plains of the United States. Trends in degradation were almost undetectable across the entire study area. In contrast the degradation status assessment revealed that 16% (7,330,625 ha) of the vegetation on the northern Great Plains and 9% (3,295,106 ha) of the southern Great Plains were significantly different (p <= 0.01) from reference conditions. The amount of annual net primary reduction lost resulting from these degraded lands relative to reference conditions was estimated at 2.02 Tg Cyr(-1), less than 1% of the total annual net primary production in the study area of 212 Tg Cyr(-1).

AB  - There is growing consensus that land degradation assessments should occur at local to regional scales, as global assessments fail to capture the complexity of land degradation processes, and how they manifest in different social-ecological contexts. We have tested a statistically rigorous method for regional land degradation assessment in drylands, using fuzzy classification theory and techniques, that results in the creation of a habitat condition archetype for the Namaqualand Hardeveld bioregion of the Succulent Karoo biome in South Africa. The methodology initially groups field data into classes based on known indicators of land degradation, before predicting observed field cover with 16 remote sensing variables, derived from both LANDSAT 8 and SENTINEL-2A satellite data. Using fuzzy classification techniques, projections of field cover from the resulting model are combined with variables representing a potential change in cover to produce a map of the habitat condition of the bioregion. Approximately 17% of the bioregion had habitat condition values less than one standard deviation smaller than the mean and could therefore be considered degraded. To provide context, this map is presented with potential drivers of change for the bioregion. The map, and accompanying drivers of change, is ultimately presented in a Google Earth Engine app for easy interpretation and use.

AB  - This study examined whether simple indicators of condition in individual Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) are related to biochemical composition and energy content for the whole range of conditions potentially observed in natural populations. The energy content of muscle was largely associated with its protein content, while liver energy content mainly consisted of lipids. Accurate predictions of muscle and liver energy content can also be made from the measurement of their water content. Relationships between energy content, water content, and simple measures such as condition factor and hepatosomatic index provide a fast and accurate assessment of seasonal changes in total available energy reserves in cod. These indices could advantageously be used to monitor the status and recovery of cod stocks and to ensure improved management of that resource.

AB  - The article deals with the research of sustainability of landscapes of North Kazakhstan region under conditions of long-term agrogenic load. In this connection and basing on the developed system of indicators there was carried out the assessment of geosystems' conditions and levels of their sustainability to the influence of human agricultural activities. The assessment was made according to thirteen indicators characterizing forming factors, landscapes functional conditions and properties of their main components. Assessment methods were based on the use of different specified rates that were transferred to a relative value (points) and were ranked according to variability (sustainability) of each landscape under direct or indirect agricultural exposure. Besides, this work performs spatial analysis and typology of the regional landscapes according to the index of potential resistance to agricultural influence. It was defined that the most resistant to agricultural human activities landscapes of Northern and central parts of the region are located within forest-steppe natural zone. Low potential resistance is typical of the landscapes located in the South-East of the region within dry steppe subzone and in the landscapes of the river Yesil valley. The level of steppe zone landscapes resistance to agricultural impact is defined as relatively stable. This work provides recommendations on restoration of ecological balance and establishing of stable functioning of the landscapes.

AB  - Studies were carried out to determine the effects on thr metabolic activities of earthworms of experimental conditions used in toxicity assays. Earthworms (Eisenia fetida andrei) were maintained under constant environmental conditions, in the absence of toxic agents, using three standard toxicology assay procedures (the artisol, contact filter paper and artificial soil tests) for two periods of time. Two controls were used: (1) earthworms taken directly from stock cultures for analysis and (2) earthworms treated as in soil test but exposed only to the culture medium rather than artificial soil. Biotransformation markers (methoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, NADH and NADPH cytochrome reductases and glutathione-S-transferase activities) and indicators of oxidative stress (catalase activity, lipid peroxides and peroxidisable lipids) were investigated. The results demonstrated that substrates and handling can induce significant biochemical changes in worms maintained in uncontaminated media. None of the substrates were better than others in avoiding these artefacts. Hence, although the soil test is closer to the natural conditions for the worms than the contact or the artisol tests, it still had significant effects on the worms in the absence of toxic chemical. Great care must therefore be taken when comparing results from different ecotoxicological assay procedures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - High-voltage insulators are one of the essential components of a power network, and regular monitoring of them ensures the reliable operation of the network. Therefore, several research groups have proposed different condition assessment indices by analyzing the measured leakage current of the polluted insulator at different environmental conditions. At laboratory conditions, those indices are developed under pure or nearly sinusoidal voltage waveforms. However, a considerable amount of harmonic distortion is prevalent in the supply voltage in real life owing to the ever-increasing trend in the use of power electronic devices in the power network; as a result, insulators in the power network are immediately subject to this distortion. Therefore, in the presence of distorted supply voltage, the efficacy of these current indicators developed for pollution severity assessment under purely sinusoidal voltage will become dubious. In this work, authors have investigated the impact of distorted supply voltage waveforms on the leakage current of an artificially polluted silicone rubber insulator. The result of this work indicates that in combination with contaminant severity and relative humidity, supply voltage distortion causes significant changes in the measured leakage current. Based on these findings, the authors further proposed a new crest factor-based index to predict the pollution level of a silicone rubber insulator.

AB  - Demographic shifts in populations of bioindicator species are widely used to gauge the extent of impacts of human disturbances on ecosystems. Yet, the mechanistic drivers of these demographic changes are often poorly understood. The Atlantic ghost crab, Ocypode quadrata is a bioindicator species of human disturbances on sandy shores, and experiences similar demographic changes as other bioindicator species in response to disturbance by reducing their population abundance and individual body sizes. Previous studies have focused on how human disturbances could cause these demographic changes through altering mortality rates or burrowing behavior. Here, we examine the potential for energetic impacts of human disturbance to cause these demographic shifts. Specifically, we investigate whether variation in habitat quality associated with the level of human disturbance results in reduced diet quality and therefore reduced physiological condition and reproductive effort of ghost crabs. We demonstrate an inverse relationship between diet quality and the level of human disturbance, with resulting reductions in the physiological and reproductive condition of ghost crabs with human disturbance. Our study shows that indirect human disturbance can explain existing variation in demographic characteristics of this bioindicator species, and highlights the importance of understanding bioenergetic relationships between species habitat use and human impacts.

AB  - Objective: We test whether macroeconomic conditions affect individuals' willingness to pay for environmental quality improvements.
   Background: Improvements in environmental quality, like everything, come at a cost. Individuals facing difficult economic times may be less willing to make trade-offs required for improvements in environmental quality. Using somewhat different methodologies and shorter time frames, prior investigations have generally found a direct relationship between willingness to pay for environmental improvements and macroeconomic conditions.
   Method: We use a nearly 40-year span (27 periods) of the General Social Survey (1974-2012) to estimate attitudes toward environmental spending while controlling for U.S. macroeconomic conditions and respondent-specific factors such as age, gender, marital status, number of children, residential location, educational attainment, personal financial condition, political party affiliation and ideology. Macroeconomic conditions include one-year lagged controls for the unemployment rate, the rate of economic growth (percentage change in real GDP), and an indicator for whether the U.S. economy was experiencing a recession.
   Results: We find that, in general, when economic conditions are unfavorable (i.e., during a recession, or with higher unemployment, or lower GDP growth), respondents are more likely to believe the U.S. is spending too much on "improving and protecting the environment". Interacting lagged macroeconomic controls with respondent's income, we find that these views are at least partially offset by the respondent's own economic condition (i.e., their own real income).
   Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with the notion that environmental quality is a normal, or procyclical good, i.e., that environmental spending should rise when the economy is expanding and fall during economic contractions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Eastern Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine, which is characterized by a sharp change in weather conditions during the growing season of agricultural crops, it is very important to grow hybrids that are most adapted to frequent weather anomalies during the growing season. This can significantly reduce their negative impact on the productivity of spring wheat.
   The results of a study of 20 samples (soft spring wheat Triticum aestivum L.) and (durum spring wheat Trticum durum) of different ecological and geographical origin for adaptability when changing environmental conditions (Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Sweden) are presented. Adaptability indicators were determined by the following characteristics: mass of one spike, mass of grain from one spike, number of grains from one spike, mass of 1000 seeds, mass of grain from 1 m2. Samples that have high plasticity and stability by these characteristics have been identified. 3As a result of the conducted studies, the dependence between the main signs of productivity were established: the number of grains from one spike, the mass of grains from one spike, the mass of 1000 seeds, the mass of one spike, the mass of seeds from 1 m2 of Triticum aestium and Triticum durumsamples. We have considered the adaptability of selection characteristics of samples by years with different environmental conditions: air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation amount, and hydrothermal coefficient.

AB  - Ethanol dehydration to diethyl ether makes it suitable for diesel engines by improving its cetane number, autoignition temperature, flammability limits, and petrodiesel miscibility. Therefore, the present investigation aimed at analyzing the ethanol dehydration process in a continuous reactor from thermodynamic, economic, and environmental perspectives. An integrated soft computing approach was also used to model and optimize the ethanol dehydration conditions. The effects of three reaction variables, i.e., weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), dehydration temperature, and dehydration pressure, were thoroughly analyzed on the exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental indicators. The WHSV was the most influential variable on the exergetic indicators investigated, while the studied indicators were hardly affected by the dehydration pressure. The optimal dehydration temperature, pressure, and WHSV were found to be 398 degrees C, 82.3 bar, and 2.96 1/h, respectively. At the selected optimal ethanol dehydration conditions, the process exergy efficiency was found to be 22.7%. The cost and environmental impact of unit product exergy at the optimal ethanol dehydration conditions were 95.0 USD/GJ and 85.7 mPts/GJ, respectively. Generally, it could be deduced that chemical biofuel plants could be well understood and optimized using the exergy-based approaches, particularly exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental methods.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are contaminants of concern due to their persistence, potential to bioaccumulate, and toxicity. While dietary exposure is the primary route of exposure for terrestrial species, data on dietary PFAS uptake and adverse effects are largely restricted to mammals. As such, substantial data gaps exist that hinder ecological risk assessment, including environmentally relevant exposure levels and taxa. Using a 30-d laboratory experiment, we examined the effects of dietary PFAS-exposure on post-metamorphic tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum). We fed salamanders crickets exposed to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), or 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS) at low (<1.0), medium (2-5), or high (16-62) ng PFAS/g/d (wet weight) dose rates. We found that only PFOS resulted in substantial biomagnification. Despite limited evidence for biomagnification, PFAS altered growth and generally reduced body condition. Salamanders with the highest burdens of PFOS grew less and had lower body conditions, while burdens of PFHxS and PFOA were only associated with reduced growth. There was no evidence that environmentally relevant doses of PFAS increase liver size in salamanders. Our results demonstrate that dietary exposure and accumulation of PFAS can impact fitness-related traits in amphibians and contribute to trophic transfer in terrestrial food webs.

AB  - The destruction of coral reef habitats has occurred at unprecedented levels during the last three decades. Coral disease and bleaching in the Caribbean and South Florida have caused extensive coral mortality with limited recovery, often coral reefs are being replaced with turf algae. Acroporids were once dominant corals and have diminished to the state where they are being considered as endangered species. Our survey assessed the condition of reef corals throughout South Florida. A probability- based design produced unbiased estimates of the spatial extent of ecological condition, measured as the absence or presence and frequency or prevalence of coral diseases and bleaching intensity over large geographic regions. This approach allowed us to calculate a quantifiable level of uncertainty. Coral condition was estimated for 4100 hectares ( ha) (or 41.0 km(2)) of coral reefs in South Florida, including reefs in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary ( FKNMS), New Grounds, Dry Tortugas National Park ( DTNP), and Biscayne National Park (BNP). The absence or presence of coral disease, 'causal' coral bleaching, partial bleaching and coral paling were not good indicators of overall coral condition. It was more useful to report the prevalence of anomalies that indicated a compromised condition at both the population and community levels. For example, 79% of the area in South Florida had less than 6% of the coral colonies diseased, whereas only 2.2% (97.15 ha) of the sampled area had a maximum prevalence of 13% diseased coral colonies at any single location. The usefulness of 'causal bleaching' might be more important when considering the prevalence of each of the three different states at a single location. For example, paling was observed over the entire area, whereas bleaching and partial bleaching occurred at 19 and 41% of the area, respectively. An index for coral reef condition might integrate the prevalence and species affected by each bleaching state at individual locations. By establishing these baselines, future surveys can examine changes and trends in the spatial distribution of coral conditions in South Florida and able to score the reefs as to their health status.

AB  - Temperature increases, hypoxia, and changes in food availability are predicted to occur in the future. There is growing concern for the health status of wild and farmed organisms, since environmental stressors alter organism functions, and elicit coordinated physiological responses for homeostasis. Mussels are good bioindicators of environmental conditions. Their ability to maintain unaltered immunosurveillance under adverse environmental conditions may enhance their survival capability. Few studies are currently concerned with the relationships and feedback among multiple stressors. Here, food concentration, temperature, and oxygenation treatments were evaluated for their effects on immune enzymatic parameters of Mytilus galloprovincialis detected in the digestive gland and the lysosomal viability by neutral red uptake. Mussels were exposed to three temperatures (12, 20, and 28 A degrees C) under normoxic (8 mg O(2)l(-1)) and anoxic conditions and specimens were fed with six food concentrations, ranging 0.2-5 g chlorophyll l(-1). Temperature increases affected esterase and alkaline phophatase enzyme functionality, and addition of food buffered detrimental effects generated by harsh conditions, such as those provided by low oxygen concentrations. Kinetics of the phenoloxidase was negatively correlated with increasing temperature. In this case, food had a buffering effect that counteracted the limiting temperature only under normoxic conditions. In addition, the stability of the lysosomal membrane was altered under conditions of thermal stress and food change, under normoxic and anoxic conditions. Overall, environmental stress factors affected immune biomarkers of Mediterranean mussels, and the level of food acted as a buffer, increasing the thermal resistance of the specimens.

AB  - In order to study the response of 56 landraces of confectionery sunflower to drought stress, an experiment was conducted in the experimental field of Agricultural Research Center of West-Azerbaijan in 2012-2013 cropping seasons. The genotypes were evaluated in three separated rectangular 7 x 8 lattice design with two replications in three irrigation treatments including optimum irrigation, moderate stress and sever stress where irrigation was done after depletion of 50%, 70% and 90% of available water, respectively. Nine drought tolerance indices including mean productivity (MP), stress tolerance index (STI), geometric mean productivity (GMP), harmonic mean (HARM), stress non-stress production index (SNPI), yield index (YI), drought resistance index (DI), modified stress tolerance index in optimum irrigation (MpSTI), and modified stress tolerance index in moderate and severe stress (MsSTI) were calculated based on grain yield under well-watered (Y-p), moderate drought stress (Y-s-mild) and severe drought stress (Y-s-severe) conditions. Grain yield in well-watered (Y-P), mild and severe stress conditions was significantly and positively correlated with MP, STI, GMP, HARM, SNPI, YI, DI, MpSTI and MsSTI. Results of this study showed that in moderate drought stress conditions the indices MP, STI, GMP and HARM could be used as the most suitable indicators for screening drought tolerant genotypes. Based on cluster analysis, the studied genotypes were grouped in 3 clusters in each one of water treatment conditions. To select drought tolerant genotypes in severe drought stress conditions, it is suggested to use indices MP, STI, GMP, HARM, SNPI and MsSTI because these indices supports stable and high yield in both non-stress and stress conditions.

AB  - 1. Two forms of multivariate analyses were used to examine the relationship between the condition of Sitka and Norway spruce in Britain and their physical and chemical environment.
   2. The results of gradient analyses (detrended canonical correspondence analysis) were difficult to interpret because extreme values at a limited number of sites significantly affected the results.
   3. Gradients of stand condition from good to poor were generally absent, with identified gradients mostly being from high scores of one response variable to high scores of another. Various different types of pollution were examined, but these showed no clear relationship with stand condition suggesting that air pollution is not a major factor affecting the crown condition of Sitka and Norway spruce in Britain.
   4. Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and discriminant analysis (DISCRIM) were also used. The TWINSPAN was used to distinguish a number of groups of sites for each species on the basis of crown condition.
   5. Most of these groups were associated with combinations of environmental variables although, in many cases, the relationships were unclear. Relationships with pollution variables were identified for six of the eight groups (all four groups for Sitka spruce and two of four groups of Norway spruce). Only one group (Norway spruce, intermediate crown condition) showed an exclusive relationship with one or more pollution variables.
   6. The combined use of TWINSPAN and DISCRIM Offers considerable potential and will be particularly useful for analysing data from monitoring exercises and information collected by large-scale surveys.

AB  - Increasing world population and demand for animal-derived protein puts pressure on animal production to meet this demand. For this purpose animal breeding efforts were conducted to obtain the maximum yield that the genetic makeup of the animals permits. Under the influence of economics which is the driving force behind animal production, animal farming became more concentrated and controlled which resulted in rearing animals under confinement. Since more attention was given on economics and yield per animal, animal welfare and behavior were neglected. Animal welfare which can be defined as providing environmental conditions in which animals can display all their natural behaviors in nature started gaining importance in recent years. This does not necessarily mean that animals provided with good management practices would have better welfare conditions as some animals may be distressed even though they are in good environmental conditions. Consumers are willing to pay more for welfare-friendly products (e.g.: free range vs caged egg) and this will change the animal production practices in the future. Thus animal scientists will have to adapt themselves for the changing animal welfare rules and regulations that differ for farm animal species and countries. In this review paper, animal welfare is discussed from an animal science standpoint. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   persistent free radicals (EPFRs) in soils of past coking sites, mainly contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Measurements of EPFRs were conducted by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique with numerous soil samples, which were collected from different distances (0-1000 m) and different depths (0-30 cm) of three contaminant sources. EPR signals with similar to 3 x 10(17) radicals/g of the soil samples were obtained, which are very similar to that generated in PAHs contaminated clays, that is, g = 2.0028-2.0036. Concentrations of PAHs and soil components were determined to understand their role in producing EPFRs. PAHs, clay, and iron predominately contributed to generating EPRFs. Meanwhile, organic matter negatively influenced the production of EPRFs. The effects of environmental factors (moisture and oxic/anoxic) were also studied to probe the persistency of EPFRs under various simulated conditions. The EPFRs are stable under relatively dry and oxic conditions. Under anoxic conditions without O-2 and H2O, the spin densities decrease initially, followed by gradual increase before attaining constant values in two months period time. The present work implies that continuous formation of EPFRs induced by PAHs is largely responsible for the presence of relatively stable radicals in soils of coking sites.

AB  - Phytoplankton data from 606 lakes were used to characterize indicator taxa of near-pristine reference conditions in clearwater and humic lowland lakes of Northern and Central Europe. Reference lakes were selected based on low pressure from catchment land-use, low population density and the absence of point sources. Reference lakes had low phytoplankton biomass and taxa richness compared to non-reference lakes. In low alkalinity lakes of Northern Europe, the reference communities had high biomass proportions of chrysophytes and low proportions of cyanobacteria; in the Central European high alkalinity lakes, the biomass was distributed more evenly among algal groups. Indicator species analysis and similarity analysis listed 5-29 taxa indicating reference conditions. Indicator taxa differed especially between the low alkalinity and the high alkalinity lakes, but there were also country-specific differences. Most common indicator taxa for the northern reference lakes were chrysophytes (e.g. Bitrichia, Dinobryon). In the Central European reference lakes, diatoms (e.g. Cyclotella) were more characteristic. Despite the differences, there was a general finding that taxa present in reference lakes were often also present in non-reference lakes, but typically in lower biomass proportions; another characteristic of the reference communities is the absence of many taxa typically found in non-reference lakes.

AB  - P-31 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been used to examine in vivo phosphorus metabolism in juvenile sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) from an aquaculture site in Nova Scotia. NMR-visible arginine phosphate (Arg P) concentrations declined from summer to winter whereas inorganic phosphate (P-i) levels increased and those of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) remained relatively constant. Our results indicate that, in the scallop that uses the phosphagen Arg P to replenish ATP, the ratio of Arg P to P-i is a better indicator of energetic status than is the ratio of adenylate concentrations known as adenylate energy charge. Scallops collected in fall and winter, when exposed to hypoxic conditions, showed pronounced decreases in Arg P associated with increases in P-i and decreases in ATP levels whereas these remained relatively unchanged in scallops collected in summer. Scallops maintained under simulated winter conditions showed lower levels of Arg P associated with poor nutrition, and a response to hypoxia similar to field scallops. The marked seasonality in concentrations of phosphorus metabolites emphasizes their potential importance as useful biomarkers in environmental stress assessment and the optimization of hatchery and grow-out conditions.

AB  - Seventy-five heavy-duty public transit buses, including different fuel systems (conventional diesel, natural gas and diesel hybrid), were tested on-road in Beijing using portable emission measurement systems. Second-by-second driving condition data were collected on typical urban bus routes including freeways, arterial roads and residential roads. The average values of distance-specific fuel consumption for diesel buses is 32.6 L 100 km(-1) under a typical bus driving cycle in Beijing (BJBC). Natural gas buses have comparable CO2 emission factors but higher fuel consumption relative to diesel buses. Hybrid diesel buses are capable of reducing CO2 emissions and fuel consumption by 18-29% compared to the Euro IV and Euro V diesel buses over the BJBC. This study quantified the impacts on fuel consumption from other conditions including road type, average speed, load mass, and air conditioning. Average speed is the leading indicator of traffic conditions which affects the on-road fuel use most significantly. If the average bus speed decreases from 25 km h(-1) to 15 km h(-1), fuel consumption is estimated to increase by similar to 20-30% for diesel buses, similar to 30-45% for natural gas buses, and most significantly (similar to 50%) for hybrid diesel buses. In addition, real-world fuel consumption of hybrid diesel buses is observed to be particularly sensitive to operating conditions - when their on-board air conditioning systems are functioning, fuel consumption can be increased by up to 50%.

AB  - Spatial and temporal variability of the microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) was studied in undisturbed soils from various bioclimatic zones. It was found that the qCO(2) value varies between 0.9 and 6.1 mug CCO2-C/mg C-mic per h in soils of different types and ecosystems. The variation coefficient of qCO(2) for soil samples taken from distant locations under similar types of ecosystems (forest. meadow, or cropland) remained below 39%. Temporal variation in qCO(2) in laboratory or natural conditions did not exceed 25%. The qCO(2) value can be used as an indicator of stability of soil as a biological system.

AB  - 1. Condition-dependent expression of ornamental traits is a fundamental assumption of theories on the honesty of sexual signals, and it is widely assumed that condition-dependence is a signature feature of ornaments.
   2. Some of the best understood condition-dependent traits are the striking carotenoid-based plumage signals of male birds, yet little is known about the many less conspicuous, less elaborate carotenoid-based plumage colours that often comprise large parts of the plumage.
   3. We examined colour (reflectance) of carotenoid-based plumage in male greenfinches that were provided with naturalistic diets with relatively low and with enhanced lutein availability during their annual moult. Using a variety of objective colorimetrics, including physiological models of avian colour vision, we compared experimental effects and general condition-dependence on the contrasting bright yellow tail patch, the yellow-green breast as well as three duller, yellow- to olive-green patches (back, crown, rump).
   4. Irrespective of the analysis method used, we found consistent and large diet effects on the reflectance of the tail, much weaker effects on the reflectance of the breast, and no significant effects on the other three plumage parts. Likewise, we found that only the colour of the tail was strongly associated with circulating (plasma) lutein concentration, as well as with general condition (body mass, haematocrit).
   5. Our results suggest that, in accord with current theories on the signal honesty, the striking yellow tail patch of the male greenfinch appears to be particularly well-adapted to signal information on carotenoid availability and general condition of the male during moult.

AB  - A study was carried out in the provinces of Guayas and Los Rios (Ecuador), with the objective of characterizing rice production systems; one under salinity conditions in Yaguachi and the other without salinization problems in the Babahoyo canton. Economic, social and ecological indicators were developed, suitable for the rice systems under study to determine the level of sustainability. The evaluation through indicators allowed to objectively detect critical points in these localities that affect sustainability. In the environmental aspect, the salinity indicator, classified as medium to high risk, and the indicator for the application of agrochemicals, characterized by the intensive use of pesticides and fertilizers, are those that most negatively affect the sustainability, especially, of the rice system in Yaguachi. In the economic dimension, the monoculture system indicator that generates additional income losses and the lack of diversity of products used for sale and food negatively affect the two rice production systems. In the social aspect, the indicators that contribute to greater sustainability were the quality of housing, degree of satisfaction and relationships with other members of the community. The General Sustainability Indices for the two rice production systems in Yaguachi and Babahoyo were 1.92 and 2.12, respectively.

AB  - Plant indicator values are widely used in ecological studies, but they are not well developed for cryptogams, what prevents their application in some environments such as lichen-rich habitats. The aim of this study was to determine the ecological indicator values of terricolous lichens occurring in the Western Carpathians. A total of 271 lichen taxa from the eastern part of Central Europe in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria are listed and evaluated. Their known indicator values for light conditions, climate (temperature, continentality), substratum (humidity, soil reaction-pH, nutrients, eutrophication) were reviewed or modified, and original values were established for taxa with missing information. Besides the traditional ordinal scale, the index of variability was established to distinguish between generalists and specialists in particular applications. Our list further contains important species traits such as ecological strategies (growth and life forms, photobiont type, substrate, reproduction) and geographic values (geographical elements, threat, frequency) allowing applications in functional ecology and macroecology. Our database can be easily associated with widely used software for the analysis of vegetation data allowing the indication of ecological conditions in lichen-rich vegetation types in currently developed large-scale vegetation surveys.

AB  - Explosion energy effective management at cavities creation in the rocks and soil massif in seismic investigation and dynamic pressure action from explosion and an earthquake on constructions demand more strict calculations for defining wave fields tensed-deforming condition. Therefore big attention is paid for development and improvement of drilling-and-blasting works processes by production workers and scientists. Nowadays scientific and practical works are conducted on studying explosive, rocks crushing processes under the external forces influence, in particular, as well as the blown-up mass consequence influence on the environment.
   This scientific work considers research on waves spreading in resilient viscous-plastic layer with cavity based resilient basis under the dynamic pressure from day surface over the cavity.
   This task is solved by "discontinuity disintegration" method of S. K. Godunov. This method advantage is all possible gaps in calculations according to this method are represented closer to real, ones than calculations obtained by artificial viscosity.
   During the task of this research the hyperbolic type of the first order differential equations system has been obtained describing dynamic pressure influence on resilient viscous-plastic layer around the cavity on layer border and elastic basis.
   Obtained numerical solution results can be applied for wave fields assessment, various nature of tension with boundary conditions, designing of various underground constructions.

AB  - Indicators of hydrologic alteration and the range of variability approach were used to assess the effects of river regulation on the hydrology of the River Murray in South Australia. Two simulated data sets derived from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's MSM-Bigmod model were compared for the period of 1895-2009. The first scenario assumed that levels of extraction and diversion as of July 2009 (present) were applicable for the entire period. The second assumed that there were no water extractions or regulatory structures and the system was natural. Whilst the natural cycle of a single yearly high flow pulse was largely preserved, lower flow pulses were more prevalent and of longer duration under present conditions, whilst high pulses were less frequent and of shorter duration. Flow variability had increased during times of high flow, and decreased during times of low flow. The difference between natural and present conditions was more severe in the summer and autumn than the winter and spring. Under the present scenario low flows occurred around two months later in the year, whilst high flows occurred slightly less than one month earlier than under natural conditions. These results can guide the design of environmental flows for the river.

AB  - In the biggest and the most polluted (due to traffic agglomeration and other diffuse sources) city from Romania, Bucharest, the city centre presents an increased air and soil pollution. In situ researches (passive methods) have been applied in the central parks due to their different structural diversity and position in the most polluted area of the city. The researches show the present species from Park and help to establish their potential as biomonitors/bioindicators of pollutants in the terrestrial environment. Biological data are used to estimate the environmental impact and potential impact on other organisms including humans.

AB  - This article investigates the climatic response of a series of indicators for characterizing annual snow conditions and corresponding meteorological drivers at 1500m altitude in the Chartreuse mountain range in the Northern French Alps. Past and future changes were computed based on reanalysis and observations from 1958 to 2016, and using CMIP5-EURO-CORDEX GCM-RCM pairs spanning historical (1950-2005) and RCP2.6 (4), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (13 each) future scenarios (2006-2100). The adjusted climate model runs were used to drive the multiphysics ensemble configuration of the detailed snowpack model Crocus. Uncertainty arising from physical modeling of snow accounts for 20% typically, although the multiphysics is likely to have a much smaller impact on trends. Ensembles of climate projections are rather similar until the middle of the 21st century, and all show a continuation of the ongoing reduction in average snow conditions, and sustained interannual variability. The impact of the RCPs becomes significant for the second half of the 21st century, with overall stable conditions with RCP2.6, and continued degradation of snow conditions for RCP4.5 and 8.5, the latter leading to more frequent ephemeral snow conditions. Changes in local meteorological and snow conditions show significant correlation with global temperature changes. Global temperature levels 1.5 and 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels correspond to a 25 and 32% reduction, respectively, of winter mean snow depth with respect to the reference period 1986-2005. Larger reduction rates are expected for global temperature levels exceeding 2 degrees C. The method can address other geographical areas and sectorial indicators, in the field of water resources, mountain tourism or natural hazards.

AB  - The paper presents an assessment of the ecological potential of the Sola river based on the benthic macroinvertebrates and diatomaceous phytobenthos, according to the principles of the Water Framework Directive. The calculated values of Multimetric Diatom Index (IO) indicated class II of ecological potential, while the Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index (MMI_PL) - class III. The final classification of biological, physicochemical and hydromorphological elements showed that the examined section of the Sola river represents a moderate ecological potential which indicates a moderate disruption in the functioning of the water ecosystem as well as a violation of the hydrological regime and morphological conditions of the riverbed.

AB  - Certain phenotypic changes originally induced by direct environmental effects (which can be modelled experimentally) and later reflected by corresponding changes in the genotype (revealed by differences in the reaction of individuals from different populations under the same environmental conditions) highlight one of the main trends in microevolutionary processes. During that process, a decrease of initially increased levels of stochastic variation marks the stabilisation of development in a new environment as a change in optimal developmental conditions.
   Concordance of interpopulation phenotypic differences with experimentally established dependence on developmental conditions and climatic conditions within habitats signifies the role of environment (by replacing the modification response within the limits of the reaction norm with a corresponding change in the reaction norm). Disturbances of this concordance suggest that some traits of microphylogenesis are playing a role.

AB  - This paper describes how to develop a composite index and how to use it to identify broadscale trends in sustainable forest management. The core issue is developing a composite measure from selected indicators of ecosystem conditions that captures the essence of the public's notions about environmental values and can be developed from existing data or by using existing data to develop proxies for key variables (indicators). This process reveals insights about the compatible nature of changes in both the composite measure and measures of socioeconomic progress. These insights suggest that there are opportunities for science to provide concise information that better informs policy or management decisions. Published by Elsevier B.V

AB  - Biochar is one of the most affordable negative emission technologies (NET) at hand for future large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which is typically found essential to stabilizing global temperature rise at relatively low levels. Biochar has also attracted attention as a soil amendment capable of improving yield and soil quality and of reducing soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this work, we review the literature on biochar production potential and its effects on climate, food security, ecosystems, and toxicity. We identify three key factors that are largely affecting the environmental performance of biochar application to agricultural soils: (1) production condition during pyrolysis, (2) soil conditions and background climate, and (3) field management of biochar. Biochar production using only forest or crop residues can achieve up to 10% of the required CDR for 1.5 degrees C pathways and about 25% for 2 degrees C pathways; the consideration of dedicated crops as biochar feedstocks increases the CDR potential up to 15-35% and 35-50%, respectively. A quantitative review of life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies of biochar systems shows that the total climate change assessment of biochar ranges between a net emission of 0.04 tCO2eq and a net reduction of 1.67 tCO2eq per tonnes feedstock. The wide range of values is due to different assumptions in the LCA studies, such as type of feedstock, biochar stability in soils, soil emissions, substitution effects, and methodological issues. Potential trade-offs between climate mitigation and other environmental impact categories include particulate matter, acidification, and eutrophication and mostly depend on the background energy system considered and on whether residues or dedicated feedstocks are used for biochar production. Overall, our review finds that biochar in soils presents relatively low risks in terms of negative environmental impacts and can improve soil quality and that decisions regarding feedstock mix and pyrolysis conditions can be optimized to maximize climate benefits and to reduce trade-offs under different soil conditions. However, more knowledge on the fate of biochar in freshwater systems and as black carbon emissions is required, as they represent potential negative consequences for climate and toxicity. Biochar systems also interact with the climate through many complex mechanisms (i.e., surface albedo, black carbon emissions from soils, etc.) or with water bodies through leaching of nutrients. These effects are complex and the lack of simplified metrics and approaches prevents their routine inclusion in environmental assessment studies. Specific emission factors produced from more sophisticated climate and ecosystem models are instrumental to increasing the resolution and accuracy of environmental sustainability analysis of biochar systems and can ultimately improve the characterization of the heterogeneities of varying local conditions and combinations of type feedstock, conversion process, soil conditions, and application practice.

AB  - The conditioning of room air in summer is widely practiced. However many operators do not have an overall quantitative strategy for minimizing energy. Widespread practice is to simply use on-off, that is, have air conditioning-on when a room is occupied, and conditioning-off, when un-occupied. Here we apply the probabilistic Fr 13 risk framework (Chem. Eng. Sci. 152 (2016) 213-226) for the first time to take account of naturally occurring fluctuations in daily ambient peak temperature (T-o), occupancy rates (L-T) and room traffic inflow and outflows (n) in a typical (hotel) room fitted with heat-attenuating curtains in the hot and dry clime of South Eastern Australia (latitude -37.819708, longitude 144.959936). We use this to synthesise an extended steady-state unit-operations model and assess the two energy strategies for conditioning of the room air to a widely used auto-set bulk temperature of 22 degrees C. It was assumed the impact on overall energy demand from room lighting and refrigerator and occupant metabolism was negligible. We show incident radiative energy will be significant, and using historical ambient temperature fluctuations and occupancy rates, that adoption of the alternative on-only continuous conditioning would use less energy in 93.6% of summer days, based on an overall commercially viable L-T = 75% with the minimum possible room traffic flow of n = 1. Practically, this equates to six (6) only failures of this alternative energy strategy in the 90 days of summer. Importantly, the probabilistic Fr 13 framework permits a practical design for larger-scale quantitative testing of the proposed strategy. A preliminary 10-day 'proof-of-concept' trial showed energy savings of 18.9% (AUD $2.23 per suite (paired-room) per day) with a concomitant 20.7% reduction in GHG. Findings will be of immediate interest and benefit to operators and managers of large buildings that rely on conditioning of dry air in summer. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the integrated traffic environment, human factor is always a main factor of the three elementary factors, besides the vehicle and road factor. The driver physiological and psychological characteristics have an important impact especially on traffic safety in urban road traffic conditions. Some typical traffic scenes in condition of urban road, such as light signal control at intersection, overtaking, and passing, are selected for condition analysis. An eye movement apparatus was used to obtain driver eye closure, blink frequency, and other visual physiological indicators in the traffic conditions of urban road. The regular patterns of driver visual characteristics in the corresponding scenes were analyzed in detail to provide data and theoretical support for the further research on traffic safety of urban environment from the viewpoint of driver psychology and behavior.

AB  - Assessments of radiological impacts on humans and other biota from potential releases to the biosphere from a deep geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel are associated with several challenges. Releases, if any, will likely occur in a far future and to an environment that will have experienced substantial transformations. Such releases would occur over very long periods during which environmental conditions will vary continuously due to climate change and ecosystem succession. Assessments of radiological impacts must therefore be based on simulations using models that can describe the transport and accumulation of radionuclides for a large variety of environmental conditions. In this paper we describe such a model and show examples of its application in a safety assessment, taking into account results from sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the model predictions.

AB  - Drought is one of the most important abiotic stresses that adversely affect plant growth and productivity. Drought regulates a multitude of biochemical and physiological processes in plant system. It is necessary to understand the traits associated for identifying drought-resilient sorghum lines. A field experiment was conducted with 20 rabi sorghum genotypes to study the variation in physiological and key root traits that contribute the drought tolerance under irrigated and stress conditions. Genotypes, Phule Anuradha and RSV 2145 recorded early flowering (68 and 69 days, respectively) under the stress condition, while both STG 25 and RSV 2145 recorded 108 days for physiological maturity. Genotype RV 48 recorded significantly higher leaf area (1355 cm(2)) and leaf area index (2.01) than check M 35-1 (1288 cm(2) and 1.90, respectively) under the stress condition. The maximum relative leaf water status was recorded in M 35-1 (84.40%) under the stress condition, an indicator of wider adaptability. Genotypes CRS 67 and STG 44 recorded higher root length (56 cm and 55 cm, respectively) compared to check M 35-1 (40.67 cm) under the stress condition reflecting that root length helps in absorption of water from deep ground level. Root volume was significantly higher in Phule Suchitra and STG 21 (7.56 cm(3) and 6.30 cm(3), respectively) under the stress condition. The root dry matter was more in Phule Suchitra (8.83 g) followed by CRS 67 (7.73 g) and M-35-1 (5.03 g) under the irrigated condition. Under stress, M 35-1 recorded significantly higher root biomass (4.06 g) followed by STG 44 (3.78 g). The grain yield was maximum in Phule Suchitra (80.00 g) followed by Phule Anuradha (64.00 g) under the stress condition. The experiment concluded that the root traits indicate the adaptability of the genotypes for drought condition, and CRS 67, Phule Suchitra and STG 44 with higher root traits can further be used in the breeding programs for drought tolerance. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the role of physiological traits and root architecture development are key factors in understanding the interplay of drought stress.

AB  - 1. Stream ecosystem health monitoring and reporting need to be developed in the context of an adaptive process that is clearly linked to identified values and objectives, is informed by rigorous science, guides management actions and is responsive to changing perceptions and values of stakeholders. To be effective, monitoring programmes also need to be underpinned by an understanding of the probable causal factors that influence the condition or health of important environmental assets and values. This is often difficult in stream and river ecosystems where multiple stressors, acting at different spatial and temporal scales, interact to affect water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem processes.
   2. In this article, we describe the development of a freshwater monitoring programme in South East Queensland, Australia, and how this has been used to report on ecosystem health at a regional scale and to guide investments in catchment protection and rehabilitation. We also discuss some of the emerging science needs to identify the appropriate scale and spatial arrangement of rehabilitation to maximise river ecosystem health outcomes and, at the same time, derive other benefits downstream.
   3. An objective process was used to identify potential indicators of stream ecosystem health and then test these across a known catchment land-use disturbance gradient. From the 75 indicators initially tested, 22 from five indicator groups (water quality, ecosystem metabolism, nutrient cycling, invertebrates and fish) responded strongly to the disturbance gradient, and 16 were subsequently recommended for inclusion in the monitoring programme. The freshwater monitoring programme was implemented in 2002, funded by local and State government authorities, and currently involves the assessment of over 120 sites, twice per year. This information, together with data from a similar programme on the region's estuarine and coastal marine waters, forms the basis of an annual report card that is presented in a public ceremony to local politicians and the broader community.
   4. Several key lessons from the SEQ Healthy Waterways Programme are likely to be transferable to other regional programmes aimed at improving aquatic ecosystem health, including the importance of a shared common vision, the involvement of committed individuals, a cooperative approach, the need for defensible science and effective communication.
   5. Thematic implications: this study highlights the use of conceptual models and objective testing of potential indicators against a known disturbance gradient to develop a freshwater ecosystem health monitoring programme that can diagnose the probable causes of degradation from multiple stressors and identify the appropriate spatial scale for rehabilitation or protection. This approach can lead to more targeted management investments in catchment protection and rehabilitation, greater public confidence that limited funds are being well spent and better outcomes for stream and river ecosystem health.

AB  - Based on the investigation of the water environment factors and aquatic biodiversity of AiYi River from March to November 2018, 14 indicators were selected from water environment factors and aquatic biodiversity index using principal component analysis to construct the evaluation index system of aquatic ecosystem health of AiYi River. The gray correlative degree method was also used to evaluate the aquatic ecosystem's health condition of AiYi River from March to November 2018. The result showed that the aquatic ecosystem health condition of AiYi River was healthy in March and November, and that was sub-health in May, July, September. The aquatic ecosystem health of AiYi River was in the subhealth state due to the higher content of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter.

Digestion of samples for heavy metals fom sediment samples and the plant is done using the microwave method and determination of metals was done by atomic absorption method. Results of the analysis showed that metals were present in the sediment and plant samples at higher values than those found in natural conditions, suggesting contamination with heavy metals shores of the lake from anthropological sources. From the concentration of the metals found in plants taken as bioindicator it was observed that at the same growth conditions for plants under consideration, they represented equal cumulative properties.

AB  - High-resolution diatom analysis was carried out to assess the limnological and climatic changes that took place at Ribains maar (French Massif Central) during the Late Pleistocene (similar to 131-similar to 105 ka BP), with a focus on the Eemian interglacial in particular. Numerical analyses were used to show that most of the variability in the fossil diatom assemblages was due to climate independently from the changes in the lake catchment vegetation (as represented by pollen data). Diatom-based quantitative reconstructions of the past limnological conditions, as well as a comprehensive literature review on the auto-ecological requirements for the principal diatom taxa, were used to interpret the record. An absolute time-scale for the sequence was derived by matching the major pollen shifts with the radiometrically dated changes in oxygen isotopes observed in Italian stalagmites. This study shows that at Ribains maar, the transition from the Riss (= Saalian) Glacial to the Eemian interglacial was marked by a gradual increase in the contribution of spring-blooming diatom species, indicating a longer growing season and milder winter/spring conditions Lit that time. A short cooling event interrupts this trend and may correspond to a stadial. At the start of the Eemian a peak in benthic taxa and the suppression of spring-blooming flora probably reflects the effects of deglaciation on the catchment. During the Eemian interglacial itself three main phases were distinguished within the diatom record. The first phase (similar to 8000 years in duration) was dominated by Stephanodiscus minutulus, which suggests that intense mixing in the water-column took place during spring. The pollen record was simultaneously dominated by Quercus and Corylus that typify this phase as the climatic optimum of the Eemian. The second phase, almost equal in duration to the first phase (similar to 7000 years), is generally dominated by Cyclotella taxa and suggests a less productive lake and much reduced period of spring mixing compared with the first phase. In the pollen diagram this corresponds to an interval dominated by Carpinus-Picea-Abies that indicates a cooler and wetter climate. The third and last phase of the Eemian, similar to 2000 year long, saw the return to Stephanodiscus-dominated assemblages, indicating a warming that may correspond to the Dansgaard-Oeschger event 25 identified in the Greenland ice-core record. In the early stage of the Wurm Glacial (= Weichselian), assemblages in the Melisey I stadial (similar to 3000 year long) were dominated by either Aulacoseira subarctica or Asterionella formosa, which Suggest colder spring conditions than during the late Eemian, but not as cold as the ones indicated by the pollen record. Stephanodiscus spp. again dominate during the Saint-Germain Ia interstadial (similar to 5000 year long) suggesting a return to the conditions that prevailed before the Melisey stadial, in agreement with the pollen record. The record ends with the Montaigu cold event, which is characterised by a. Pinus peak in the pollen record, and corresponds to a large abundance of A. subarctica in the diatom sequence. Throughout the Eemian the abundance of Stephanodiscus spp., which is thought to be driven by winter conditions, show cyclic fluctuations that most likely match the cooling events identified in a pollen record from Germany. Variation in insolation throughout the Eemian may have been the driving factor behind the species succession observed in the diatom sequence.
   While this study demonstrates that diatom analysis of lake sediment can provide very detailed information n long-term climate change, a review of the few other diatom investigations published on European Eemian deposits shows that this technique has been so far seldom used to its full potential in this context in central and southern Europe.

AB  - Changes in the trophic status and moistening of oligotrophic peat soils subjected to oil pollution and subsequent reclamation in the middle reaches of the Ob River are discussed. The main plants-indicators are listed. Numerical estimates of the trophic level and the degree of moistening of natural and transformed soils of the widespread bog biogeocenoses-pine-dwarf-shrub-sphagnum, complex ridged-hollow, and cotton grass-sphagnum bogs-are suggested on the basis of the ecological scales developed by L.G. Ramenskii. These estimates have been grouped into several classes used to describe the ecological conditions in natural biogeocenoses of the middle taiga subzone. The main tendencies in the transformation of ecological conditions are revealed. Indicative characteristics of the anthropogenic salinization of peat soils are established.

Biomolecules isolated from extremophiles possess extraordinary properties and, in particular, proteins isolated from extremophiles represent unique biomolecules that function under severe conditions, comparable to those prevailing in various industrial processes. In this article, we will review some examples of recent applications of thermophilic proteins for the development of a new class of fluorescence non-consuming substrate biosensors for monitoring the levels of two analytes of high social interest, such as glucose and sodium.

AB  - The nitrification denirtification wastewater treatment processes have been studied in laboratory conditions, using a system of two completely mixed reactors and a secondary clarifier. Wastewater and activated sludge were taken from the Sofia Wastewater Treatment Plant (Sofia WWTP). Four steady states, differing in sludge age were investigated. For each steady state microbiological and biochemical analyses were carried out. The aim of the study was to establish the reliable bioindicator for assessment and management of the nitrogen removal processes. The amount of the more important physiological groups of microorganisms varies insignificantly in the four steady states whereas the dehydrogenase activity corresponds closely to the organic substrate utilization Irate in anoxic conditions. These results confirm the expected conservatism of the microbiological structural indicators, on the one hand, and the possibility of using the dehydrogenase activity as a reliable biological indicator, on the other hand.

AB  - Many people live, work and spend time during their commute in near-road environments (< 50 m) where pollutant concentrations usually remain high. We investigated the influence of roadside green infrastructure (GI) on concentrations of particulate matters <= 10 mu m (PM10), <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), <= 1 mu m (PM1), black carbon (BC) and particle number concentrations (PNC) under three GI configurations - (i) hedges only, (ii) trees only, and (iii) a mix of trees and hedges/shrubs-separately in close (< 1 m) and away (> 2 m) road conditions. These configurations gave us a total of six different real-world scenarios for evaluation. The changes in concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, PM1, BC and PNC at all six sites were estimated by comparing simultaneous measurements behind and in front of GI (or adjacent clear area). A portable battery-operated experimental set-up was designed for measuring the pollutant concentrations for 30 full days over a field campaign period of three months. On each day, around 10 h of continuous data were recorded simultaneously behind and in front of GI/adjacent clear area, capturing both morning and evening traffic peaks. Our objectives were to: (i) assess the effectiveness of different types of GI in reducing various pollutants; (ii) evaluate the impact of wind directions and density of vegetation on reducing different pollutant concentrations behind GI; (iii) investigate the changes in fractional composition of sub-micron (PM1), fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10) particles; and (iv) quantify the elemental composition of collected particles before and after the GI. In away-road conditions, all three configurations showed reductions behind the GI for all pollutants. The 'hedges only' configuration showed higher pollutant reductions than the other two configurations, with maximum reductions of up to 63% shown for BC. In close-road conditions, the results were mixed. The 'trees only' configuration reported increases in most of the pollutant concentrations, whereas the combination of trees and hedges resulted in reduced pollutant concentrations behind the GI. Among all pollutants, the highest relative changes in concentration were observed for BC (up to 63%) and lowest for PM2.5 (14%). Categorising the data based on wind directions showed the highest reduction during along-road wind conditions (i.e., parallel to the road). This was expected due to the sweeping of emissions by the wind and the wake of road vehicles whilst the barrier effect of GI enhanced this cleansing, limiting lateral diffusion of the pollutants. However, cross-road winds that took vehicular emissions to pass through the GI allowed us to assess their influence, showing up to 52, 15, 17, 31 and 30% reduction for BC, PM10, PM2.5, PM1 and PNC, respectively. The largest reductions were consistently noted for the mixed 'trees and hedges' configuration in close-road conditions and the 'hedge only' configuration in away-road conditions. The assessment of various fractions of PM showed that 'hedges only' and a combination of trees and hedges lowered fine particles behind GI. The SEM-EDS analysis indicated the dominance of natural particles (50%) and a reduction in vehicle-related particles (i.e., iron and its oxides, Ba, Cr, Mn) behind GI when compared with the in-front/adjacent clear area.
   The evidence contributed by this work enhances our understanding of air quality modifications under the influence of different GI configurations, for multiple pollutants. In turn, this will support the formulation of appropriate guidelines for GI design, to reduce the air pollution exposure of those living, working or travelling near busy roads.

AB  - The capability of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in accommodating deformation is critical to the electrode integrity. However, the nanoscale thickness and environmental sensitivity of SEI make it challenging to characterize multiple mechanical parameters and identify an appropriate predictor for such capability. Here, we develop a feasible atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based nanoindentation test that circumvents the interference of the anode substrate and allows accurate probing of Young's modulus and elastic strain limit of SEI, The "maximum elastic deformation energy" (U) that an SEI can absorb is proposed to predict the stability of the SEI, as successfully demonstrated in Li/K metal anodes. We show that another asset of U is to provide a rapid and effective means to screen proper electrolytes for the stabilization of Sn and Sb microparticle anodes through building high-U SEIs. Overall, this new indicator, U, offers future directions toward rational design of robust SEIs for advanced anodes.

AB  - The research presents the application of fuzzy logic for synthetic evaluation of strategies for working capital management of twelve food companies from Northern Europe in 2005-2015. A set of financial ratios formed an aggregated indicator reflecting the complexity of relationships between the level and structure of current assets and liabilities of a firm. Based on the proposed indicator, four types of strategies for working capital management were identified and characterized in terms of risk and return preferences. Only a few companies from the sample demonstrated a direct orientation on liquidity or value within their strategies for working capital management. To retain flexibility in short-term financial management, most firms applied moderate policies for current assets and liabilities that helped them in maintaining liquidity and reducing the cost of financing. The integrity of the proposed method for the synthetic evaluation of working capital management makes it a convenient managerial tool suitable for use in firms operating in a turbulent business environment.

AB  - Salinization of soils is one of the main sources of soil degradation worldwide, particularly in arid and semiarid ecosystems. High salinity results in osmotic stress and it can negatively impact plant grow and survival. Some plant species, however, can tolerate salinity by accumulating osmolytes like proline and maintaining low Na+ concentrations inside the cells. Another mechanism of saline stress tolerance is the association with symbiotic microorganism, an alternative that can be used as a biotechnological tool in susceptible crops. From the immense diversity of plant symbionts, those found in extreme environments such as Antarctica seems to be the ones with most potential since they (and their host) evolved in harsh and stressful conditions. We evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a consortium of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPB) and endosymbiotic fungi isolated from an Antarctic plant on saline stress tolerance in different crops. To test this we established 4 treatments: (i) uninoculated plants with no saline stress, (ii) uninoculated plants subjected to saline stress (200 mM NaCl), (iii) plants inoculated with the microorganism consortium with no saline stress, and (iv) inoculated plants subjected to saline stress. First, we assessed the effect of symbiont consortium on survival of four different crops (cayenne, lettuce, onion, and tomato) in order to obtain a more generalized response of this biological interaction. Second, in order to deeply the mechanisms involved in salt tolerance, in lettuce plants we measured the ecophysiological performance (F-v/F-m) and lipid peroxidation to estimate the impact of saline stress on plants. We also measured proline accumulation and NHX1 antiporter gene expression (involved in Na+ detoxification) to search for possible mechanism of stress tolerance. Additionally, root, shoot, and total biomass was also obtained as an indicator of productivity. Overall, plants inoculated with microorganisms from Antarctica increased the fitness related traits in several crops. In fact, three of four crops selected to assess the general response increased its survival under salt conditions compared with those uninoculated plants. On the other hand, saline stress negatively impacted all measured trait, but inoculated plants were significantly less affected. In control osmotic conditions, there were no differences in proline accumulation and lipid peroxidation between inoculation treatments. Interestingly, even in control salinity, F-v/F-m was higher in inoculated plants after 30 and 60 days. Under osmotic stress, F-v/F-m, proline accumulation and NHX1 expression was significantly higher and lipid peroxidation lower in inoculated plants compared to uninoculated individuals. Moreover, inoculated plants exposed to saline stress had a similar final biomass (whole plant) compared to individuals under no stress. We conclude that Antarctic extremophiles can effectively reduce the physiological impact of saline stress in a salt-susceptible crops and also highlight extreme environments such as Antarctica as a key source of microorganism with high biotechnological potential.

AB  - Urban air pollution is one of the most important environmental problems. Lichens are good bioindicators in air pollution studies because of their dependence on the atmospheric deposition for nutrition. The present study focused on the effects of urbanization on the composition of atmospheric deposition inputs and physiological parameters of transplanted epiphytic lichen Ramalina farinacea. The status of lichens responded to urban pollutants related to vehicle and industrial activity (NO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, NO2, PM10). The content of chlorophyll and F-V/F-M were positively related to the amount of precipitation (mm) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The increase in lipid peroxidation and electrolyte conductivity, indicating damage to the cell membrane, was found in lichens transplanted to the urban environment. The high variability in electrolyte conductivity indicated that cell membrane injuries were characteristics of the investigated study area.

AB  - Colonial cell disaggregation and release of intracellular microcystin were evaluated following chlorine treatment of naturally occurring Microcystis. Microscopic observations of water samples collected from Lake Mead, Nevada, USA, confirmed the presence of colonial Microcystis with cells protected by an outer sheath up to 30 mu m thick. During chlorination, two stages of cell decomposition were observed, stage 1: colonial cell disaggregation, and stage 2: unicellular degradation. Following a [Cl-2 ](0:)DOC0 ratio of 0.15 (t = 20 min, pH = 8.2-8.5) in unfiltered Lake Havasu samples, total particle count increased from (1.0 +/- 0.11) x 10(5) to 4.2 x 10(5) particles/mL and fluorescent particle count increased from (1.2 +/- 0.50) x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(5) particles/mL, illustrating colonial cell disaggregation. Although total and fluorescent particles increased, the concentration of chlorophyll -a (Chl-a) decreased from 81 mu g/L to 72 mu g/L, and continued to decrease at higher [Cl-2](0):DOC0 ratios. The preliminary second order rate constant for the reaction between Microcystis and chlorine in natural waters was estimated using either Chl-a (k = 15 M-1 s(-1)) or fluorescence particle count (k = 38 M-1 s(-1)) as an indicator of cell damage following colonial disaggregation (i.e., at [Cl-2](0):DOC0 ratio >= 0.15). Complete release of intracellular microcystin-LR (MC-LR) was observed in both Lake Havasu and Lake Mead samples when applying a [Cl-2](0):DOC0 ratio of 0.30 (t = 20 min), which was equivalent to a chlorine exposure of 8 min-mg/L for Lake Havasu samples. With chlorination, DOC increased by 3-18% indicating release of either colony bound or cell -bound DOC. The results demonstrated the ability of chlorine to disaggregate/inactivate natural Microcystis colonies, and identified oxidation conditions resulting in complete release of intracellular MC-LR.

AB  - The status of sardine and anchovy populations in the northern Mediterranean Sea has been declining in recent decades. In this study, fatty acids and parasitism at different reproductive and feeding stages in these two species were assessed using specimens caught along the northern Catalan coast, in order to assess the links between lipid dynamics, reproduction and feeding in these two species and to contribute towards an explanation of the potential causes of the current poor situation of the stocks. The results support the use of fatty acid levels as indicators of the body condition of sardine and anchovy at different reproductive and feeding stages, as well as that of the pelagic environmental conditions. In particular, the relatively low n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels found in spawning sardines compared to spawning anchovies indicate a poorer reproductive health status of sardine. By comparing the current total lipid content values with those recorded in other Mediterranean and North Atlantic areas, and others from more than 10 years ago, in the adjacent area of the Gulf of Lion, our study reveals the persistent poor condition of sardine and anchovy in the northern Catalan Sea. Furthermore, the low levels of diatom fatty acid markers observed throughout the spawning and non-spawning seasons in both sardine and anchovy indicate a diet poor in diatoms. Moreover, the results indicate that it is very unlikely that parasitism is a significant factor in the decline in condition of sardine and anchovy in the northern Catalan Sea. In fact, the results, which we believe provide useful insights for the management of small pelagic fisheries in the Mediterranean, suggest that the current poor condition of sardine and anchovy in the northern Catalan Sea has probably been exacerbated by a decrease in plankton productivity and/or a shift in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton communities, adding to the ongoing effects of overfishing.

AB  - Widespread marine anoxia is considered one of the most important causes for the mid-Capitanian mass extinction. However, the mechanisms and subsequent sulfidic process for the mid-Capitanian mass extinction are still debated. Here, we focus on a comprehensive study including marine productivity and redox conditions of the Lower Yangtze area across the mid-Capitanian mass extinction based on multiple geochemical indicators. Our results show that the redox conditions and marine productivity have gone through three stages. The pre-extinction early-middle Capitanian is characterized by anoxic conditions with intermittent euxinic episodes and moderate-high productivity, whereas the middle Capitanian is dominated by stronger euxinic conditions and higher productivity. Subsequently, an oxic shallow water environment and low productivity are recognized by significant decreases in all of these geochemical indicators across the mid-Capitanian. The appearance and development of the anoxic-euxinic conditions was probably caused by high productivity related to enhanced upwelling, which led to the intensified heterotrophic respiration and subsequent oxygen-depletion of the water column. More sluggish oceanic circulation that resulted from the global warming associated with the eruption of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province and upward movement of the chemocline due to great regression also further exacerbated the euxinic conditions during the middle Capitanian. The development of these euxinic conditions may have played a major role in triggering the super-anoxic ocean and is also coincident with the mid-Capitanian biotic crisis, which suggests the possible causal link between them. With comprehensive analysis of profiles across the globe, sulfidic models showing that the sulfidic water first occurred in the deep water during the early-middle Capitanian and shoaled to shallow water in the middle-late Capitanian could be established, despite the fact that the temporally and spatially heterogeneous sulfidic processes in the late Guadalupian are still debated.

AB  - Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is identified as an important instrument for facilitating environmental protection and sustainable development. However, since its emergence there has been a growing interest in examining its translation from theory into practice. This paper reviews the translation of mitigation measures proposed in environmental impact statements (EISs) into planning conditions at two platinum mining and processing projects along the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe. By comparing mitigation measures proposed in EISs and those included in environmental management plans (EMPs), examining views of environmental managers and local residents, as well as field observations the mitigation implementation status is verified and evaluated. Results show that 52% of mitigation measures proposed in EISs and mostly procedural are translated into planning conditions. Residents near the platinum processing plant were not satisfied with the mitigation of sulphur dioxide, dust and noise impacts on their health. The need to incorporate and enforce substantive mitigation measures in EISs and planning conditions is recommended for the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most methods for condition monitoring are based on the analysis and characterization of physical quantities that are three-dimensional in nature. Plotted in a three-dimensional Euclidian space as a function of time, such quantities follow a trajectory whose geometric characteristics are representative of the state of the monitored system. Usual condition monitoring techniques often study the measured quantities component by component, without taking into account their three-dimensional nature and the geometric properties of their trajectory. A significant part of the information is thus ignored. This article details a method dedicated to the analysis and processing of three-component quantities, capable of highlighting the special geometric features of such data and providing complementary information for condition monitoring. The proposed method is applied to two experimental cases: bearing fault monitoring in rotating machines, and voltage dips monitoring in three-phase power networks. In this two cases, the obtained results are promising and show that the estimated geometric indicators lead to complementary information that can be useful for condition monitoring.

AB  - Quantifying dieback in forests is useful for land managers and decision makers seeking to explain spatial disturbances and understand the cyclic nature of forest health. Crown condition is assessed as reference to dieback in terms of the density, transparency, extent and in-crown distribution of foliage. At 20 sites in the Yalgorup National Park, Western Australia, a total of 80 Eucalyptus gomphocephala crowns were assessed both in situ (2008) and using two acquisitions (2008 and 2010) of airborne imagery. Each tree was assessed using four crown-condition indices: Crown Density, Foliage Transparency, the Crown Dieback Ratio and Epicormic Index combined into a single index called the Total Crown Health Index (TCHI). The airborne imagery is like value calibrated then classified and modelled using in situ canopy condition assessments resulting in a quantification of crown-condition change over time. Comparison of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and a novel Red-Edge Extrema Index (REEI) suggests that the latter is more suited to classification applications of this type.

AB  - The Cretaceous black shales of Colombia are among the most important successions in the north of South America and have attracted the attention of many geoscientists and exploration companies over the last few decades, because of their high hydrocarbon potential and the presence of emerald deposits. However, many uncertainties still remain with regard to their tectonic setting, sequence stratigraphy, depositional environments, palaeoxygenation conditions, and organic matter preservation. In order to develop a more integrated picture of these different processes and conditions, we conducted a detailed sedimentological, inorganic geochemical (U, V, Ni, Zn, Mn, Fe, Ti, Mo, Cu, Cr, Cd, Ba) and sequence stratigraphic analysis of the Cretaceous black shales in the Magdalena-Tablazo Sub-Basin (Eastern Cordillera Basin) of Colombia. Eleven lithofacies and five lithofacies associations of a storm-dominated, siliciclastic-carbonate ramp were identified, which range from basin to shallow inner ramp environments. These facies were grouped into six third-order stratigraphic sequences showing high-order cycles of marine transgression with constrained regressive pulses during the late Valanginian to early Coniacian. The black shales succession represents deposition under anoxic bottom water with some intervals representing dysoxic-suboxic conditions. The evolution of the sedimentary environments and their palaeoxygenation history reflect tectonic and eustatic sea-level controls that 1) produced a variable orientation and position of the coastline throughout the Cretaceous; 2) conditioned the low-gradient ramp geometry (<0.3 degrees) and 3) modified the oxygenation conditions in the Magdalena-Tablazo Sub-Basin. An improved understanding of the sedimentary setting during deposition of the Cretaceous black shales in the Magdalena-Tablazo Sub-Basin assists in highlighting the interplay between the mechanism of sedimentation and continuum anoxic conditions prevailing in a basin, as well the important role of nutrient input from continental runoff as a trigger of high productivity and extended anoxia conditions.

AB  - Profiles of genome-wide transcriptional events for a given environmental condition can be of importance in the diagnosis of poorly defined environments. To identify clusters of genes constituting such diagnostic profiles, we characterized the specific transcriptional responses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to growth limitation by carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur. Microarray experiments were performed using cells growing in steady-state conditions in chemostat cultures at the same dilution rate. This enabled us to study the effects of one particular limitation while other growth parameters (pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen tension) remained constant. Furthermore, the composition of the media fed to the cultures was altered so that the concentrations of excess nutrients were comparable between experimental conditions. In total, 1881 transcripts (31% of the annotated genome) were significantly changed between at least two growth conditions. Of those, 484 were significantly higher or lower in one limitation only. The functional annotations of these genes indicated cellular metabolism was altered to meet the growth requirements for nutrient-limited growth. Furthermore, we identified responses for several active transcription factors with a role in nutrient assimilation. Finally, 51 genes were identified that showed 10-fold higher or lower expression in a single condition only. The transcription of these genes can be used as indicators for the characterization of nutrient-limited growth conditions and provide information for metabolic engineering strategies.

AB  - Excised-leaf water loss from excised leaves of 30 wheat cultivars was determined under irrigated and drought stressed conditions. It was then related to the drought response index characterised by comparing grain yield under irrigated and drought stress conditions. The water loss has been found to be an indicator of drought resistance and considerable genetic differences existed for this easily determinable trait at tillering and anthesis stages of plant growth. The drought response index had stronger associations with water loss under drought conditions which indicated that varieties showing less water loss also contributed to drought resistance. The cultivars C 306 and RL 7 had low water loss at both tillering and anthesis stages of plant growth and had high yield under drought stress conditions.

AB  - Nitrification is considered to be a relatively sensitive indicator of the ecotoxicological effects of agrochemicals on soil microorganisms.  In cases, however, where the nitrification is very quick in some soils, evaluation of the magnitude and duration of these effects is difficult.  We, therefore, selected a clay loam soil known for its very rapid nitrification under optimum conditions.  By variation of ecological conditions (e.g. temperature, moisture, ammonium fertilization) the magnitude and time of nitrification could be changed.  Simultaneously, however, the effects on nitrification of the herbicide "Flussig Herbogil" (dinoterb) and the nitrificide "Didin" (dicyandiamide) became stronger.  This indicates the possibility to achieve enough sensitivity to agrochemicals even in rapidly nitrifying "problem soils" when changing the hitherto recommended optimum test conditions (60% w.h.c.; 20-degrees-C; 100 mg NH4+-N/kg soil) in order to obtain a reduced activity.

AB  - Within the ACOSIC project supported by the European Commission novel oxygen scavenger and indicator systems were developed to remove the residual oxygen from inside the packaging and simultaneously to display the functionality of the oxygen scavenger or the integrity of the food packaging. The oxygen scavenger/indicator systems can be applied by conventional film conversion and printing techniques and can be adapted to different substrate materials. The oxygen scavenger and indicator systems are incorporated into packaging film materials and can be utilized in flexible and rigid packaging applications for sensitive foods or pharmaceuticals, in which a low oxygen environment is beneficial. Data obtained on selected foods packed in a structure that incorporates the novel developed oxygen scavenger/indicator systems illustrates the advantage of the new concepts. Developments are planned for further improving the scavenging capacity and kinetics and the determination of the threshold value for oxygen indication of the demonstrator films to adapt the scavenger/indicator system for selected applications.

AB  - Based on two staining protocols, DiOC(6)(3)/propidium iodide (PI) and RedoxSensor Green (an indicator of bacterial reductase activity)/PI, multi-parameter flow cytometry and cell sorting has identified at least four distinguishable physiological states during batch cultures of Bacillus cereus. Furthermore, dependent on the position in the growth curve, single cells gave rise to varying numbers of colonies when sorted individually onto nutrient agar plates. These growing colonies derived from a single cell had widely different lag phases, inferred from differences in colony size. This further highlights the complex population dynamics of bacterial monocultures and further demonstrates that individual bacterial cells in a culture respond in markedly dissimilar ways to the environment, resulting in a physiologically heterogenous and dynamic population.

AB  - Many agricultural practices cause environmental degradation that affects the cellular integrity of anurans. In the present study, we provided in situ data of Dendropsophus minutus, Physalaemus cuvieri, and Scinax fuscovarius collected in soybean/corn and conservation units in the Brazilian Cerrado. The in situ data showed no significant variation in the micronucleus frequency between the sites, only the reniform cells had a higher rate for the agricultural environment. A combined analysis of all nuclear erythrocyte abnormalities (ENAs=nuclear buds, reniform nuclei, apoptotic cell, binucleated, and anucleated cells) was recorded higher frequencies in farmland. Overall, Scinax fuscovarius was considered the best potential bioindicator for soybean/corn plantations. Finally, we recommend expanding the micronucleus test for in situ studies to expand our understanding of the sensitivity of native anuran species and provide a more systematic assessment of the adverse effects of environmental pollutants on wildlife.

AB  - Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are important constituents in all eukaryotic organisms, contributing to the structural integrity of biological membranes and serving as precursors for enzymatically-generated local hormones. In addition to these functions, PUFA can generate by a free radical-initiated mechanism, key products which participate in a variety of pathophysiological processes. In particular, free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of PUFA leads to in vivo formation of isoprostanes (IsoP), neuroprostanes (NeuroP), and phytoprostanes (PhytoP) which display a wide range of biological actions. IsoP are now the most reliable indicators of oxidative stress in humans. In this review, we will discuss some advances in our knowledge regarding two cyclic PUFA derivatives, IsoP and PhytoP, and how their biological roles may be clarified through new approaches based on analytical and synthetic organic chemistry.

AB  - We studied fluctuating asymmetry and feather growth rates as indicators of fitness of blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) breeding at the border of their distribution range in the Iberian Peninsula. Iberian blackcaps increase their abundance with increasing rainfall and ground cover of brambles. In border habitats, they are sedentary and morphologically different from migrants, suggesting that they could be adapted to peripheral conditions. We tested whether juvenile body condition depends on (1) distance from the centre of the range, (2) mean precipitation or (3) bramble cover. Controlling for environmental variation, we tested for differences between migratory and sedentary populations. Body condition varied across the Iberian gradient in parallel with changes in precipitation. Controlling for this effect, sedentary populations were in better body condition than migratory populations. Our results support the idea that environmental heterogeneity causes fitness to fluctuate across species' ranges, and also that local adaptation may, mean that peripheral populations are more than a 'tail end' of the species.

AB  - Habitat evaluation of wadeable streams based on accepted protocols provides a rapid and widely used adjunct to biological assessment. However, little effort has been devoted to habitat evaluation in non-wadeable rivers, where it is likely that protocols will differ and field logistics will be more challenging. We developed and tested a non-wadeable habitat index (NWHI) for rivers of Michigan, where non-wadeable rivers were defined as those of order >= 5, drainage area >= 1600 km(20), mainstern lengths >= 100 km, and mean annual discharge >= 15 m(3)/s. This identified 22 candidate rivers that ranged in length from 103 to 825 km and in drainage area from 1620 to 16,860 kM2. We measured 171 individual habitat variables over 2-km reaches at 35 locations on 14 rivers during 2000-2002, where mean wetted width was found to range from 32 to 185 m and mean thalweg depth from 0.8 to 8.3 m. We used correlation and principal components analysis to reduce the number of variables, and examined the spatial pattern of retained variables to exclude any that appeared to reflect spatial location rather than reach condition, resulting in 12 variables to be considered in the habitat index. The proposed NWHI included seven variables: riparian width, large woody debris, aquatic vegetation, bottom deposition, bank stability, thalweg substrate, and off-channel habitat. These variables were included because of their statistical association with independently derived measures of human disturbance in the riparian zone and the catchment, and because they are considered important in other habitat protocols or to the ecology of large rivers. Five variables were excluded because they were primarily related to river size rather than anthropogenic disturbance. This index correlated strongly with indices of disturbance based on the riparian (adjusted R-2 = 0.62) and the catchment (adjusted R-2 = 0.50), and distinguished the 35 river reaches into the categories of poor (2), fair (19), good (13), and excellent (1). Habitat variables retained in the NWHI differ from several used in wadeable streams, and place greater emphasis on known characteristic features of larger rivers.

AB  - Environmental factors could have a key role in the continuous and remarkable decline of sperm quality observed in the last decades. This study compared the seminal parameters and sperm DFI in men living in areas with different levels of air pollution. Results demonstrate that both steel plants workers and patients living in a high polluted area show a mean percentage of sperm DNA fragmentation above 30%, highlighting a clear sperm damage. In this work, two different techniques were used to measure sperm DNA damage in patients' groups, finding in both cases a high sperm DFI in patients living in polluted areas. We candidate sperm DNA fragmentation as a valuable early marker of the presence and harmful effects of pollution. We suggest that sperm DNA evaluation could be both an indicator of individual health and reproductive capacity, and a suitable datum to connect the surrounding environment with its effects.

AB  - Warming and disturbance of precipitation dynamics are expected in the Mediterranean basin, resulting in longer, more intense drought and heat waves. Here we investigated how litter microbial functioning and responses to stress may be shaped by coastal environmental conditions, and whether this depends on litter type (Pinus halepensis, Pistacia lentiscus and their admixture). Mesocosms of monospecific and mixed litters collected from both inland and coastal areas were subjected to either control (25 degrees C, 60% water holding capacity [WHC]) or stress conditions (five drying-rewetting [D/rW] cycles: 1 week of drying at 35 degrees C, 1 week at 25 degrees C, 60% WHC). Litters were characterised using chemical analyses (C/N ratio and solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] spectroscopy) and indicators of microbial activity (lignocellulolytic activities, basal respiration [BR], active microbial biomass [MB], fungal and bacterial catabolic profiles). Litter type controlled cellulases and basal respiration in litters from the inland area (e.g. positive correlations between these microbial indicators and di-O-alkyl C + O-alkyl C and %N), whereas the litter-type effect was smoothed for the coastal area. Fungal and bacterial catabolic profiles were mainly shaped by the coastal conditions and litter type, respectively, indicating that fungi were more sensitive to coast-specific conditions and bacteria more sensitive to their immediate surrounding (i.e. litter type). After D/rW cycles, microbial catabolic profiles showed: (a) a stronger stress impact on microbial communities from the inland area and (b) pre-exposure to coastal constraints limited the drought effect on decomposers from the coastal area. Our findings reveal that coastal environmental conditions and litter type are major drivers of microbial functioning and responses to drought stress. Highlights
   Poorly documented litter functioning in Mediterranean coastal environments is here investigated Coastal conditions smoothed litter type effect on certain microbial markers Pre-exposure to stress (coastal conditions) limited drought effect on microbial catabolic profiles Coastal areas should be considered when evaluating microbial functioning and responses to drought

AB  - Climate change causes alterations in lake systems, thus influencing lake biota. Studies of phytoplankton with short generation times and seasonal replacement provide an opportunity for assessing how aquatic organisms respond to changes in environmental conditions. This study explores the potential of chrysophyte cysts as indicators of seasonal and interannual changes in meteorological conditions in Lakes Lazduny and Rzes ' niki, located in northern Poland. Monthly chrysophyte cyst data from sediment traps, biweekly limnological and hydrochemical data, and daily meteorological data were used to find and explain the relationships between chrysophyte cysts and changes in meteorological conditions. We showed that cyst seasonality indirectly corresponds to meteorological conditions acting through changes in the mixing regimes, which in turn influences nutrient and light availability. Statistical analyses revealed that the taxonomic structure and interannual variability of chrysophyte cysts are dependent on multiple variables. Nevertheless, air temperature was the most important meteorological variable influencing cyst assemblages. Cysts were indicative of different periods of lake physical structure, suggesting the potential of chrysophyte cysts in paleoclimatic studies.

AB  - As the Arctic continues to warm, abundances of juvenile Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in the northern Bering Sea are expected to increase. However, information regarding the growth and condition of juvenile salmon in these waters is limited. The first objective of this study was to describe relationships between size, growth, and condition of juvenile chum (O. keta) and pink (O. gorbuscha) salmon and environmental conditions using data collected in the northeastern Bering Sea (NEBS) from 2003-2007 and 2009-2012. Salmon collected at stations with greater bottom depths and cooler sea-surface temperature (SST) were longer, reflecting their movement further offshore out of the warmer Alaska Coastal Water mass, as the season progressed. Energy density, after accounting for fish length, followed similar relationships with SST and bottom depth while greater condition (weight-length residuals) was associated with warm SST and shallower stations. We used insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations as an indicator of relative growth rate for fishes sampled in 2009-2012 and that found fish exhibited higher IGF-1 concentrations in 2010-2012 than in 2009, although these differences were not clearly attributable to environmental conditions. Our second objective was to compare size and condition of juvenile chum and pink salmon in the NEBS between warm and cool spring thermal regimes of the southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS). This comparison was based on a hypothesis informed by the strong role of sea-ice retreat in the spring for production dynamics in the SEBS and prevailing northward currents, suggesting that feeding conditions in the NESS may be influenced by production in the SEBS. We found greater length (both species) and condition (pink salmon) in years with warm thermal regimes; however, both of these responses changed more rapidly with day of year in years with cool springs. Finally, we compared indicators of energy allocation between even and odd brood-year stocks of juvenile pink salmon, finding support for the idea that the even-year stock allocates more energy to storage, as opposed to growth, than does the odd-year stock. Over all, our results support the idea that sea-ice dynamics influence energy allocation and growth of juvenile salmon in the northern Bering Sea and provide a foundation for further understanding of how environmental conditions influence juvenile salmon at the northern edge of their range.

AB  - Five fabrics were identified in Alpine and Irish caves on the basis of morphological and microstructural characteristics, and related to growth mechanisms and growth environment. Columnar and fibrous fabrics grow when speleothems are continuously wet, and from fluids at near equilibrium conditions (low supersaturation; SIcc < 0.35), through the screw dislocation mechanism. The highly defective microcrystalline fabrics form at the same supersaturation range as columnar fabric but under variable discharge and the presence of growth inhibitors. Dendritic fabrics, which have the highest density of crystal defects, develop in disequilibrium conditions (high supersaturation) under periodic very low-flow-regime periods that result in prolonged outgassing. Cave calcareous tufa forms in disequilibrium conditions. Only the calcite crystals of fabrics formed at low supersaturation seem to precipitate near-isotopic-equilibrium conditions.

AB  - Astronium graveolens is a native tree species from Atlantic Forest considered sensitive to O-3. This study aimed to determine which environmental factors, including air quality and meteorological conditions, have the most significant influence on gas exchange and the appearance of visible foliar symptoms in this species. Saplings were potted and exposed in a standardized manner in an open area in the southeastern city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Gas exchange was measured weekly in the morning (9 am to 10 am), midday (11 am to 12 pm), and afternoon (2 pm to 3 pm) during the spring and summer seasons (n = 10). Data on O-3 concentration and meteorological conditions were obtained on-site. Principal component analysis identified that the morning hours provide the most favorable meteorological conditions for gas exchange. High temperature and VPD reduced gas exchange in the midday and afternoon. Although the AOT40 was high, there were no visible foliar symptoms, which was an unexpected result. We propose that the meteorological conditions, mainly the VPD and temperature, caused stomatal closure, and consequently prevented the absorption of O-3; therefore, there was no association between O-3 and reduction of gas exchange, nor manifestation of foliar visible symptoms. We consider that more studies are necessary for the proper use of A. graveolens as an O-3 bioindicator species.

AB  - Polarization-depolarization current (PDC) measurements are now being used as a diagnosis tool to predict the ageing condition of transformer oil-paper insulation. Unfortunately, it is somewhat difficult to obtain the ageing condition of transformer cellulose insulation using the PDC technique due to the variation in transformer insulation geometry. In this literature, to quantify the ageing condition of transformer cellulose insulation using the PDC technique, we firstly designed a series of experiments under controlled laboratory conditions, and then obtained the branch parameters of an extended Debye model using the technique of curve fitting the PDC data. Finally, the ageing effect and water effect on the parameters of large time constant branches were systematically investigated. In the present paper, it is observed that there is a good exponential correlation between large time constants and degree of polymerization (DP). Therefore, the authors believe that the large time constants may be regard as a sensitive ageing indicator and the nice correlations might be utilized for the quantitative assessment of ageing condition in transformer cellulose insulation in the future due to the geometry independence of large time constants. In addition, it is found that the water in cellulose pressboards has a predominant effect on large time constants.

AB  - European hake is one of the most important economic resources for South European fleets; however, not many studies on its reproductive biology have been carried out. Gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices and condition factor were estimated. Proximate composition was analyzed in gonad, liver and muscle as indicators of female condition status; these results were converted to energy values. Variations of these parameters during the spawning season and through the year were studied. The hake population in Galician waters has a protracted spawning season with peak spawning from February to March. The proximate composition of tissues changes considerably throughout the spawning season although population spawning asynchrony masks temporal patterns. This work corroborates that energy dynamics associated with egg production in European hake are different from those observed in species from temperate waters (5 degrees-10 degrees C), depending more on environmental conditions and food availability during the spawning season than on body energy reserves.

AB  - Human bones, recovered from excavations, are an important biological archive of information. In particular, the analysis of the collagen fraction is useful for paleodietary reconstruction, via light stable isotopes, and for C-14 dating. Generally, collagen extraction procedures do not prevent loss of integrity of proteins. As a consequence, information about the state-of-remains preservation is unavailable. Here we describe a "soft" nondestructive CH3COOH-based method to recover collagen from archaeological bones, and also to obtain material for successive isotopic analyses. Our isotopic measurements on the extracts indicate that the CH3COOH-based method of extraction may be routinely employed in the context of paleodiet studies. In addition, we propose that biochemical characterization by denaturant electrophoresis and Western blot on CH3COOH extracts may be used as a bone collagen quality indicator. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Effective conservation of protected species requires accurate estimates of the status of their populations. In the UK, this led to the production of a series of sampling protocols to establish the status of designated species against predetermined conservation objectives: a process known as condition assessment'. Condition assessments involve comparisons of various parameters, invariably including abundance and/or population structure, of the target species against criteria that are judged to be indicative of viable populationsThis study investigated temporal and spatial variations in the abundance and population structure of spined loach (Cobitis taenia), a scarce species indigenous to Europe and central Asia. Specifically, the study compared the density, number of age classes and percentage contribution of the 0+ year age class of spined loach between day and night, months, years and locations.There were marked diel, seasonal, annual and spatial variations in the density, number of age classes and percentage contribution of 0+ year spined loach. Such phenomena are important because monitoring programmes conducted at inappropriate times of day or year, or with insufficient frequency or geographical coverage, could lead to inaccurate assessments of the condition of protected populations and, consequently, to inadequate conservation measures. Notwithstanding, there were few impacts on the condition assessments of the spined loach populations because at least one of the parameters invariably failed to satisfy the population condition assessment criteria.A prerequisite for successful conservation is an effective monitoring programme. It is therefore essential that surveys to assess the condition of populations of protected species are designed with due consideration of their diel behaviour, breeding season, life span and habitat use. It is recommended that the monitoring protocol and condition assessment criteria for spined loach are amended, and that surveys are conducted by trawling, in late summer, at least every 3-4years.

AB  - Universities and educational institutions worldwide had to abruptly suspend their in-person classes and offer the rest of the term in an online format. This adjustment meant that instructors had to switch their instruction format and redesign their assessment strategies to ensure good quality education. In this work, we present the methods used in two courses for this transition and the impact on student learning. Specifically, we present data from two courses: second-year engineering mathematics and first-year object-oriented programming. The online instruction was delivered covering all the objectives, and the online assessment environment was designed with all possible safeguards to maintain integrity. Our data from these assessments show that the measures were successful. Further, the data indicate that while the pandemic severely impacted the first-year students, the second-year students did not experience any learning issues in the transition. We also present the lessons learned for future improvement.

AB  - In the current context of an increasing human encroachment on landscapes, the identification and cartography of the last remaining wild areas are increasingly challenging in the field of nature conservation. The concept of naturalite, a French-word derived from wilderness, is increasingly used in the literature to designate different qualities of an area, which can be antagonistic. However, there is still a lack of definition of this concept and they were few attempts to use it for mapping. Based on the French and international literature related to the definitions, concepts and methods to map and quantify the naturalite, we try to distinguish three different facets of this concept: the biophysical integrity, the spontaneity and the spatiotemporal continuities. When considering the example of the Marais poitevin, we propose a methodological approach to produce maps of these three facets, using specific indicators. Finally, we discuss the importance of using the concept of naturalite in nature conservation.

AB  - The macroinvertebrate communities and relationships with environmental variables were characterized in the Erhai basin by sampling at 44 sites. Among the 76 taxa observed, Baetis sp., Tubificidae, Simulium sp., Eukiefferiella sp., Gammarus sp. and Parakiefferiella sp. were the dominant taxa. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that seven environmental variables, namely altitude, Ca2+, chemical oxygen demand, NO3-N, total phosphorus, streambed width, and a qualitative habitat evaluation index (QHEI), were significantly related to the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates. Two-way indicator species analysis divided total sampling sites into four groups. Weighted-averaging regression and cross-calibration produced strong models for predicting NO3-N, altitude, and QHEI, which enabled the selection of the following benthic taxa as potentially sensitive indicators of certain levels of NO3-N, altitude, and QHEI: Aracina, Atrichops morimotoi, Ceratopsyche sp., Guttilelopia sp., and Nemoura sp. for NO3-N; Heptagenia sp. and Parakiefferiella sp. for altitude; and Aracina for QHEI.

AB  - 1. The objective was to compare the effect of two litter types (wheat straw and wood shavings) and two different rearing conditions (Treated and Control) on welfare indicators, broiler performance, carcase injuries, particularly hock and foot pad dermatitis (FPD), litter characteristics and meat quality.
   2. Treated conditions were characterised by a low stocking density (11 birds/m2), short photoperiod (16h light: 8h dark) and a large amount of litter (3 to 45kg/m2, respectively, for wheat straw or wood shavings). Control conditions were a high stocking density (14 birds/m2), long photoperiod (23h light:1h dark) and small amount of litter (23 to 3kg/m2, respectively, for wheat straw or wood shavings). In addition, the effects of two widely used litter materials, wheat straw and wood shavings, were investigated.
   3. The combined effects of lower stocking density, greater amount of litter material and a photoperiod similar to the natural one, reduced the occurrence of FPD in Treated groups keeping the FPD score under the European threshold.
   4. Improved rearing conditions led to faster growth rate associated with inferior feed efficiency, whereas litter type exerted negligible effects on broiler performance.
   5. Litter moisture content, nitrogen and ammonia released by the litter were lower in Treated groups than Control groups. The use of wood shavings resulted in lower moisture and nitrogen concentrations in the litter.

AB  - In insects, the fluctuating asymmetry of bilaterally symmetrical traits has been suggested as an indicator of environmental stress because asymmetry is expected to increase when stressful conditions disturb the normal development of organisms. However, the extensive literature on asymmetry-stress associations is indeterminate. Here we contrast changes in asymmetry with changes in an alternate stress indicator, the shape of insect wings. The development of wing shape involves numerous genes that act throughout egg-to-adult development, so stresses that act at a specific time could alter shape in specific ways. Shape changes, as measured by the Procrustes technique, were considered in five data sets: exposure of Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) to multiple stresses involving ethanol, low nutrition and cold shocks; exposure of a chironomid (Chironomus tepperi (Skuse)), a blowfly (Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann)), and lightbrown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana (Walker)) to pesticides; and development of C. tepperi under saline conditions. All these conditions influenced viability and development time. In none of these cases was a change in symmetry of wing size or wing shape detected. In contrast, in four of the five data sets there was a change in wing shape. These results suggest that wing shape may be altered more commonly by stress than trait asymmetry. Wing-shape monitoring may be useful in detecting stressful environmental conditions during development, at least under controlled conditions.

AB  - Successful reproduction is one of the key elements for population integrity. The failure in reproduction due to pollution and habitat loss, apart from overharvest, is considered the main reason for the extirpation of the Baltic sturgeon. Therefore, the existence or restoration of suitable habitat for reproduction and early life stages is one prerequisite for the remediation of a Baltic sturgeon population. Without proper spawning habitat the establishment of a self sustaining population is unlikely. For habitat identification in the Odra River catchment area the information on historic spawning grounds, on existing migration obstructions, and on present hydrology and water quality was utilized. Additionally, video imaging of the substrate structure was included into the analysis. For this purpose, a submerged camera system with a digital recorder, coupled to a GPS and a depth sounder systems were used. Criteria for spawning habitat were derived mainly from publications on Acipenser sturio Linnaeus, 1758, Acipenser oxyrinchus Mitchill, 1814 and other sturgeon species, as well as and behavioural experiments. For the analysis of the current status of the habitat, a decision path was developed, to compare the suitability of potential sites in accordance with the given criteria. The data were transferred to digital maps including substrate qualities and water depths. Historic spawning sites and potential sites were surveyed in the Odra system including the rivers Odra, Warta, Prosna, Notec and Drawa. Out of 14 historically described sites 9 were inaccessible due to migration obstacles. Two sites have been lost due to substrate alterations, two sites had suitable substrates but high nutrient loads compromising effective reproduction and only one site was considered suitable taking into account all parameters. With the ongoing efforts in wastewater purification as well as the reduction of diffuse pollution from agriculture, improvements in water quality will increase the functional integrity of the two major sites in the Warta River in the vicinity of the city of Poznan. Suitable habitat was available in small patches in a variety of river stretches. Additional attempts for the remediation of spawning habitat should be undertaken to further improve the situation since a verification of the habitat assessment by naturally spawning sturgeons is still to come.

AB  - In high-level radioactive waste (HLW) repositories, buffer blocks are used for constructing engineering barrier to intercept radionuclides. Deterioration of exposed buffer blocks during their manufacture, storage, and transport may enlarge the hydraulic conductivity of an engineering barrier, reducing the barrier's efficacy. It is not easy to monitor the shrinkage displacement by traditional tools because the shrinkage is less than 1 mm per day, while the monitoring length of the block is as large as 350 mm. Additionally, the cracks are often too narrow to allow for an accurate measurement of their depths. For this study, we used Gaomiaozi (GMZ) bentonite and quartz sand at a 7:3 mass ratio to compact fan-shape buffer blocks, and then exposed those blocks in an indoor environmental condition, which allowed desiccation of the blocks to occur. We monitored the overall and surface shrinkage of the blocks employing fixed dial indicators (FDIs) and digital image correlation (DIC), respectively. We excavated subsamples containing cracks from a desiccated block at various depths and estimated the depth of the cracks using Brazilian split tests. We also investigated the microstructure evolution of the blocks with mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) after exposure. Hierarchical evaporation of the block's moisture was observed because the evaporating surface migrated inward rapidly, which led to the absence of initial evaporation stage. The shrinkage displacements of each measuring line were similar, while the longer measuring lines presented less shrinkage strain, indicating the uneven shrinkage. Moreover, the surface shrinkage of the blocks was greater than the overall shrinkage, revealing the interior of the blocks to be resistant to change during desiccation. Besides, the blocks' inner pores showed less change, while the inter-aggregate pores on the block surface shrank visibly after exposure. The depth of the desiccated cracks was less than 26 mm, as estimated by the distribution of tensile strength. Because we found the varied deterioration levels between the block's surface and interior, we determined that its structural integrity and efficacy were not as compromised as its surface seemed to indicate.

AB  - To assess the marine environmental impacts of abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, cage farms in Wan-do, we monitored the benthic environment on top of the sediment underneath cage farm stations and reference stations. We applied two methods for this assessment. One was the A- and B-investigation of the MOM system (Modeling-On fish farm-Monitoring) developed in Norway. The other was a general environmental monitoring method which is widely used. In this study, we found benthic animals in all samples that belonged to condition 1 which were based on group 1(presence of macrofauna) of the B-investigation method. The values of redox potential (group 2-pH, redox potential) in all samples were above +65 mV belonging to condition 1. Based on sensory results (group 3-gas, color, odor, thickness of deposits), five out of seven experiment samples showed condition 1 while stations 2 and 7 showed condition 2, which have been cultured for 10 years in semi-closed waters. As group 2 takes precedence over group 3, the level of the conditions for B-investigation results consequently showed condition 1 in all stations. We found that pollutants and trace metals in the sediment underneath cage farms were lower than the pollution standard. This led us to conclude that the environmental impacts of the cage farms in this study were not significant.

AB  - High-resolution topographic models have revolutionized monitoring of river changes by comparing sequential river topographic surveys (i.e. change detection). Nevertheless, much more may be obtained from this innovative quantification of changes. In this paper, we enhance the interpretation of geomorphic processes by presenting a new method for understanding of sources and sinks of sediment, river sediment transfers and functional sediment connectivity. Repeat digital elevation models (DEMs) obtained by photogrammetry were used to quantify topographic change after two floods by creating a DEM of difference (DoD) of a 6.5 km-long reach of Rambla de la Viuda stream, an ephemeral gravel-bed river in eastern Spain. The proposed method involved dividing the channel into 10 m-long longitudinal strips that were used to systematically draw boundaries between the erosional and depositional areas of the DoD. The analysis objectively: (i) drew a series of erosional and depositional segments, from 120 to 1360 m in length; (ii) estimated ranges of source-to-storage sediment transport distances, 320-670 m in the upstream and middle reaches and up to 2030 m in the lower reach; and (iii) obtained values of functional connectivity (i.e. the ratio between the sediment exported (erosion) and retained (deposition), ranging from 10(3) to 10(-3)). The variability in these three parameters along the river was found to be related to the level of channel disturbance by in-stream mining during the 1990s and 2000s. Additionally, this method indicates that the main process responsible for self-adjustment of the present morphosedimentary conditions is intra-reach erosion of banks and channel beds. Thus, this study proposes a new methodology to characterize morphological change, sediment transfer and connectivity that may serve as environmental indicators of the hydromorphological integrity of rivers with potential application to the European Water Framework Directive.

AB  - Multiple diatom sampling methods exist for the assessment of lotic systems but few comparisons of their application efficacies in monitoring have been conducted. In this study 60 sites were sampled on four large, non-wadeable rivers in Ohio and Kentucky, USA, which varied in depth, flow rate, surrounding land use and hydrologic modification. Four algae sampling methods were tested: three methods U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS QUAL and USGS QUAN) collected algae from rocks, debris and sediment in the littoral zone along a 1-2 km reach, while one method (USGS PHYTO) consisted of three cross-river phytoplankton grab samples collected from a boat. Physical and chemical data were also collected. Little difference in diatom assemblage composition was found among the EMAP, QUAL and QUAN methods. Although compositionally similar, the PHYTO method collected a substantial proportion of relatively unique diatoms compared to the littoral zone methods.
   Two disturbance gradients were calculated, one based on 1 km upstream land use within a 500 m buffer, and the other based on principal component analysis dimension reduction of measured water parameters (PCAWQ). Metrics, generally indicators of eutrophication, were calculated for each sampling method and correlated with the disturbance gradients. After Bonferroni corrections, the EMAP method had six metrics correlated with the PCAWQ, while the PHYTO and QUAL methods each had four correlated metrics. Two QUAN metrics were correlated with the PCAWQ. Few metrics were correlated with the land use measure of disturbance. While the EMAP method had the most correlated metrics, this method, along with QUAL and QUAN methods are time and labour intensive (>1 h), relative to the phytoplankton method (< 20 min). Resource managers may desire to weigh the benefits of two additional metrics with the EMAP method versus the costs associated with increased sampling time and effort.

AB  - In the following communication we report the evaluation of 18 proteins that were processed by a specific needle free injection device. The processed protein samples were analyzed by two HPLC techniques, reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). These techniques are two of the most widely used analytical techniques in the biopharmaceutical industry for the characterization, integrity assessment and stability study of peptide and protein products. The results indicate that needle free injection, using the specific device of this study, is not damaging to the studied proteins and does not generate aggregates. We found no evidence of the predicted possible effects of needle free injections, and concluded that needle free delivery is in general not different than any other delivery system and that its use should be evaluated on a case by case basis. It has to be noted that there are various needle free device designs and our work was performed using an Iject (R) from Bioject. Our conclusions therefore should be limited to the Iject (R) design we used in this study. In the reported experiments we used commercially available (economical) model proteins, which facilitate the use of the results for future comparison and reference. The work reported here can serve as a reference to illustrate the benign nature of our needle free injection device. It also highlights an interesting analogy between a set of phobias that were seen to have plagued the early stages of biochemistry and HPLC, on the one hand, and some attitudes that appear to hinder the widespread acceptance of needle free injection at present time, on the other. These phobias were identified and named by Professor Csaba Horvath, the father of HPLC, as barophobia, siderophobia and lithophobia. Today a wealth of evidence is available to indicate that those phobias are ungrounded and that the negative observations can be explained in most cases by adsorption and prevented by proper formulations and solvent conditions.

AB  - Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning systems in museums are called to properly control important microclimate parameters, not only for visitors' wellbeing, but mostly for the preservation of works of art. Accordingly, in case of interruptions to Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning systems, due to maintenance interventions or drawbacks, it is essential to guarantee the acceptable break from service to which possible damages for the works of art are related. In this regard, the aim of this work is to introduce a simple indicator to support curators in regulating the stipulation of contracts with external companies, a more effective management and maintenance of the Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning systems will thus be achieved in order to preserve the works of art, by integrating into the contracts economic penalties related to the system's service break period. The feasibility of this new procedure has been checked by means of a case study involving the "Museo Regionale" of Palermo (Italy).

AB  - Background: As well as being highly comorbid conditions, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) share a number of clinically-relevant phenomena. This raises questions about similarities and overlap in diagnosis and aetiological pathways that may exist for both conditions.
   Aims: To examine maternal conditions and perinatal factors for children diagnosed with an ASD, with or without ID, and children with ID of unknown cause, compared with unaffected children.
   Methods: The study population comprised all live singleton births in Western Australia (WA) between January 1984 and December 1999 (N = 383,153). Univariate and multivariate multinomial logistic regression models were applied using a blocked modelling approach to assess the effect of maternal conditions, sociodemographic factors, labour and delivery characteristics and neonatal outcomes.
   Results: In univariate analyses mild-moderate ID was associated with pregnancy hypertension, asthma, urinary tract infection, some types of ante-partum haemorrhage, any type of preterm birth, elective C-sections, breech presentation, poor fetal growth and need for resuscitation at birth, with all factors showing an increased risk. Severe ID was positively associated with poor fetal growth and need for resuscitation, as well as any labour or delivery complication. In the multivariate analysis no maternal conditions or perinatal factors were associated with an increased risk of ASD without ID. However, pregnancy hypertension and small head circumference were associated with a reduced risk (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.94; OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.96, respectively). For ASD with ID, threatened abortion before 20 weeks gestation and poor fetal growth were associated with an increased risk.
   Conclusion: Findings show that indicators of a poor intrauterine environment are associated with an elevated risk of ID, while for ASD, and particularly ASD without ID, the associations are much weaker. As such, these findings highlight the importance of accounting for the absence or presence of ID when examining ASD, if we are to improve our understanding of the causal pathways associated with these conditions.

AB  - This study was conducted at the Kraichtal, southern Germany. Through die measurements of the relative illuminance under canopy and the coverage of many undergrowing species in 13 plots of forest communities, the correlation between the relative illuminance and the coverage of the species was calculated. The adaptation of 12 undergrowing species to light condition was determined based on the above calculation. Combining the indicator values of the species to ecological factors Like light, humidity, temperature, acidity and nitrogen content in the soil with the constancy values of species in communities, the ranking order of undergrowing species in the communities was also examined. The results show: 1) In determining the light distribution in a forest community, scattered light condition is preferable because the interference from the drifting of Light spots under the tree canopy can be reduced, and thus relatively stable distribution of light radiation can be obtained. 2) The distribution of 9 species, out of 12 species studied, was linearly correlated with the light condition under the canopy. For 7 of the 9 species, the correlation between the coverage of species and the relative illuminance was positive, and negative for 2 of them. For the other 3 species under the canopy the coverage was not correlated with the relative illuminance. 3) Compared with the light indicator values of species, the quantitative analysis of the relationships between species coverage and relative illuminance is more effective to reflect the adaptation of the species to light conditions under canopy and to reveal the ecological range of illuminance level of the species. 4) The relative adaptability of different species to light conditions directly affects the inter-specific relationships of the undergrowing species and may determine their ranking order in a community. The species with euphotic ecological range of illuminance level were easier to adapt to different light conditions under tree canopy and thus were able to exist in most forest community types with high constancy values.

AB  - As part of the ''Shenandoah National Park: Fish in Sensitive Habitats'' (SNP:FISH) project, the blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus) was utilized as an indicator species to assess the susceptibility of the ichthyofaunal community of Shenandoah National Park (USA) to acidification. Water chemistry (ANC, conductivity, pH, and concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+ Na+, K+, Cl- NO3-, SO42-, and SiO2) was sampled every three months over the course of 31/4 years which represents the probable maximum lifetime of R. atratulus. Condition factors (K = [g/mm(3)]*10(6)) were calculated for samples of fish (age class 2+ yr, n = 370) from nine montane, second/third order streams representing a range of ANCs. A principle components regression was performed on factor scores from a principle components analysis of the water chemistry variables and fish condition factor. Two factors, one associated with stream water ANC and ion concentrations, and another associated with SO42- concentration, collectively explained 84% of the variance in condition factor. The influence ofvariables other than water chemistry upon R. atratulus K is addressed The results show that environmental chemistry is highly associated with the K of R. atratulus.

TI  - Condition Evaluation of Large Generator Stator Insulation Based on Partial Discharge Measurement
T2  - ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - The large generator faults are mostly from the stator insulation, which is aged by exposure to a combination of thermal, electrical, mechanical, and harsh environment stresses. Condition evaluation of stator insulation is an important measure of ensuring the safe operation and extending the remaining life of large generator. In this paper, a diagnosis method based on the partial discharge (PD) measurement was used for the condition evaluation of the stator insulation. The statistical parameters of partial discharge phase resolved distribution were proposed to assess the aging condition of stator insulation. A partial least square (PLS) approach was used to explore and extract relationships between the statistical parameters of partial discharge distribution with physical properties and performance such as electrical breakdown strength. Results of the PD testing and statistical analysis show that the statistical parameter Sk extent of partial discharge distribution changes much more remarkably with the aging time than do the other parameters. The statistical parameter Sk can be considered as a potential indicator of stator insulation aging. The PLS approach can effectively assess the stator insulation aging condition and can provide a predictive capability for the stator insulation diagnosis.

AB  - We documented hypotheses on the evolution of developmental heterochronies by estimating short- and long-term advantages of alternative morphs. In this respect, we compared food energy intakes and body condition between paedomorphic and metamorphic Alpine newts (Triturus alpestris, Caudata, Amphibia) in four populations. Because we found a strong correlation between fat reserves and body condition, we used this last parameter as an indicator of long-term gains. In all studied sites, paedomorphic females showed higher body condition than metamorphic ones. Paedomorphic males were also at advantage in two populations. Paedomorphs exhibited higher energy intakes than metamorphs in two populations and similar gains in two others. Our results support unifying theories that predict the occurrence of facultative paedomorphosis in varied habitats as paedomorphs exhibited better energy balance than metamorphs. This work shows the need for considering integrative parameters such as body condition in the comparative study of performances when studying developmental heterochronies.

AB  - The species composition of the herbaceous layer was surveyed in eight plant communities with a small-quadrat method. Ordination techniques were applied to these data to identify relative homogenous grazing areas, assess the veld condition of each unit and to identify indicator species, based on a grazing gradient. Five relative homogenous grazing areas were identified and should be treated as such for management purposes. The veld in the Nylsvlei Nature Reserve was generally in a good condition due to the low stocking densities of game (approximate to 0.29 animals ha(-1)) which have been maintained for many years. Nine indicator species, i.e. Cynodon dactylon, Digitaria eriantha, Ischaemum afrum, Leersia hexandra, Oryza longistaminata, Setaria sphacelata, Sporobolus ioclados, Sporobolus pyramidalis, and forbs, were identified which may be used for future monitoring of veld condition ill the different vegetation units.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

AB  - The measurement of electric potential and resistance reflect the transport of sodium and chloride ions which take place in keratinocytes and is associated with skin response to stimuli arising from external and internal environment. The aim of the study was to assess changes in electrical resistance and the transport of chloride and sodium ions, under iso-osmotic conditions and following the use of inhibitors affecting these ions' transport, namely amiloride (A) and bumetanide (B). The experiment was performed on 104 fragments of rabbit skin, divided into three groups: control (n = 35), A-inhibited sodium transport (n = 33) and B-inhibited chloride transport (n = 36). Measurement of electrical resistance (R) and electrical potential (PD) confirmed tissue viability during the experiment, no statistically significant differences in relation to control conditions were noted. The minimal and maximal PD measured during stimulation confirmed the repeatability of the recorded reactions to the mechanical and mechanical-chemical stimulus for all examined groups. Measurement of PD during stimulation showed differences in the transport of sodium and chloride ions in each of the analyzed groups relative to the control. The statistical analysis of the PD measured in stationary conditions and during mechanical and/or mechanical-chemical stimulation proved that changes in sodium and chloride ion transport constitute the physiological response of keratinocytes to changes in environmental conditions for all applied experimental conditions. Assessment of transdermal ion transport changes may be a useful tool for assessing the skin condition with tendency to pain hyperactivity and hypersensitivity to xenobiotics.

AB  - Surveillance of cat shelters by official veterinarians in Austria is based on legal requirements and does not directly assess cat welfare. The aim of this study was to develop animal-based parameters that are feasible to measure in a surveillance setting, stable over time, and reproducible by different raters. We assessed physical condition (body condition, eye and nose discharge, and coat and skin) and behavior of the cats (aggressive interactions, play behavior, behavior toward humans) and also collected data about housing conditions, shelter management, and the shelter cat population. The validity of the animal-based parameters was assessed by examining relationships with housing conditions. Thirty animal shelters housing a median of 63 cats each were studied. Cats were kept mostly in groups (mean size, 7). Adult cats housed in the shelter for at least 4 weeks (24 +/- 18 per shelter) were included. Test-retest reliability of the animal-based parameters was assessed by visiting 10 shelters twice approximately 2 months apart. To assess interrater reliability (IRR), 36 pens were evaluated by 2 raters. Two parameters were stable over time with acceptable IRR. The proportion of very thin cats (body condition score of 1/5) and the proportion of cats with a poor coat condition correlated highly with no significant difference between visits (%catsverythin: r(s) = 0.84, P = 0.002, Wilcoxon test: P = 0.225; % catspoorcoat: r(s) = 0.86, P = 0.002, Wilcoxon test: P = 0.128). IRR was moderate for % catsverythin (r(s) = 0.63, P < 0.001) and good for % catspoorcoat (r(s) = 0.87, P < 0.001). The physical condition of the cats was found to correlate with housing conditions; for example, an increased proportion of very thin cats correlated with a higher proportion of pens with less than 1 lying area per cat (r(s) = 0.54, P < 0.05) and with a lower proportion of pens with hiding places for all cats (r(s) = -0.54, P < 0.05). Poorer scores for coat condition correlated with longer mean length of stay in the shelter (r(s) = 0.46, P < 0.05), fewer cat toilets per cat (r(s) = -0.37, P < 0.05), and a more unpleasant odor (r(s) = 0.57, P < 0.05). Our results show that simple animal-based parameters can give an indication of how well cats cope with their environment and suggest that the use of these parameters, in addition to the assessment of conformance with legal requirements for shelter surveillance, could be beneficial for cat welfare.

AB  - The free vibration of rotating functionally graded porous (FGP) circular cylindrical shell with different boundary conditions is presented analytically in this study. The porous material properties are assumed to be graded in the thickness direction of the cylindrical shell according to three types of porosity distributions. By using Love's shell theory and Hamilton's principle, the governing equations of the rotating FGP cylindrical shell are derived, in which the effects of the centrifugal and Coriolis forces due to rotation are also taken into account. The natural frequencies of the rotating FGP cylindrical shell structure subjected to different boundary conditions are determined by applying Galerkin's method together with beam functions of longitudinal mode functions. To validate the present results, comparisons between the results of the present method and previous studies are performed; a very good agreement is achieved. Besides, some influences of porous material properties, boundary conditions, circumferential wave number, geometric parameters, Coriolis acceleration, rotating speed on natural frequency as well as critical speed of the rotating FGP cylindrical shell are given.

AB  - The formation of hydrogen sulfide in biofilms and sediments in sewer systems can cause severe pipe corrosions and health hazards, and requires expensive programs for its prevention. The aim of this study is to propose a new control strategy and the optimal condition for sulfide elimination by intermittent nitrate dosing in sewer sediments. The study was carried out based on lab-scale experiments and batch tests using real sewer sediments. The intermittent nitrate dosing mode and the optimal control condition were investigated. The results indicated that the sulfide-intermittent-elimination strategy by nitrate dosing is advantageous for controlling sulfide accumulation in sewer sediment. The oxidation-reduction potential is a sensitive indicator parameter that can reflect the control effect and the minimum N/S (nitrate/sulfide) ratio with slight excess nitrate is necessary for optimal conditions of efficient sulfide control with lower carbon source loss. The optimal control condition is feasible for the sulfide elimination in sewer systems. (C) 2014 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Crop condition assessment in the early growing stage is essential for crop monitoring and crop yield prediction. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based method is employed to evaluate crop condition by inter-annual comparisons of both spatial variability (using NDVI images) and seasonal dynamics (based on crop condition profiles). Since this type of method will generate false information if there are changes in crop rotation, cropping area or crop phenology, information on cropped/uncropped arable land is integrated to improve the accuracy of crop condition monitoring. The study proposes a new method to retrieve adjusted NDVI for cropped arable land during the growing season of winter crops by integrating 16-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data at 250-m resolution with a cropped and uncropped arable land map derived from the multi-temporal China Environmental Satellite (Huan Jing Satellite) charge-coupled device (HJ-1CCD) images at 30-m resolution. Using the land map's data on cropped and uncropped arable land, a pixel-based uncropped arable land ratio (UALR) at 250-m resolution was generated. Next, the UALR-adjusted NDVI was produced by assuming that the MODIS reflectance value for each pixel is a linear mixed signal composed of the proportional reflectance of cropped and uncropped arable land. When UALR-adjusted NDVI data are used for crop condition assessment, results are expected to be more accurate, because: (i) pixels with only uncropped arable land are not included in the assessment; and (ii) the adjusted NDVI corrects for interannual variation in cropping area. On the provincial level, crop growing profiles based on the two kinds of NDVI data illustrate the difference between the regular and the adjusted NDVI, with the difference depending on the total area of uncropped arable land in the region. The results suggested that the proposed method can be used to improve the assessment of early crop condition, but additional evaluation in other major crop producing regions is needed to better assess the method's application in other regions and agricultural systems.

AB  - A logical sequence of seven steps is proposed as a generic template to design plans for monitoring and evaluating fish and wildlife in the Columbia River ecosystem. Management programs for these resources fail to include coordinated monitoring and evaluation plans. This short-coming is indicative of pervasive management conflicts detected from regional to local geographic scales. In the absence of a cohesive ecological management framework, monitoring and evaluation activities proceed without a clear understanding of what uncertainty they are intended to address, nor is there a clear description of the process to utilize the information gained. As a result, the accountability for the investment of public funds for fish and wildlife restoration is poor, information collected from the environment is not included in decisionmaking, and the ability to gain knowledge while taking management actions is compromised. The sequence of steps discussed here does not identify or describe distinct monitoring activities or methodologies at any particular location or listed under any specific monitoring plan. Instead, it concentrates on the generic elements necessary for the design and implementation of coordinated fish and wildlife monitoring plans. It is proposed that at least four major issues demand considerable attention in order to improve regional monitoring and evaluation capabilities: The first is adoption of an ecological framework for the management of fish and wildlife at relevant geographic scales within the ecosystem. Such a framework must include an explicit identification of goals, objectives, and actions to steer coordinated decisions across the boundaries of technical disciplines, management jurisdictions, and institutional responsibilities. The second is that the identification of these management goals for the geographic location of interest must precede the design of monitoring and evaluation plans from the top down. Third, the evaluation component must be considered early on in the planning process, so that it blends smoothly with monitoring at the time of implementation. Fourth, decision-makers and scientists engaged in the planning of fish and wildlife monitoring and evaluation efforts in the region must have a close collaborative relationship. Monitoring and evaluation plans designed under these premises may enhance our collective observational capabilities, promote cost-effectiveness and adequate evaluation, and provide a useful tool to adjust our management practices to the challenges of complex ecosystems.

AB  - 1. The 'hydrogeomorphic' approach to functional assessment of wetlands (HGM) was developed as a synthetic mechanism for compensatory mitigation of wetlands lost or damaged by human activities. The HGM approach is based on: (a) classification of wetlands by geomorphic origin and hydrographic regime (b) assessment models that associate variables as indicators of function, and (c) comparison to reference wetlands that represent the range of conditions that may be expected in a particular region, in this paper, we apply HGM to riparian wetlands of alluvial rivers.
   2. In the HGM classification, riverine wetlands ape characterized by formative fluvial processes that occur mainly on flood plains. The dominant water sources are overbank flooding from the channel or subsurface hyporheic flows. Examples of riverine wetlands in the U.S.A. are: bottomland hardwood forests that typify the low gradient, fine texture substratum of the south-eastern coastal plain and the alluvial flood plains that typify the high gradient, coarse texture substratum of western montane rivers.
   3. Assessment (logic) models for each of fourteen alluvial wetland functions are described. Each model is a composite of two to seven wetland variables that are independently scored in relation to a reference data set developed for alluvial rivers in the western U.S.A. Scores are summarized by a 'functional capacity index' (FCI), which is multiplied by the area of the project site to produce a dimensionless 'functional capacity unit' (FCU). When HGM is properly used, compensatory mitigation is based on the FCUs lost that must be returned to the riverine landscape under statutory authority.
   4. The HGM approach also provides a framework for long-term monitoring of mitigation success or failure and, if failing, a focus on topical remediation.
   5. We conclude that HGM is a robust and easy method for protecting riparian wetlands, which are critically important components of alluvial river landscapes.

AB  - Ionospheric disturbances present a considerable hazard to single-frequency satellite navigation systems for airborne users. We discuss our implementation of three ionospheric threat models in the DLR "multi-output advanced signal test environment for receivers" global navigation satellite system simulator, which is based on Spirent GSS 7780/7790 signal generator. These threat models include the standard front-based threat model developed for the integrity assessment of ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS), a simplified plasma bubble model, and ionospheric scintillation, which can be combined with either of the two previously mentioned models. These effects can now straightforwardly be simulated at the German Aerospace Center's research facilities. As an example, we simulate a GBAS ground facility with code-carrier divergence monitoring, affected by an ionospheric front, and we show the results of a simulation with coincidental occurrence of a plasma bubble and scintillation with an S (4) index of 0.4.

AB  - Pesticide Risk Indicators (PRIs) are widely used to evaluate and compare the potential health and environmental risks of pesticide use and to guide pest control policies and practices. They are applied to agricultural, landscape and structural pest management by governmental agencies, private institutions and individuals. PRIs typically assess only the potential risks associated with the active ingredients because, with few exceptions, pesticide manufacturers disclose only the identity of the active ingredients which generally comprise only a minor portion of pesticide products. We show that when inert ingredients are identified and assessed by the same process as the active ingredient, the product specific risk can be much greater than that calculated for the active ingredient alone. To maintain transparency in risk assessment, all those who develop and apply PRIs or make decisions based on their output, should clearly disclose and discuss the limitations of the method.

AB  - Current methods for in vivo retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) imaging involve either retrograde or intravitreal injection of chemical or biological tracers, which are invasive and may require repeated injection for serial long-term assessment. We have developed a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope technique (blue-light CSLO or bCSLO) to image retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in mice expressing cyan fluorescent protein tinder the control of a Thy-1 promoter. Fluorescent spots corresponding to CFP-expressing retinal ganglion cells were discernable with the bCSLO. 96.1 +/- 2.6% of CFP expressing cells also were retrograde labeled with DiI indicating the bCSLO imaged fluorescent spots are RGCs. The imaging of Thy-1 promoter-driven CFP expression in these mice could serve as a sensitive indicator to reflect the integrity of RGCs, and provides a non-invasive method for longitudinal study of the mechanism of RGC degeneration and the effect of neuroprotective agents.

A wide range of aromatic aldehydes easily undergo condensations with alpha-naphthol and malononitrile under solvent-free condition to afford the desired products of good purity in excellent yields. Taking into account environmental and economical considerations, the protocol presented here has the merits of environmentally benign, simple operation, convenient work-up and good yields. Furthermore, the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused for at least five cycles without losing its activities.

AB  - A 2D-DIGE/MS approach was used to assess protein abundance differences in the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii from polluted aquatic ecosystems of Do (n) over tilde ana National Park and surrounding areas with different pollution loads. Procambarus clarkii accumulated metals in the digestive glands and gills reflecting sediment concentrations. We first stated that, probably related to elements accumulation, pollution increased oxidative damage in P. clarkii tissues, as shown by the thiol oxidation status of proteins and MDA levels. In these animals, the altered redox status might be responsible for the deregulated abundance of proteins involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress including protein folding, mitochondrial imbalance and inflammatory processes. Interestingly, polluted P. clarkii crayfish also displayed a metabolic shift to enhanced aerobic glycolysis, most likely aimed at generating ATP and reduction equivalents in an oxidative stress situation that alters mitochondrial integrity. The deregulated proteins define the physiological processes affected by pollutants in DNP and its surrounding areas and may help us to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of environmental pollutants. In addition, these proteins might be used as exposure biomarkers in environmental risk assessment. The results obtained might be extrapolated to many other locations all over the world and have the added value of providing information about the molecular responses of this environmentally and economically interesting animal.
   Significance: Metal content in digestive gland and gills of P. clarkii crayfish reflects their contents in sediments at sites of Dofiana National Park and its surroundings. Accumulation of essential and toxic transition metals is paralleled by clear signs of oxidative stress to lipids and proteins and by significant deregulation of many proteins involved in protein folding, mitochondrial respiratory imbalance and inflammatory response. These results indicate that P. clarkii is an excellent bioindicator to be used in aquatic ecosystems quality monitoring. Additionally, results evidence that the anthropogenic activities carried out around Dofiana National Park represent an extremely serious threat to this unique Biosphere Reserve and pose a risk to the environment and their inhabitants health.
   The identified deregulated proteins provide information about the metabolic pathways and/or physiological processes affected by pollutant-elicited oxidative stress, may also be useful as biomarkers of environmental pollution and have the added value of providing information about the molecular responses of this environmentally and economically interesting animal.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of relationships between grain growth parameters and drought response. Grain growth parameters of more than 70 millet lines were assessed under well-watered and postflowering drought-stress conditions in two field trials at the ICRISAT Sahelian Center, Sadore, Niger. All the grain growth parameters based on thermal time varied more than two-fold between lines in both moisture environments. Single grain mass of the lines ranged from 4.3-10.9 mg under well-watered conditions and 3.4-9.4 mg under drought stress. When averaged across trials, 51% of the accounted variance of final grain mass could be explained by differences in the grain growth rate under well-watered conditions, while differences in the duration of the linear grain growth phase accounted for 37% of the variation in final grain mass.
   Drought stress reduced the linear grain growth phase and, as a consequence, reduced final grain mass by up to 25%. Lines with long grain filling periods under well-watered conditions had larger reductions in the grain filling period and in final grain mass under stress. In general, there was little effect of drought stress on the grain growth rate. However, because of the negative correlation of grain growth rate and linear grain growth phase, lines with higher grain growth rates in well-watered conditions had smaller reductions in grain filling period under stress. Grain growth rate accounted with 38% for the major part of the variation in grain mass under stress conditions.
   Grain growth parameters in well-watered and drought-stress conditions were unrelated to drought tolerance as expressed by a drought response index, and were indicators of neither susceptibility nor tolerance to stress. However final grain mass was highly correlated to yield under stress. A feasible risk-reducing strategy in the likelihood of postflowering stress is to select pearl millet lines for drought escape with a high grain growth rate combined with a relatively short grain filling period.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThere is renewed interest in quinoa as a potential source of vegetable oils; however, there is no information about how environmental conditions affect its fatty acid composition, a critical indicator of its oil quality. The fatty acid concentrations of four cultivars adapted to temperate environments were compared at three sowing dates to evaluate the effect of environmental conditions during the seed-filling period on the variation in oil quality.
   RESULTSThe interaction between cultivar and sowing date was the main source of variation explaining the changes in the lipid content and fatty acid concentrations in quinoa. Most of the variation in the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids was attributed to the temperature and solar radiation during the seed-filling period; cultivar-specific responses to photo-thermal conditions were observed among the sea-level quinoa cultivars evaluated.
   CONCLUSIONThe lipid content and concentration of fatty acids in quinoa are affected by sowing date. This effect is exerted through changes in temperature and solar radiation conditions. This managing practice can therefore be used to achieve quinoa oil with different qualities. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Data collection for fresh-water regions of The Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program (EHMP), in southeast Queensland, Australia, involves the sampling of over 130 sites among 19 catchments twice per year and has been ongoing for over ten years. The sampling design was derived following an exhaustive process of indicator and site selection to develop a composite indicator that represented aquatic ecosystem health. After 13 years of implementation, there was an interest in identifying redundancies in sampling to reduce sampling costs without making a substantial impact on the integrity of the program and its capacity to report on ecosystem health. This paper focuses on identifying a subset of sites and times that could be removed from sampling with a minimal impact on the subsequent ecosystem health scores. Herein, Mixed models are employed to assess a variance structure from which optimality criteria are utilized to identify the scheme. Integer programs are then used to ensure specific practical constraints are observed.

AB  - The impact-echo (IE) method is a popular non-destructive testing (NDT) technique widely used for measuring the thickness of plate-like structures and for detecting certain defects inside concrete elements or structures. However, the IE method is not effective for full condition assessment (i.e., defect detection, defect diagnosis, defect sizing and location), because the simple frequency spectrum analysis involved in the existing IE method is not sufficient to capture the IE signal patterns associated with different conditions. In this paper, we attempt to enhance the IE technique and enable it for full condition assessment of concrete elements by introducing advanced machine learning techniques for performing comprehensive analysis and pattern recognition of IE signals. Specifically, we use wavelet decomposition for extracting signatures or features out of the raw IE signals and apply extreme learning machine, one of the recently developed machine learning techniques, as classification models for full condition assessment. To validate the capabilities of the proposed method, we build a number of specimens with various types, sizes, and locations of defects and perform IE testing on these specimens in a lab environment. Based on analysis of the collected IE signals using the proposed machine learning based IE method, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in performing full condition assessment of concrete elements or structures.

AB  - Quantitative analysis of benthic foraminifera from the Serravallian S. Nicola composite section (Tremiti Islands, Adriatic Sea) and about 37 in thick, pointed out changes of bottom paleoecological conditions in this eastern Mediterranean area during the analyzed time interval. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages are typical of bathyal environment and indicate a constant paleobathymetry of about 1,000 m. Changes in benthic foraminiferal assemblages allowed us to identify five intervals, which were afterward calibrated on the astrochronological scale to reconstruct the palcoecological evolution of bottom conditions. In particular starting from the base of the section the following different bottom conditions have been identified: 1) between about 12.62 to about 12.29 Ma high surface productivity, active bottom water circulation and, consequently, moderate bottom food supply; this palcoenvironment slightly changed between about 12.49 and 12.29 Ma, where benthic assemblages testify unstable bottom conditions with periods of active circulation (relative abundance of Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi), alternated with periods of sluggish circulation (peaks of Bulimina subulata group); 2) relatively oxygenated paleoenvironment together with low food supply between about 12.29 and 12.08 Ma; 3) increase of organic matter content (abundance of U. peregrina-pygmaea), due to higher surface productivity and/or greater preservation of organic matter at bottom from 12.08 to 11.81 Ma; 4) relatively oxygenated conditions with low food supply from 11.81 to about 11.45 Ma; 5) similar conditions to those of the basal part of the section (about 12.62 - 12.29 Ma) from about 11.45 to 11.10 Ma, but with an increase of organic matter content.
   Finally, the comparison between the paleoecological reconstruction of the S. Nicola composite section and Ras il-Pellegrin (Malta) composite section, reported in another paper in the interval between about 12.6 and 12.2 Ma, pointed out very different extimated paleobathymetries, but similar paleoecological bottom conditions as evidence of relatively high surface productivity.

AB  - Coastal wetland vegetation along the Great Lakes differs strongly with latitude, but most studies of Great Lakes wetland condition have attempted to exclude the effect of latitude to discern anthropogenic effects on condition. We developed an alternative approach that takes advantage of the strong relationship between latitude and coastal wetland floristic condition. Latitude was significantly correlated with 13 of 37 environmental variables tested, including growing degree days, agriculture, atmospheric deposition, nonpoint-source pollution, and soil texture, which suggests that latitude is a good proxy for several environmental drivers of vegetation. Using data from 64 wetlands along the U.S. coast of Lakes Huron, Michigan, Erie, and Ontario, we developed linear regressions between latitude and two measures of floristic condition, the Floristic Quality Index (FQI, adj. r(2)=0.437, p<0.001) and the first axis scores from a non-metric multidimensional scaling of wetland plant cover (MDS1, adj. r(2) = 0.501, p<0.001). Departures from the central tendency of these regression models represented wetlands of better or worse condition than expected for their latitude. This approach provides a means to identify wetlands worthy of preservation, to establish vegetation targets for wetland restoration, and to forecast changes in floristic quality associated with future climate change.

AB  - Blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and deposit- and suspension-feeding bivalves (Macoma balthica and M. mitchelli) play important roles in the food web of Chesapeake Bay and may serve as indicators of ecological health, particularly in small subestuaries where conditions may be strongly linked to watershed and local factors. We sampled 19 subestuaries of Chesapeake Bay to test hypothesized relationships of blue crabs and bivalves with salinity (a regional indicator), watershed- and local-scale land use, and local habitat and water quality. We divided the subestuaries into five land-use categories: forested, developed, agricultural, mixed agricultural and mixed-developed. We measured water quality, sediment class, physical habitat and adjacent land use/land cover at each of six stations within each subestuary. Fyke nets were employed to estimate blue crab abundance and size-structure, while cores were used to estimate bivalve densities and biomass. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis indicated that 51% of the variance in blue crab abundance was explained by salinity, watershed land use and shoreline marsh habitat. Crab abundance was greatest at salinities > 16 ppt, but in lower salinities crabs were most abundant along marsh shorelines in forested and mixed land-use watersheds. Juvenile crabs < 85 mm were more strongly associated with shoreline marshes, particularly in subestuaries with forested and mixed land-use watersheds. Macoma spp. were similarly associated with shoreline marshes but mainly in muddy bottoms at moderate-to-high salinities; however the best CART model only explained 25% of variance in bivalve abundance. These results were consistent with our predictions that shoreline wetlands and watershed land use may have important effects on these taxa along the estuarine salinity gradient, and are consistent with hypotheses based on previous descriptive and experimental research linking blue crabs and deposit-feeding bivalves to habitats rich in allochtonous detritus.

TI  - Electrical conductivity of soybean seeds after storage in several environments
T2  - SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Membrane integrity, as measured by electrical conductivity (EC), is suggested as an indicator of seed vigor in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] seeds. This study evaluated the effect of storage time and temperature on EC of six soybean seed lots (two lots each of high, medium and low vigor). All seed lots were adjusted to 120 g kg(-1) seed moisture, sealed in aluminum foil packets and placed in storage at 10 and 20 degreesC or stored unsealed in multi-wall paper bags in warehouse (WH) conditions at Lexington, KY, USA for 486 days. Four of the six seed lots were also stored unsealed at 10 degreesC. All seed lots were sampled at 3-month intervals and evaluated for seed moisture (SMC), standard germination (SG) and vigor [accelerated aging (AA) and EC]. After 91 and 204 days in storage, samples initially stored at 20 degreesC and WH were moved to 10 degreesC and sampled at the same intervals. Seed moisture content for unsealed samples equilibrated at 107 g kg(-1) (+/-9 g kg(-1)) in both the WH and 10 degreesC environments. No change in SG occurred for seeds stored sealed (120 g kg(-1)) at 10 degreesC, except for the low vigor seed lots which declined significantly at the last sample date. The AA germination declined significantly for all, seed lots stored sealed at 10 degreesC, however the EC did not change during the same storage period. Seeds stored sealed at 20 degreesC and unsealed in the WH showed rapid declines in AA and SG and significant increases in EC. When these seeds were moved to 10 degreesC, however, the AA continued to decline while the EC remained at the same level (no significant change) for the remainder of the seed storage period. Thus whilst the AA declined in all environments, the EC only increased at higher temperatures (20 degreesC, WH) but showed little change during storage at 10 degreesC. Thus, precautions must be taken if using EC to measure soybean seed vigor following storage at 10 degreesC.

AB  - The selection of genotypes best adapted to environmental conditions has traditionally focused on agronomic and grape composition parameters. However, to classify the genotypes most adapted to climate change conditions, the aim must be to focus on the ecophysiological responses that will ultimately determine their performance. The variability in water use efficiency of 13 Grenache genotypes over three-seasons was assessed under field conditions at leaf, grape and plant level. Results showed a significant effect of genotype at all three levels, and despite the large interannual variability there was a remarkable consistency among levels. Furthermore, using genotype-specific regressions it was possible to identify significant differences in the intrinsic water use efficiency response of each genotype as a function of the vine water status. The relationship between net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, as well as carbon isotope discrimination in grapes, were also confirmed as reliable physiological indicators for selecting grapevine genotypes to future environmental conditions. Therefore, the proposed multi-level methodology was useful to quantify the intracultivar variability and the identification of more and less efficient genotypes within Grenache.

AB  - Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (FDS) is an effective tool allowing assessing the condition of oil-paper insulation system in power equipment. However, results from these measurements are known to be greatly influenced by various parameters, including insulation aging, moisture content, and insulation geometry/volume, together with environmental condition such as temperature. In this contribution, a series of experiments have been performed under controlled laboratory conditions. The dielectric response of the oil impregnated paper, along with the degree of polymerization and moisture content, were monitored. Since dielectric parameters are geometry dependent, poles (independent of the geometry) which depends on resistivity and permittivity, were considered to assess the condition of the insulation. From the investigations performed on new and aged samples, it is shown that poles (P) can be regarded as insulation aging indicator. It is also shown that a per unit value based on the Dielectric Dissipation Factor (DDF), measured in the frequency range from 1 to 1000 Hz can be correlated to moisture content in the insulation paper.

AB  - Question Malus sylvestris is considered an endangered tree species in Central Europe. Hybridization with Malus domestica poses a serious threat to the genetic integrity of the wild species. Here we investigate whether M. sylvestris and the hybrid M. domestica x sylvestris occur in the same habitat or have different ecological niches and whether M. sylvestris is threatened by displacement by the hybrid. Location Northern Bavaria. Methods Taxon delimitation was accomplished using six genetic microsatellite markers and 613 Germany-wide references of M. sylvestris and 75 cultivars. To determine differences in the ecological niches between M. sylvestris and hybrids, light availability for the trees was estimated via gap fractions in hemispherical photographs. Soil particle size fractions and pH values were determined for each horizon. Vegetation releve data were collected, and mean Ellenberg indicator values calculated. For habitat differences, means in combination with frequency patterns of the parameters were compared, and logistic models and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of community data were calculated. Results Genetic markers identified 22 M. sylvestris and 11 hybrid specimens, meaning that in the study area the wild taxon is much more frequent than the hybrid. Ecological site differences between M. sylvestris and its hybrid with M. domestica were best explained by light availability, pH and mean Ellenberg moisture value. In contrast to the ecological demands of the hybrid, Malus sylvestris tolerated wet soil and flooding and even somewhat shadier conditions in the later successional stages. DCA revealed that differences in the composition of the plant communities in which the taxa were found were primarily driven by soil moisture. Conclusions Our data suggested different ecological niches, which are appropriate to reduce the risk of replacement of M. sylvestris by the hybrid M. domestica x sylvestris. Hence, these findings provide important implications for a more targeted planning of in-situ conservation strategies of M. sylvestris genomes with low levels of admixture and help to protect plant communities suitable for the threatened wild apple.

AB  - Background
   Insecticide-treated nets are the cornerstone of global malaria control and have been shown to reduce malaria morbidity by 50-60%. However, some areas are experiencing a resurgence in malaria following successful control. We describe an efficacy decay framework to understand why high malaria burden persists even under high ITN coverage in a community in western Kenya.
   Methods
   We enrolled 442 children hospitalized with malaria and paired them with age, time, village and gender-matched controls. We completed comprehensive household and neighborhood assessments including entomological surveillance. The indicators are grouped into five domains in an efficacy decay framework: ITN ownership, compliance, physical integrity, vector susceptibility and facilitating factors. After variable selection, case-control data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression models and mosquito data were analyzed using negative binomial regression. Predictive margins were calculated from logistic regression models.
   Results
   Measures of ITN coverage and physical integrity were not correlated with hospitalized malaria in our study. However, consistent ITN use (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.12-0.43), presence of nearby larval sites (AOR = 1.137, 95% CI: 1.02-1.27), and specific types of crops (AOR (grains) = 0.446, 95% CI: 0.24-0.82) were significantly correlated with malaria amongst children who owned an ITN. The odds of hospitalization for febrile malaria nearly tripled when one other household member had symptomatic malaria infection (AOR-2.76, 95% CI: 1.83-4.18). Overall, perfect household adherence could reduce the probability of hospitalization for malaria to less than 30% ( 95% CI: 0.12-0.46) and adjusting environmental factors such as elimination of larval sites and growing grains nearby could reduce the probability of hospitalization for malaria to less than 20% ( 95% CI: 0.04-0.31).
   Conclusion
   Availability of ITNs is not the bottleneck for malaria prevention in this community. Behavior change interventions to improve compliance and environmental management of mosquito breeding habitats may greatly enhance ITN efficacy. A better understanding of the relationship between agriculture and mosquito survival and feeding success is needed.

AB  - This study on yellow perch (Perca flavescens) examines a series of enzymatic markers and the relative weights of pyloric caeca and visceral lipids, their response to changes in feeding regime and their potential use to infer recent changes in growth rate and fish condition. Fish were exposed to four different feeding regimes for 12 weeks resulting in specific growth rates ranging from 0.3% to 3.5% (%/day). Growth and condition responded rapidly to changes in ration and the weight of pyloric caeca and visceral lipids reflected increased feed intake. Growth rate was correlated with muscle citrate synthase and caecal nucleoside-diphosphate kinase activities, whereas condition was correlated with muscle citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase activities and with caecal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Results showed that enzyme activities and biometric parameters responded rapidly to increased feed intake, but the response was slower when food intake decreased. Plateaus were attained for both condition and visceral lipid index, but the relative weight of pyloric caeca continued to increase throughout the experimental period. Results from this study could, in principle, be used to infer recent growth and energy status in wild yellow perch and thus provide an indicator of food availability in their environment.

AB  - Assessing the health condition has a wide range of applications in healthcare, military, aerospace, and industrial fields. Nevertheless, traditional feature-engineered techniques involve manual feature extraction, which are too cumbersome to adapt to the changes caused by the development of sensor network technology. Recently, deep-learning-based methods have achieved initial success in health-condition assessment research, but insufficient considerations for problems such as class skewness, noisy segments, and result interpretability make it difficult to apply them to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a K-margin-based Interpretable Learning approach for health-condition assessment. In detail, a skewness-aware RCR-Net model is employed to handle problems of class skewness. Furthermore, we present a diagnosis model based on K-margin to automatically handle noisy segments by naturally exploiting expected consistency among the segments associated with each record. Additionally, a knowledge-directed interpretation method is presented to learn domain knowledge-level features automatically without the help of human experts which can be used as an interpretable decision-making basis. Finally, through experimental validation in the field of both medical and aerospace, the proposed method has a better generality and high efficiency with 0.7974 and 0.8005 F1 scores, which outperform all state-of-the-art deep learning methods for health-condition assessment task by 3.30% and 2.99%, respectively.

AB  - According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the status of European surface waters is assessed using aquatic organism groups. Here we present an overview of 297 assessment methods, based on a questionnaire survey addressing authorities in all countries implementing the WFD. Twenty-eight countries reported on methods applied to rivers (30%), coastal waters (26%), lakes (25%) and transitional waters (19%). More than half of the methods are based on macroscopic plants (28%) or benthic invertebrates (26%); in addition, phytoplankton (21%), fish (15%) and phytobenthos (10%) were assessed. Countries of Central and Western Europe had developed almost all methods required for the WFD implementation. Two main sampling strategies were discernable: small-scale sampling of the taxonomically diverse groups of benthic invertebrates and phytobenthos that demand elaborate processing, versus large-scale sampling of vast, species-poor plant stands or the mobile fish fauna. About three-quarters of methods identified organisms to species-level while in particular phytoplankton-based methods used class-or phylum-level, or included no taxonomic information. Out of nine metric types distinguished, river methods used more sensitivity and trait metrics while for other water categories abundance metrics prevailed. Fish-based methods showed the highest number of metrics. Fifty-six percent of methods focussed on the detection of eutrophication and organic pollution, with shares decreasing from autotrophic to heterotrophic organism groups: phytoplankton > phytobenthos > macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > fish fauna. The order was almost reverse for hydrological or morphological deterioration: fish fauna and macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > phytoplankton > phytobenthos. These pressures were mainly assessed by methods applied to rivers and transitional waters. The pressure-impact relationship of about one-third of methods was not tested empirically with methods for transitional waters being the least validated. The strength of relationships differed significantly between organism groups and water categories. The correlation coefficients generally covered a broad range (<0.4 to >0.8), but on average with the pattern: phytoplankton > macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > phytobenthos and fish fauna. In terms of water categories the following order resulted: coastal waters > lakes > transitional waters > rivers. Status boundaries were mostly defined using statistical approaches. We advocate better reflection of the necessary sampling effort and precision, full validations of pressure-impact relationships and an implementation of more ecological components into classification.

AB  - Changes in catchment land cover can impact stream ecosystems through altered hydrology and subsequent increases in sedimentation and nonpoint-source pollutants. These stressors can affect habitat suitability and water quality for aquatic invertebrates. We studied the impact of a range of physical and chemical stressors on aquatic insects, and tested whether the effects of these stressors differed in 3 habitat types: riffles, pools, and banks. Our study was conducted in Piedmont streams in Georgia (USA) where catchment development pressure and the potential for aquatic biodiversity loss are high. We sampled 3 replicates of riffle, pool, and bank habitats within a 100-m reach of 29 streams (11-126 km(2)) that varied in catchment land cover. Correlations between environmental variables and aquatic insects (both richness and density) within habitat types indicated that riffle habitats (vs pool and bank habitats) exhibited the strongest relations with environmental variables. Riffle assemblages were negatively affected by both physical (e.g., bed mobility) and chemical (e.g., specific conductance, nutrient concentrations) variables. The density of aquatic insects in pools was also correlated to physical and chemical variables, but there were few relationships with pool or bank richness or bank density. Because of greater relative impacts of disturbance in riffles versus banks, we found greater differences between riffle and bank richness in streams with greater sediment disturbance. The proportion of bank richness (bank richness/bank + riffle richness) increased with finer bed sediment (r(2) = 0.43) and increased bed mobility (r(2) = 0.35). We compared richness of facultative taxa (found in multiple habitats) between sites we characterized as minimally impacted and sediment-impacted. In riffles, richness of facultative taxa was lower in sediment-impacted vs minimally impacted sites (11.0 vs 20.2, p 0.002, t-test), but was similar for both disturbance groups in banks (20.1 vs 22.7, p > 0.05, t-test). Our results suggest that taxa richness may be retained in bank habitats when riffle quality is poor and banks may serve as a refuge in highly disturbed systems. Such shifts in the distribution of benthos may be an early warning indicator of biotic impairment and have implications for biomonitoring and maintenance of habitat.

AB  - 1. A major threat to freshwater taxon diversity is the alteration of natural catchment Land use into agriculture. industry Or urban areas and the associated eutrophication of the water. In order to stop freshwater biodiversity loss, it is essential to quantify the relationships between freshwater diversity and catchment Land use and water nutrient concentrations.
   2. A literature survey was carried out oil biodiversity data from rivers and streams. Fish and macroinvertebrates were selected as focal groups, as they are widely used as indicator species of river and stream health. Only published data were selected that (a) compared data found at impaired sites with a pristine reference situation (either in time or space), (b) clearly defined the stressors Studied (Land use cover and/or nutrient concentrations), and (c) clearly defined biodiversity (number of native species. species lists or IBI-scores).
   3. The number of native taxa Found ill each Study was transferred in all index of relative taxon richness (RTR) ranging from 0 (severely altered) to 100 (pristine reference conditions). Only those taxa were included that were (at least) present in the most pristine situation. This made it possible to combine, compare and analyse results from different studies. Catchment Land use was expressed as the percentage of non-natural Land use (agriculture. industry. housing or mining). As a measure of nutrients, the concentrations of NO3. NH4, PO4, total N and total P ill the river and stream water were used.
   4. Over 240 published articles have been studied. but only 22 met the criteria described above and could be used for further analysis.
   5. This study showed that altered catchment Land use has a major effect oil freshwater biodiversity and that the rate of species loss is serious oil average every 10% of lost natural catchment Land use cover leads to a loss of almost 6% (+/-0.83) of the native freshwater fish and macroinvertebrate species.

AB  - 1. Throughout much of the tropics, habitat loss is increasing and intensifying on the unprotected land surrounding conservation areas. The influence of these land-use changes on biodiversity is poorly understood. This study used data on dung beetles, a taxonomic group widely acknowledged to be an effective ecological indicator of anthropogenic disturbance, to evaluate temporal changes in diversity inside a natural protected area.
   2. Using data from quantitative sampling events over the last 35 years along with an exhaustive review of the information available in museums and the literature, we present evidence suggesting that the dung beetles community structure has shifted dramatically over time at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.
   3. To date, 50 dung beetle species have been reported from La Selva. Of these, 10 (20%) were consistently collected within the study timeframe while 21 species (42%) were uncommon. Our results indicate a tendency toward decreasing species richness and changes in species composition over time.
   4. Analysis of the community structure revealed a decrease in diversity (H'), an increase in dominance (D) and a decrease in evenness (J) over the 35-year period; all of which can be linked to an increase in the dominance of one species (Onthophagus acuminatus). These changes were also reflected in the proportional abundance of major species guilds.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Despite the relatively low human impact within La Selva, this study suggests that the dung beetle community has changed as result of habitat loss in the surrounding landscape and the progressive increasing isolation of the reserve over the last 35 years. Our findings, together with studies of other biota in the reserve, indicate a worrying decline in the conservation value of La Selva in recent decades. This shift in the diversity and composition of native forest biota needs to be taken into account in future studies that continue to rely on La Selva as providing an intact baseline for comparative research. More importantly, we suggest that the size of the reserve may need to be increased if its ecological integrity is to be restored. This study provides further evidence that isolated protected areas may often fail to safeguard biodiversity in the long term, and that to be viable, conservation strategies urgently need to adopt a wider landscape perspective.

AB  - In this study, we have identified 6-L-biopterins and their glucosides as candidate structures for the consistently occurring algae-derived humic-like fluorophores (Em 440-460 nm) using a combination of fluorescence excitation-emission matrixes, size exclusion chromatography with fluorescence detector and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In intact algal cells, biopterins and their glucosides existed mainly as their reduced tetrahydrobiopterin (H4Bip) forms, and redox transformation from H4Bip to biopterin occurred with the exposure of intracellular algal organic matter to oxygen. During the degradation experiment under simulated natural conditions, light irradiation facilitated the utilization of biopterin by Microcystic aeruginosa and induced the photochemical degradation of 6-L-biopterin to 6-carboxypterin. The concentrations of 6-L-biopterin (without counting any other derivatives) ranged from 0.20 mu g/L to 2.78 mu g/L in water samples from 5 lakes in China. For an investigated sample from Lake Tai surface water, biopterin and its derivatives contributed to 24.0 +/- 1.1% of UV absorbance at 350 nm and 55.5 +/- 1.7% of fluorescence at Ex350/ Em450 nm of total chromophoric/fluorescent dissolved organic matter (CDOM/FDOM). During water treatment, pre-chlorination of algae-laden water induced the releases of biopterin and its derivatives into water, and the variation of biopterin fluorescence intensity can be used as a surrogate indicator for predicting algal membrane damage. Once released into water, biopterin could not be effectively removed by the conventional coagulation treatment irrespective of coagulant type, dose and water pH. The identification of ubiquitous pterins as candidate structures responsible for "humic-like" fluorophores is conducive to the understanding of the generation, property, behavior and fate of algae-derived CDOM/FDOM in natural and engineered water systems.

AB  - Forest biodiversity is highly linked with the occurrence of certain forest development phases (fdp) within the forest life cycle. Generally, the disintegration phase provides the highest biodiversity. The objective of the study was to test different existing forest life cycle assessment approaches aiming at developing a common reliable fdp assessment method. We tested and compared three approaches to record fdp in beech, mixed beech and spruce forests, in managed and unmanaged forests, and in four different plot sizes ranging from 125 to 2000 m(2). The main results of the fdp comparison are as follows:
   (1) In approximately two thirds of the cases the three considered methods did not yield a corresponding fdp record.
   (2) Generally, the larger the plot sizes, the larger the average fdp deviation in forest reserves.
   (3) The fdp deviation is stronger in beech or spruce dominated forest reserves than in mixed beech forest reserves.
   (4) Plots of 500 m(2) show most distinct numbers of microhabitats corresponding to the fdp sequence within the forest life cycle.
   (5) Furthermore, the managed forests mostly show lower fdp deviation than the forest reserves.
   One approach resulted in the most differentiated portrayal of the studied forest structures compared to the other two as shown by the facts that, (a) the studied forests are seen to be divided up into more fdp than when applying the other two methods, and that (b) the dominant fdp changed depending on the forest community and plot size reflecting different growth conditions and probabilities to meet large dimensioned trees during records, respectively, and (c) considering the distribution of microhabitats which are crucial for xylobiontic (saproxylic) organisms, this approach resulted in the assumed biodiversity patterns with increasing microhabitat numbers up to the disintegration phase thus it was used as a basis for the creation of an optimized fdp assessment method as a tool for common and standardized use in forest ecology and biodiversity research.

AB  - During the benthic cultivation process of Mytilus edulis (blue mussels), wild mussel seed is often transplanted from naturally occurring subtidal beds to sheltered in-shore waters to be grown to a commercial size. The survival of these relaid mussels is ultimately a function of their quality and physiological condition upon relaying and it has been recognised that mussels can suffer from a loss in condition following transportation. We investigated whether the process of being transported to ongrowing plots had a negative effect on the physiological health and resultant behaviour of mussels by simulating transportation conditions in a controlled experiment. Mussels were kept, out of water, in plastic piping to recreate translocation conditions and further, we tested if depth held in a ship hold (0, 1.5 and 3 m) and length of time emersed (12,24 and 48 h) affected mussel condition and behaviour. Physiological condition was assessed by quantifying mussel tissue pH and whole tissue glucose, glycogen, succinate and propionate concentrations. The rate of byssogenesis was also quantified to estimate recovery following a period of re-immersion. The depth at which mussels were held did not affect any of the physiological indicators of mussel stress but short-term byssus production was affected. Mussels held at 3 m produced fewer byssus threads during the first 72 h following re-immersion compared with mussels at 0 m (i.e. not buried) suggesting that depth held can impede recovery following transportation. Duration of emersion affected all stress indicators. Specifically, mussels held out of water for 48 h had a reduced physiological condition compared with those emersed for just 12 h. This work has practical implications for the benthic cultivation industry and based on these results we recommend that mussels are held out of water for less than 24 h prior to relaying to ensure physiological health and resultant condition is preserved.

AB  - Winged porphyroclasts are often used as kinematic or strain indicators in shear zones. In particular, it has been suggested that the geometry of delta-clasts in mylonites can give information about the theological behaviour of the matrix around the clast (Passchier et al., 1993). We tested this hypothesis with a numerical finite element simulation of the flow field of a viscous matrix around a relatively rigid clast. Power-law viscous flow properties of the matrix with stress-exponents of 1 (linear viscous), 3 and 5 were tested, as well as three different sets of approximately simple shear boundary conditions, which are relevant to experimental and/or natural situations,
   The simulations show that the flow field is primarily determined by the boundary conditions. The stress-exponent is of secondary importance. In general, the different boundary conditions produce two types of flow fields about the rigid clast: an eye-shaped flow field and a bow-tie shaped flow field. The former is produced by boundary conditions that approximate simple shear applied at an infinite distance from the rigid clast, and the latter is produced by boundary conditions which are equivalent to a shear box or ring shear apparatus. Although both the shear-box and ring-shear boundary conditions produce bow-tie flow patterns, the wing geometries which result from the flow patterns for these two cases can be significantly different.
   The geometry of the wings that develop on a delta-clast is a direct function of the flow field around the clast. For linear and non-linear theologies, only the ring-shear boundary conditions produce wings that show ''stair-stepping'' (i.e. wings that are parallel but not in the same plane). In natural shear zones, delta-clasts both with and without stair-stepping are observed. In comparing geologic observations with experimental or numerical modelling, it is essential to understand which boundary conditions are appropriate.

AB  - The tropical dry forest region along the western slope of Central America represents a biodiverse and fragile area that is under increasing pressure from agricultural production, thus threatening the provision of ecosystem services, the integrity of these landscapes, and the rural communities who depend on them. To address this issue, we evaluated the influence of common agricultural management practices (cropping and livestock systems) vs. the Quesungual slash-and-mulch agroforestry system (QSMAS) on diverse parameters of soil quality and function. We then used this information to identify soil invertebrate bioindicators that represent key aspects of soil quality (chemical fertility, physical properties, aggregate morphology, and biological functioning). In February of 2011 soil sampling was conducted on six hillside farms near the town of Somotillo in western Nicaragua to assess soil properties and the abundance and diversity of soil macrofauna within four management systems: (1) QSMAS, based on maize production, (2) traditional maize cropping system with few trees (TC), (3) silvopastoral system with low tree density (SP), and (4) secondary forest (SF), used as a reference. The conversion of forest to agriculture demonstrated the greatest impact of management in this study. For example, SF presented significantly higher diversity of soil invertebrate taxonomic groups than either TC or SP (P < 0.03), and demonstrated the lowest level of soil compaction, significantly less than SP (P < 0.05). Additionally, SF demonstrated the highest value of soil quality according to a synthetic indicator that integrates chemical, physical and biological aspects of soil quality. Although overall soil quality under QSMAS was lower than SF, this system demonstrated the highest abundance (number of individuals) of soil macrofauna, and appeared to at least partially mitigate the negative consequences of forest conversion on soil functioning. Using the Indicator Value Index, which ranks species according to their specificity and fidelity across sites, along with farmer consultation we found seven indicator taxa of soil quality that could greatly facilitate future evaluation of land management impacts by farmers and technicians in the region. We suggest that the methodology applied is robust and adaptable to diverse agroecological contexts and would allow for more rapid responses to evolving land use issues as they arise.

AB  - The conservation of biodiversity in Latin American metropolitan areas is threatened by the intense land-use and -cover change. Assessing the overall biodiversity changes in entire regions faces with the traditional lack of consistent biodiversity data. This work aims at contributing to this assessment through a set of major pressures to biodiversity defined from land-use and -cover changes, and evaluating their extent, distribution and correlations with geographical variables. The study was performed in the framework of the Metropolitan Urban Plan of Concepcion (MUPC, Chile). Land-use and -cover maps were obtained through image classification for the years 2000 and 2010, before and after the MUPC approval, and combined in a land-use and -cover change (LUCC) map. A set of pressures to biodiversity (natural and artificial forestation, deforestation, agricultural abandonment and expansion, and urbanization) was obtained from reclassifying the LUCC map. The correlations of these pressures with a set of geographical variables were assessed using canonical ordination methods. Finally, a preliminary forecast analysis of the effects of the MUPC was performed by combining the land-use and -cover map of 2010 with the urban-extension areas of the plan.
   Results showed that, in only 10 years, 57% of the Concepcion Metropolitan Area (CMA) was affected by land-use and -cover changes, and 48% was affected by the pressures to biodiversity. Artificial forestation and deforestation were the dominant pressures, followed by agricultural abandonment and urbanization. The geographical distribution of pressures during the 2000-2010 period also contributed to affect the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable management of the CMA. Indeed, natural forestation occurred close to urbanization, thus threatening the ecological integrity of native forests, while artificial forestation, deforestation and agricultural abandonment took place in steeply areas thus increasing landslide risk. Despite urbanization was not the most relevant pressure in the short studied period, urban development planned in the MUPC would determine an overall increase of 60% in the built-up area of the CMA, mostly affecting brushwood and forest plantations but also native forest and wetlands. Implications of these results for the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and the sustainable management of Latin American metropolis are finally discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Benthic eutrophication often gives origin to qualitative changes in marine and estuarine ecosystems, for example the shift in primary producers, often followed by changes in species composition and trophic structure at other levels. Through time such modifications may determine a selected new trophic structure. The development of structural dynamic models will allow to simulate such changes, using goal functions to guide ecosystem behaviour and development. The selection of other species and other food web may then be accounted by a continuous optimisation of model parameters according to an ecological goal function. Exergy has been applied in structural dynamic models of shallow lakes, and appears to be one of the most promising approaches. Theoretically, exergy is assumed to become optimised during ecosystems development, and ecosystems are supposed to self organise towards a state of an optimal configuration of this property. Exergy may then constitute not only a suitable system-oriented characteristic to express natural tendencies of ecosystems evolution, but also a good ecological indicator of ecosystems health. Biodiversity is also an important characteristic of ecosystems structure, constituting a powerful and traditional concept, which was found to be suitable to test the intrinsic ecological significance of exergy. We examined the properties of exergy (exergy and specific exergy) and biodiversity (species richness and heterogeneity) along an estuarine gradient of eutrophication, testing the hypothesis that they would follow the same trends in space and time. This hypothesis was validated in a certain extent, with exergy, specific exergy and species richness decreasing as a function of increasing eutrophication, but heterogeneity responding differently. Biodiversity measurements and their interpretation appeared subjective. Exergy and specific exergy may be a suitable alternative, that could be used as goal functions in ecological models and as holistic ecological indicators of ecosystems integrity. Nevertheless, since exergy and specific exergy showed to respond differently to ecosystems seasonal dynamics, it is advisable to use both complementary. The method proposed by Jorgensen et al. (1995) to estimate exergy, which takes into account the biomass of organisms and the thermodynamic information due to genes, appeared to be operational. There is nevertheless an obvious need for the determination of more accurate (discrete) weighing factors to estimate exergy from organisms biomass. We propose to explore the assumption that the dimension of active genomes, which are primarily a function of the required genetic information to build up an organism? are proportional to the relative contents of DNA in different organisms.

AB  - Mountain areas are characterized by geomorphic processes, especially mass wasting and snow avalanches, which may impact the landscape affecting also the biological component, trees included. If sites colonized by trees are characterized by geomorphic features with a high Global and Scientific Value, including Representativeness of geomorphological processes, Educational Exemplarity, and Integrity, they can be considered geomorphosites. In the framework of assessment of the Scientific Value of geomorphosites, Ecological Support Role is of great importance. Hence, tree rings derived information can be used as indicators to refine the Scientific Value of the sites and also to propose multidisciplinary approaches to understand landscape dynamics. In fact, trees colonizing sites of geomorphological interest are used for detecting past and present events and tree rings may be considered ecological indicators under different points of view. Arboreal vegetation can register growth disturbances in terms of morphological features, at macro- (particular morphologies of trunks) and micro-scale (annual growth rings, stress indicators like compression wood, traumatic resin ducts), becoming a powerful indicator of the geomorphic activity affecting the landscape. In some cases, combined with other techniques like climate data analysis, they may allow refining the often lacunose historical records of geomorphic events impacting different territories. The integrated analysis carried out in the Loana Valley (Sesia Val Grande UNESCO Geopark, Western Italian Alps), considering a selection of geomorphosites affected by mass wasting processes and snow avalanches and located along a touristic trail, allowed to detect which meteorological thresholds favour hydrogeological instability (i.e. overcome of Mean Annual Rainfall of 6-10%). Tree rings data coming from the investigated sites provided information on the recurrence of geomorphic activity, allowing filling gaps within the historical archives, by individuating years during which hydrogeological or snow-related events probably occurred and that were missed (i.e. 1986, 1989, 2001, 2007), and adding details on sites for which temporal constraints had not been found before (i.e. Pizzo Stagno Complex System). Finally, investigated sites demonstrated to differently record the history of instability affecting the area and this difference is mirrored in the sites values that are adopted in the framework of geoheritage analysis (Scientific Value, Ecological Support Role and Educational Exemplarity). The proposed multidisciplinary approach, including geomorphology, dendrogeomorphology and climatology, represents, hence, a useful tool in geoheritage valorisation and management strategies.

AB  - TAPHONOMIC ANALYSIS OF HOLOCENE CHITONS (POLYPLACOPHORA: MOLLUSCA) FROM TIERRA DEL FUEGO, ARGENTINA. Chitons from the marine Holocene of Tierra del Fuego represent a minor fraction of the mollusc assemblages, mostly composed of bivalves and gastropods. The reasons of their limited relative abundance are considered in this work. The analysis of their taphonomic and paleontologic attributes indicates that the taphonomic condition on a chiton plate is the result of a combination of biological, ecological and environmental factors. It is concluded that chitons are good paleoecological and paleoenvironmental indicators, since they maintain ecological fidelity with respect to their original paleocommunities and they are suitable to evaluate the post-mortem events that took place up to they are found within the fossil record.

AB  - Twenty-three headwater tidal creeks draining watersheds representative of forested, suburban, urban, and industrial land cover were sampled along the South Carolina coast from 1994 to 2002 to: (1) evaluate the degree to which impervious land cover is an integrative watershed-scale indicator of stress'. (2) synthesize and integrate the available data on linkages between land cover and tidal creek environmental quality into a conceptual model of the responses of tidal creeks to human development,- and (3) use the model to develop recommendations for conserving and restoring tidal creek ecosystems. The following parameters were evaluated: human population density, land use, impervious cover, creek physical characteristics, water quality, sediment chemical contamination and grain size characteristics, benthic chlorophyll a levels, porewater ammonia concentration, fecal coliform concentration, and macrobenthic and nekton population and community characteristics.
   The conceptual model was developed and used to identify the linkages among watershed-scale stressors, physical and chemical exposures, and biological responses of tidal creeks to human development at the watershed scale. This model provides a visual representation of the manner in which human population growth is linked to changes in the physiochemical environment and ultimately the nursery habitat function of tidal creeks and the safety of seafood harvested from headwater tidal creeks. The ultimate stressor on the tidal creek ecosystem is the human population density in the watershed and associated increases in the amount of impervious land cover. Measurable adverse changes in the physical and chemical environment were observed when the impervious cover exceeded 10-20%, including altered hydrography, changes in salinity variance, altered sediment characteristics, increased chemical contaminants, and increased fecal coliform loadings. Living resources responded when impervious cover exceeded 20-30%. The impacts on the living resources included reduced abundance of stress-sensitive macrobenthic taxa, reduced abundance of commercially and recreationally important shrimp, and altered food webs. Headwater tidal creeks appear to provide early warning of ensuing harm to larger tidal creeks, tidal rivers and estuaries, and the amount of impervious cover in a watershed appears to be an integrative measure of the adverse human alterations of the landscape. Through education and community involvement, a conservation ethic may be fostered that encourages the permanent protection of lands for the services they provide. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article proposes a quantitative analysis to measure social vulnerability in a urban space, specifically in the area of the Municipality of Rome. Social vulnerability can be defined as a situation in which people are characterized by a condition of multidimensional deprivation that encompasses multiple aspects of life and exposes population to different risks and hazards produced by natural, environmental, socioeconomic and epidemic factors. The analysis that follows presents the use of multivariate methods and models to provide an index for every dimensions of vulnerability (housing quality, social context, education, employment, urban mobility, social relations and economic conditions) and a global index for mapping social vulnerability. The analysis also succeeds in identifying significant vulnerability spatial patterns and to measure how and if vulnerability can be different in case of an observed heterogeneity in urban space.

AB  - The proteolytic sulphide-producing bacteria (PSPB) are widely distributed in water and sediment and are a good indicator of the ecological status of ecosystems. From the ecological point of view it is important to distinguish the physiological group of PSPB from other bacteria producing H,S from sulphate, sulphite or thiosulphate. A flew medium named peptone-cysteine-ammonium iron citrate agar (PCA) was developed and tested. The medium regularly gave a higher number of colony forming units than the control media for detection of sulphide formation, indole production and motility (Merck) and iron sulphite agar (Oxoid). For the enumeration of PSPB from the environment, the simultaneous incubation of samples in aerobic and anaerobic conditions is recommended and a higher number should be taken for interpretation.

AB  - Biodeterioration is a major problem for the conservation of cultural heritage materials. We provide a new and original approach to analyzing changes in patterns of colonization (Biodeterioration patterns, BPs) by biological agents responsible for the deterioration of outdoor stone materials. Here we analyzed BPs of four Khmer temples in Angkor (Cambodia) exposed to variable environmental conditions, using qualitative ecological assessments and statistical approaches. The statistical analyses supported the findings obtained with the qualitative approach. Both approaches provided additional information not otherwise available using one single method. Our results indicate that studies on biodeterioration can benefit from integrating diverse methods so that conservation efforts might become more precise and effective.

AB  - The relationship of carabid beetle species occurrence patterns and environmental variables characterising the hydrological regime has been studied at the River Elbe in Central Germany. Both flood duration and groundwater depth had major influence on species assemblages as the ordination of study plots mainly followed a gradient along these two variables. The simultaneous ordination of the plots according to species occurrence and environmental parameters showed a highly significant joint structure with the first two axes of a co-inertia analysis, explaining >98% of the variance. A total of 27 species out of 129 caught fulfilled criteria of fidelity and specificity to the plots of the five clusters revealed by their abiotic conditions and were sufficiently abundant to be suitable indicators for one or a combination of clusters of plots.

AB  - Pollen-mediated gene flow of genetically modified crops to their wild relatives can facilitate the spread of transgenes into the ecosystem and alter the fitness of the consequential progeny. A two-year field study was conducted to quantify the gene flow from glufosinate-ammonium resistant (GR) soybean (Glycine max) to its wild relative, wild soybean (G. soja), and assess the potential weed risk of hybrids resulting from the gene flow during their entire life cycle under field conditions in Korea, where wild soybean is the natural inhabitant. Pollen-mediated gene flow from GR soybeans to wild soybeans ranged from 0.292% (mixed planting) to 0.027% at 8 m distance. The log-logistic model described the gene flow rate with increasing distance from GR soybean to wild soybean; the estimated effective isolation distance for 0.01% gene flow between GR and wild soybeans was 37.7 m. The F1 and F2 hybrids exhibited the intermediate characteristics of their parental soybeans in their vegetative and reproductive stages. Canopy height and stem length of hybrids were close to those of wild soybean, which shows an indeterminate growth; the numbers of flowers, pods, and seeds per hybrid plant were close to those of wild soybean and significantly higher than those of GR soybean. Seed longevity of F2 hybrid plants was also intermediate but significantly greater than that of GR soybean due to high seed dormancy. Our results suggest that transgenes of the GR soybean might disperse into wild populations and persist in the agroecosystem of the genetic origin regions due to the pollen-mediated gene flow and the relatively high fitness of the hybrid progeny.

AB  - The "in-stream exposure model" iSTREEM(R), a Web-based model made freely available to the public by the American Cleaning Institute, provides a means to estimate concentrations of "down-the-drain" chemicals in effluent, receiving waters, and drinking water intakes across national and regional scales under mean annual and low-flow conditions. We provide an overview of the evolution and utility of the iSTREEM model as a screening-level risk assessment tool relevant for down-the-drain products. The spatial nature of the model, integrating point locations of facilities along a hydrologic network, provides a powerful framework to assess environmental exposure and risk in a spatial context. A case study compared national distributions of modeled concentrations of the fragrance 1,3,4,6,7,8-Hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8,-hexamethylcyclopenta-g-2-benzopyran (HHCB) and the insect repellent N, N-Diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) to available monitoring data at comparable flow conditions. The iSTREEM low-flow model results yielded a conservative distribution of values, whereas the mean-flow model results more closely resembled the concentration distribution of monitoring data. We demonstrate how model results can be used to construct a conservative estimation of the distribution of chemical concentrations for effluents and streams leading to the derivation of a predicted environmental concentration (PEC) using the high end of the concentration distribution (e.g., 90th percentile). Data requirements, assumptions, and applications of iSTREEM are discussed in the context of other down-the-drain modeling approaches to enhance understanding of comparative advantages and uncertainties for prospective users interested in exposure modeling for ecological risk assessment.

AB  - Community-based assessment of protozoa is usually performed at a taxon-dependent resolution. As an inherent 'taxon-free' trait, however, body-size spectrum has proved to be a highly informative indicator to summarize the functional structure of a community in both community research and monitoring programs in aquatic ecosystems. To demonstrate the relationships between the taxon-free resolution of protozoan communities and water conditions, the body-size spectra of biofilm-dwelling protozoa and their seasonal shift and environmental drivers were explored based on an annual dataset collected monthly from coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China. Body sizes were calculated in equivalent spherical diameter (ESD). Among a total of 8 body-size ranks, S2 (19-27 mu m), S3 (28-36 mu m), S4 (37-50 mu m) and S5 (53-71 mu m) were the top four levels in frequency of occurrence, while rank Si (13-17 mu m), S2 and S4 were the dominant levels in abundance. These dominants showed a clear seasonal succession: S2/S4 (spring) -> S2/S4 (summer) -> S4 (autumn) -> S2 (winter) in frequency of occurrence; Si (spring) -> S4 (summer) -> S2 (autumn) -> Si (winter) in abundance. Bootstrapped average analysis showed a clear seasonal shift in body-size spectra of the protozoa during a 1-year cycle, and the best-matching analysis demonstrated that the temporal variations in frequency of occurrence and abundance were significantly correlated with water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), alone or in combination with chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrients. Thus, the body-size spectra of biofilm-dwelling protozoa were seasonally shaped and might be used as a time and cost efficient bioindicator of water quality in marine ecosystems.

AB  - Water management practices alternative to continuous flooding are highly required to enhance water use efficiency and safeguard environmental quality in temperate rice agro-ecosystems. In this work, we carried out a two year field experiment (2012-2013) in a rice paddy in NW Italy to evaluate and quantify the agro-environmental sustainability of three different water management practices involving (i) water seeding and continuous flooding (WFL), (ii) dry seeding and flooding at tillering stage (DFL), and (iii) dry seeding and intermittent irrigation (DIR). The effects of water management on agronomic parameters, such as crop yields, yield components and the apparent N recovery were evaluated for four rice varieties (Gladio, Baldo, Selenio e Loto) representing the main Italian grain types. We also evaluated net irrigation, water use efficiency, nitrate leaching and runoff, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the different management practices. Water management strongly affected grain yields and qualitative yield components. Whereas WFL and DFL showed similar yields, DIR resulted in significant yield reductions by 28, 24, 19 and 14% for the four varieties, respectively. This 'was related to a lower tillering rate, and reduced N uptake and apparent fertilizer N recovery. Intermittent irrigation however showed lowest net irrigation and consequently a higher water use efficiency (56%) with respect to WFL (22%) and DFL (26%). High soil solution nitrate concentrations and leaching from the root zone as a result of nitrification under oxic soil conditions represented the greatest environmental constrain of dry seeded cropping systems. On the other hand, water management practices alternative to continuous flooding, in particular DIR, strongly contributed to mitigate GHG emissions and reduce the Global Warming Potential of these cropping systems by up to 70-90%.

AB  - Although toxic chemicals constitute a major threat for wildlife, their effects have been mainly assessed at the individual level and under laboratory conditions. Predicting population-level responses to pollutants in natural conditions is a major and ultimate task in ecological and ecotoxicological research. The present study aims to estimate the effect of mercury (Hg) levels on future apparent survival rates and breeding performances. We used a long-term data set (similar to 10 years) and recently developed methodological tools on two closely related Antarctic top predators, the South Polar Skua Catharacta maccormicki from Adelie Land and the Brown Skua C. lonnbergi from the Kerguelen Archipelago. Adult survival rates and breeding probabilities were not affected by Hg levels, but breeding success in the following year decreased with increasing Hg levels. Although South Polar Skuas exhibited much lower Hg levels than Brown Skuas, they suffered from higher Hg-induced breeding failure. This species difference could be attributed to an interaction between Hg and other environmental perturbations, including climate change and a complex cocktail of pollutants. By including Hg-dependent demographic parameters in population models, we showed a weak population decline in response to increasing Hg levels. This demographic decline was more pronounced in South Polar Skuas than in Brown Skuas. Hence, Hg exposure differently affects closely related species. The wide range of environmental perturbations in Antarctic regions could exacerbate the demographic responses to Hg levels. In that respect, we urge future population modeling to take into account the coupled effects of climate change and anthropogenic pollution to estimate population projections.

AB  - The sedimentary record from lakes can be used as an archive of past environmental changes and for events related to anthropogenic activities in the catchment area. In this paper, we review the more recent studies on zoobenthos responses to changes in lake productivity and to altered sublittoral and hypolimnetic oxygen conditions, as reflected from subfossil midge (Diptera: Chironomidae) assemblages and palaeostratigraphies. We discuss how the importance of different environmental variables is scale dependent in both time and space and we summarize some of the classical and general patterns in chironomid palaeolimnology. The recent advances in quantitative reconstructions using chironomid transfer functions and numerical analyses are presented and compared. A consensus ranking of species trophic optima and respiratory adaptations from published data sets showed good agreement. Factors such as lake depth, stratification patterns, water level change, sediment conditions, submerged vegetation and ecological thresholds are all important for interpretation of palaeolimnological trajectories. We use previously published and new data to document how these factors determine, change or preserve the "lake identity" over time. We conclude that subfossil chironomids have proven to be very effective indicators for lake trophic development (productivity) and hypolimnetic oxygen conditions. Challenges in interpreting the subfossil chironomid record include the interaction between a range of scale-dependent variables and processes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper is concerned incorporating landscapes ecological and cultural values in infrastructure planning. We focus on cultural heritage connectivity in the context of environmental impact statements in transportation infrastructure planning. Using a case study from south-central Sweden cultural heritage indicators from maps were defined, and a GIS-based automated search tool is developed for analysing cultural heritage connectivity from an antiquarian perspective. Analyses of cultural heritage connectivity can inform about the historical and/or present function of the landscape and its social and economic conditions. While this type of connectivity can be searched out using information from maps, a difficulty lies in communicating the knowledge in an interesting way to non-experts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The results of a bioindication study based on the diversity of epiphytic lichens in a semi-arid area of South Italy are presented. The area features the presence of an industrial zone located in a rural context. The survey was performed in 20 sampling sites. The lichen diversity values (LDV) were determined by the frequencies of all lichen species within a sampling grid placed on tree trunks. Lichens demonstrated a condition of environmental alteration extending to the industrial zone, and tending towards a recovery in the rural surroundings. The survey also showed evidence of eutrophication all over the study area.

AB  - Benthic diatoms form an important component of the microphytobenthos and have long been utilised as suitable bioindicators in aquatic systems. However, knowledge on benthic diatom community succession on hard substrata (biofilm) remains understudied in austral marine coastal systems. In this study, we investigated benthic diatom colonisation on artificial substrates (Plexiglass) over a period of 5 weeks at two locations with different physical environments along the warm temperate coast of South Africa. Results revealed relatively similar physico-chemical conditions but highly contrasting diatom community development were observed between the two sites. While there were some shared taxa, site-specific dynamics resulted in significantly different diatom species diversity and richness, facilitated by common (e.g., Nitzschia ventricosa and Cocconeis scutellum) and a large percentage of rarely observed species such as Cocconeis testudo and Lyrella lyra. A total of 134 species belonging to 44 genera were observed during the study. The overall diatom composition differed spatio-temporally during the experimental period, with the fluctuating species occurrences and abundances highlighting the rapid microalgal species turnover within days, under natural conditions. Environmental variables were shown to have varying influences as drivers of the diatom community descriptors. Multivariate modelling confirmed that study site and the interaction between site and sampling occasion were important predictors of diatom abundances, and the overall observed community composition. The current results suggest that benthic diatoms on artificial substrata could be incorporated as suitable indicators of change along the coastline subject to further investigations, taking into account site-specific differences driven by habitat complexity and environmental variability. The experimental method proved to be efficient and can be implemented to study the response of benthic diatoms to localised nutrient enrichment around the coastline.

AB  - Phragmites australis is the dominant species in the Yellow River Delta and plays an important role in wetland ecosystems. In order to evaluate the relationship between phenotypic variation and environmental factors, explore how functional traits respond to changes in electrical conductivity and soil water content, and reveal the ecological strategies of P. australis, we investigated the ecological responses of P. australis to soil properties based on 96 plots along the coastal-inland regions in the Yellow River Delta of China. Within the range of soil water content (SWC, 9.39%-36.92%) and electrical conductivity (EC, 0.14-13.29 ms/cm), the results showed that (a) the effects of salinity were more important than the soil water content for the characterization of the morphological traits and that plant functional traits including leaf traits and stem traits responded more strongly to soil salinity than soil water content; (b) compared with morphological traits such as average height and internode number, physiological traits such as SPAD value, as well as morphological traits closely related to physiological traits such as specific leaf area and leaf thickness, showed stronger stability in response to soil water and salinity; and (c) under the condition of high electrical conductivity, P. australis improved its water acquisition ability by increasing indicators such as leaf water content and leaf thickness. In addition, with the increase in plant tolerance to stress, more resources were used to resist external stress, and the survival strategy was inclined toward the stress tolerator (S) strategy. Under low EC conditions, P. australis increased specific leaf area and leaf area for its growth in order to obtain resources rapidly, while its survival strategy gradually moved toward the competitor (C) strategy.

AB  - Environmental stress conditions are ultimately related to the induction of oxidative stress in organisms, as a consequence of an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This could be exploited to study sub-lethal effects induced by the environment in the organisms. In the present work, we evaluate the possibility to use the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri as a bioindicator, to assess the environmental quality in the Lagoon of Venice. Three colony batches were immersed, for 22 days, at two sites (I and 2) with different grades of hydrodynamics and anthropogenic impact and physico-chemical features of seawater; a control batch was kept in a large tank with continuous seawater flow at the Marine Station of the Department of Biology, University of Padova, in Chioggia (site 3). Seawater at site 2 had higher pH and temperature than site I. Colonies were then retrieved, their mRNA was extracted and the level of transcription of genes involved in oxidative stress response (glutathione synthase, gamma-glutamyl-cysteine ligase, modulatory subunit, two isoforms of glutathione peroxidases and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase) was evaluated. In colonies from sites 1 and 2, most genes showed significantly increased transcriptional levels with respect to control Values. Spectrophotometric analyses of colony homogenates revealed that the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase was higher in colonies from site 2 as compared to site 1, allowing us to speculate that colonies in site 2 were under higher stress level than those in site 1. Overall, we can conclude that B. schlosseri seems a good indicator of the ecological status of the Lagoon environment, within a range of pH and temperature in which colonies are used to live.

AB  - Loss of biodiversity and altered ecosystem functioning are driven by the cumulative effects of multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors affecting both quantity and quality of water resources. Here we performed a 40-day laboratory microcosm experiment to assess the individual and combined effects of drought and the model fungicide tebuconazole (TBZ) on leaf litter decomposition (LLD), a fundamental biogeochemical process in freshwater ecosystems. Starting out from a worst-case scenario perspective, leaf-associated microbial communities were exposed to severe drought conditions (four 5-day drought periods alternated with 4-day immersion periods) and/or a chronic exposure to TBZ (nominal concentration of 20 mu g L-1). We assessed the direct effects of drought and fungicide on the structure (biomass, diversity) and activity (extracellular enzymatic potential) of fungal and bacterial assemblages colonizing leaves. We also investigated indirect effects on the feeding rates of the amphipod Gammarus fossarum on leaves previously exposed to drought and/or TBZ contamination. Results indicate a stronger effect of drought stress than fungicide contamination under the experimental conditions applied. Indeed, the drought stress strongly impacted microbial community structure and activities, inhibiting the LLD process and leading to cascading effects on macroinvertebrate feeding. However, despite the lack of significant effect of TBZ applied alone, the effects of drought on microbial functions (i.e., decrease in LLD and in enzymatic activities) and on Gammarus feeding rates were more pronounced when drought and TBZ stresses were applied together. In a perspective of ecological risk assessment and ecosystem management for sustainability, these findings stress the need for deeper insight into how multiple stressors can affect the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and associated services.

AB  - The benefits of low input farming on biodiversity and ecosystem services are already well-established, however most of these studies focus only on the focal field scales. We aimed to study whether these benefits exist at the whole farm scale, to find the main environmental driving effects on biodiversity at the whole farm scale in farms of different grassland grazing intensity, applying three well-known species diversity indicator groups of different ecological traits.
   Edaphic (earthworms), epigeic (spiders) and flying (bees) taxa were sampled in each identified habitat type within 18 low-input farms in Central Hungary, 2010. The number of habitat types, the number of grassland plots, the cumulative area of grasslands and habitat type had an effect on the species richness and abundance of spiders, while grassland grazing intensity influenced the species richness of bees. Both bees and spiders were sensitive to vegetation and weather conditions, resulting in more bees on flower-rich farms and those having higher temperature; and more spiders on farms with more heterogeneous vegetation structure and in low-wind areas. Relatively few earthworms were found in the whole study, and their abundance was not influenced by any of the farm composition and management variables.
   We conclude that local field management (grazing intensity of grassland patches) can have a farm scale effect, detectable on species diversity indicators that have high dispersal ability and strong connection to grasslands as important foraging sites (bees). However, other farmland biota (spiders) is also strongly determined by farmland composition and habitat diversity, therefore the maintenance of a mosaic within-farm habitat structure is strongly recommended. The application of earthworms as farmland composition or management indicators is strongly restricted because of their special needs of soil conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The physiological state of the animal's body can be characterized based on hematological indicators since blood plays a special role in the body. Moving nutrients and active biological substances, the blood plays the regulator role of all vital functions of the body. Around each cell, it creates the internal environment of the body, the stability of the conductor, which is necessary for the life of all organs and tissues. It is widely known that the state of a living organism depends on the protective properties and adaptability of its body. Biochemical analysis of the blood composition can characterize these properties. The obtained data were compared with the reference indicators of metabolism in the body of cows. The determining results of total protein and protein fractions content in the blood serum indicate that the individuals of the experimental groups as a result of the influence of adverse environmental factors on the animal body revealed a small decrease in the concentration of total protein and manifest significant changes in the proteinogram, while the protein composition of the blood serum undergoes significant changes when compared with the normal spectrum of proteins. It was found that the total concentration of sugar in the blood of cows is significantly lower than the reference values indicating a direct relationship with the concentration of total protein and the nature of the serum proteinogram. Changes in the most important metabolic concentrations of carbohydrates in the blood of cows are narrowly directed and confirm the data obtained on liver dysfunction, but the rate of increase in their level is different. For the level of pyruvic acid, the main metabolites of glycolysis and glyconeogenesis are significantly higher than the reference values.

AB  - Spatial variability in environmental conditions has been attributed as the main driver behind marine biodiversity in structurally complex environments. Despite this, spatial heterogeneity, reflecting terrain organisation of environmental conditions, is seldom quantified in the marine environment, especially at regional scale. In contrast, quantification of spatial patterns has been widely applied to characterise structural features of terrestrial landscapes and has been demonstrated to be of great use in landscape ecology and spatial planning. To address this discrepancy, we use landscape ecology indices (entropy-based contagion) and objective automated marine landscape mapping techniques to quantify marine landscape heterogeneity and evaluate the use of this metric as proxy for biodiversity in submarine canyons. Submarine canyons enhance marine landscape diversity at regional scales and provide unique habitats for diverse and abundant faunal assemblages. The deep and complex topography, strong currents and occurrence of specific oceanographic patterns affect the habitat heterogeneity potentially making canyons a hotspot for biological activity, with high faunal diversity.
   Here, multibeam bathymetry and sidescan sonar imagery were used to generate a marine landscape map for Whittard Canyon, NE Atlantic, using objective automated classification and object-based image analysis (OBIA). The resulting marine landscape map was characterised by seven landscape types, of which five were found to be ecologically relevant using species indicator analysis (IrsroVAL). Spatial heterogeneity within the landscape map was then quantified with the entropy-based contagion index. Differences in the entropy -based contagion index were highly significant between canyon branches and the lower canyon. The two main canyon branches were not significantly different from each other. Differences in entropy -based contagion value across seabed areas can help to determine areas suitable for the establishment of Marine Protected Area.

AB  - Hydropower plants are an important source of renewable energy. In the near future, high-head storage hydropower plants will gain further importance as a key element of large-scale electricity production systems. However, these power plants can cause hydropeaking which is characterized by intense unnatural discharge fluctuations in downstream river reaches. Consequences on environmental conditions in these sections are diverse and include changes to the hydrology, hydraulics and sediment regime on very short time scales. These altered conditions affect river ecosystems and biota, for instance due to drift and stranding of fishes and invertebrates. Several structural and operational measures exist to mitigate hydropeaking and the adverse effects on ecosystems, but estimating and predicting their ecological benefit remains challenging. We developed a conceptual framework to support the ecological evaluation of hydropeaking mitigation measures based on current mitigation projects in Switzerland and the scientific literature. We refined this framework with an international panel of hydropeaking experts. The framework is based on a set of indicators, which covers all hydrological phases of hydropeaking and the most important affected abiotic and biotic processes. Effects of mitigation measures on these indicators can be predicted quantitatively using prediction tools such as discharge scenarios and numerical habitat models. Our framework allows a comparison of hydropeaking effects among alternative mitigation measures, to the pre-mitigation situation, and to reference river sections. We further identified key issues that should be addressed to increase the efficiency of current and future projects. They include the spatial and temporal context of mitigation projects, the interactions of river morphology with hydropeaking effects, and the role of appropriate monitoring to evaluate the success of mitigation projects.

AB  - European semi-natural calcareous grasslands are species-rich ecosystems, considered as priority habitats by the European Union (92/43/EEC Directive) and judged worthy of conservation. They are in strong decline in extension and are threatened by abandonment throughout Europe. It is known that grasslands management (grazing, mowing) acts as driving force in plant community diversity, which in turn is an important conservation aim of European environmental policies. The area of current pastoral landscape (about 1000 ha) of the North Adriatic (Cicarija, Croatia) was studied in order: 1/ to understand which factors drive floristic differentiation - environmental features and/or grassland management conditions, 2/ to identify indicator species sets linked to those factors and 3/ to appraise the effects of management type on the coenological and functional composition of indicator species. 73 phytosociological releves were carried out; for each of them field data (altitude, aspect, slope and land form), productivity measurements and information on grassland management were collected. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified a productivity-related soil moisture gradient as the environmental driving force of grassland floristic differentiation. Indicator species analysis (ISA) detected the indicator species sets related to environmental features and management type. The results indicate that undergrazing and the lack of periodic mowing are responsible for the higher total variance of floristic data set explained by environmental parameters rather than by management (use/not use). For the same reasons, the variations that emerged from comparison of the functional characteristics of the indicator species of grazing and of mowing (avoidance strategy, life form, and storage organs) proved more important than those observed in comparing used and abandoned grasslands. The management system adopted (grazing or mowing) appears in turn to be conditioned by the soil moisture/productivity gradient.

AB  - 1. Improved water quality, through a reduction in diffuse pollution from agricultural sources, is an expected benefit of agri-environment schemes, but this has yet to be demonstrated in practice. Here, we evaluate the impact of Welsh agri-environment schemes on water quality and freshwater ecosystem condition through a combined monitoring and modelling framework.
   2. To determine the influence of the agri-environment schemes on ecosystem condition, spatially independent catchments dominated by a single scheme (>40% of catchment) were compared to control catchments dominated (>70%) by agricultural land that was not part of any scheme. Biological indicators of water quality were monitored at the outfall of each catchment and a spatially explicit modelling framework of diffuse pollutant emissions applied to each of the 80 catchments.
   3. Direct comparison ( scheme/non-scheme) was unable to identify any significant effect of agri-environment scheme participation. However, derived biological indicators that reflected organic pollution, eutrophication and pesticide run-off were strongly correlated with modelled concentrations of corresponding diffuse pollutants, thus providing a ground-truth for the models. Scenarios that assessed the correct counterfactuals ( i.e. the influence of scheme entry on pollutant output) were developed for the whole of Wales. The models indicated an important effect of scheme entry on water quality, but this effect was not evenly distributed across the landscape.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that agri-environment schemes can deliver improvements in water quality, through a reduction in diffuse pollution from agricultural sources. However, it is not easy to demonstrate scheme effectiveness; the combination of field survey and modelling used here provides a framework for addressing these difficulties. A spatially targeted approach for agri-environment scheme options to protect water resources from diffuse pollution is likely to be most effective at delivering water quality improvements.

AB  - Plant nutrition conditions are limited in naturally acidic soil due to harmful hydrogen and aluminium ions. More favourable conditions for plant nutrition (soil liming) will affect root qualitative and quantitative parameters and influence ecosystem stability. Four legume-grass swards were cultivated. The swards were a combination of one species of legume and two species of grasses: Trifolium pratense L., Trifolium repens L., Trifolium hybridum L., Medicago sativa L. (each of 50%) with Phleum pratense L. (35%) and Poa pratensis L. (15%). The aim of this study is to evaluate the root morphological and soil biological indicators of legume-grass swards under the first two years of development in soils with different pH levels.Sward ecosystem development depends on the pH of the soil, sward species composition and soil biota. During the first year of sward development, soil pH had a significant influence on the morphology of root system. Swards root mass and total root length was 2.4 and 2.2 times bigger in naturally acidic soil. This resulted in a change of biological parameters.In the second year of sward development, soil pH had no significant influence on swards root mass. However, under the impact of different soil pH, various swards root systems were formed and the root C:N ratio had changed. It is observed that, regardless of the sward species composition and the year of development, at higher root C:N ratio soil microbial biomass was higher and CO2 emissions were lower in swards in naturally acidic soils.Regardless of soil pH, different types of clover-grass swards promoted organic carbon immobilization in microbial biomass and, at the same time, stabilized the sward ecosystem in the top soil layer (soil respiration in 0-10 and 10-20cm layers was lower) more effectively than the alfalfa-grass sward.

AB  - As climate-driven environmental changes and anthropogenic perturbations increasingly affect ecological systems, the number of abrupt phase shifts in ecosystem dynamics is rising, with far-reaching ecological, economic and social effects. These shifts are notoriously difficult to study, anticipate and manage. Although indicators of impending phase shifts in ecosystems have been described theoretically, they have only been observed empirically either after the fact or under controlled experiments. Here we demonstrate the usefulness of case-specific simulation models to estimate tipping points in the dynamics of real ecological systems, characterise how these thresholds may vary depending on local conditions and derive safe management targets associated with low risk of undesirable phase shifts. Under the combined effects of ocean changes and fishing, inshore rocky reefs in eastern Tasmania can transition from dense seaweed beds to sea urchin 'barrens' habitat, realising severe local loss of habitat, productivity and valuable fisheries. Using Monte-Carlo simulations with a validated model that realistically captures reef dynamics, we characterise the hysteresis in community dynamics and the variability in ecological thresholds along the gradient of environmental conditions. Simulation suggests that prevention of ongoing sea urchin destructive grazing of macroalgal beds is achievable but the yet-to-be-observed restoration of seaweed beds from extensive sea urchin barrens is highly unlikely. To guide management against undesirable phase shifts, we define target points associated with low risk of widespread barrens formation and show that, along with sea urchin culling, recognising the role of lobsters in mitigating sea urchin destructive grazing through predation is key to maintain reef productivity.

AB  - To estimate the importance of community structure and environmental factors for maintenance and in situ conservation of populations of European Globeflower (Trollius europaeus subsp. europaeus) in four sites (one within a natural reserve) in a low elevation but cool valley of the Transylvanian Carpathian foothills, an inventory of all globeflower individuals was performed and floristic releves were recorded in different community types (meadow, fen and scrub). As a surrogate for habitat conditions, we used plant species indicator values for light, moisture and nitrogen. Globeflower density is highest in mesic habitats, the ecological optimum estimated (about 6 on Ellenberg's scale) being slightly lower than that indicated for Central Europe (7). The juvenile:fertile plants ratio (J:F) declines with increasing soil moisture. Larger flower production in hygrophilous communities does not result in a higher proportion of juveniles or J:F ratio. Despite the presumed strong competition determined by high species richness in some host communities, the most dynamic population (large proportion of juveniles) was found in mesophilous, mown meadows. A clumped distribution of fertile plants under the open scrub canopy seems to be responsible for the significantly larger number of flowers per individual observed, as compared with the relative amount of flowers produced in the adjacent sward. Irrespective of host community, the juveniles display an aggregated distribution with respect to fertile plants, which is probably related to short-distance dispersal of seeds. Our results reveal the importance of host community species richness and soil moisture for the target population stage structure and reproductive investment. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Hydrologic alteration is a major threat to freshwater biota, and particularly fish, in many river courses around the world. We analyzed and compared the effects of water abstraction on two threatened cyprinid fishes of contrasting ecology (the Mediterranean barbel Barbus meridionalis and the Catalan chub Squalius laietanus) in a Mediterranean stream. We compared abundance, size-structure, growth, and condition of both species across perennial and artificially intermittent reaches affected by water abstraction. Both species were less abundant, had scarce large individuals, and displayed slower growth rates (length-at-age) in intermittent reaches, showing clear detrimental effects of water diversion. Mixed-effect models of scale increments showed variation among individuals and among sites, years and age classes for both species. The larger-sized, water-column species (chub) disappeared or was rare in many intermittent reaches. The barbel present in intermittent reaches showed better somatic condition than in sites with permanent flow, perhaps due to reduced competition after rewetting or colonization by better fitted individuals. This benthic, rheophilic species seems more resilient to moderate water abstraction than chub. Many effects of water flow intermittency were only detected on fish life-history traits when accounting for natural, often non-linear, variation, along upstream-downstream gradients. Our results suggest that abundance was the strongest indicator of effects of water abstraction on fish populations, whereas condition was a more labile trait, rapidly recovering from anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - Riverbanks are very dynamic habitats for riparian vegetation strongly influenced by fluvial and geomorphic processes. This habitat type was severely reduced in the past by river straightening and bank stabilisation. Restoration and establishment of new floodplain streams promote this habitat, but a directed succession to later stages was observed many times. Our study aimed to analyse whether the often observed directed succession of the streambank vegetation after restoration implementation could be reversed by a natural flood along a newly created floodplain stream. We investigated the effects of a natural flood in 2013 and different prerestoration conditions on species development in the riparian zone. Vegetation was studied along 12 transects in four different sections from 2011 to 2014. Species composition differed strongly between the sections. Species richness was lowest in a newly dug steep section with high morphological dynamics and highest on wider flat streambanks. Changes during the years reflecting different hydrological events varied between sections. The high natural flood in 2013 reduced the cover of the herb layer and increased bare ground, which led in most sections to a loss of nontarget species. Total target species richness did not change due to the natural flood, while target species showed a high turnover rate. In the following year, however, the flood-induced development of species composition, in general, was reversed. Natural floods changed abiotic and biotic conditions along the streambank, but they did not accelerate ecological restoration towards predefined target ecosystems. However, they were necessary to preserve the needed dynamic vegetation changes and species turnover to hinder the succession to later stages dominated by a few species. Our study shows that riparian vegetation near the streambank can be monitored most effectively in cross-profile transects, both in the long-term and event-related.

AB  - While long-term monitoring is essential to improve our knowledge of marine ecosystems health, it remains challenging to summarise complex ecological data in order to characterise and understand biodiversity trends. To compile monitoring data across large numbers of species, scientists and policymakers mainly rely on diversity and species richness indices. This task may prove complicated however, as many indices exist and no individual metric undoubtedly emerges as the best overall. Here, using data from zooplankton surveys from 1998 to 2014, we examined year-to-year changes in copepod communities in two littoral ecosystems of Western Europe - the Arcachon Bay and the Gironde estuary - that share similar climate, but with different local ecological processes, especially hydrological conditions. We tested the ability of commonly used a and beta-diversity metrics, such as species richness, Pielou's evenness or Jaccard's index, to mirror year-to-year changes in species abundances and we detected a synchronous change in both copepod abundances and a-diversity that took place circa 2005 in the two sites. In response to changes in environmental conditions such as nutrients, salinity, river discharge or particulate matter, two opposite biodiversity trends were observed, with a decrease in copepod diversity in the Arcachon Bay but an increase in the downstream part of the Gironde estuary. Although diversity metrics allowed us to well detect trends, the use of multivariate approaches such as principal component analysis provided important information on how and why diversity fluctuates. Our study provides evidence that long-term monitoring programmes must be encouraged for optimising management and conservation actions such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and that more local comparative studies need to be initiated for better characterising diversity trajectories at very fine scales at which ecologists often work.

AB  - Total hydrolysable amino acids (THAAs) constitute the most important fraction of labile nitrogen. Anthropogenic activities directly influence various biogeochemical cycles and then accelerate lake ecosystem deterioration. This is the first study that has established the relationship between sediment THAAs and anthropogenic activities using dated sediment cores, and evaluated the possibility of THAAs release at the sediment interface based on changes in environmental conditions in Erhai Lake. The results showed that historical distribution and fractions of THAAs could be divided into three stages: a stable period before the 1970s, a clear increasing period from the 1970s to 1990s, and a gradually steady period that started after the 1990s. The chemical fraction, aromatic and sulfur amino acids (AAs) accounted for only <= 3% of THAAs. Basic AAs accounted for 5-17% of THAAs, and remained at a relatively stable level. However, acidic and neutral AAs, which accounted for 19-44% and 35-69% of THAAs, respectively, were the predominant factors causing THAAs to increase due to rapid agricultural intensification and intensification of contemporary sedimentation of phytoplankton or macrophytes since the 1970s. These trends were closely related to both anthropogenic activities and natural processes, which implied that sediment THAAs could act as an effective indicator that reflects anthropogenic activities and aquatic environmental characteristics. The current contributions of sediment THAAs on TN and TOC were <5% and 1.5%, respectively. However, the dramatic increase in THAAs in the sediment cores indicated that there was a huge potential source of labile nitrogen for the overlying water under certain environmental conditions. Correlation analysis suggested that the release of THAAs was negatively correlated with pH, whereas positively correlated with bacterial number and degree of OM mineralization, which particularly depend on the stability of HFOM. Therefore, the risk of sediment THAAs release might increase when the sediment environment continuously changes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interpretation of assessment and monitoring data requires information about how reference conditions and ecological resilience vary in space and time. Reference conditions used as benchmarks are often specified via potential-based land classifications (e.g., ecological sites) that describe the plant communities potentially observed in an area based on soil and climate. State-and-transition models (STMs) coupled to ecological sites specify indicators of ecological resilience and thresholds. Although general concepts surrounding STMs and ecological sites have received increasing attention, strategies to apply and quantify these concepts have not. In this paper, we outline concepts and a practical approach to potential-based land classification and STM development. Quantification emphasizes inventor), techniques readily available to natural resource professionals that reveal processes interacting across spatial scales. We recommend a sequence of eight steps for the co-development of ecological sites and STMs, including 1) creation of initial concepts based on literature and workshops; 2) extensive, low-intensity traverses to refine initial concepts and to plan inventory; 3) development of a spatial hierarchy for sampling based on climate, geomorphology, and soils; 4) stratified medium-intensity inventory of plant communities and soils across a broad extent and with large sample sizes; 5) storage of plant and soil data in a single database; 6) model-building and analysis of inventory data to test initial concepts; 7) Support and/or refinement of concepts; and 8) high-intensity characterization and monitoring of states. We offer a simple example of how data assembled via our sequence are used to refine ecological site classes and STMs. The linkage of inventory to expert knowledge and site-based mechanistic experiments and monitoring provides a powerful means for specifying management hypotheses and, ultimately, promoting resilience in grassland, shrubland, savanna, and forest ecosystems,

AB  - Seed dormancy, which is thought to have evolved in response to unpredictable environmental variability, has led to the existence of seed banks-populations of dormant, viable seeds in the soil. Seed banks are theoretically important to both the demography and genetic structure of plant populations. The presence of seed dormancy can also affect the evolution of traits not directly associated with dormancy and germination.
   Theoretical models have suggested that the existence of dormancy can influence the rate of evolution of post-germination traits. The eventual outcome (e,g., allele frequencies) may be influenced as well, leading to adaptive syndromes of germination and post-germination traits. Seeds that germinate in different conditions may experience different selective regimes for post-germination traits. If there an trade-offs between the fitness of post-germination traits in different environments, then seeds that germinate in the environment to which their post-germination traits are adapted will be at a selective advantage. If differences in germination and post-germination traits are genetically based, then potentially adaptive genetic correlations between germination and post-germination traits may evolve. We feel that investigating the ecological and evolutionary importance of these correlations requires an empirical approach. As a first step, hen we ask whether the conditions necessary for such syndromes to arise exist in a particular plant population.
   We show that conditions favoring the joint evolution of dormancy and postgermination traits leading to adaptive syndromes exist in the mustard, Lesquerella fendleri, in central New Mexico. First, Lesquerella experiences the sort of variation in environmental conditions that would be expected to lead to adaptive trade-offs in the expression of post-germination traits for individuals that differ in germination traits, Annual precipitation varies greatly from year to year so that germination in drier years would be expected to select for more xerophytic traits. Within a year, microenvironmental spatial variation exists. Lesquerella growth and reproduction are sensitive to both year-to-year and microenvironmental variation. Second, the seed bank can affect both the demographic and genetic structure of the population. Dormant seeds remain viable for at least 3 yr and can mitigate the negative demographic effects of reproductive failure. Allozyme differences exist between seeds that germinate in the field and seeds that remain dormant, suggesting that the evolutionary potential of the aboveground population is influenced by dormancy. Finally, the necessary genetic and environmental variation is present. Both germination percentage and post-germination traits (e.g., leaf morphology) vary among and within populations as well as among environmental treatments. Thus, the potential exists for Lesquerella to respond to selective differences between different temporal or spatial environments.
   We suggest experimental approaches for assessing the extent to which seed dormancy has affected or will affect the evolution of post-germination traits. The consequences of past evolution could be explored by asking ''What genetic and phenotypic differences exist between individuals that germinate and those that remain dormant?'', while controlling for factors that influence germination (maternal genotype, maternal environment, and germination environment). Exploring whether evolution is currently occurring would require an assessment of natural selection and the genetic potential for response to selection. Given the difficulty of such studies, a reasonable first step would be to explore how evolution can occur by performing an artificial selection experiment on dormancy or germination percentage. Then, correlated responses of post-germination traits could be examined.
   Empirical studies such as these are necessary in order to better understand the role of seed banks in plant ecology and evolution. Then, once associations that can be interpreted as adaptive syndromes are documented, questions about the ecological mechanisms (e.g., necessary frequencies of different year types) and genetic mechanisms (e.g., linkage disequilibrium vs. pleiotropy) can be explored. We hope to draw attention to seed dormancy, which is an often-ignored stage in the life history of plants, and to encourage empirical work, which lags far behind theory.

AB  - Broad-scale forest restoration projects are implemented across the western United States to restore seasonally dry, frequent-fire-adapted ecosystems to improve ecological function and enhance resilience by increasing resistance to crown fire and climatic stressors. Despite the widespread use of restoration treatments that center on tree thinning and application of prescribed fire, the longevity of beneficial effects and the robustness of outcomes under future climate change predictions remains unclear. In this study, we remeasured a set of experimental areas established a minimum of 20 years ago that comprise a network of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest restoration study sites in northern Arizona. We analyzed ecological resiliency by evaluating forest conditions in terms of resistance to climatic stressors and potential crown fire in units that were thinned following evidence-based restoration guidelines (ERG), then burned with prescribed fire at multiple intervals, compared against paired untreated controls. Resilience indicators included forest structure, tree mortality, tree growth, regeneration, canopy fuels, and crowning index. We also simulated future forest conditions under a warming climate scenario (RCP 4.5) with a range of prescribed fire return intervals. Results indicated that experimental areas where restoration treatments were implemented remained more resilient to climate stressors compared to controls after 20 years. Treated areas had significantly lower tree mortality and greater average diameter growth compared to controls. Furthermore, forest structure generally remained similar to historical reference conditions in treated units with the exception of increases in ingrowth of sprouting species at the drier sites. Canopy fuel load and crown fire hazard in treated units remained significantly lower than controls, indicating that treatments remained effective in reducing crown fire potential over the 20-year study period without the need for additional tree thinning. Modeling basal area, crowning index, and the proportion of basal area in large trees under a future warming scenario suggested that the treated units underwent less changed than untreated areas. Under climate change, management of fire regimes even at longer-than-historical intervals (historical approximate to 5 yr, tested 5, 10, and 20 yr) would maintain basal area within our historical range of variability and maintain fire resistant forest over the next several decades. However, decline by the end of the century is concerning. Our results suggest that forest restoration treatments, guided by historical reference conditions, promote ecological resilience in the long-term and continued maintenance burning into the future is likely warranted even with continued drought and warming.

AB  - Aim. To establish the spatial and temporal variability in yield of corn for grain in the Volyn region in 1965-2017. Methods. Agricultural research, multivariate statistics, cluster analysis, geographic information technology. Results. From 1965 to 2015, the highest yield of corn for grain in the Volyn region was observed in the southern regions, and the lowest yield level was established for the northern regions. According to the peculiarities of the temporal dynamics of corn yields, the administrative regions are classified as allocating spatially homogeneous complexes consistent with the Forest-steppe, Polissia, and the Transitional Zone. The indicators of the dynamics of corn yields in all regions are characterized by a positive asymmetry coefficient, indicating an asymmetric distribution with a shift to the left. The presence of asymmetry indicates the heterogeneity of conditions and the cultivation of corn for grain during the study period and the possibility of identifying qualitatively homogeneous time intervals, that is, for the periodization of the investigated hour interval following the yield indicators of corn for grain. The geography of homogeneous clusters identified based on indicators of the dynamics of grain corn, which to a certain extent corresponds to the physical and geographical zoning of the region, is evidence of the ecological conditionality of corn yield by modes that correlate with factors of physical and geographic heterogeneity of the region. Of the ecological and geographic factors, climatic conditions were the most variable over the corresponding period. From 1965 to 2015, the nature of the dynamics of grain corn yields underwent qualitative transformations, which are the basis for appropriate periodization. Essential markers of the respective periods are the general yield level and the yield trend's general direction. Conclusions. The highest yield of corn for grain in the Volyn region was observed for the administrative districts located in the forest-steppe zone, and the lowest was characteristic for the districts within Polissia. The level of grain corn yields in the region may differ by almost 2.9 times, resulting from the soil's heterogeneity and climatic conditions. The dynamics of the production process in the forest steppe zone and Polissia are in antiphase: favorable conditions for increasing yields in one geographic zone are accompanied by opposite conditions for the adjacent zone and vice versa. Grain corn yield in 1965-2015 showed cyclical dynamics, during which periods with two local maximums were observed: in the ninth decade of the 20th century and the second half of the first decade of the 21st century.

AB  - Maritsa River is related to the Aegean water collecting region. During 2015, a total amount of 23 specimens of perch (Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758) are investigated. Identified two species of helminths (Proteocephalus percae (Muller, 1780) and Acantocephalus lucii (Muller, 1776)) are reported for the first time as intestinal parasites of perch from the freshwater ecosystem of the Maritsa River. They are core and authogenic species for the helminth communities of P. fluviatilis. Analyses of the helminth communities were carried out at both levels: infracommunity and component community. Basic ecological characteristics and biotic indices were determined to evaluate ecosystem condition of the river. The results of these studies attest to the importance of perch's helminths and helminth communities as sensitive bioindicators.

AB  - Lough Murree, a rock/karst barrier lagoon, is superficially isolated from the sea and seasonal variations in lake water level reflect precipitation and groundwater variation. Lake salinity is influenced by subsurface saline intrusions, occasional barrier overwash together with precipitation and groundwater inflow, leading to poikilohaline conditions. Palaeolimnological reconstructions in Murree support the supposition that the lagoon was once superficially connected to the sea around the mid-nineteenth century. Physical, chemical and biological proxies suggest an evolution to more freshwater conditions. Uncertainties about the timing of the transition persist because of an unresolved sediment chronology. The isolation of Murree from the Atlantic Ocean has promoted the formation of dense charophyte beds composed of lagoonal specialist species, which are able to tolerate large variations in salinity.

AB  - Natural rivers offer riparian habitats to many highly specialised, rare, and endangered insect species and are extremely important for ecosystem services. In the past, these ecosystems have been heavily degraded by anthropogenic use and run the risk of losing their favourable ecological conditions. For this reason, restoration measures are urgently needed and strongly demanded politically as well as legally, for instance, through the European Union Water Framework Directive. This is also important because nowadays, we are confronted with increasing insect declines. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact approach, we studied the effects of a riverbank restoration (complete removal of a large gravel embankment) on carabid assemblages of riparian habitats along the Mulde River in central Germany in 2017 and 2019. We collected 86 species in three site types (managed, natural, and restored) by pitfall trapping and found numerous species of conservation concern. Our analyses showed that the percentage of species of conservation concern was significantly higher after restoration in restored compared to managed sites. Furthermore, after restoration, the percentage of indicator species for natural sites increased significantly in restored sites while the abundance of indicator species characteristic for managed sites decreased in these sites. Species assemblage composition significantly changed in response to restoration approaching near-natural conditions. The creation of habitat mosaics with open gravel and sand patches as well as the re-establishment of river dynamics were likely the most significant drivers for restoration success. We were able to show how important the restoration of riparian habitats is to promote populations of endangered, rare, and specialised species. Our results highlight that positive effects of a river restoration measure can be observed after a relatively short time. Ground beetles can thus be viewed as early indicators for restoration success, but we see a need for long-term monitoring to evaluate long-term effects reliably.

AB  - Escape incidents of farmed fish involve economic losses to fish farms, interactions with local fisheries and environmental impacts to coastal ecosystems. In order to ensure a sustainable aquaculture activity it is advisable to gather any kind of information about the escapees for further management strategies. In this study, we aimed to trace the life history of escaped meagre (Argyrosomus regius) through otoliths microchemistry, based on the assumption that escaped fish experience different environmental conditions once they are outside the net-pen compared to their farmed conspecifics. Strontium (Sr-88) and barium (Ba-138) composition was analyzed using laser-ablation ICP-MS along core-to-edge transects of right sagittal otoliths on escaped and farmed meagre from the same coastal area in the W-Mediterranean Sea. Overall, results showed similar patterns of Sr concentrations throughout the otolith transects between farmed and escaped meagre, although some differences can be observed at specific periods of fish life for Ba concentrations. Consequently, temporal variations regarding otolith Sr:Ba ratios differed between farmed and escaped meagre, suggesting that farmed and escaped fish shared the same origin (rearing at coastal farms) but inhabited in different conditions from a certain time of their life. However, core-to-edge Sr:Ba values also differed among escaped individuals, which might indicate that each individual escaped in different periods. Consequently, the otolith Sr:Ba ratio seemed to be a good indicator of differences between fish groups, showing different temporal patterns. Nevertheless, the limitation of the low number of sampled individuals prevented to draw clearer conclusions. Further research is necessary in order to investigate the potential use of otolith microchemistry as a practical tool to trace of escaped fish, and consequently, to help solving potential conflicts among coastal users improving management of potential negative socioeconomic and ecological impacts.

AB  - The present study investigated the distribution of environmentally relevant metals and organic matter in the shelf sediments of the southeastern Arabian Sea using biogeochemical proxies for the assessment of environmental quality and trophic status. The distribution of metals in the study site followed the order: Fe > Mg > Pb > Ni > Mn > Co > Cu > Zn > Cd. High biological productivity associated with upwelling leads to significant accumulation of Cd higher than crustal abundance in the shelf region. The enrichment factor (EF) of metals demonstrate enrichment of Pb and Co which suggests the anthropogenic influence and not redox conditions. The sediment quality guidelines (SQG) in comparison with metal concentration revealed adverse effects, possibly occurring in marine benthic species. The spatial trend of metal enrichment along transects is appreciably controlled by the adsorption to fine grained sediments. The multivariate statistical analyses, such as correlations and principal component analysis (PCA) clearly indicated the control of texture, association of clay minerals in the degree of trace metal (Cd, Pb, Ni and Co) contamination from anthropogenic as well as natural sources. Low levels of Zn, preferably display scavenging by Fe/Mn metal oxides. Biochemical descriptors in sediments indicated meso-oligotrophic conditions prevailing in the summer monsoon. The ratios among various biogeochemical parameters such as total organic carbon/total nitrogen (TOC/TN < 10), protein/carbohydrate (PRT/CHO < 1) displayed that the organic matter deposited of marine origin which is relatively old with potentially low nutritional value. The close relationship between biochemical components and phytopigments suggest a major contribution of autochthonous phytodetritus derived organic matter. The study provides important information about sediment biogeochemistry and metal contamination from a potential fishery zone of Indian exclusive economic zone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understanding the flow of ecosystem services and the capacity of ecosystems to generate these services is an essential element for understanding the sustainability of ecosystem use as well as developing ecosystem accounts. We conduct spatially explicit analyses of nine ecosystem services in Telemark County, Southern Norway. The ecosystem services included are moose hunting, sheep grazing, timber harvest, forest carbon sequestration and storage, snow slide prevention, recreational residential amenity, recreational hiking and existence of areas without technical interference. We conceptually distinguish capacity to provide ecosystem services from the actual flow of services, and empirically assess both. This is done by means of different spatial models, developed with various available datasets and methods, including (multiple layer) look-up tables, causal relations between datasets (including satellite images), environmental regression and indicators derived from direct measurements. Capacity and flow differ both in spatial extent and in quantities. We discuss five conditions for a meaningful spatial capacity-flow-balance. These are (1) a conceptual difference between capacity and flow, (2) spatial explicitness of capacity and flow, (3) the same spatial extent of both, (4) rivalry or congestion, and (5) measurement with aligned indicators. We exemplify spatially explicit balances between capacity and flow for two services, which meet these five conditions. Research in the emerging field of mapping ES should focus on the development of compatible indicators for capacity and flow. The distinction of capacity and flow of ecosystem services provides a parsimonious estimation of over- or underuse of the respective service. Assessment of capacity and flow in a spatially explicit way can thus support monitoring sustainability of ecosystem use, which is an essential element of ecosystem accounting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The region of Mining Triangle is inserted in the Cerrado, with 66.79% of its area under Oxisols Reds, who have low natural fertility and high levels of exchangeable aluminum, requiring correction and fertilization for insertion in the production process. The physical attributes of the soil are good indicators of its quality and permits monitoring of areas that suffered some type of interference, determining the best use of that which causes less degradation. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the structure of an Oxisol in the Cerrado area in the region of Minas Gerais, Uberlandia, MG, under different uses and receiving organic wastes. With the intervention of the research, wastes generated in the activities related to animal production can leave the condition of polluting the environment to the condition of basic materials of high added value for agriculture, therefore, beyond action fertilizer that are present and conditioning effects repair of physical attributes of soils, could mean, then, a factor of adding value both for the activity of intensive rearing, agriculture and environment. The transformation of the native savannah in production environments changed the soil structure. The conversion to pasture areas and crops (corn and sugar cane) decreased macroporosity and increased soil density. This conversion also influenced the state of aggregation of soil, measured by the increase in the dispersion of clay fraction.

AB  - The algae geochemical anomaly coefficient (K-GA) and hazard coefficient (K-Me), which are geochemical coefficients characterizing the condition of an algae habitat, have been calculated based on heavy metal (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Ni) levels in the brown alga Sargassum miyabei sampled at different time intervals from 49 stations in Peter the Great and Kievka bays, Sea of Japan. It has been found that K-Me > 1 occurs for K-GA > 2. A sketch map of the degree of metal contamination of algae in Peter the Great Bay has been compiled. At 22% of stations, algae show increased threshold levels of metals, which means that the ecological condition of these areas requires monitoring and measures to mitigate the environmental impact.

AB  - Salinity and inlet distance were the most consistent indicators of species groupings among the 40 most abundant fish species in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida. In contrast to findings of other studies conducted on small juveniles and forage fishes in the IRL, this study suggested that distributions of the more mobile organisms are influenced more by physical conditions than by biological interactions. Consequently, environmentally-corrected single species models will be more effective in assessing changes in stock abundance and habitat preferences of mobile species in the IRL. Because of the fluctuations in physical conditions in the IRL and other estuaries, it may be inappropriate to use biologically based methods that rely solely on species interactions to assess fish stocks in those systems.

AB  - Tree diversity is found to enhance ecosystem functions in forests and increase the resistance and resilience of trees subjected to environmental stress, including climate change. This effect, however, can be different depending on tree species assemblages and ecological contexts. The pan-European programme for monitoring forest health (ICP Forests) considers crown defoliation as an indicator of tree vitality. Only a few studies have analysed the role of tree diversity in crown defoliation, with contrasting results. This paper analyses the relationships between defoliation and forest diversity in a country (Italy) characterised by heterogeneous bioclimatic and edaphic characteristics (from Mediterranean to Alpine) and with a wide range of forest tree species and functional groups. National-scale results show that defoliation increased in more diverse forest stands. This result can be explained by the fact that the tree mixtures reflect varying ecological conditions in heterogeneous environments. The most relevant factors that explain tree defoliation at the national level, investigated through random forest analysis, were the geographic position, tree species identity and forest stand age and structure. Cluster analysis was applied to identify homogeneous groups of plots based on their ecological and vegetation features. Four clusters were selected. Within each homogeneous cluster, the crown defoliation of the tree species showed different and contrasting patterns, changing their relationships with diversity over time. A beneficial role of diversity on defoliation (i.e. decrease of defoliation) has been observed in Quercus ilex, growing in Mediterranean conditions, and Picea abies in Alpine areas after dry periods. In the latter species, drought led to a greater increase in defoliation in monospecific than in mixed stands, suggesting the stabilising role of tree diversity.
