AB  - Much of our knowledge about land use and ecosystem services in interrelated social-ecological systems is derived from place-based research. While local and regional case studies provide valuable insights, it is often unclear how relevant this research is beyond the study areas. Drawing generalized conclusions about practical solutions to land management from local observations and formulating hypotheses applicable to other places in the world requires that we identify patterns of land systems that are similar to those represented by the case study. Here, we utilize the previously developed concept of land system archetypes to investigate potential transferability of research from twelve regional projects implemented in a large joint research framework that focus on issues of sustainable land management across four continents. For each project, we characterize its project archetype, i.e. the unique land system based on a synthesis of more than 30 datasets of land-use intensity, environmental conditions and socioeconomic indicators. We estimate the transferability potential of project research by calculating the statistical similarity of locations across the world to the project archetype, assuming higher transferability potentials in locations with similar land system characteristics. Results show that areas with high transferability potentials are typically clustered around project sites but for some case studies can be found in regions that are geographically distant, especially when values of considered variables are close to the global mean or where the project archetype is driven by large-scale environmental or socioeconomic conditions. Using specific examples from the local case studies, we highlight the merit of our approach and discuss the differences between local realities and information captured in global datasets. The proposed method provides a blueprint for large research programs to assess potential transferability of place-based studies to other geographical areas and to indicate possible gaps in research efforts.

AB  - An environmental pollution assessment of the Ebrie lagoon, the largest coastal ecosystem in Western Africa, was executed by applying the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impacts-Response (DPSIR) framework. The domestic and industrial activities in Abidjan and agricultural activities in the wider catchment area were identified as the main driving forces. Two-thirds of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) loads and 95% of total nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) loads of Abidjan are from domestic effluents, with industry making up the rest. Outside of the direct influence of Abidjan, nutrient levels in the lagoon are governed by the influx of nutrients from the rivers Comoe, Me and Agneby, with nutrient land runoff as the key factors. Total annual N loads to the lagoon for 2000 are estimated at 33 kt, of which 45% from urban sources, 42% from land runoff and 13% from atmospheric deposition. Estimates for P are 2.5 kt, 39%, 48% and 13%, respectively. Scenario analysis has shown that autonomous growth, without pollution reduction measures, would result in an estimated five-fold increase in nutrient inputs to the lagoon over the period 1980-2050. Nutrient concentrations in the lagoon would consequently increase by a factor of 3 1/2, which could escalate to a dramatic level of eutrophication for the complete system. Pollution reduction policies aimed at non-point sources would be most effective in reducing nutrient concentrations. Point-source pollution reduction would improve conditions around Abidjan, but not substantially in the other sections of the lagoon. The approach taken in this study has proven efficient under conditions of relative data scarceness, and sufficiently reliable to allow for policy level conclusions to be drawn. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aims The protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis and Toxoplasma gondii are identified as public health priorities and are present in a wide variety of environments including the marine ecosystem. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that the marine bivalve blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) can be used as a tool to monitor the contamination of marine waters by the three protozoa over time. Methods and Results In order to achieve a proof of concept, mussels were exposed to three concentrations of G. duodenalis cysts and Cryptosporidium parvum/T. gondii oocysts for 21 days, followed by 21 days of depuration in clear water. Then, natural contamination by these protozoa was sought for in wild marine blue mussels along the northwest coast of France to validate their relevance as bioindicators in the field. Our results highlighted that: (a) blue mussels bioaccumulated the parasites for 21 days, according to the conditions of exposure, and parasites could still be detected during the depuration period (until 21 days); (b) the percentage of protozoa-positive M. edulis varied under the degree of protozoan contamination in water; (c) mussel samples from eight out of nine in situ sites were positive for at least one of the protozoa. Conclusions The blue mussel M. edulis can bioaccumulate protozoan parasites over long time periods, according to the degree of contamination of waters they are inhabiting, and can highlight recent but also past contaminations (at least 21 days). Significance and Impact of the Study Mytilus edulis is a relevant bioaccumulators of protozoan (oo)cysts in laboratory and field conditions, hence its potential use for monitoring parasite contamination in marine waters.

AB  - The objective of this review was to provide a better understanding of how global climate change and fire influence the occurrence of understorey legumes and thereby biological nitrogen (N) fixation rates in forest ecosystems. Legumes are interesting models since they represent an interface between the soil, plant, and microbial compartments, and are directly linked to nutrient cycles through their ability to fix N. As such, they are likely to be affected by environmental changes.
   Biological N fixation has been shown to increase under enriched CO2 conditions, but is constrained by the availability of phosphorus and water. Climate change can also influence the species composition of legumes and their symbionts through warming, altered rainfall patterns, or changes in soil physicochemistry, which could modify the effectiveness of the symbiosis. Additionally, global climate change may increase the occurrence and intensity of forest wildfires thereby further influencing the distribution of legumes. The establishment of leguminous species is generally favored by fire, as is N-2 fixation. This fixed N could therefore replenish the N lost through volatilization during the fire. However, fire may also generate shifts in the associated microbial community which could affect the outcome of the symbiosis.
   Understorey legumes are important functional species, and even when they cannot reasonably be expected to reestablish the nutrient balance in forest soils, they may be used as indicators to monitor nutrient fluxes and the response of forest ecosystems to changing environmental conditions. This would be helpful to accurately model ecosystem N budgets, and since N is often a limiting factor to plant growth and a major constraint on C storage in ecosystems, would allow us to assess more precisely the potential of these forests for C sequestration.

AB  - Egg composition varies both within and between clutches, and mothers are expected to alter their deposition of resources to the egg depending on environmental conditions and breeding strategies. Within-clutch variation in egg composition has been proposed to reflect an adaptive maternal strategy influencing sibling competition. In species with brood reduction, mothers should reinforce brood hierarchies due to hatching asynchrony and favour senior chicks by making first-laid eggs larger, richer in nutrients, with higher testosterone and carotenoid levels and lower corticosterone concentrations than last-laid eggs [parental favouritism hypothesis (PFH)]. Moreover, mothers that are of better quality and/or experience better feeding conditions during laying are expected to increase their deposition of resources to the egg, resulting in differences between clutches [investment hypothesis (PFH)]. Several components may act together to provide an optimal reproductive strategy, but studies of variation in different egg components in the same egg are relatively rare. We analysed egg size, testosterone and corticosterone concentrations and carotenoids measured as yolk colour between and within clutches for the facultative siblicidal Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa triclactyla. First-laid eggs were larger, contained lower testosterone, higher yolk colour score, and similar corticosterone levels than last-laid eggs. Thus, only differences in egg size and yolk colour supported the PFH. We used within-clutch egg size dimorphism as an indicator of the quality of the mother or the feeding conditions during laying. In support of the IH, we found that mothers of better quality or that experienced better feeding conditions deposited more corticosterone into their eggs. High corticosterone levels may benefit nestlings when there is no brood reduction but high sibling competition is present. We found no support for the hypothesis that egg components are mutually adjusted to each other and we discuss the possible reasons for this.

AB  - The main principles in the prevention of pesticide health hazards are a comprehensive toxicological evaluation of new compounds to be introduced into practice and adequate hygienic regulations allowing for all sorts of pesticides pathogenic action and various sources of their supply from the environment.  In acute, subacute and chronic experiments pesticides are examined for toxicity, adverse effects on reproductive function and embryogenesis, mutagenic, carcinogenic and allergenic potential.  The hygienic classification is based on the limiting criterion of the greatest damage.  Safe levels are derived from the tolerance thresholds resting on persistence and changes of the shifts found, from investigations of borderline health conditions, assessment of homeostasis, hepatic immune and monooxygenase systems involved in metabolism of lipid, soluble pesticides.  Animal experiments findings extrapolated to clinical conditions help to predict probable long-term responses.  The directions of the research into prevention of pesticides-induced health hazards are outlined.

AB  - Determining how to restore fish migration routes blocked by large dams is the subject of great debate. Fishways are effective engineering measures restoring fish migration routes. However, most fishways in China do not carry out their target functions. Additionally, no studies have investigated key fishway technologies in the plateaus of Western China. In this research, the relationship between fish behavior and hydrodynamics was assessed by conducting quantitative descriptions of flow speed, turbulence, and other hydraulic indicators. First, target fish species of the plateaus of Western China were determined; then, swimming capabilities and migration characteristics of target fish were assessed. Then the preliminary hydraulic conditions for fishway projects in the plateaus of Western China were proposed. Finally, on-site migration experiments in the fishways were conducted to validate the preliminary hydraulic conditions. (c) 2019 Sichuan Agricultural University. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Age has been used as the major determinant in the process of aging being the causal or explanatory variable of health, behavior and competence. Over recent decades, in several research context, there is growing emphasis on the idea that beyond and behind age (an other biological conditions), external or environmental factors account for variation in the way people become older. In this article, empirical results coming from several studies are presented showing the importance of environmental factors such as socio-recreational aid,, community accessibility, expectation of functioning, tolerance, and social climate predict personal factors such as health, memory and depression complaints, activity, health and satisfaction among the elders living in residential settings. Also, socio-demographic factors such educational level and income are strongly associated with health (physical and mental health) and environmental quality seems to he related with life satisfaction in elders living in the community.

AB  - State-and-transition models (STMs) are tools used in rangeland management to describe linear and non-linear vegetation dynamics as conceptual models. STMs can be improved by including additional ecosystem services, such as wildlife habitat, so that managers can predict how local populations might respond to state changes and to illustrate the tradeoffs in managing for different ecosystem services. Our objective was to incorporate songbird density into an STM developed for sagebrush rangelands in northwest Colorado to guide local management of sagebrush birds. The STM included two shrub-dominated community phases, a native grassland state, and a shrubland and grassland phase within an exotic-dominated state. We surveyed plots for songbirds, collected a suite of vegetation indicators at each plot, and quantified songbird habitat relationships with count-based regression models. We then used the estimated models to predict songbird density based on average vegetation conditions per state or community phase. Moderate or increasing shrub cover were important predictors for shrubland-associated species, and responses to understory components varied by species. In the STM, we predicted higher densities of shrubland-associated bird species in the shrub-dominated phases and higher densities of grassland-associated bird species in the state and phase lacking shrub cover. No single state or phase captured the highest density for all songbirds, illustrating the value of alternative states. Our results also demonstrate the utility of displaying traditional wildlife count models against the range of vegetation conditions associated with each state or phase to understand how wildlife density can vary within states and phases.

AB  - As a principal part of terrestrial ecological environment, vegetation is dominant in maintaining the function of terrestrial ecosystem. In order to systematically study the change patterns, causes, and implications of vegetation cover in a typical semi-humid and semi-arid region under changing environments, the Wei River Basin (WRB) was selected as the case study. Spatial-temporal changing patterns of vegetation cover in the WRB were firstly examined based on satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Then, the underlying causes were studied by investigating the relationships among precipitation, temperature and soil moisture (SM) condition using the cross wavelet technique. Furthermore, implications of changing vegetation cover on runoff and sediment load were also analyzed. Results indicated that: (1) significant increasing trends of vegetation cover were detected at annual scale; and seasonal vegetation cover in the WRB is characterized with significant increasing trends in spring and autumn, while insignificant decreasing trend of summer vegetation cover in the upstream and midstream; (2) stationarity of annual NDVI is invalid with change points identified in all subregions of the WRB; (3) the correlations between annual NDVI series and precipitation, temperature and SM series demonstrate that significant increasing vegetation cover in the WRB are more influenced by temperature and SM condition than precipitation, anthropogenic factor however is also another reason for changing vegetation cover in the basin; and (4) statistically significant negative correlations between NDVI and runoff, sediment discharge imply that aside from human activities, increasing vegetation cover partially contributes to the reduction of runoff and sediment in the WRB. These findings are helpful for scientific assessment of ecological restoration projects, thereby facilitating local soil and water conservation.

AB  - Questions: On sandy coastal habitats, factors related to substrate and to wind action vary along the sea-inland ecotone, forming a marked directional disturbance and stress gradient. Further, input of propagules of alien plant species associated to touristic exploitation and development is intense. This has contributed to establishment and spread of aliens in coastal systems. Records of alien species in databases of such heterogeneous landscapes remain scarce, posing a challenge for statistical modelling. We address this issue and attempt to shed light on the role of environmental stress/disturbance gradients and propagule pressure on invasibility of plant communities in these typical model systems.
   Location: Sandy coasts of Lazio (Central Italy).
   Methods: We proposed an innovative methodology to deal with low prevalence of alien occurrence in a data set and high cost of field-based sampling by taking advantage, through predictive modelling, of the strong interrelation between vegetation and abiotic features in coastal dunes. We fitted generalized additive models to analyse (1) overall patterns of alien occurrence and spread and (2) specific patterns of the most common alien species recorded.
   Conclusion: Even in the presence of strong propagule pressure, variation in local abiotic conditions can explain differences in invasibility within a local environment, and intermediate levels of natural disturbance and stress offer the best conditions for spread of alien species. However, in our model system, propagule pressure is actually the main determinant of alien species occurrence and spread. We demonstrated that extending the information of environmental features measured in a subsample of vegetation plots through predictive modelling allows complex questions in invasion biology to be addressed without requiring disproportionate funding and sampling effort.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to recommend conceptual modifications for incorporation in state-and-transition models (STMs) to link this framework explicitly to the concept of ecological resilience. Ecological resilience describes the amount of change or disruption that is required to transform a system from being maintained by one set of mutually reinforcing processes and structures to a different set of processes and structures (e.g., an alternative stable state). In light of this concept, effective ecosystem management must focus on the adoption of management practices and policies that maintain or enhance ecological resilience to prevent stable states from exceeding thresholds. Resilience management does not exclusively focus on identifying thresholds per se, but rather on within-state dynamics that influence state vulnerability or proximity to thresholds. Resilience-based ecosystem management provides greater opportunities to incorporate adaptive management than does threshold-based management because thresholds emphasize limits of state resilience, rather than conditions that determine the probability that these limits will be surpassed. In an effort to further promote resilience-based management, we recommend that the STM framework explicitly describe triggers, at-risk communities, feedback mechanisms, and restoration pathways and develop process-specific indicators that enable managers to identify at-risk plant communities and potential restoration pathways. Two STMs representing different ecological conditions and geographic locations are presented to illustrate the incorporation and application of these recommendations. We anticipate that these recommendations will enable STMs to capture additional ecological information and contribute to improved ecosystem management by focusing attention on the maintenance of state resilience in addition to the anticipation of thresholds. Adoption of these recommendations may promote valuable dialogue between researchers and ecosystem managers regarding the general nature of ecosystem dynamics.

AB  - Under the background of China's proposal to achieve "carbon neutralization and carbon peak ", it is an important task for each province to clarify their forest ecological security (FES) status. However, there is little understanding of the temporal and spatial evolution of forest ecological security and its influencing factors. Based on the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model, this paper constructed a comprehensive evaluation index system for forest ecological security and used the CRITIC method and panel data to estimate the dynamic changes in FES for 31 provinces in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) between 2009 and 2018. Furthermore, the obstacle degree model was used to determine the important obstacle factors affecting FES. The results showed that: (1) The comprehensive indices of FES of most provinces in mainland China were increasing, showing a good development trend during the study period; (2) subject to the limitations of resources and economic conditions, the FES at the provincial level showed significant spatial heterogeneity, which generally presents a distribution characteristic of "low in the western region and high in the central and eastern regions "; and (3) the primary obstacles restricting the improvement of FES level in most provinces of China were forest state indicators or input response indicators, followed by pressure indicators. Therefore, it is recommended to take targeted measures to reduce the intensity of forest cutting and the incidence of forest disasters, improve the utilization efficiency of forest resources, the productivity of forestland and the input-output level of forestry industry, and strengthen the training of professional talents and technical input according to the resource endowment condition of each province so as to improve the level of forest ecological security.

AB  - Macrophytes are increasingly being used worldwide for assessing aquatic ecological condition. Because their growth is influenced by physical habitat conditions, such as sediment quality and near,shore gradient, macrophytes may also be valuable indicators of shoreline restoration efforts. An extensive shoreline restoration project in a lake with a history of industrial activity provided the opportunity to examine macrophyte and sediment status as nietrics of aquatic ecosystem health and response.
   We surveyed macrophyte beds in Muskegon Lake, Michigan over a 4-year period to assess the ecological benefits of the restoration project. Macrophyte biomass was affected strongly by the physical features of the individual sites, including hydrologic exposure (i.e., wind and wave action) and sediment organic matter, which contributed to a large degree of variability among the sites. Declines in macrophyte biomass the year following restoration suggested a short-term negative impact on macrophyte communities. Recovery to at least pre-restoration biomass was evident two years following restoration. However, concurrent changes at the reference sites, though to a lesser degree, also suggested a possible overriding environmental cause (i.e., water level, air temperature, precipitation) for the observed changes in macrophyte growth.
   Lake restoration projects are usually designed to improve water quality and enhance the fishery. Although both goals are influenced by macrophytes, the plants themselves are rarely a focal point of restoration. Our study allowed us to address this information gap; even after 4 years of sampling, it appears the timeline is too short to detect a definitive response to restoration, but our results provide important baseline information and lessons learned for future studies.

AB  - Trait-based indices have been widely applied to determine the below-ground effects of anthropogenic disturbances on the nematofauna. Given that the aggregation of the nematode community into one index value might result in difficulties in the interpretation of the signal, we investigated whether trait-based indices of nematodes are sensitive enough to assess the soil quality in agricultural soil systems. In the case of 137 locations in the Netherlands, we compared the suitability of indices to assess soil microbial and (a)biotic conditions for six combinations of management and soil type. Nematode abundance was strongly correlated with soil phosphorus (explained variances: 43.8% for molar N:P ratio and 30.9% for C:P ratio) and less with microbial biomass (explained variance 26.0%). Generally, the nematode abundance reflected more the variances of abiotics and microbial parameters than trait-based indices did. Nematode maturity indices point to differences in management intensity between ecosystems, although maturity indices explained only a small fraction of the variance of soil parameters. For combinations of soil and management types, contrasting correlations between nematological indices and soil conditions were often detected. Agricultural soils can be seen as characterized by a disturbance continuum and observed correlations were low as soon as soil and ecosystem types were analyzed together. Still, the gradients in soil abiotics and microbial parameters were rather large in comparison to single combinations of soil and ecosystem type. Dissimilarities indicate that small gradients within comparable ecosystems can largely hamper the interpretation of some indices and hence applying trait-based indices to few locations in an attempt to assess the biological qualities at local scales should be performed with caution.

AB  - The absence of environmentally sensitive soil management systems can be considered as one of the major risks to sustainability of agricultural soils in Iran. Tillage is the most critical operation in soil management designed to achieve high crop yield, but it can adversely affect the soil fauna in several ways. In the present study, assessment of soil fauna was carried out in Western Iran in 2008 and 2009 in soil subjected to conventional (CT), minimum (MT) and no (NT)-tillage systems and amended with three levels of cattle manure (CM). Earthworm, mite, springtail and nematode populations were measured as indicators of macro, meso and micro fauna groups, respectively. Soil moisture and bulk density were also determined. Generally, low populations of soil fauna were observed consistent with expectations under similar conditions for this region. Earthworm populations were low and had a patchy distribution. Tillage and CM were found to have no effects on soil mites in both years. Soil springtails were reduced by soil tillage, indicating their sensivity to soil disturbance induced by tillage. In 2008, the nematode population was greater with application of 40 ton ha(-1) CM applications (113 N.100 g soil(-1)). Soil tillage-induced disturbance reduced nematode population in 2009 (214 N.100 g soil(-1) at CT). Minimum seedbed preparation besides less soil disturbance makes MT a proper tillage system for Zea mays cultivation. Cattle manure application increased Z. mays' biomass, but according to our results its annual application is not recommended. There were no changes in BD in both years. We conclude that in short-term studies, soil nematode populations are suitable biological indices (under similar soil and climatic conditions) for the ecological comparison of agricultural management systems in Iran.

AB  - In 1988, epizootics of ulcer disease in the flatfish flounder in the Dutch Wadden Sea were reported near freshwater drainage sluices of IJsselmeer Lake, locally affecting up to 38.9% of fish. Other diseases such as fin rot and lymphocystis were less frequent, but followed a similar pattern. Results of follow-up surveys in the Wadden Sea in 1994-2005 confirm previous findings and also show significantly elevated ulcer prevalences at other smaller drainage works. The most likely stress factors that contributed to the development of the epizootics at these sites include osmotic stress, adverse water quality conditions including chemical contaminants, nutritional deficiencies, and obstruction to fish migration. It was shown that discharges of IJsselmeer Lake freshwater in 1988-96 had a wide effect on the prevalence and distribution of ulcers and lymphocystis in the western Wadden Sea. A general reduction in disease prevalence in flounder in the entire Dutch Wadden Sea was observed during 1988-2005, which was most likely due to a general improvement in water quality and locally improved habitat conditions for flounder near drainage sluices. Ulcer prevalences outside the two IJsselmeer Lake sluices (Den Oever and Kornwerderzand) declined in this period from approximately 30% to 10% for medium-sized fish. Other skin diseases have also displayed a downward trend at both sites in recent years, with prevalences falling sharply to below 1%. Elsewhere in the Wadden Sea and the Ems-Dollard estuary, disease prevalences have declined towards natural background levels (<1%). It is concluded that skin diseases, especially ulcers, are useful indicators of environmental quality in the Wadden Sea. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Responses of benthic macroinvertebrates along gradients of urban intensity were investigated in nine metropolitan areas across the United States. Invertebrate assemblages in metropolitan areas where forests or shrublands were being converted to urban land were strongly related to urban intensity. In metropolitan areas where agriculture and grazing lands were being converted to urban land, invertebrate assemblages showed much weaker or nonsignificant relations with urban intensity because sites with low urban intensity were already degraded by agriculture. Ordination scores, the number of EPT taxa, and the mean pollution-tolerance value of organisms at a site were the best indicators of changes in assemblage condition. Diversity indices, functional groups, behavior, and dominance metrics were not good indicators of urbanization. Richness metrics were better indicators of urban effects than were abundance metrics, and qualitative samples collected from multiple habitats gave similar results to those of single habitat quantitative samples (riffles or woody snags) in all metropolitan areas. Changes in urban intensity were strongly correlated with a set of landscape variables that was consistent across all metropolitan areas. In contrast, the instream environmental variables that were strongly correlated with urbanization and invertebrate responses varied among metropolitan areas. The natural environmental setting determined the biological, chemical, and physical instream conditions upon which urbanization acts and dictated the differences in responses to urbanization among metropolitan areas. Threshold analysis showed little evidence for an initial period of resistance to urbanization. Instead, assemblages were degraded at very low levels of urbanization, and response rates were either similar across the gradient or higher at low levels of urbanization. Levels of impervious cover that have been suggested as protective of streams (5-10%) were associated with significant assemblage degradation and were not protective.

AB  - Algal assemblages have been widely used as an ecological indicator of aquatic ecosystem health conditions because of their specific sensitivity to a wide variety of environmental conditions. In turbid rivers, as in other aquatic systems, phytoplankton structure plays an important role in structuring aquatic food webs. Worldwide, phytoplankton is less studied in turbid, large tropical rivers compared to temperate river systems. The present study aimed to describe the phytoplankton diversity and abundance in a turbid tropical river (the Red River, northern part of Vietnam from 20 degrees 00 to 25 degrees 30 North; from 100 degrees 00 to 107 degrees 10 East) and to determine the importance of a series of environmental variables in controlling the phytoplankton community composition. Phytoplankton community was composed of 169 phytoplankton taxa from six algal groups including Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Dinophyceae and Cyanobacteria. Community composition varied both spatially and with season. Sixteen measurement environmental variables were used as input variables for a three-layer backpropagation neural network that was developed to predict the phytoplankton abundance. Phytoplankton abundance was successfully predicted using the tagsig transfer function and the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. The network was trained to provide a good overall linear fit to the total data set with a slope (R) and mean square error (MSE) of 0.808 and 0.0107, respectively. The sensitivity analysis and neutral interpretation diagram revealed that total phosphorus (TP), flow discharge, water temperature and P-PO43- were the significant variables. The results showed that the developed ANN model was able to simulate phytoplankton abundance in the Red River. These findings can help for gaining insight into and the relationship between phytoplankton and environmental factors in this complex, turbid, tropical river.

AB  - Parasites have proven to display high responsiveness to anthropogenic stress, having, therefore a considerable value as bioindicators. We analysed the variability in the structure of parasite populations and assemblages of the poeciliid Cnesterodon decemmaculatus caught at partially urbanized stream along a unidirectional gradient with the aim of evaluating their utility as indicators of the effect of urbanization. A total of 209 fish were examined for parasites; some physical parameters of the stream, including the percentage of urbanization (UR) were also recorded. Data were analyzed at the levels of parasite populations and assemblages discriminated by host sex. Fish condition factor was negatively affected by UR, possibly related to flashing hydrology, but it was not related to parasite abundance. Different combinations of variables explained the distribution of parasite populations and assemblages along the creek, with UR being recurrently identified among the best predictors of parasite loads at all levels of analyses. Whereas densities of mollusc first intermediate hosts were considered of little relevance for parasite distribution, distribution of definitive hosts, as well as the presence of pollutants and increased flashiness in urbanized sections of the creek were retained as possible explanations to the observed patterns. As these factors can act simultaneously, the mechanisms driving differences in parasite dynamics of urban streams are difficult to individualize, but the effect of urbanization on both hosts and parasites was clearly identified. Parasites found, with abundances clearly related to UR, can be considered as good ecological indicators, since they are broadly distributed in the region, easy to observe and count, their prevalence and abundance allow reliable quantitative comparisons and are sensitive to variations of environmental stress and/or ecological conditions at small spatial scales. Consequently the susceptibility of fish-trematode systems to variations in both biotic and abiotic stressors makes them a promising tool for detecting urbanization-related disturbances in streams.

AB  - The Zanzibar Archipelago is one of the most productive and biologically rich reef ecosystems along the eastern coast of Africa and provides valuable benefits to coastal people. It is situated between the high-diversity hotspot of the coral triangle and the cold-water areas of southern Africa with significance as recipient and redistributor of biotas via equatorial and Agulhas currents. The archipelago consists of three major islands: Zanzibar (Unguja), Pemba and Mafia. The reefal structures surrounding the islands are imperiled by intensifying local and global stressors ultimately reducing their capability to maintain their physical structure. We have conducted large-scale island wide surveys on benthic foraminifera, a group of unicellular protists that contribute significantly to the calcium carbonate budget of coral reefs.
   The spatial distribution, composition, species richness and environmental significance of foraminiferal faunal assemblages were examined via numerical and statistical analyses. Quantitative faunal analyses reveal the presence of seven major habitats, characterized by specific indicator taxa, assemblages and gradients of species richness. Spatial patterns of foraminiferal biotas are characterized by numerical abundances of individual taxa, cluster groups and gradients of species richness, as documented by cluster, Fisher a, and ternary plot analysis. Reef vitality was assessed via the FORAM Index, a single metric index indicative of reef health and conditions for carbonate accretion. The FORAM Index and species richness patterns show that the coral reefs around Pemba, Mafia and Zanzibar are generally in moderate to good condition, but also permits the identification of areas requiring assessment and monitoring. Lowest suitability values were recorded off Zanzibar Town, a densely populated area where anthropogenic influence continues to impact reef development. The presence of habitat specific assemblages and numerical abundance values of individual taxa show that benthic foraminifera are ideal tracers of environmental perturbations useful in paleoecological and paleoenvironmental studies.

AB  - A massive beaching and mortality of fishes occurred in Coliumo Bay, a shallow bay located along the coast of the eastern South Pacific Ocean on 3 January 2008. This stranding was a consequence of an abrupt decrease in the dissolved oxygen concentration throughout the whole water column, due to the effect of intense upwelling along the coast off central-southern Chile. The main objectives of this study were: (1) to characterize taxonomically and biologically the fish species assemblage present in this beaching; (2) to evaluate several physiological indicators for the condition of the beached species at the time of their death; and (3) to assess the possible cause-effect mechanisms involved in the fishes death and the changes that took place in the fish community throughout the time. In this beaching, 26 fish species were identified: 23 teleosts, one myxiniform and two elasmobranchs. Most beached specimens were juveniles. Haematological and histological evidence indicate that severe hypoxia that lasted for at least 48 h was the most plausible cause of death. The main conclusion of this study is that the presence of oxygen-poor equatorial sub-surface water in the shallow coastal zone due to intense regional-scale upwelling caused the fish stranding. Although the effect of the hypoxic event was severe for the fish assemblage of Coliumo Bay, the rapid recuperation observed suggests that hypoxic events at the local spatial scale can be buffered by migration processes from the fish community inhabiting close by areas non-affected by low oxygen conditions. The effect that severe hypoxic events may have on larger spatial scales remains unknown. (C) 2010 The Authors Journal compilation (C) 2010 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

AB  - Soil quality is a concept based on the premise that management can deteriorate, stabilize, or improve soil ecosystem functions. It is hypothesized that the degree of stratification of soil organic C and N pools with soil depth, expressed as a ratio, could indicate soil quality or soil ecosystem functioning, because surface organic matter is essential to erosion control, water infiltration, and conservation of nutrients. Stratification ratios allow a wide diversity of soils to be compared on the same assessment scale because of an internal normalization procedure that accounts for inherent soil differences. Stratification ratios of soil organic C were 1.1, 1.2 and 1.9 under conventional tillage (CT) and 3.4, 2.0 and 2.1 under no tillage (NT) in Georgia, Texas, and Alberta/British Columbia, respectively. The difference in stratification ratio between conventional and NT within an environment was inversely proportional to the standing stock of soil organic C to a depth of 15-20 cm across environments. Greater stratification of soil C and N pools with the adoption of conservation tillage under inherently low soil organic matter conditions (i.e., warmer climatic regime or coarse-textured soil) suggests that standing stock of soil organic matter alone is a poor indication of soil quality. Stratification of biologically active soil C and N pools (i.e., soil microbial biomass and potential activity) were equally or more sensitive to tillage, cropping intensity, and soil textural variables than stratification of total C and N. High stratification ratios of soil C and N pools could be good indicators of dynamic soil quality, independent of soil type and climatic regime, because ratios >2 would be uncommon under degraded conditions.

AB  - This review examines the substantial changes that have taken place in marine habitats and resources of the Gulf over the past decade. The habitats are especially interesting because of the naturally high levels of temperature and salinity stress they experience, which is important in a changing world climate. However, the extent of all natural habitats is changing and their condition deteriorating because of the rapid development of the region and, in some cases from severe, episodic warming episodes.
   Major impacts come from numerous industrial, infrastructure-based, and residential and tourism development activities, which together combine, synergistically in some cases, to cause the observed deterioration in most benthic habitats. Substantial sea bottom dredging for material and its deposition in shallow water to extend land or to form a basis for huge developments, directly removes large areas of shallow, productive habitat, though in some cases the most important effect is the accompanying sedimentation or changes to water flows and conditions. The large scale of the activities compared to the relatively shallow and small size of the water body is a particularly important issue.
   Important from the perspective of controlling damaging effects is the limited cross-border collaboration and even intra-country collaboration among government agencies and large projects. Along with the accumulative nature of impacts that occur, even where each project receives environmental assessment or attention, each is treated more or less alone, rarely in combination. However, their combination in such a small, biologically interacting sea exacerbates the overall deterioration. Very few similar areas exist which face such a high concentration of disturbance, and the prognosis for the Gulf continuing to provide abundant natural resources is poor.

AB  - Results of Cladocera and organic matter analyses from the Eemian lake deposits in Solniki (NE Poland) are presented. We focused on the reaction of the lake's environment to progressive cooling reflected in the changes of the organic matter and the Cladocera community. Approximately 3-m of sediments accumulated from the optimum of the Eemian Interglacial (E5) to the Early Vistulian (EV2) were analyzed. Results of analyses of organic matter correlated with Cladocera data enabled a reconstruction of varying environmental conditions and geneses of organic matter. The organic carbon content is closely related to climatic conditions. The lowest values are recorded in the coldest periods during the ending of the Eemian Interglacial and the Herning stadial of the Early Vistulian. The highest ones occur unexpectedly in the Eemian post-optimum: at the end of the spruce phase and at the beginning of the pine phase.
   During the Eemian optimum (E5), biodiversity of Cladocera species was maximal (17), but the frequency of specimens was low. At the end of the optimum (E5), an improvement of living conditions, more optimal for various ecological groups of Cladocera took place. Algae remained a significant component of organic matter. The early Eemian post-optimum (E6) is characterized as a period of the high number of zooplankton species, the highest frequency as well as biodiversity. At that time, probably a higher water level and an optimal temperature formed very favorable conditions for the fauna development. During this period, maximal values of TOC, TN and the slight increase of C/N ratio suggest a higher primary productivity with a small supply of organic matter of terrestrial origin. Coexistence of two species of the family Bosminidae and maximum values of delta N-15 suggest a high trophy (beta-mesotrophy). High resolution and detailed analyses of the lake sediments accumulated during the pollen zone E7, allowed to identity a few minor environmental fluctuations recorded in varied Cladocera frequency, TOC and C/N ratio. In the final period of the Eemian Interglacial and in the Early Vistulian (Herning stadial), a drastic reduction in frequency of Cladocera and the features of OM (the lowest amounts of TOC and TN, and the highest value of C/N) reflect the decline of lake conditions and a lack of both primary production and aquatic vegetation in the lake. During the Amersfoort interstadial a renewed bioproduction and slightly supply of terrestrial plants in organic matter as well as revitalize zooplankton took place. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - Vegetation phenology is the most intuitive and sensitive biological indicator of environmental conditions, and the start of the season (SOS) can reflect the rapid response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. At present, the model based on mean temperature neglects the role of the daytime maximum temperature (TMAX) and the nighttime minimum temperature (TMIN) in providing temperature accumulation and cold conditions at leaf onset. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of spring phenology for the boreal forest from 2001 to 2017 based on the moderate-resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data (MOD13A2) and investigated the asymmetric effects of daytime and nighttime warming on the boreal forest spring phenology during TMAX and TMIN preseason by partial correlation analysis. The results showed that the spring phenology was delayed with increasing latitude of the boreal forest. Approximately 91.37% of the region showed an advancing trend during the study period, with an average advancement rate of 3.38 +/- 0.08 days/decade, and the change rates of different land cover types differed, especially in open shrubland. The length of the TMIN preseason was longer than that of the TMAX preseason and diurnal temperatures showed an asymmetrical increase during different preseasons. The daytime and nighttime warming effects on the boreal forest are asymmetrical. The TMAX has a greater impact on the vegetation spring phenology than TMIN as a whole and the effect also has seasonal differences; the TMAX mainly affects the SOS in spring, while TMIN has a greater impact in winter. The asymmetric effects of daytime and nighttime warming on the SOS in the boreal forest were highlighted in this study, and the results suggest that diurnal temperatures should be added to the forest terrestrial ecosystem model.

AB  - Despite large investments of public funds into environmental flows programs, we have little ability to make quantitative predictions of the ecological benefits of restored flow regimes. Rather, ecological predictions in environmental flow assessments typically have been qualitative and based largely upon expert opinion. Widely applicable, quantitative models would help to justify existing flow programs and to inform future planning. Here, we used a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of monitoring data coupled with expert-derived prior distributions, to develop such a model. We quantified the relationship between the duration and frequency of inundation, and encroachment of terrestrial vegetation into regulated river channels. The analysis was informed by data from 27 sites on seven rivers. We found that longer inundation durations reduce terrestrial vegetation encroachment. For example, a 50-day continuous inundation during winter reduced predicted vegetation cover to a median of 11% (95% CI: 7%-35%) of cover predicted under non-inundated conditions. This effect varied among sites and rivers, and was moderated by the frequency of inundation events. The hierarchical structure improved precision of model predictions relative to simpler analysis structures. Informative prior distributions also improved precision relative to minimally informative priors. The hierarchical Bayesian analysis allows us to make quantitative predictions of ecological response under the full range of flow conditions, allowing us to assess the benefits of planned or delivered environmental flows. It can be used to make estimates of ecological effects at sites that have not been sampled, and also to scale up site-level results to catchment and regional scales. Quantitative predictions of ecological effects provide a more objective risk-based approach, allowing improved planning of environmental flows and building public confidence in these major investments of public funds.

AB  - Giant sequoia [Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindl.) J. Buchholz] trees and their ecosystems are unique natural treasures in the Sierra Nevada, California, where most groves are federally managed for biodiversity, perpetuation of the species, and aesthetic, recreational, ecological, and scientific values. Increasing temperatures during the next several decades may create conditions unfavorable for these giant sequoias. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective management systems to preserve the health of these giant sequoia groves. This study used a topographic wetness index (TWI) as the indicator of soil moisture conditions to evaluate the vulnerability of giant sequoia groves to soil moisture stress and focused on evaluating TWI distributions among all 70 sequoia groves to assess their vulnerability to soil moisture stress. The TWI values were derived using a 10-m digital elevation model and compared with soil, geology, slope, aspect, and elevation at the sequoia groves to understand the vulnerability of the groves to soil moisture stress. The TWI values were also compared with snow cover persistence derived from 12 yr of MODIS snow cover products. In addition, satellite soil moisture products were used to compare the dry and wet periods predicted by snow cover persistence. Results showed that the groves located at higher elevation are less vulnerable unless the TWI across the groves is low. For the large number of groves with elevations mainly in the 1800-to 2100-m range, the TWI distributions can serve as a first-order indicator of relative vulnerability. Further, this analysis showed that areas with milder slopes and more converging area (higher TWI), plus longer snow cover persistence, should be less susceptible to low summer soil moisture than areas having steeper slopes, more diverging topography (lower TWI), and earlier snowmelt. This analysis can be used to highlight groves that are potentially more vulnerable, particularly when considering TWI, snow cover persistence, and satellite soil moisture together.

AB  - We evaluated copepod taxonomic diversity as a potential biological indicator of ocean conditions in the northeast Pacific Ocean using data collected biweekly between May 1996 and December 2004 and from 1969 to 1973 and 1983 off Newport, Oregon. During the summer, low copepod biodiversity is accompanied by high biomass, with the opposite patterns prevailing in the winter. High biodiversity, and associated low biomass, is also observed during the summers of major El Nino events (1983, 1997-1998) and during years when the Pacific Decadal Oscillation is in a positive phase. From 1996 to the present, seasonally adjusted monthly anomalies of taxa richness and the Shannon-Weiner diversity index were compared to hydrographic and meteorological variables and to basin-wide climatological indices. Correlations of biodiversity with physical variables were strongest during the summer months for the Multivariate El Nino/Southern Oscillation Index, temperatures at a water depth of 50 in, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. During a 4-year cool period (1999-2002), biodiversity was low, likely a result of the increased transport of coastal subarctic waters into the northern California current. In recent years (2002 2005), however, there has been a dramatic increase in biodiversity. These increases may be attributable to the influence of a weak El Nino event in 2003; yet, high biodiversity persisted through the summer of 2005 and at times was higher than during the strongest El Nino events of the 20th century (1983 and 19971998). Our analyses suggest that changes in source waters, driven by remote basin scale forcing and not local environmental events, cause interannual-to-decadal variations in copepod biodiversity in the northern California current.

AB  - Background It is known that aquaculture may produce negative environmental effects on marine ecosystems. Southern Chile is one of the most important salmon and mussel-producing areas in the world. Here we assess the ecological status of benthic communities near farming centers in Caucahue Channel, Chiloe, which has been used intensely for salmon and mussel production for 30 years. Methods The macrofauna, sediments and water column were characterized at distances of 5 to 100 m from three salmon and three mussel-producing centers. Information was also obtained from reference sites 500 to 3000 m from these aquaculture farms. The macrofauna and environmental conditions during winter were analyzed using uni- and multivariate analysis and the AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) as an indicator of benthic community condition. Results (i) There is a high degree of spatial dissimilarity in macrofauna and environmental variables among sampling sites and types of environments (far from or near farming centers) and between the northern and southern areas of the channel; (ii) sediment structure (mean grain size and percentage of total organic matter) correlated with the observed dissimilarities in macrofauna communities; and (iii) the level of perturbation according to AMBI was heterogeneous, with sites in the undisturbed/normal range to moderately disturbed/polluted. Conclusions We found a high spatial dissimilarity in benthic macrofauna and environmental variables among sampling sites, environmental types and between the northern and southern areas of the channel. AMBI and multivariate community-environment analysis are useful tools to define the level of perturbation of a geographic area at different spatial scales, using all the ecological information from each sample and replicates.

AB  - Feeding periodicities and rhythms of suspension-feeding bivalves in coastal waters are dosely related to diel and tidal cyclic environmental changes, such as food availability and predation risk. Although such feeding periodicities of bivalves are important for understanding how their feeding strategies adapt to localized habitats, the feeding periodicity in bivalves in the field remains to be clarified, especially in infaunal species. The present study focused on the morphological condition of the crystalline style as an indicator of the feeding activity of the infaunal bivalve Manila clam, Rudilapes philippinarum, and estimated their feeding periodicity in the field. First, the effects of feeding (siphon-extending) behaviour, food and the light/dark cycle on the condition of the crystalline style (defined based on its morphology and hardness) were investigated in the laboratory. Results of the ordered logistic models and model selection showed that clams extending their siphons kept their crystalline styles hard. Furthermore, the effects of the light/dark cycle and tidal phase on the condition of the crystalline style were investigated in natural intertidal and subtidal zones and assessed using the results of the ordered logistic models. In the intertidal zone, the effect of the tidal phase was significant, whereas the effect of the light/dark cycle was not, and feeding was estimated to be active at ebb and flood tides, when the density of food particles was likely to be high. On the other hand, in the subtidal zone, the results of the model selection were not clear because of significant effects of interactions between the light/dark cycle and tidal phase. However, when the interactions were removed from the models, the effect of the light/dark cycle was significant, and feeding was estimated to be active at night when the predation risk from visual predators would be relatively low. These results confirm that R. philippinarum possesses behavioural plasticity in feeding periodicity, which is adaptable to both intertidal and subtidal zones.

AB  - The paper presents soil conditions of Pulsatilla vernalis in the Polish lowland. There were determined species preferences in relation to physical and chemical properties, grain size composition and the type of soil. It has been found that P. vernalis prefers very poor sandy, acid, dry and permeable soils, with small water capacity. The range of habitat parameters at the lowland sites differs, however, from the conditions at the mountain sites. Due to specific habitats of the species, new ecological indicator values were proposed for the lowland sites of P. vernalis. The results of soil analysis presented in this paper, as well as other data related to biology of the species, should be accounted for in the active protection plan, including the processes of reintroduction and introduction of the species.

AB  - Biomass production of different ecotypes within three ecological important grass species was determined during cultivation under uniform environmental conditions. Results obtained clearly indicate that ecotypes of these species exhibit a significant degree of variation with regard to biomass production. Furthermore, indications from this investigation are that no correlation exists between production ability of a species and long-term average rainfall, and the effect of both genetic and environmental factors on the production ability of a species determines the eventual biomass production of a species. Biomass production represents one of various ecologically important characteristics to be used in conjunction with other ecological characters to construct a usable, special purpose classification system. This system will assist rangeland ecologists in identifying functional ecotypes within grass species, thus facilitating the understanding and interpretation of vegetation dynamic models and rangeland condition assessments.

AB  - There is a pressing need for indicators and methods to quantify the provision of ecosystem services as a prerequisite to identify management options that optimize trade-offs between services. Arable weeds provide multiple services and are thus a good model to evaluate such trade-offs. This flora provides trophic resources (flowers or seeds) that support pollinators and pest natural enemies (pollination and pest control services) but can also be harmful for crop production (disservice). To date, few indicators are available to quantify the contribution of weeds to ecosystem services or their harmfulness, and no indicators account for intraspecific variability in weed traits that result from contrasting growing conditions, notably the location of weeds within fields (field edge vs field core) and crop type. Here, we developed nine proxies for potential weed harmfulness (competition, harvest difficulties and future weed infestations) and weed contributions to resources provision to pollinators (bees, bumblebees and hoverflies) and pest natural enemies (carabid beetles, birds and parasitoid wasps). These nine proxies accounted for individual weed plant response to growing conditions (combination of within-field location by crop type) for 155 weed species, resulting in 967 unique situations (combinations of species by within-field locations by crop types). Apart from harvest difficulties, all proxies were positively correlated, i.e. harmfulness increased when services increased. Weed plants located on field edges had greater contributions to all proxies than those located in field cores, especially in cereal crops. We identified that small weed species with short life cycles and low competitiveness, presented the optimum proxy combination, i.e. high services and low harmfulness. The development of these proxies and the proposed framework provide new avenues for assessing trade-offs between multiple ecosystem services at different temporal (crop sequence) and spatial scales (landscape).

AB  - Research Highlights: Mangrove forests are absorbing anthropogenically produced excess nitrogen under moderate to intensive human interaction in the study sites, further indicating the degree of deviation from the natural ecosystem condition. Background and Objectives: Mangrove species, when directly connected to anthropogenic activities such as sewage disposal, agricultural inputs, and receiving of animal manure, absorb excess nutrients from the systems and act as ecological indicators of long-term natural changes. However, there is a paucity of examples of how the mangroves respond to a land-use gradient comparing to the non-mangrove plants under indirect anthropogenic impacts. Materials and Methods: In this investigation, foliar total nitrogen (N), carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio, and delta N-15 of mangrove and non-mangrove species collected from 15 watersheds on three islands in Okinawa, Japan, have been compared. The land-use areas in the study watersheds were delineated by ArcGIS software, and the correlation between the foliar traits and the human-affected area ratios were examined. Results: Foliar delta N-15 of the mangroves, which was significantly different from those of the non-mangroves on each island, showed significantly higher values (5 parts per thousand to 14 parts per thousand) in human-affected forests, whereas the values were up to 3 parts per thousand in pristine forests. Furthermore, the significant positive relationship between foliar nitrogenous traits and the human-affected area ratios suggested that the anthropogenic N might be regulating foliar N content and delta N-15 signature on the sites. Conclusion: Different degrees of foliar isotopic fractionation with the land-use gradient have clarified that mangroves can be a powerful tool for monitoring ecosystem conditions under anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Autoecological traits of aquatic organisms are well known to provide crucial information on hydrosystems and are good complements to biotic indices for evaluating surface water ecological quality. In France, as in many other European countries, autoecological approaches concerning diatoms are based on a checklist developed in the Netherlands. While this work was pioneering and suited to the conditions of study, ecological indicators developed in such small scales and such specific natural environments often show reduced efficiency when used in other conditions.
   France is a vast and highly biogeographically diversified region with many situations that are not to be found in the Netherlands, such as limestone substrate rivers and torrents in mountainous areas. Consequently, the elaboration of a better suited autoecological reference system has been long requested by French water managers to support ecological diagnosis.
   In this study, we elaborated a new autoecological reference system gathering knowledge on environmental optima, tolerance and range values for 809 French diatom taxa, along with an ordinal classification for 7 autoecological traits: water acidity, water mineralisation, oxygen requirements, saprobity, trophic state, organic nitrogen and nitrates. By combining weighted averaging and regression tree techniques we also produced a simple, statistically robust and reproducible approach to study univariate taxa-environment relationships in a given region.
   This new trait matrix, in addition to providing autoecological attributes for over 200 French diatom taxa that had no correspondence in previous reference systems, also takes into account French specificities such as the scarcity of acidic situations and mineral nitrogen issues. On the basis of this new matrix, 3 autoecological functional groups have been identified in French diatom flora, mainly related to traits linked to anthropogenic disturbance. This revised autoecological classification will provide much more reliable information on French stream benthic diatoms ecology, and should therefore allow better ecological diagnosis if accompanied by rigorous management of synonyms and taxonomic levels.

AB  - Ecological restorations of contaminated sites balance the human and ecological risks of residual contamination with the benefits of ecological recovery and the return of lost ecological function and ecosystem services. Risk and recovery are interrelated dynamic conditions, changing as remediation and restoration activities progress through implementation into long-term management and ecosystem maturation. Monitoring restoration progress provides data critical to minimizing residual contaminant risk and uncertainty, while measuring ecological advancement toward recovery goals. Effective monitoring plans are designed concurrently with restoration plan development and implementation and are focused on assessing the effectiveness of activities performed in support of restoration goals for the site. Physical, chemical, and biotic measures characterize progress toward desired structural and functional ecosystem components of the goals. Structural metrics, linked to ecosystem functions and services, inform restoration practitioners of work plan modifications or more substantial adaptive management actions necessary to maintain desired recovery. Monitoring frequency, duration, and scale depend on specific attributes and goals of the restoration project. Often tied to restoration milestones, critical assessment of monitoring metrics ensures attainment of risk minimization and ecosystem recovery. Finally, interpretation and communication of monitoring findings inform and engage regulators, other stakeholders, the scientific community, and the public. Because restoration activities will likely cease before full ecosystem recovery, monitoring endpoints should demonstrate risk reduction and a successional trajectory toward the condition established in the restoration goals. A detailed assessment of the completed project's achievements, as well as unrealized objectives, attained through project monitoring, will determine if contaminant risk has been minimized, if injured resources have recovered, and if ecosystem services have been returned. Such retrospective analysis will allow better planning for future restoration goals and strengthen the evidence base for quantifying injuries and damages at other sites in the future.

AB  - Over recent decades farmland abandonment has affected large areas of the landscape. To better predict the changes associated with this process, we developed a secondary succession model based on Ellenberg indicator values describing the ecological niche of a tree along environmental gradients. These values are compared with local ecological factors dependent on terrain conditions. The terrain is represented by a Digital Terrain Model, where the local conditions are represented by a light availability model, climate data, soil properties, and a combination of a water flow model and average annual rainfall data. Each tree in our model is associated with its immediate circular ecological neighbourhood and is treated individually from the seedling stage through to its decay. Each year, tree heights, actual vigour, and neighbourhood radii were calculated. When two radii intersected, the vigour of both trees was compared. The weaker of the two became dominated, leading to stress-related mortality. When a tree reached the adult stage, it produced seeds that established new seedlings that competed for light and nutrition. To start the simulation, the initial amount of seed was planted on bare ground. It was possible to monitor the succession phases either visually or statistically. 3D tree models were used to visualize a tree at any age, generating realistic landscape images useful for demonstrating long-term changes in the cultural landscape to non-experts. The results were compared with those from previous field studies in various areas of Slovenia. Apart from predicting landscape changes after farmland abandonment, the model can be used for forecasting the regeneration process after clearcutting or natural disasters. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aims of this study were: (i) to assess if carbamate pesticides and ammonium, widely detected in European freshwater bodies, can be considered ecologically relevant endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) for benthic and interstitial freshwater copepods; and (ii) to evaluate the potential of copepods as sentinels for monitoring ecosystem health. In order to achieve these objectives, four species belonging to the harpacticoid copepod genus Bryocamptus, namely B. (E.) echinatus, B. (R.) zschokkei, B. (R.) pygmaeus and B. (B.) minutus, were subjected to chronic exposures to Aldicarb and ammonium. A significant deviation from the developmental time of unexposed control cultures was observed for all the species in test cultures. Aldicarb caused an increase in generation time over 80% in both B. minutus and B. zschokkei, but less than 35% in B. pygmaeus and B. echinatus. Ammonium increased generation time over 33% in B. minutus, and 14, 12 and 3.5% for B. pygmaeus, B. zschokkei and B. echinatus, respectively. On the basis of these results it can be concluded that chronic exposure to carbamate pesticides and ammonium alters the post-naupliar development of the test-species and propose their potential role as EDCs, leaving open the basis to search what are the mechanism underlying. A prolonged developmental time would probably produce a detrimental effect on population attributes, such as age structure and population size. These deviations from a pristine population condition may be considered suitable biological indicators-of ecosystem stress, particularly useful to compare polluted to unpolluted reference sites. Due to their dominance in both benthic and interstitial habitats, and their sensitivity as test organisms, freshwater benthic and hyporheic copepods can fully be used as sentinel species for assessing health condition of aquatic ecosystems as required by world-wide water legislation.

AB  - Aim. To develop unified methodological recommendations for the declaration of a tree or group of trees as natural monuments, for the monitoring of their condition, for the compilation of a cadastral register and of a passport identifying a protected natural object.
   Materials and Methods. On the basis of eco-floristic research and published data, the description of an ancient specimen of Juniperus excelsa M. Bieb near Cape Sarych, south-western Crimea, was undertaken. In accordance with standard parameters, methodological recommendations were prepared for the designation of unique trees as specially protected natural territories.
   Results. It was established that this specimen of J. excelsa is one of the most ancient examples in the territory of the Russian Federation, thus constituting the basis for its creation as a natural monument of federal significance (named "Patriarch of Tavrida", city of Sevastopol). It was shown, that in designating a tree or group of trees as protected natural objects it is necessary to define its biological and taxonomical characteristics and to provide documentary justification for necessary nature protective measures and modes of nature management.
   Conclusion. Methodological recommendations were developed which allow the unified description of a tree or group of trees to support their designation as specially protected natural territories. In the documentation required to justify designation it is recommended that data be compiled in ten principal categories: general characteristics; location; aims in creating the designation relating to the value of the monument's natural features; assessment of the contemporary nature management and condition of the monument; its taxation characteristics; assessment of its environmental significance; recreational resources and usage potential; negative factors and threats; identification of optimal boundaries and particular recommendations for a protection regime.

AB  - Natural or anthropogenic disturbances in the forest ecosystem alter ecological conditions and lead to shifts in microbial diversity. We focused on the topsoil properties of specific sites in Tatra National Park (Slovakia) that were affected by windthrow, wildfire and wood extraction. We analyzed soil organic matter content (SOM), dry weight (DW), enzymatic activity including dehydrogenase activity (DHA), fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDH) and phosphomonoesterase (PME). Bacterial community profiles were analyzed using the PCR-DGGE approach, and Ellenberg's indicator values (EIV) were used as eco-indices of studied sites. Dystric Cambisol was sampled at sites distinguished by management approaches established after windthrow in 2004 and wildfire in 2005. We focused on the windthrow site where wooden debris was extracted (EXT); the site left for self-recovery with no intervention (NEX); the site affected by wildfire (FIR), a former reference site damaged by the windstorm in 2014 followed by the extraction of wooden debris (REX), and a non-affected reference spruce stand (REF). The windthrow sites with different management (EXT, NEX) showed relative similarities based on enzymatic activity, bacterial community profiling (85%) and EIV comparison. The FIR site exhibited no similarities (0%) with EXT and NEX in the bacterial community structure. The SOM content correlated only with PME (r(2) = 0.42) and soil moisture (r(2) = 0.64). Based on RDA analysis, certain EIVs seem to be suitable indicators of selected soil properties. The lack of differences between NEX and EXT could be caused by the diminishing of post-disturbance effects on microbial communities. The effect of wildfire on microbial activity and bacterial community structure seems to be longer than different management approach.

AB  - Changes in the macroinvertebrate community in response to flow variations in the Little Stour River, Kent, UK, were examined over a 6 year period (1992-1997). This period included the final year of the 1988-1992 drought, followed by some of the wettest conditions recorded this century and a second period of drought between 1996 and 1997. Each year, samples were collected from 15 sites during late-summer base-flow conditions. Correspondence analysis identified clear differences between samples from upstream and downstream sites, and between drought and non-drought years. Step-wise multiple regression was used to identify hydrological indicators of community variation. Several different indices were used to describe the macroinvertebrate community, including macroinvertebrate community abundance, number of families and species, and individual species. Site characteristics were fundamental in accounting for variation in the unstandardized macroinvertebrate community. However, when differences between sites were controlled, hydrological conditions were found to play a dominant role in explaining ecological variation. Indices of high discharge (or their absence), 4-7 months prior to sampling (i.e. winter-spring), were found to be the most important variables for describing the late-summer community. The results are discussed in relation to the role of flow variability in shaping instream communities and management implications. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Flood damage reflects insufficient adaptation of human presence and activity to location and variability of river flow in a given climate. Flood risk increases when landscapes degrade, counteracted or aggravated by engineering solutions. Efforts to maintain and restore buffering as an ecosystem function may help adaptation to climate change, but this require quantification of effectiveness in their specific social-ecological context. However, the specific role of forests, trees, soil and drainage pathways in flow buffering, given geology, land form and climate, remains controversial. When complementing the scarce heavily instrumented catchments with reliable long-term data, especially in the tropics, there is a need for metrics for data-sparse conditions. We present and discuss a flow persistence metric that relates transmission to river flow of peak rainfall events to the base-flow component of the water balance. The dimensionless flow persistence parameter F-p is defined in a recursive flow model and can be estimated from limited time series of observed daily flow, without requiring knowledge of spatially distributed rainfall upstream. The F-p metric (or its change over time from what appears to be the local norm) matches local knowledge concepts. Inter-annual variation in the F-p metric in sample watersheds correlates with variation in the "flashiness index" used in existing watershed health monitoring programmes, but the relationship between these metrics varies with context. Inter-annual variation in F-p also correlates with common base-flow indicators, but again in a way that varies between watersheds. Further exploration of the responsiveness of F-p in watersheds with different characteristics to the interaction of land cover and the specific realisation of space-time patterns of rainfall in a limited obser-vation period is needed to evaluate interpretation of F-p as an indicator of anthropogenic changes in watershed conditions.

AB  - Nutrient enrichment and eutrophication of estuarine and coastal waters are accelerating, and there is a need to develop rapidly detectable and quantifiable indicators of these changes. Coastal systems are also impacted by climatic perturbations, including droughts, storms, and floods, the frequencies of which may be increasing. Phytoplankton are excellent indicators of ecological change. They are relatively easy to detect, identify, and quantify; they conduct a large share of primary production; and they are sensitive to diverse environmental stressors. In this study, phytoplankton total biomass, as chlorophyll a, and group-specific chemotaxonomic indicators (including chlorophylls and carotenoids) were used to characterize community responses to human (nutrient) and climatic (hydrologic) perturbations in the Neuse River Estuary-Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA. This estuarine-coastal continuum is experiencing anthropogenic nutrient enrichment and, since 1996, a rise in hurricane frequency. Freshwater input and flushing strongly interacted with supplies of the limiting nutrient nitrogen (N) to determine the location, magnitude, and composition of phytoplankton biomass along this continuum. Elevated flow (high flushing) following hurricanes favored dominance by the fast-growing chlorophytes and cryptophytes. Diatoms tended to dominate under moderate flow, while dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria increased in dominance when low flow prevailed in winter/spring and summer/fall, respectively. Depending on seasonal hydrologic cycles and episodic (hurricane) conditions, phytoplankton community structure differed substantially. These changes impact eutrophication, food web, biogeochernical (e.g., hypoxia), and habitat conditions in this and other coastal ecosystems currently experiencing changes in nutrient inputs and climatic events. Phytoplankton-based indicators are adaptable to unattended monitoring platforms (e.g., ferries) that can be coupled to remote sensing and modeling efforts, in order to evaluate and help manage ecological change at ecosystem and regional scales.

AB  - The memory-based recognition of a goal is a capacity well demonstrated in birds, and understanding this ability often involves determining the relative importance of spatial and feature information in representing the properties of a goal. However, surprisingly little avian research has examined goal recognition in a field setting. Here, we demonstrate that homing pigeons can be successfully trained outdoors to fly to and land on a goal platform located in an array of other platforms at a distance on the order of 100 m. They can do so under conditions when the properties of the goal are stable in time as well as when the properties of the goal periodically change; the latter condition indicating that homing pigeons can rapidly adapt their memory representations to take into account changing environmental conditions. When probed for preferential use of either spatial (location) or feature-based (color) information, the pigeons demonstrated an indifferent capacity to use both independent of task demands. The homing pigeon memory systems that support goal recognition appear to be opportunistic with respect to the information exploited, using spatial and feature information equally to guide their behavior. Therefore, and despite strong natural and artificial selection for navigational ability, spatial information is no more important than feature cues in representing a goal location for homing pigeons flying outdoors.

AB  - Climate change presents severe risks for the implementation and success of environmental flows worldwide. Current environmental flow assessments tend to assume climate stationarity, so there is an urgent need for robust environmental flow programs that allow adaptation to changing flow regimes due to climate change. Designing and implementing robust environmental flow programs means ensuring environmental objectives are achieved under a range of uncertain, but plausible climate futures. We apply stress testing concepts previously adopted in water supply management to environmental flows at a catchment scale. We do this by exploring vulnerabilities in different river management metrics for current environmental flow arrangements in the Goulburn River, Australia, under non-stationary climatic conditions. Given the limitations of current environmental flows in supporting ecological outcomes under climate change, we tested three different adaptation options individually and in combination. Stress testing adaptation results showed that increasing environmental entitlements yielded the largest benefits in drier climate futures, whereas relaxing river capacity constraints (allowing more targeted delivery of environmental water) offered more benefits for current and wetter climates. Combining both these options led to greater than additive improvements in allocation reliability and reductions in environmental water shortfalls, and these improvements were achieved across a wider range of climatic conditions than possible with either of the individual options. However, adaptation may present additional risks to some ecological outcomes for wetter climates. Ultimately, there was a degree of plausible climate change beyond which none of the adaptation options considered were effective at improving ecological outcomes. This study demonstrates an important step for environmental flow assessments: evaluating the feasibility of environmental outcomes under climate change, and the intervention options that prove most robust under an uncertain future.

AB  - Many upland rivers in the Northern Hemisphere contain important habitat for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Owing to their sensitivity to environmental change, salmon are often used as bio-indicators. In Scotland, rivers containing potentially suitable habitat for salmon fry are often also regulated for hydropower. Regulated flow regimes can differ substantially spatially and temporally. Thus, where river management may be needed to maintain, restore, and protect their ecological functioning, this needs to be based on evidence of such spatiotemporal effects. This study investigated the effects of different types of river regulation on the hydraulic characteristics of downstream river reaches and the inferred consequences for salmon fry using hydraulic habitat quality models. The study focussed on the River Lyon (390 km(2)), a tributary of the Tay (4587 km2), Scotland, UK. Hydraulic habitat variability was assessed for three reach-scale sites with contrasting flow regimes characterised by (a) releases from hydropower generation, (b) compensation flow and (c) partly re-naturalised flow conditions. For each site, high resolution Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) were developed from bathymetric surveys and 2D hydraulic models were used to assess hydraulic characteristics. Discharge time series were used to simulate hydraulic conditions for regulated and simulated natural flows. Depth and velocity data were extracted from the hydraulic models and used to infer habitat quality using a habitat model developed for Atlantic salmon fry in similar-sized Scottish rivers. Results showed the effects of regulation can vary substantially within reaches and between seasons. Comparison to natural flow regimes suggested that flow alteration has a variable influence on habitat quality depending on the type of regulation and time of year. This work has improved understanding of the effects of regulation on biophysical processes and may also be useful for managing tradeoffs between management, restoration, and societal benefits.

AB  - Interest in the biodiversity value of urban waters is growing. Understanding key ecological processes is essential for effective management of these aquatic ecosystems. Our paper focuses on identifying the key factors that structure chironomid assemblages, such as water quality and dredging, in urban waters strongly influenced by seepage of large rivers. Chironomid assemblages were studied in urban surface-water systems (man-made drainage ditches) in polder areas along lowland reaches of the rivers Rhine-Meuse in The Netherlands. Multivariate analysis was used to identify the key environmental factors. Taxon richness, Shannon index (H'), rareness of species, and life-history strategies at urban locations were compared with available data from similar man-made water bodies in rural areas, and the effectiveness of dredging for restoring chironomid diversity in urban waters was tested. Three different chironomid associations were distinguished by Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis. Variation within and among chironomid associations were significantly related to substrate (sludge layer and substrate type: sand vs clay), % cover of lemnids, submerged vegetation, filamentous algae, and water transparency. Chironomid taxon richness and H' were similar in urban and rural waters, probably because of their similar hydrologic, morphologic, and water-quality conditions and their similar dredging and weed-control regimes. Rareness was slightly higher in urban than in rural waters. In urban water systems, chironomid taxon richness was negatively related to sludge layer and % cover of lemnids. Dredging changed chironomid species composition, and increased taxon richness and life-history strategies indicative of good 02 conditions. Therefore, dredging can be regarded as an effective measure to restore diversity of chironomid communities in urban waters affected by nutrient-rich seepage or inlet of river water.

AB  - The chemical composition of bivalve shells can reflect that of their environment, making them useful indicators of climate, pollution, and ecosystem changes. However, biological factors can also influence chemical properties of biogenic carbonate. Understanding how these factors affect chemical incorporation is essential for studies that use elemental chemistry of carbonates as indicators of environmental parameters. This study examined the effects of bivalve shell growth rate and age on the incorporation of elements into juvenile softshell clams, Mya arenaria. Although previous studies have explored the effects of these two biological factors, reports have differed depending on species and environmental conditions. In addition, none of the previous studies have examined growth rate and age in the same species and within the same study. We reared clams in controlled laboratory conditions and used solution-based inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis to explore whether growth rate affects elemental incorporation into shell. Growth rate was negatively correlated with Mg, Mn, and Ba shell concentration, possibly due to increased discrimination ability with size. The relationship between growth rate and Pb and Sr was unresolved. To determine age effects on incorporation, we used laser ablation ICP-MS to measure changes in chemical composition across shells of individual clams. Age affected incorporation of Mn, Sr, and Ba within the juvenile shell, primarily due to significantly different elemental composition of early shell material compared to shell accreted later in life. Variability in shell composition increased closer to the umbo (hinge), which may be the result of methodology or may indicate an increased ability with age to discriminate against ions that are not calcium or carbonate. The effects of age and growth rate on elemental incorporation have the potential to bias data interpretation and should be considered in any biogeochemical study that uses bivalves as environmental indicators.

The parameters used to define watercourse typology are in accord with the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC outlined by the European Commission. The relationships were tested using descriptive and multivariate statistical analysis, namely cluster analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. It was found that only some of the typological parameters have a close association with indicators of surface water quality. Specifically, the parameters of altitude and geology show clear relationships with pH, calcium content, and the saprobity index of macroinvertebrates. Conversely, parameters that are strongly influenced by anthropogenic pollution show weak relationships with indicators of surface water quality. These depend instead on the presence of pollution sources rather than on natural environmental conditions.

AB  - The lagg of a raised bog is a transition zone where runoff collects from the ombrotrophic (rain-fed) bog and adjacent mineral soils. Distinct hydrological and hydrochemical gradients exist across the lagg zone, resulting in specific plant communities. Little research emphasis has been placed on the lagg zone in the past, with studies tending to focus on the more easily-defined bog instead. Recently, peatland researchers have begun to discuss the importance of the lagg to raised bog restoration. This paper reviews current knowledge on lagg zones, the function of this transition zone, some useful indicators to determine its location in the field, and argues that restoration of the lagg should be a key element in raised bog restoration.

AB  - A plant community is an open thermodynamic system. In accordance with the first and second laws of thermodynamics, the total internal energy U of a plant community before reaching equilibrium will increase under natural conditions because of solar energy intake and nutrient uptake. As state functions of a thermodynamic system, enthalpy H, entropy S and Gibbs free energy G are related to U by G + TS = H = U + PV. Increase in U will lead to increases in H, S and G since given volume V and temperature T or pressure P, dG + TdS = dH = dU > 0. The experimental data collected from the plant communities restored on a manganese tailing site confirmed the potential trend of increase in H, S and G of the plant communities with increase in their biomass quantity and biodiversity. The traditional criterion "Delta G < 0" would then be no longer valid as a spontaneity index for description of the ecological process of a growing and developing plant community. Since G/H = 1-T(S/H), given T, G/H will be negatively related to S/H. The number of plant species N is an essential property of a plant community, and as a function of N, the S/H ratio is expected to increase with increase in species richness under natural conditions, resulting in d(S/H) >= 0 and d(G/H) <= 0. The change in G/H can thus be applied as a thermodynamic parameter to judge the spontaneity of plant community growth and development. The results obtained from the present study showed that both G/H and S/H ratios were useful indicators for description of the ecological restoration process.

AB  - Atmospheric conditions have some direct and indirect effects on plant growth in many ways. This effect is important especially in physical, chemical or biological process in plant growth. Deviations from optimum conditions could negatively affect plant growth. Thought that the climate is the main factor limiting the plant distribution and living, the climatic parameters would be used as indicators of plant productivity. Annual mean temperature (TEMP) and annual mean precipitation (PREC) are two of the most used climate factors to model stand productivity. Annual mean minimum-maximum temperature, temperature and precipitation in growing season, actual evapotranspiration (AET) and moisture index have been also used in related studies. This study aims to determine the relationships between some climate factors and the site index (SI) of oriental spruce (Picea orientalis (L.) Link.) naturally distributed in Rize-Kackar Mountainous Ecoregion in Turkey. Within this scope, 54 sample plots were visited in the study area and tree height, tree diameter at breast height and stand age were measured in each sample plot to determine SI. Climatic data was obtained from meteorological stations closest to study areas Results showed that SI of oriental spruce were positively correlated with annual mean temperature (r= 0,424), mean temperature in during season (VTEMP) (r= 0,484) and annual AET (r= 0,312). On the other hand annual mean precipitation (r= -0,593), mean precipitation during growing season (VPREC) (r= -0,633) and the Thornthwaite moisture index (THMI) (r= 0,541) were negatively correlated with SI. To model the SI multiple linear regression technique was used. The model, consisting of VTEMP and VPREC accounted for only 42,7 % of the variation in SI. The results show the importance of climate factors on oriental spruce growth, especially in site selection for afforestation activities.

AB  - The epifaunal communities characteristic of the southern New England, USA, region between eastern Long Island Sound, CT, and Cape Cod, MA, comprise a complex system in which different mechanisms at certain threshold levels can cause the establishment of 4 distinct community states: (1) a diverse native community dominated by bryozoans and sponges most commonly found in open coast areas, (2) an invasive ascidian community characteristic of marinas and areas of coastal development, (3) a mussel-dominated community occurring after massive recruitment and (4) an ascidian community dominated by Diplosoma listerianum that occurs only in years following warm winters. Each of these states is fairly resilient, but the spatial extent and duration of each state can be highly variable. Transitions among the states occur if some set of threshold conditions are surpassed and reasonable predictions can be made based on knowledge of the natural history of the species within the system. Two sets of processes seem to control the resilience of each state and the thresholds beyond which a transition to a new state occurs: (1) fast and local processes such as within-population recruitment, predation or bioengineering by mussels and (2) slow regional processes such as climate change, coastal development or habitat restoration. Of these, coastal development and restoration efforts are under management control and could have large effects on these community states, in particular the native community. However, we may not be able to influence large-scale regional processes such as climate change that may favor non-native communities. Nevertheless, the different community states can be used as indicators of both local and regional management success and allow local management efforts to be put in the context of larger scale shifts in threshold conditions that affect regional community patterns.

AB  - One of the longest (above 7 m thick) uninterrupted Eemian-Vistulian (Weichselian) pollen successions in Poland is known from Kublowo (central Poland). The huge importance of this succession is manifested in the possibility of study the evolution of the lake environment under the influence of changing, from interglacial to glacial climatic conditions.
   The reconstruction of the environmental changes at Kublowo and its surroundings show the short climate fluctuations and a detailed picture of the natural conditions prevailing in central Poland (central Europe) during the period from approximately 126,000 to 55,000 years BP. Based on the results of multiproxy analysis, four lacustrine stages linked with a higher water level and three boggy stages (low water level) of evolution of the Kublowo paleolake were observed.
   The pollen diagram from Kublowo reveals a succession of eighteen local pollen assemblage zones (K1-K18 L PAZ). The K1 to K7 LPAZ zones record the interglacial succession correlated with the Eemian. The next pollen zones, K8 to K18, are linked with the Vistulian. The pollen sequence shows, between the Eemian Interglacial (MIS 5e) and the last glaciation (second stadial of the Plenivistulian (MIS 4-3), four cold intervals that are interpreted as stadial phases: Herning, Rederstall, Schalkholtz and Ebersdorf separated by three temperate intervals (interstadials): Brorup, Odderade and Oerel.
   In the studied sediments, 25 species of subfossil Cladocera were identified, and ten zones of fauna development were distinguished. The unique feature of this profile is the good preservation of above 100,000-year-old Cladocera remains and a high diversity of species, which are primarily littoral. The Middle and Late Eemian were periods convenient to Cladocera development due to high temperatures, high water levels, high trophy and occurrence macrophytes. A deterioration of fauna living conditions started in the Late Eemian and next took place in the Vistulian cold events.
   The results of isotopic and geochemical analyses of organic matter from Kublowo have enabled the reconstruction of varying environmental conditions and the origin of organic matter. The organic carbon content (TOC) changes from 1% to 40% and is closely related to climatic conditions. During the Eemian, the amount of TOC systematically increased. The lowest values are recorded in the coldest periods during the Herning, Rederstall and Schalkholz Stadials. The C/N atomic ratio fluctuates from 13 to 34 and the highest values occur in the Brorup Interstadial. The values of delta C-13 change from -27.9 to -12.9%, and delta N-15 values oscillate between -1.6 and +5.3%. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study we reconstructed the moisture condition of the eastern Qaidam Basin of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau based on a 3585-year tree ring chronology. The growth environment of Qilian juniper (Sabina przewalskii kom.) on the mountains in the eastern Qaidam Basin was first determined by comparing precipitation and temperature estimates from two spatial datasets (PRISM and World Climate). Moisture balance was calculated as the sum of simulated moisture deficit (negative) and surplus using a modified Thornthwaite water balance model, and used as a proxy of biological drought conditions. Using data during 1956-2005, we established the transfer function to reconstruct a 2847-year series of January-June moisture balance (843 BCE-2004 CE). With an adjusted R-2 value of 0.654 of the transfer function and strong performance in validation, the reconstructed January June moisture balance can be considered an excellent indicator of biological drought conditions for the study region. The reconstructed series showed strong correlations with reconstructed PDSI in the monsoon Asian region, representing a region of 10 degrees latitudes by 20 degrees longitudes. Using the reconstructed series, we identified centennial scale dry periods since 843 BCE: 381-277 BCE, 425-520 CE, 1108-1212 CE, 1428-1516 CE, and 1634-1743 CE. Additionally it had statistically significant negative correlations with a monsoon intensity proxy based on oxygen stable isotope from southwestern China (Dongge Cave). Further analyses identified significant relationships with solar activity, especially during the last 700 years. We confirmed the similar to 200-year cyclic pattern in the reconstructed moisture balance series, which matched the known 210-year de Vries solar cycle and peaked during the Little Ice Age. However, the cyclic patterns of the reconstructed moisture balance series and solar activity were decoupled for the period prior to approx. 1300 CE. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nezara viridula (L.) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) recently expanded its distribution range in Japan and reached Osaka. In the southern temperate zone, the species overwinters in the adult stage and reproductive diapause is associated with a body colour change from green to russet. In Osaka, the reproductive diapause is only induced in September-October and nymphs from late egg masses are destined to die during winter. However, the fate of adults emerging late in the season remained unknown. Survival, body colour change, and post-diapause reproduction were studied under quasi-natural conditions in Osaka in 1999-2000 in those adults that attained adulthood as late as in November. Two experimental cohorts were used: in the Outdoor cohort, insects were reared outdoors starting in their second instar (28 September); in the Laboratory cohort, nymphs and subsequently adults were reared from the same day under diapause-inducing conditions (L10:D14 at 25 degreesC), then acclimatized (5 days at 20 degreesC and 5 days at 15 degreesC; L10:D14) and transferred outdoors on 1 December. Adults in both cohorts did not reproduce in autumn and survived the winter with a low mortality. More than 20% of adults in the Outdoor cohort failed to change body colour from green to russet during winter, apparently because of the low ambient temperature, suggesting that the environmental conditions required for colour change do not completely coincide with those required for diapause induction, and that the colour of the adults is not always a reliable indicator of diapause in this species. After overwintering, females from the Outdoor cohort produced significantly fewer egg masses and eggs and had a significantly shorter period of oviposition than females that entered diapause under short-day conditions in the Laboratory cohort. Thus, if progeny from the late egg masses attain adulthood late in the autumn, these adults have high chances of successful overwintering, but their reproductive output after the winter diapause is significantly reduced.

AB  - A basic requirement in the development of modern fruit growing, that should be characterized by economic and ecological efficiency, is the detailed knowledge of the factors which are influencing the crop development, namely: environmental conditions and culture methods. Both aspects must have as final goal the maintenance and permanent improvement of the soil fertility. The rational, economically and ecologically efficient application of fertilizers can be achieved only by knowing in detail the physico-chemical conditions of the soil, considered as a means of living production necessary for plant growth. Thus we can determine the technological links in which we must intervene to obtain sustainable production both in terms of environmental protection and economically. It is also important to remember that by knowing these characteristics, we can identify the ecological methods of disease and pest control, given that the health of plants is directly influenced by the health and fertility of the soil. In 2019, before planting, soil samples were collected from depths of 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm. The samples were analyzed from the point of view of the main soil fertility indicators, respectively: pH, humus content, degree of saturation in bases, nitrogen index, mobile phosphorus, sum of bases and hydrolytic acidity, in order to determine the favorable cultivation of fruiting shrubs. The paper makes recommendations on the need to apply fertilizers in order to optimize the conditions for setting up a new orchard in an intensive system.

AB  - Global water planners are increasingly considering seawater desalination as an alternative to traditional freshwater supplies. Since desalination is both expensive and energy intensive, taking advantage of favorable natural and societal conditions while siting desalination facilities can provide significant financial and environmental returns. Currently, policy makers do not use a location-specific integrated analytical framework to determine where natural and societal conditions are conducive to desalination. This analysis seeks to fill that gap by demonstrating a multi-criteria, geographically-resolved methodology for identifying suitable regions for desalination infrastructure where 1) available renewable resources can offset part of the fossil energy load; 2) feedwater characteristics reduce the total energy needed for desalination; and 3) human populations have capacity and willingness to pay for desalinated water. This work demonstrates the method with a quantitative global analysis that identifies favorable sites for solar-aided seawater reverse osmosis desalination (SWRO) based on specific target criteria. Location-based data about natural conditions (solar insolation, ocean salinity, and ocean temperature) are integrated and mapped with social indicators (water stress, prevailing water prices, and population) to identify regions where solar-aided SWRO has the highest potential. This work concludes that water-stressed tropical and subtropical cities show the highest potential for economically sustainable solar-aided SWRO. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Salmonids show a high degree of phenotypic plasticity that can differ among genotypes, and this variation is one of the major factors contributing to uncertainty in extrapolating laboratory-based risk assessment data to nature. Many studies have examined the relative growth and survival of transgenic and non-transgenic salmonids, and the results have been highly variable due to genotype x environment interactions. The relative survival of fast- and slow-growing strains can reverse depending on the environment, but it is not clear which specific environmental characteristics are driving these responses. To address this question, two experiments were designed where environmental conditions were varied to investigate the contribution of rearing density, food amount, food type, habitat complexity, and risk of predation on relative growth and survival of fast-growing transgenic and slow-growing wild-type coho salmon. The first experiment altered density (high vs. low) and food amount (high vs. low). Density impacted the relative growth of the genotypes, where transgenic fish grew more than non-transgenic fish in low density streams, regardless of food level. Density also affected survival, with high density causing increased mortality for both genotypes, but the mortality of transgenic relative to non-transgenic fish was lower within the high-density streams, regardless of food level. The second experiment altered habitat complexity (simple vs. complex), food type (artificial vs. natural), amount of food (normal vs. satiation), and risk of predation (present vs. absent). Results from this experiment showed that genotype affected growth and survival, but genotype effects were modulated by one or more environmental factors. The effect of genotype on survival was influenced by all examined environmental factors, such that no predictable trend in relative survival of transgenic versus non-transgenic fry emerged. This was primarily due to variations in survival of non-transgenic fish under different environmental conditions (non-transgenic fry had highest survival in hatchery conditions, and lowest survival in complex conditions with natural food fed at a normal level with or without predators). Transgenic fry survival was only significantly influenced by predator presence. The effects of genotype on mass and length were significantly modulated by food type only. Transgenic fry were able to gain a large size advantage over non-transgenic fish when fed artificial food under all habitat types. These experiments support the observations of dynamic responses in growth and survival depending on the environment, and demonstrate the challenge of applying laboratory-based experiments to risk assessment in nature.

AB  - One of the main issues of radiobiology is the study not only of the sensitivity of cellular structures and individual systems of the body under chronic irradiation, but also the study of genetic variability of populations. Chronic exposure increases mutations in the population and stabilizes the number of mutations after several generations. It is shown that as a result of low-dose exposure to natural populations, the genetic load has been growing for many generations until the level of mutation load stabilizes.
   The study of the dynamics of genetic variability of populations, which is characterized by indicators of adaptation of individuals (fertility, viability) to environmental conditions and mutation load (dominant lethal mutations) allows not only to assess the sensitivity of populations to the effects of adverse factors, but also to determine the mechanisms of maintaining homeosis populations in changing conditions. The effects of low-dose chronic radiation on experimental populations of Drosophila derived from wild-type lines that differ in the content of mobile genetic elements are studied. It is shown that chronic irradiation (0.25 mGy/h, Ra-226) for 30 generations leads to destabilization of the genome, manifested in changes in the indicators of adaptability and mutability of populations, namely, in a significant increase in the level of embryonic mortality, reducing the level of viability, increasing the frequency of dominant lethals, reducing fertility in irradiated populations.

AB  - Nematode communities are meaningful biological indicators of soil health and soil processes across different grassland types and management practices and analyses of nematode communities provide insight into structure, function, and sensitivity or resilience across multiple ecosystems. In three model grasslands: meadow steppe (MS), typical steppe (TS), and alpine meadow (AM), this current research examined responses of soil nematode communities and related edaphic characteristics to grazing, mowing, and crop cultivation at two soil depths. The research fills a critical knowledge gap by resolving multidirectional influences between local conditions, grassland management practices, and nematode communities. Across grassland types, nematode abundance in AM was greater than MS and TS grasslands, and nematodes were more abundant near the soil surface. Cultivation resulted in greater nematode abundance compared to all other management practices, and generally, bacterivores were the most dominant nematode trophic group. The TS and MS grasslands had relatively more bacterivores, exhibiting substantial influences on soil mineralization and organic matter decomposition pathways. The AM grassland showed relatively more plant feeding nematodes, driving soil mineralization pathways. Among the three management practices, crop cultivation had the greatest impact on nematode community structure and the soil environment, especially in relatively sensitive AM grasslands. In fact, AM soil environments responded most dramatically to cultivation, with nematode abundance, soil quality, and food web complexity increasing. However, soil ecosystem stability, food web reliance, and food web response to resources decreased in cultivated AM soils. Results indicate that unique environmental characteristics in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau drive substantially different AM grassland nematode community structure and soil conditions compared to TS or MS grasslands. As anthropogenic pressures on these ecosystems mount, it is critical to understand how different management practices influence grassland nematode communities, with cascading effects through soil environments.

AB  - Understanding plant resource use efficiencies (RUEs) and their tradeoffs in a desert shrub community, particularly as it concerns the usage of water, light, and nitrogen, remains an ecological imperative. Plant RUEs have been widely used as indicators to understand plant acclimation processes to unfavorable environmental conditions. This study aimed to examine seasonal dynamics in RUEs in two widely distributed plant species in a typical desert shrub community (i.e., Artemisia ordosica and Leymus secalinus) based on in-situ measurements of leaf photosynthesis, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen concentration (i.e., N-mass + N-area), and several site-related abiotic factors. Both species exhibited significant seasonal variation in RUEs, with a coefficient of variation (CV) > 30% and seasonal divergence among the various RUEs. Seasonal divergence was largely controlled by variation in stomatal conductance (Gs), which was in turn influenced by variation in soil water content (SWC) and water vapor pressure deficit (VPD). RUEs between species converged, being positively correlated, yielding: (i) r(2) = 0.40 and p < 0.01 for WUE; (ii) r(2) = 0.18 and p < 0.01 for LUE; and (iii) r(2) = 0.25 and p < 0.01 for NUE. RUEs for A. ordosica were mostly larger than those for L. secalinus, but less reactive to drought. This suggests A. ordosica was more conservative in its usage of available resources and was, therefore, better able to adapt to arid conditions. Resource use strategies between species differed in response to drought. Desert shrubs are projected to eventually replace grasses, as drought severity and duration increase with sustained regional climate change.

AB  - The main goal of our research is to verify the existence of a model of succession in lake fauna based on the example of water beetles. To contribute to this aim, we have completed a study on 28 harmonic lakes in northern Poland. Water beetles were captured from six different littoral mesohabitats: sandy bottom, Lobelia sp., rushes and bulrushes, non-sandy bottom, Phragmites sp., and sedge stands of the shallowest littoral zone. The relationship between the number of species and the degree of succession is not linear. In the final stages of succession, species richness becomes impoverished. On the other hand, lake succession has a clear influence on changes in the ecological structure of fauna, i.e. the mutual quantitative relationships between ecological groups. The beetle fauna in the transitional stage of evolution (mesotrophic lakes) is most typical of lakes. With consecutive stages of the succession of harmonic lakes, a decrease in the share of the lake component was observed, while the share of generalists increased. These changes are directional and indicate clearly some degradation of lake fauna as a result of the lake's evolution. Their causes should be sought on different spatial scales - at the lake's catchment level (type of land use), immediate surroundings, the shoreline (height of the shores, degree of macrophyte development, type of substrate) and water parameters, mainly oxygen saturation and electrolytic conductivity. Some of these conditions, for example, the nearest surroundings of a lake (share of natural and semi-natural land relative to the anthropogenically transformed land, or the height of lake shores) may additionally cause certain modifications in the succession of lakes. Irrespective of the stage of succession, the lakes surveyed provide favourable conditions for many species that are rare and endangered throughout Europe.

AB  - The boreal forest ecosystem is one of the largest frontier forests of the world, providing many ecological services to society. Boreal forests are also economically important, but forest harvesting and management become increasingly difficult when one moves from south to north in boreal environments. An approach was thus developed to assess the suitability of land units for timber production in a sustainable forest management (SFM) context in the northern boreal forest of Quebec (Canada). This area includes all of Quebec's spruce - feather moss bioclimatic domain (closed forest), as well as the southern portion of the spruce-lichen bioclimatic domain (open woodland). Four criteria specific to the biophysical aspects of SFM were evaluated in 1114 land districts: physical environment, timber production capacity, forest vulnerability to fire (e.g., probability that it reaches maturity), and conservation of biodiversity. Indicators and acceptability cutoff values were determined for each selected criterion, and a sequential analysis was developed to evaluate if a land district has the potential to be sustainably managed. This analytical process led to the classification of land districts into three categories: slightly sensitive (SFM possible); moderately sensitive (SFM possible under certain conditions); and highly sensitive (SFM not possible). The results show that 354 land districts were highly sensitive, 62 due to physical constraints (7.5% of the area), 130 due to insufficient potential productivity (15.4% of the area), 92 due to insufficient potential productivity to account for the fire risk (13.8% of the area), and 70 due to an insufficient proportion of tall and dense forest habitats (7.7% of the area - biodiversity criterion). This work provides scientific background to proposing a northern limit for forest management activities in Quebec. The developed approach could be useful in other jurisdictions to address similar issues.

AB  - The natural flow paradigm (NFP) emphasizes the need to partially or fully maintain or restore the range of natural intra- and interannual variation of hydrologic regimes to protect native biodiversity and the evolutionary potential of aquatic, riparian and wetland ecosystems. Based on our studies of natural and managed flow regimes in New Zealand, we do not believe that all components of the natural flow regime are necessary to achieve the objectives of the NFP, either partially or fully, because many aquatic species have very flexible niches and life-history requirements (i.e. there is 'ecological redundancy'). Obviously, maintaining the natural flow regime will maintain the hydrologic and hydraulic conditions necessary for sustaining natural ecosystems. However, if there is adequate knowledge of what 'values' need to be maintained in a waterway, and the aspects of the flow regime that are required to maintain those values are also known, then regimes can be designed that target these requirements and thus optimize conditions for the 'values'. We believe that an assessment of ecosystem requirements using information on river processes together with habitat requirements and life-history strategies of biota can achieve the best balance between resource use and sustaining ecosystem function and value, and show examples where changes to natural flow regimes have maintained, or even improved, instream values in some New Zealand rivers. We caution that simple flow-based rules, such as those that might be developed under the NFP, could be unnecessarily restrictive on multiple use of water in New Zealand while, at the same time, preclude the opportunity for enhancement of key ecosystem values in many waterways.

AB  - The range and precipitation effectiveness of the Indian summer monsoon in the NW of the subcontinent is subject to contentious discussions for several decades. This topic was mostly treated from a climatological point of view. Only recently, integrated approaches are pursued using the indicator functions of the vegetation for monsoonal humidity influx in more detail. In this paper, new climatological findings are correlated with recent vegetation ecological and phytogeographical studies in order to assess the dependence of closed sub-humid forests on monsoonal precipitation north of the main Himalayan range.
   General climatic conditions in the region are characterized by a SW-NE-directed gradient of decreasing humidity. They result from the position in a transitional area of two genetically different precipitation regimes: Extratropical westerly circulation and tropical monsoon regime. This paper analyzes the relationships of monsoonal humidity influx and distribution patterns, synecology, synsociology, and regeneration of major forest communities (Pinus wallichiana-, Picea smithiana-communities) towards the dry limits of forests in the region. Small-scale distribution patterns of forest stands correspond to the spatial differentiation of water vapour transport from shallow monsoonal depressions over the crestlines of West Himalaya and Karakorum. This transport is modified by the topography of high mountain chains, acting as barriers against moist labile air masses from the south. The gradual decrease of humidity along the SW-NE-gradient is reflected by synsociological characteristics of communities, i.e. by their differentiations into mesic and xeric subassociations. The forests appear to be relict ecosystems of moister periods of the Holocene. Under presently drier conditions in an extreme subtropical arid high mountain environment, the maintenance of an equable forest climate is indispensable for successful regeneration. Thus, further forest degradation will lead to an irreversible loss of forest habitats.

AB  - Numerous physical and chemical approaches are existing for metal elimination from the soil; nonetheless, phytoremediation is regarded as one of the paramount effective and cost-friendly approach. However, ample work has been done all over the world to appraise phytoremediation capability of plants in controlled conditions; only limited studies are existing on metal uptake abilities of plants cultivated under natural conditions. So, the present work estimates the phytoremediation potential of rice, imperative food crop cultivated in agricultural soils of Punjab with key objective to appraise the accretion and transport of metals (Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr, Cd, Ni, As and Pb) in roots, stems and leaves. Data was analysed by using Pearson's correlation analysis and heatmap analysis. Correlation analysis exhibited strong relationship among metals in soil and different tissues of rice. pH, soil organic carbon and phosphorus showed significant correlation with studied metal(loid)s in the soils affecting their availability and retention. In soil, highest and lowest concentrations of Zn and Pb were found for different sites, respectively. In rice among all the metals, Ni was found maximum in roots and stems, while Zn content was recorded maximum in leaves. The results of bioaccumulation factor and translocation factor were obtained above one for Zn, Mn, Ni, Cr, Cd and Pb, signifying the phytoremediation potential of rice in natural conditions.

AB  - This study evaluates the possibility of using autumn coloration of young Scots pine (Pious sylvestris L.) seedlings as an indicator of adaptation to harsh climate conditions. One-year old seedlings from natural stands with different origins and seed orchards were classified as "red/reddish" and "green" based on the needle color after artificially increased night length in nursery and then measured after 14 years in field trials. In almost all the studied groups seedlings classified as "red/reddish" had significantly higher survival rate than seedlings classified as "green". The survival of "red/reddish" was 14.2% higher than "green" among natural stand seed material and 56.2% among seed orchard material. During the study period the survival difference between "red/reddish" and "green" seedlings tended to increase. The seedling color had limited connection with the height growth, even though the trees classified as "red/reddish" were slightly taller than those classified as "green". However, the total productivity over all field trials, described here as a heightsum, of "red/reddish" trees was 15% higher than productivity of "green" trees from natural stand material, and 61% higher than those from seed orchard material. It seems that controlled selection based on autumn color can be utilized within seed crops of different types with the aim to increase the adaptability of seed material to different environmental conditions.

AB  - The trophic status classification of coastal waters at the European scale requires the availability of harmonised indicators and procedures. The composite trophic status index (TRIX) provides useful metrics for the assessment of the trophic status of coastal waters. It was originally developed for Italian coastal waters and then applied in many European seas (Adriatic, Tyrrhenian, Baltic, Black and Northern seas). The TRIX index does not fulfil the classification procedure suggested by the WFD for two reasons: (a) it is based on an absolute trophic scale without any normalization to type-specific reference conditions; (b) it makes an ex ante aggregation of biological (Chl-a) and physico-chemical (oxygen, nutrients) quality elements, instead of an ex post integration of separate evaluations of biological and subsequent chemical quality elements.
   A revisitation of the TRIX index in the light of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC) and new TRIX derived tools are presented in this paper. A number of Italian coastal sites were grouped into different types based on a thorough analysis of their hydro-morphological conditions, and type-specific reference sites were selected. Unsealed TRIX values (UNTRIX) for reference and impacted sites have been calculated and two alternative UNTRIX-based classification procedures are discussed. The proposed procedures, to be validated on a broader scale, provide users with simple tools that give an integrated view of nutrient enrichment and its effects on algal biomass (Chl-a) and on oxygen levels. This trophic evaluation along with phytoplankton indicator species and algal blooms contribute to the comprehensive assessment of phytoplankton, one of the biological quality elements in coastal waters.

AB  - Purpose Environmental assessments in the transportation sector are often lacking in transparency and completeness. In this article, the environmental trade-offs in road passenger transportation between conventional vehicles and electrified vehicles are compared, using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Hence, the relevance of a massive electrification approach can be questioned. Assessing a set of current midsize passenger cars and buses allows for investigation of potential environmental issues. This is the first detailed LCA concerning several hybridization levels for cars and buses, and it is based on real consumption data for two traffic conditions. Methods We focused on the ISO standards (ISO 2006a, b) and analyzed the energy carriers' life cycle and the vehicle's life cycle. The functional unit is clearly defined as the transportation of one passenger over 1 km in specific driving conditions from a point A to a point B, without prejudice toward the path taken. Vehicle specifications were derived based on the available manufacturers' data, literature, and French Institute of Petroleum (IFPEN) experts. For the use stage, two driving cycles were assessed: the "worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedure" (WLTP) cycle and an urban cycle. France was selected as the study area, and a sensitivity analysis was performed based on a European electricity charging mix for electrified vehicles. Results and discussion Battery electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) exhibit the highest climate change (CC) mitigation potential, provided that the electricity mix has low carbon and that the PHEV is used with a fully-charged battery. With these conditions, PHEVs can perform even better than EVs. In that regard, PHEVs using only a thermic engine perform the worst in regard to CC indicator. It is also worth mentioning that electric buses are the best solution in urban traffic conditions for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Among powertrains, the electrified powertrains are even more important when performing in urban cycles. For other environmental indicators, such as particulate matter emissions, EVs perform worse than conventional thermic vehicles. Conclusions The results underline the importance of considering vehicles' life cycles for LCA in the transportation sector and the need for multicriteria environmental analysis. Therefore, electrification of the transportation sector should not be driven by a single CC indicator, as this may generate potential environmental drawbacks. It is also crucial to adapt public policies to the local context because the results are highly sensitive to the electricity charging mix.

AB  - The present study investigates the demographic characteristics of economically, ecologically and medicinally important mudskipper species,Pseudapocryptes elongatus(Cuvier, 1816) from Indian Sundarbans, based on data collected over 15 consecutive months. Length-frequency data of 945 individuals collected from the Indian Sundarbans were analyzed using a FAO-ICLARM Stock Assessment Tool. Length-weight relationships analysis showed negative allometric growth inP. elongatuspopulation. Condition factor indicated the well-being of the population in the study area. The von Bertalanffy growth curve showed six growth cohorts, higher growth coefficient (K = 0.62 yr(-1)) and growth parameter index (o ' = 2.48). The elongated mudskipper population can grow faster and achieve a large asymptotic length (L-infinity) of 24.15 cm and thus could be a potential candidate for aquaculture in India. There were two recruitments bouts per year. The higher natural mortality rate (M = 1.39 yr(-1)) than the fishing mortality rate (F= 0.43 yr(-1)) with exploitation level (E= 0.24) below the optimum level indicates that the state of the stock is sustainable under current harvesting strategy. Present level of harvesting also offers an excellent fishing opportunity for fishers to increase their yield. We therefore suggest the implementation of new harvesting methods to increase the yield. Additionally owing to the rich taste and high nutrient content ofP. elongatusit is also important to focus on the aquaculture of this species, particularly in India based on the information provided in present study and the information available from other parts of the world. Present study also has conservation significance as the study species is as an indicator species of the mangrove ecosystem.

AB  - Wetland protection and restoration are important for human's sustainable development, and assess the resilience and regime shift of wetland ecosystem under human disturbances is necessary for this purpose. Geochemical records, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from seven wetland cores dated by Pb-210 and Cs-137 analysis were used to identify the historical background of human disturbances on wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain. We also carried out paleoecological analysis (including plant macrofossils and diatoms) in one core (Honghe wetland) to reconstruct the successions of wetland ecological communities. The resilience and regime shift of ecosystem were evaluated based on autocorrelation and the Sequential t-test analysis of regime-shifts algorithm. Our results show that enrichment factors (EFs) of N, P and heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb etc.), and the concentrations of PAHs experienced slight increases from the 1920s but dramatic increases from the late 1970s. The dominant species of plant community began to change from Drepanocladus aduncus to Carex lasiocarpa from the late 1970s, and the diatoms began to change from wet-indicator to dry-indicator species from the 1950s in Honghe wetland. The regime shift of the wetland ecosystem occurred around 1990 CE, which due to a drop in water level caused by human activities, such as wetland drainage for the reclamation and the excessive use of groundwater for irrigation purpose, rather than climate moisture variations. There is a time gap between the severe disturbances and regime shift due to the stronger resilience of wetland ecosystem. The ecological characteristics (e.g. water level, biological compositions, and EFs of nutrient elements and heavy metals) of Honghe wetland before the late 1970s (release phase) were used as reference conditions for wetland restoration.

AB  - Ecological studies of contaminating microzooplankton in microalgal mass culture are important for large-scale cultivation risk management and remediation strategies, with the ultimate goal to ensure the sustainable high-yield production of microalgal biomass. Using multivariate statistical techniques, the characteristics and relationships with environmental variables of contaminating microzooplankton species were studied in commercial production of Spirulina platensis in outdoor raceway ponds in East and North China. A total of 16 microzooplankton species were identified from 64 large-scale raceway ponds, including three rotifers, two amoebae, and eleven ciliates. The relative abundance of individual microzooplankton species was in an order, from high to low, of ciliates > rotifers > amoebae. The ciliate Cyclidium marinum was the most frequently occurring species, mainly due to its wide tolerance of environmental conditions; and the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis was the key contaminating species, responsible for major loss of biomass productivity owing to its high level of occurrence and feed characteristics as an algivore. The high salinity habitats of the culture systems in North China featured the ciliate Frontonia didieri as an algophagous indicator species, while in East China the amoebae Nuclearia simplex and Euplaesiobystra hypersalinica were indicators for seed ponds and production ponds, respectively, attributed to the specific physicochemical conditions of the local environments. Fine tuning of salinity and pH away even temporarily from the optima of these contaminating microzooplankton species may be an easy and effective protocol for contamination control. Our investigation indicates the importance of comprehensively considering the environmental optima, tolerances and feed characteristics of contaminating species, together with continuous monitoring and ecological data analysis, for efficient management strategies geared towards the mitigation of biological contamination in microalgal mass culture.

AB  - Humpback dolphins (genus Sousa), obligatory inshore delphinids, are frequently exposed to adverse effects of many human activities. In Hong Kong, one of the world's most urbanised coastal regions, ~ 50% of the dolphins suffer from at least one type of epidermal lesions, likely related to anthropogenically degraded habitat. Furthermore, one in every ten dolphins has physical injuries indicative of vessel collisions, propeller cuts and fishing-gear entanglements. As top predators with long lifespan, dolphins are good "barometers" of marine environment and their compromised health conditions are symptomatic of increasingly degraded ecological conditions of coastal seas, especially in rapidly developing regions of fast-growing economies.

AB  - Using the Modelling-Ongrowing fish farms-Monitoring B investigation system (MOM-B), we discussed the effects of deep sea cage (DSC) and traditional sea cage (TSC) fish mariculture on benthic environments in the Yellow Sea, China. Macrofauna, and chemical and sensory parameters were evaluated at 10 field stations surrounding a traditional sea cage farm in 2016-2017 and 10 field stations surrounding a deep sea cage farm in 2018-2019. Benthic macrofauna were found in all samples, and biological parameters were universally rated acceptable or better. In spring and winter, the pH and redox potential values near the DSC farm were within the score 0, while in summer and autumn, values were within the score 1. In TSC farm, most scores were in the score 0 in spring and autumn and in the score 1 in summer. Chemical parameter results showed the DSC and TSC farms were all in condition 1, whereas the sensory parameters near the DSC farm were in condition 1, and the TSC farm in condition 2. Finally, the results demonstrate benthic environments near the DSC farm were better than those near the TSC farm. MOM-B system provides a practical environmental assessment tool that is simple, cheap and easy to implement and can be performed by moderately trained personnel.

AB  - Littoral plains are exposed to natural phenomena, such as sea-waves, tides, rainfalls and sea-level rise, but also to human pressure, determining a growing exposure of the natural and man-made environments to hazard conditions. Through this work, a new kind of multiple approach is proposed to evaluate the coastal risk due to erosion processes, which was first tested on the Calabria Tyrrhenian coast. The resulting data show that 35% of the coastal stretches are classified into very high risk category, 30% into high risk, 28% into medium risk and only 7% into low risk. The coastal areas, characterized by high and very high levels of risk, are formed by sandy beaches and are distributed mainly at the northern side of the regional coastline while the southern part, distinguished mainly by rocky outlines, shows lower risk levels. The comparison between the calculated risk values and the real conditions of the damage state shows a good correspondence, testifying the pertinence of the new methodology. The latter is based on indices with data easily available, making the procedure fast and simple to use and applicable mainly in large scale surveys. The achieved good results suggest that the new methodology used to evaluate the coastal risk condition may be also extended to other Mediterranean beaches.

AB  - A robust and sensitive method was developed for the enantiomeric analysis of six chiral pesticides (including metalaxyl, epoxiconazole, myclobutanil, hexaconazole, napropamide, and isocarbophos) in aquatic environmental samples. The optimized chromatographic conditions for the quantification of all the 12 enantiomers were performed with Chiralcel OD-RH column using mobile phase consisting of 0.1% aqueous formic acid and acetonitrile operated under reversed-phase conditions and then analyzed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Twelve enantiomers were detected in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Solid-phase extraction and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction were employed in this study. Response surface methodology was applied to assist in the dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction optimization. Under the optimum conditions, recoveries of pesticides enantiomers varied from 83.0 to 103.2% at two spiked levels with relative standard deviation less than 11.5%. The concentration factors were up to 1000 times. Method detection and quantification limits varied from 0.11 to 0.48 ng/L and from 0.46 to 1.49 ng/L, respectively. Finally, this method was used to determination of the enantiomers composition of the six pesticides in environmental aqueous matrices, which will help better understand the behavior of individual enantiomer and make accurate risk assessment to ecosystems.

AB  - Stratified Upper Pleistocene sediment sequences have been geochemically investigated in the arid environment of the Wadi Sabra (Southern Jordan). The wadi fills are associated to archaeological finds of Upper Palaeolithic to Epipalaeolithic age and intended for a reconstruction of palaeoenvironmental conditions during and after the time of the initial human occupation. As the mineralogical and sedimentological composition of the sediments is highly influenced by the nature of the local source rock, the significance of provenance analysis and depositional processes is limited. Therefore, geochemical characteristics were consulted as indicators for secondary alteration and weathering processes.
   A combined approach of CNS analysis, carbonate fractionation, electrical conductivity, and colour spectrophotometry supported by selective XRF scanning and chemical iron extraction was used to elaborate the nature and characteristics of various fine grained calcrete horizons. Although a detailed palaeoenvironmental interpretation of these deposits was complicated by an inhomogeneous distribution of precipitated solutes, a diversity of source materials, and potential sedimentation gaps, the results indicate that most of the fine grained deposits represent fossil and relict palaeosol horizons. Consequently, the study area might have experienced repeated phases of landscape stability and initial soil development during the latest phase of the Upper Pleistocene before a change in hydrological conditions initiated a distinctive erosional period that prevailed during most of the Holocene until modern times.

AB  - During the archaeological excavations in the Byzantine Theodosian harbor (Istanbul) a Holocene dark gray to black clay sequence was uncovered. This clay unit was deposited under anoxic conditions in a small swamp. Both wooden artifacts from the Neolithic period, but also dispersed organic matter were perfectly preserved within this sequence. The aim of this study was the assessment of environmental changes and anthropogenic impacts with the help of organic geochemical and isotopic characterization of organic matter in this clay unit. The age model, based on C-14 data, showed that the clay was deposited during a period about from 11,100 to 7500 cal. years BP. Hydrogen Index values lower than 100 mgHC/gTOC, n-alkane distributions with maxima at nC(29) or at nC(31), a predominance of long-chain n-alkanes (C-25-C-33) and delta C-13(org) values around -24 parts per thousand to -27 parts per thousand suggest a predominantly terrestrial origin of organic matter from C-3 plants. Obvious excursions of bulk delta C-13(org) and compound-specific delta C-13 and delta D values of nC(27), nC(29), nC(31), and nC(33) are interpreted as indicators of changes in environmental and climatic conditions. Several shifts toward colder and warmer climatic conditions were identified and dated. Furthermore, two sudden changes in the hydrological regime were dated to 9000-8820 cal. years BP and to 8150-8050 cal. years BP toward wetter and drier conditions, respectively. Specific molecular organic geochemical indicators such as faecal sterols or a strong enrichment of delta N-15 caused by human impact could not be detected. Therefore, the swamp should not have been intensively affected by Neolithic people and/or respective indicators of their influence have been diluted due to the high sedimentation rate.

AB  - The distribution of bryophytes in central Belgium was investigated using species grid-mapping superimposed on a series of maps which included information on soil conditions and land use. Our objectives were to assess the influence of environmental variation on the bryoflora at a regional scale, to examine how bryophytes respond to environmental variation, and to assess the extent to which species ecological and life-history traits determine the accuracy of the predictability of species occurrence in order to provide comprehensive lists of species based on environmental conditions. The first two axes of a correspondence analysis (CA) of the floristic data explained 14.6% of the total chi(2). CA1 was significantly correlated with loamy-sandy soils on a sand layer (r = -0.74, p < 0.001), forest cover (r = -0.80, p < 0.001), loamy soils (r = 0.79, p < 0.001), and agricultural fields cover (r = 0.61, p < 0.001). CA2 had a low but significant correlation coefficient with pebbly soils cover (r = 0.38, p < 0.001). The probability of occurrence of 59% of the investigated species could be significantly predicted by logistic regression from the sets of environmental variables. About 55% of the species exhibited an increasing probability of occurrence with increasing forest cover and loamy-sandy soils cover, 1% with agricultural fields and loamy soils cover, and 3% with pebbly soils cover. The predictability of species occurrence varied as a function of four life-history traits (minimum spore size, life expectancy, type of gametophyte and papillose leaf cell walls) and three ecological traits (indicator values of light, temperature and soil acidity). The most predictable species, including a number of leafy liverworts, were characteristic for acidic, fresh and shaded conditions and displayed a strong preference for forest habitats. Taxa with limited predictability included epiphytes and mosses characteristic of pebbly soils due to the ability of these species to efficiently disperse and adapt to various ecological conditions. Species for which the distribution range could not successfully be predicted were either ubiquitons, characteristic for ephemeral habitats, or highly successful in a very common habitat.

AB  - The risk assessment of pesticides for freshwater ecosystems in the Amazon has relied on the use of toxicity data and water quality criteria derived for temperate regions due to a lack of ecotoxicological studies performed with indigenous species. This leaves an unknown margin of uncertainty for the protection of Amazonian ecosystems, as differences in environmental conditions and species sensitivity are not taken into account. To address this issue, the acute toxic effects of malathion (an organophosphorus insecticide) and carbendazim (a benzimidazole fungicide) were assessed on five fish and five freshwater invertebrates endemic to the Amazonian region. Subsequently, the intrinsic sensitivity of Amazonian and temperate freshwater species was compared using the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) concept. Amazonian species sensitivity to malathion was found to be similar to that of their temperate counterparts, with LC50 values ranging between 111 and 1507 mu g/l for fish species and 2.1-426 mu g/l for arthropod species. However, Amazonian fish appeared to be slightly less sensitive for carbendazim than temperate fish with LC50 values ranging between 1648 and 4238 mu g/l, and Amazonian invertebrates were found to be significantly more resistant than their temperate counterparts, with LC50 values higher than 16000 mu g/l. The results of this study suggest that for these compounds, the use of water quality criteria derived with laboratory toxicity data for temperate species will result in a sufficient protection level for Amazonian freshwater organisms. Recommendations for further research include the validation of threshold concentrations derived with temperate standard test species and with the SSD model with semi-field experiments considering larger assemblages of indigenous species under local environmental conditions.

For this purpose, different parameters were determined: the size distribution and stability of soil aggregates I mean weight diameter (MWD), microparticles and macroparticles proportions (MIP and MAP), and aggregate stability (AS)]; soil microbial population size [microbial biomass C (MBC)] and activity [basal respiration (BR) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA)]: and soil hydrolase activities [phosphatase (PHA), beta-glucosiclase (beta-GA) and urease (UA)]. Soil ecological trends obtained from Principal Component Analysis revealed the accumulation of organic matter from restored vegetation as the triggering factor for the development of soil aggregation and biological functionality. The spatial differentiation of reclaimed vegetation was the principal source of variability for these soil forming processes, which were also conditioned by the presence of variations on soil particle size distribution. Erosion-related exponential decreases of AS, BR, DHA, PHA, beta-GA and UA were identified. In fact, limitations of vegetation development caused by accelerated soil erosion drastically constrained the development and spatial organisation of both physical structure and soil biological functionality, by preventing the accumulation of soil organic matter. Although soil forming processes in uneroded conditions occurred, soil functionality levels were rather low, probably due to the small amounts of soil organic matter reached, generally <2%. This stresses the importance of including organic amendments during restoration works in Mediterranean environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Peer-reviewed literature and published reports were used to summarize knowledge of benthic algal assemblage composition and ecology in Lake Erie, and causes and consequences of temporal variation in algal abundance. Macroalgal assemblages in rocky littoral and soft substrate habitats have been reasonably well described and studied, as has the epiphyte/metaphyte assemblage associated with rocky littoral macroalgae. In contrast, little information exists for non-epiphytic microalgae in littoral habitat. During the period when algal records were reported (1865-2006), the rocky littoral macroalgal assemblage was often dominated by the chlorophyte genera Cladophora and Ulothrix and the rhodophyte Bangia, whereas the charophytes Chara and Nitella were most abundant in littoral soft substrate. In addition to substrate effects, assemblage composition varied as a function of depth, temperature, light levels, and nutrient concentrations. Under certain conditions, macroalgal taxa appeared to outcompete and exclude other taxa from littoral habitat. However, these organisms have also facilitated increased algal diversity by supporting epiphytes/metaphytes. In Lake Erie, significant temporal change in benthic algal abundance has been associated with: 1) eutrophication (prior to 1972), 2) oligotrophication following the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (1972-1985), and 3) invasion by Dreissena mussels (1986-2006). Increasingly eutrophic conditions were reflected by high abundance and frequent shoreline fouling by Cladophora, declining charophyte (such as Chara, Nitella) abundance, and invasion of rocky littoral habitat by euryhaline Bangia. Subsequent indicators of oligotrophication included declining Cladophora abundance, and increased diatom abundance in deepwater habitat. Effects of filter-feeding Dreissena (such as increased water clarity, phosphorus excretion) were likely causes for Cladophora resurgence in the 1990s, and likely contributed to return of Chara and Nitella to formerly occupied habitat. Algal assemblages clearly reflect environmental conditions in aquatic ecosystems. To accurately assess present and future conditions in Lake Erie, continued study of all benthic assemblages is recommended, with greater attention directed toward microalgae in littoral habitat than has occurred in the past.

AB  - Stream temperatures are key indicators for aquatic ecosystem health, and are of particular concern in highly seasonal, water-limited regions such as California that provide sensitive habitat for cold-water species. Yet in many of these critical regions, the combined impacts of a warmer climate and urbanization on stream temperatures have not been systematically studied. We examined recent changes in air temperature and precipitation, including during the recent extreme drought, and compared the stream temperature responses of urban and nonurban streams under four climatic conditions and the 2008-2018 period. Metrics included changes in the magnitude and timing of stream temperatures, and the frequency of exceedance of ecologically relevant thresholds. Our results showed that minimum and average daily air temperatures in the region have increased by >1 degrees C over the past 20 years, warming both urban and nonurban streams. Stream temperatures under drought warmed most (1 degrees C-2 degrees C) in late spring and early fall, effectively lengthening the summer warm season. The frequency of occurrence of periods of elevated stream temperatures was greater during warm climate conditions for both urban and nonurban streams, but urban streams experienced extreme conditions 1.5-2 times as often as nonurban streams. Our findings underscore that systematically monitoring and managing urban stream temperatures under climate change and drought is critically needed for seasonal, water-limited urban systems.

AB  - The environmental vulnerability of a landscape is directly associated with any physical, geomorphological, and spatial factors which directly interfere with the ecological functionality of natural areas. Therefore, the composition, diversity, and structure of fragmented forest areas are essential to identify the patterns in the landscape and propose the most appropriate management measures for its conservation. The present study set out to analyse the applicability of landscape metrics for assessing the environmental fragility of forest remnants of different geographical conditions and phyto-physiognomies. This would contribute to landscape assessment and the diagnosis of remnants, and support decision making for strategic and effective environmental planning. The study areas selected were two river basins, the Atibaia river basin in Brazil, and the Certima river basin in Portugal. The maps used as a basis for the selection of the forest remnants analysed were made available by public managers and date from 2015 for both basins. The analyses were performed with GIS software, and two groups of landscape metrics were considered: the first applied to the general landscape of the basin and the second applied to each remaining forest patch as a landscape unit. At the remaining forest level, the metrics analysed were the area, central area index, circularity index, shape index, distance from the nearest neighbour, proximity of the remnant to the road network, and proximity to the watercourse. The results showed that there are many remnants in both basins with predominantly small size and located close to each other. However, their fragilities vary in each basin, indicating that the applied metrics are effective tool for the preliminary diagnosis of natural vegetation remnants in areas with different geospatial and phyto-physiognomic conditions. Therefore, the results obtained are of great importance as a basis for formulating landscape development policies, by integrating appropriate land management strategies.

AB  - Sclerochronological studies based on hard structures of marine organisms are valuable tools both for reconstructing past climate conditions and for predicting future impacts of environmental changes on marine resources. Existing archives, which house millions of fish otoliths (ear stones) constitute an excellent basis for such research; but, they remain underutilized. The objective of this project was to identify the factors that influence the annual growth patterns of the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) based on an analysis of otolith increments. We applied linear mixed models to develop a 74-year long chronology that reflects the inter-annual variations in flounder growth rates using otolith samples collected from 1957 to 2016 in the southern part of the Baltic Sea, which is considered to be highly vulnerable to global climate change. By analyzing the widths of otolith increments we revealed the existence of common environmental factors that influence fish growth. Using a mixed modeling framework, we incorporated a recent method to identify the optimal time window for climatic factors and showed that the most significant effect of the mean Baltic Sea index occurs during August December, while mean sea surface temperature is most significant from April June. Change point analysis on the developed chronology identified major alterations occurred in flounder growth in 1988, 1992 and 2006. This result is in accord with published studies on regime shifts in the Baltic Sea ecosystem. This paper reports information concerning the response of the commercially important European flounder to the changing environment that may support future ecosystem-based management of fish stocks. Moreover, the results also highlight the potential for applying biochronological techniques to identify rapid regime shifts in marine ecosystems.

AB  - Measuring the quality of the nutritional resources available to wild herbivores is critical to understanding trophic regulation processes. However, the direct assessment of dietary nutritional characteristics is usually difficult, which hampers monitoring nutritional constraints in natural populations. The feeding ecology of ruminant herbivores has been often assessed by analyzing fecal nitrogen (FN) concentrations, although this method has been less evaluated in other taxa. This study analyzed the suitability of FN as an indicator of ingesta quality in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which is a keystone lagomorph species in Mediterranean ecosystems and of great conservation interest. Firstly, domestic O. cuniculus were used to evaluate under experimental conditions the accuracy of total FN and the metabolic FN as diet quality indicators of forages with characteristics similar to those available under natural conditions. Secondly, the accuracy of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to calculate FN was tested using partial least squares regression. Thirdly, a pilot field study was conducted to monitor FN dynamics from wild O. cuniculus in three different habitats during wet and drought periods. A strong association was found between diet type and total FN and metabolic FN (Pseudo-R-2 >= 0.89). It was also found that NIRS calibrations were accurate for depicting nitrogen concentrations (R-2 > 0.98 between NIRS and chemical results). Finally, the seasonal FN dynamics measured in the field were consistent with current knowledge on vegetation dynamics and forage limitations in the three habitats. The results support the use of NIRS methods and FN indices as a reliable and affordable approach to monitoring the nutritional quality of rabbit habitats. Potential applications include the assessment of the mechanistic relationships between resource limitations and population abundance, e.g., in relation to natural drought cycles and to habitat interventions aimed at reinforcing rabbit populations.

AB  - Ecological profiles and multiple factorial analysis of Woody species distribution related to soil descriptors provide a global and species by species assessment of edaphic factors governing trees, shrubs and saplings ecology in a sudanian savanna/fallow vegetation. Importance values and frequencies of 72 species are related to colour, textural and exchangeable cations richness of the upper layer of the soil as well as to thickness of hardpan, hydromorphic and clay layers and thickness of sandy, loamy and gravely layers. The clay/sand opposition, the gradient in exchangeable cation richness and the hydric conditions are the main edaphic factors governing species distribution. A majority of species has a significant link with at least one of the soil descriptors. The importance value of several species, which are frequent such as shea tree (Butyrospermum paradoxum) or nere (Parkia biglobosa), is better linked with edaphic factors than is their presence, so the vegetation facies they establish are informative of soil conditions. Indicator species of cation richness, hydromorphy, soils on hardpan, etc. are identified. Sapling ecology of some species however slightly differs from the ecology of mature trees owing to the rejuvenation of vegetation due to the fallow system. The distribution of some species in the Bondoukuy savannas and fallows seems to be wider or narrower than it would be in a less anthropised environment. Species of fallow on sandy poor soils are commonly found on regosols, furthermore some of the most common species of rich but shallow soils on hardpan are known as species of the ancient dry forest coming on fertile soils, which are nowadays cultivated. Therefore, if soil factors seem to be the main determinants of species distribution in vegetation after anthropic perturbations, these perturbations affect the amplitude of the distribution of species and biological type.

AB  - A trait-based approach was used to evaluate the restoration success of a moss layer transfer technique on the herbaceous community of a cut-over bog. In order to understand the herbaceous dynamics following restoration, the bog was monitored prior to restoration and biannually over ten subsequent years, in two initial drainage conditions (dry peat fields and wet ditches), and compared to seven undisturbed bogs. Herbaceous community found prior to and in the early stage after restoration were characterized by species associated to mesic soil conditions with a fen-like pH, ruderal or wetland species, species with mycorrhiza or exotic species. These species did not persist in the latter stage after restoration and were replaced by species that are carnivorous, are associated to variable water availability and show mostly sexual reproduction. The extent of changes in traits composition of the herbaceous community between the early and latter stages after restoration showed the importance of multiple-year monitoring to evaluate restoration projects. The trait composition found in the latter stage after restoration appeared to converge toward the reference ecosystem where the community was characterized by species with large seeds, associated to humid soil conditions and a forest or peatland habitat. Lower trait diversity was found in the latter stage after restoration than in the reference ecosystem, especially in peat fields. In addition, species and functional diversity pattern varied with the initial drainage conditions, decreasing in peat fields while remaining stable in ditches. This suggests that different initial topography for restoration might help increase species and functional diversity of a managed ecosystem. Finally, our results outline measures to improve the moss layer transfer technique: sowing herbaceous species with large seeds in the latter stage after restoration, applying the restoration technique as soon as exploitation has terminated or removing all vegetation (including seeds and rhizomes) from the site to be restored.

AB  - This study evaluated alternative protocols for culturing thermophilic campylobacters in environmental water. All samples were filtered through a sterile 0.45 mu m pore-size membrane, which was then incubated in Preston enrichment broth. Four variables were compared: water sample volume (2000 mL vs. 500 mL), enrichment broth volume (25 mL vs. 100 mL), enrichment incubation duration (24 h vs. 48 h), and number of enrichment passages (one vs. two). In addition, DNA extracts were prepared from all final broths and analyzed using three rRNA PCR assays. River water was collected at 3 sampling sites weekly for 9 weeks. Among these 27 collections, 25 (93%) yielded Campylobacter spp. under at least one of the 16 culture conditions. By univariate analysis, yields were significantly better for the 2000 mL sample volume (68.5% vs. 43.0%, p<0.0001) and the 25 mL enrichment broth volume (64.5% vs. 47.0%, p<0.0004). Neither of the enrichment period had a significant effect, although there was a trend in favor of 48 h incubation (59.5% vs. 52.0%, p = 0.13). The three PCR methods gave concordant results for 66 (33%) of the culture-negative samples and 103 (50%) of the culture-positive samples. Compared with culture results. Lubeck's 16S PCR assay had the best performance characteristics, with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 94%. Of the 12 culture-negative samples positive by Lubeck's PCR assay, 11(92%) samples were also positive by Denis' 16S PCR assay, suggesting that in these cases the culture might have been falsely negative. Based on our results, we conclude that the optimal conditions for detecting Campylobacter spp. in natural waters include 2000 mL sample volume and a single enrichment broth of 25 mL PB incubated for 48 h.

AB  - Coastal lagoons experience removal and leaching of metals due to seasonal fluctuation of salinity coupled with pH and dissolved oxygen variability. Benthic foraminifers are susceptible to seasonal variation in physicochemical conditions. Assessment of bioavailable fraction of selected metals in sediments along the salinity gradient of the largest brackish lagoon in Asia-Chilika was carried out. Further, population density and abnormality index of foraminifera in the sediments were calculated to understand the influence of bioavailable metal on benthic foraminifera. Metal concentrations were higher in the low salinity regions and decreased towards the high salinity regions. This suggests river discharge controls the metal input and distribution in the lagoon. Overall, metal concentrations are high in the residual fraction (F4) followed by interplay within the reducible (F2) or oxidizable (F3) fractions, except for Mn. The seasonal fluctuations of pH and cyclic oxygen deficiency intensified the leaching of Fe, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn in the bioavailable fraction in the low salinity region of the lagoon. The presence of metals in bioavailable fractions impacted the normal growth of the abundant Ammonia species. Despite low bioavailable metal concentrations, higher morphological abnormalities were observed in the high salinity regions due to higher energy conditions near the sea. Therefore, abnormalities in the benthic foraminifera are attributed to bioavailability of metals from sediments and natural stress conditions in the coastal lagoon environment.

AB  - An understanding of the palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic conditions that affects the preserved fossil record is a powerful tool aiding the reconstruction of past ecosystems. In this study, bone diagenesis is used as a sensitive indicator of the palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic conditions during deposition of the Middle Triassic Tarjados Formation of western Argentina. The results provide new information that will improve palaeoecosystem reconstructions throughout western Gondwana. The tetrapod fossil record of the Tarjados Formation is scarce, mainly represented by isolated and dispersed bones. Bones from several stratigraphic levels were analysed. Different mineral infillings are recognised, such as sediment, iron oxides, and calcite. Based on the sequential precipitation of mineral infillings documented in the samples, we identified three diagenetic pathways. The stratigraphic distribution of the diagenetic pathways was analysed to evaluate the depositional and palaeoclimatic conditions through the Tarjados Formation. The integration of the sedimentology and stacking pattern with bone diagenesis suggests changes in the sediment supply and the strongly seasonal soil moisture fluctuations characterised by alternating short wet and long dry seasons, under an overall semi-arid climatic regime. This climatic evidence agrees with a palaeogeographic configuration with a local rain-shadow effect of highlands in contrast with the documented by Cuyana Basin, where the palaeogeographic configuration suggests without local rain-shadow effect with the wet period dominance over drier ones.

AB  - Coral reefs provide shoreline protection, biological diversity, fishery harvests, and tourism, all values that stem from the physically-complex coral infrastructure. Stony corals (scleractinians) construct and maintain the reef through deposition of calcium carbonate. Therefore, assessment of coral reefs requires at least some measurement endpoints that reflect the biological and physical condition of stony corals. Most monitoring programs portray coral quantity as live coral cover, which is the two-dimensional proportion of coral surface to sea floor viewed from above (planar view). The absence of the third dimension, however, limits our ability to characterize coral reef value, physiology, health and sustainability. A three-dimensional (3D) approach more realistically characterizes coral structure available as community habitat and, when combined with estimates of live coral tissue, quantifies the amount of living coral available for photosynthesis, growth and reproduction. A rapid coral survey procedure that coupled 3D coral quantification with more traditional survey measurements was developed and tested in the field. The survey procedure relied on only three underwater observations - species identification, colony size, and proportion of live tissue - made on each colony in the transect. These observations generated a variety of metrics, including several based on 3D colony surface area, that are relevant to reef management.

AB  - State-and-transition models (STM) are valuable tools that aid understanding and management of ecosystems. There also is potential for STMs to be used as a framework to assess whether management actions are achieving desired conservation objectives. However, few published examples exist where STMs have been used in this way. Using high-quality empirical field data collected in endangered temperate woodlands across a 6-year period, we explore whether a Box Gum Grassy Woodland STM employed in an Australian agri-environment scheme can be used to assess whether management interventions are achieving an improvement in woodland Condition State. We found there was insufficient contextual information in the STM to facilitate its robust use as a framework for assessing whether management interventions were achieving conservation outcomes in Box Gum Grassy Woodlands. Weather was a key driver influencing management effectiveness, but its effects were absent from the STM, as were probabilities and time frames for transitions between Condition States. The deficiencies in the STM may preclude accurate conclusions about the effectiveness of the program. Given the influence of weather on the system, longer time frames are required to adequately assess the influence of management on key variables (e.g., native plant richness, native ground cover) underpinning the STM. This case study provides opportunities to understand the potential implications of using insufficiently contextualized STMs as frameworks for assessing whether management actions are achieving desired conservation objectives. It also provides opportunities to learn from what went wrong. To this end, based on our findings, we provide practical recommendations (applicable beyond our case study system) for improving the construction and implementation of STMs for the purposes of evaluating the success of management interventions in ecological restoration and conservation programs.

AB  - Hydromorphological restructuring of river sections, i.e. river restoration measures, often has little effects on aquatic biota, even in case of strong habitat alterations. It is often supposed that the biotic response is simply delayed as species require additional time to recolonize the newly generated habitats and to establish populations. To identify and specify the supposed lag time between restoration and biotic response, we investigated 19 restored river reaches twice in a five-year interval. The sites were restored one to ten years prior to the first sampling. We sampled three aquatic (fish, benthic invertebrates, macrophytes) and two riparian organism groups (ground beetles and riparian vegetation) and analyzed changes in assemblage composition and biotic metrics. With the exception of ground beetle assemblages, we observed no significant changes in richness and abundance metrics ormetrics used for biological assessment. However, indicator taxa for near-natural habitat conditions in the riparian zone (indicators for regular inundation in plants and river bank specialists in beetles) improved significantly in the five-year interval. Contrary to general expectations in river restoration planning, we neither observed a distinct succession of aquatic communities nor a general trend towards "good ecological status" over time. Furthermore, multiple linear regression models revealed that neither the time since restoration nor the morphological status had a significant effect on the biological metrics and the assessment results. Thus, the stability of aquatic assemblages is strong, slowing down restoration effects in the aquatic zone, while riparian assemblages improve more rapidly. When defining restoration targets, the different timelines for ecological recovery after restoration should be taken into account. Furthermore, restoration measures should not solelyfocus on local habitat conditions but also target stressors acting on larger spatial scales and take other measures (e.g. species reintroduction) into consideration.

AB  - Background Blood parameters such as haematocrit or leucocyte counts are indicators of immune status and health, which can be affected, in a complex way, by exogenous as well as endogenous factors. Additionally, social context is known to be among the most potent stressors in group living individuals, therefore potentially influencing haematological parameters. However, with few exceptions, this potential causal relationship received only moderate scientific attention.
   Methods In a free-living and individually marked population of the highly social and long-lived Greylag goose, Anser anser, we relate variation in haematocrit (HCT), heterophils to lymphocytes ratio (H/L) and blood leucocyte counts to the following factors: intrinsic (sex, age, raising condition, i.e. goose- or hand-raised), social (pair-bond status, pair-bond duration and parental experience) and environmental (biologically relevant periods, ambient temperature) factors. Blood samples were collected repeatedly from a total of 105 focal birds during three biologically relevant seasons (winter flock, mating season, summer).
   Results We found significant relationships between haematological parameters and social as well as environmental factors. During the mating season, unpaired individuals had higher HCT compared to paired and family individuals and this pattern reversed in fall. Similarly, H/L ratio was positively related to pair-bond status in a seasonally dependent way, with highest values during mating and successful pairs had higher H/L ratio than unsuccessful ones. Also, absolute number of leucocytes tended to vary depending on raising condition in a seasonally dependent way.
   Discussion Haematology bears a great potential in ecological and behavioural studies on wild vertebrates. In sum, we found that HTC, H/L ratio and absolute number of leucocytes are modulated by social factors and conclude that they may be considered valid indicators of individual stress load.

AB  - Thousands of tourists visit certain Antarctic sites each year, generating a wide variety of environmental impacts. Scientific knowledge of human activities and their impacts can help in the effective design of management measures and impact mitigation. We present a case study from Barrientos Island in which a management measure was originally put in place with the goal of minimizing environmental impacts but resulted in new undesired impacts. Two alternative footpaths used by tourist groups were compared. Both affected extensive moss carpets that cover the middle part of the island and that are very vulnerable to trampling. The first path has been used by tourists and scientists since over a decade and is a marked route that is clearly visible. The second one was created more recently. Several physical and biological indicators were measured in order to assess the environmental conditions for both paths. Some physical variables related to human impact were lower for the first path (e.g. soil penetration resistance and secondary treads), while other biochemical and microbiological variables were higher for the second path (e.g. beta-glucosidase and phosphatase activities, soil respiration). Moss communities located along the new path were also more diverse and sensitive to trampling. Soil biota (Collembola) was also more abundant and richer. These data indicate that the decision to adopt the second path did not lead to the reduction of environmental impacts as this path runs over a more vulnerable area with more outstanding biological features (e.g. microbiota activity, flora and soil fauna diversity). In addition, the adoption of a new route effectively doubles the human footprint on the island. We propose using only the original path that is less vulnerable to the impacts of trampling. Finally from this process, we identify several key issues that may be taken into account when carrying out impact assessment and environmental management decision-making in the Antarctic area.

AB  - Solar photocatalytic inactivation (SPCI) of E. coli as the indicator microorganism using LaFeO3 (LF) has already been investigated under various experimental conditions, excluding any role of natural organic matter (NOM). However, comprehensive information about the behavior of E. coli and its inactivation mechanism in the presence of NOM, as well as the behavior of NOM components via solar photocatalysis using LF as a photocatalyst, has prime importance in understanding real natural water environments. Therefore, in this study, further assessment was devoted to explore the influence of various NOM representatives on the SPCI of E. coli by using LF as a novel non-TiO2 photocatalyst. The influence of NOM as well as its sub-components, such as humic acids (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), was also investigated to understand different NOM-related constituents of real natural water conditions. In addition to spectroscopic and mechanistic investigations of cell-derived organics, excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra with parallel factor multiway analysis (PARAFAC) modeling revealed further information about the occurrence and/or disappearance of NOM-related and bacteria-related fluorophores upon LF SPCI. Both the kinetics as well as the mechanism of the LF SPCI of E. coli in the presence of NOM compounds displayed substrate-specific variations under all conditions.

AB  - Monetary valuation of dryland ecosystem services may help to increase the salience of drylands in decision making. Yet, there is no comprehensive assessment of the indicators that determine the estimated monetary values for dryland ecosystem services (hereafter: dryland value). Having compiled a database consisting of 559 observations from 66 valuation studies in drylands worldwide, this study analyzes the relative importance of local socio-economic, environmental and methodological indicators in explaining the monetary value estimates for nine dryland ecosystem services by means of a multiple regression analysis. By explicitly quantifying the effect sizes of the indicators of dryland value, we shed new light on the driving forces behind monetary valuation of dryland ecosystem services. Our results show that local socio-economic and environmental conditions are marginal in explaining dryland value, indicating that local dryland conditions are not sufficiently captured with current valuation approaches. Simultaneously, we find that methodological factors, including valuation method and study extent, heavily influence dryland value, suggesting that monetary valuation outcomes are largely determined by the selected methodology. This emphasizes the need to improve monetary valuation methods so that they better capture local dryland conditions in order to be able to serve as a meaningful tool for decision making.

AB  - Intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) are dynamic ecosystems that shift between aquatic and terrestrial states. IRES are widespread, abundant and increasing in extent, but developing biomonitoring programmes to determine their ecological quality is challenging. To date, quality assessments have focused on the aquatic organisms present during wet phases, whereas dry-phase communities remain poorly characterized. We examined multiple biotic groups present in dry IRES channels, to compare assemblages at sites impacted and unimpacted by human activity and to evaluate the potential of each group as an ecological quality indicator. We explored existing, unpublished data for three biotic groups: an aquatic microflora (diatoms), an aquatic fauna (the invertebrate `seedbank'), and a mixed flora (aquatic and terrestrial plants); notably, we did not source data for terrestrial assemblages with high potential to act as indicators. Diatom and plant assemblage composition differed between impacted and unimpacted sites, and the latter assemblages were more diverse and included more indicator taxa. Invertebrate seedbank taxa richness was higher at unimpacted sites but compositional differences were not detected, probably due to the coarse taxonomic resolution to which abundant taxa were identified. Performance of standard indices of ecological quality was variable, but differences were identified between impacted and unimpacted conditions for all biotic groups. Our results can inform the enhancement of biomonitoring programmes designed to characterize IRES ecological quality in relation to legislative targets. We highlight the need to integrate wet- and dry-phase survey data in holistic quality assessments. Although we suggest diatoms, aquatic plants and the aquatic invertebrate seedbank as having the potential to inform assessment of dry-phase ecological quality, we highlight the need for research to further characterize these aquatic groups and, crucially, to explore terrestrial assemblages with high potential to act as dry-phase quality indicators.

AB  - Water management practices and access to safe water supplies have major implications for human health. While a range of assessments has been developed to assess water vulnerability, limited work has extended these concepts to health and wellbeing. Water-associated disease cycles are characterized by complex linkages between social and ecological determinants, thus conceptualizing vulnerability in the context of health offers a useful framework for analysis. This paper applies a water associated disease index (WADI) as a tool to deepen understanding of changing vulnerability to dengue, comparing conditions in 2000 and 2010 in Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil. Multi-dimensional data were integrated into indicators of exposure and susceptibility using the WADI approach, including water access, land cover, climate, and solid waste collection, and outputs were validated and visualized in map form. The findings illustrate heterogeneous patterns of vulnerability to dengue in the region, and highlight trends of seasonal and long-term changes. Highest vulnerability was observed in densely populated Recife and the surrounding coastal region in both time periods, with climate conditions creating seasonal trends in exposure to dengue. While more remote areas in the semi-arid Sertao showed low vulnerability overall, increases were observed in some areas between 2000 and 2010 due to land use intensification and growing population densities. These findings suggest that interventions should consider the dynamic nature of social and ecological factors that contribute to health outcomes and address current as well as future populations vulnerable to dengue transmission. This vulnerability mapping approach can be applied to other water-associated diseases impacted by global environmental change to highlight priority areas for further investigation and contribute towards improving interventions.

AB  - Vegetation buffers like vegetative filter strips (VFSs) are often used to protect water bodies from surface runoff pollution from disturbed areas. Their typical placement in floodplains often results in the presence of a seasonal shallow water table (WT) that can decrease soil infiltration and increase surface pollutant transport during a rainfall-runoff event. Simple and robust components of hydrological models are needed to analyze the impacts of WT in the landscape. To simulate VFS infiltration under realistic rainfall conditions with WT, we propose a generic infiltration solution (Shallow Water table INfiltration algorithm: SWINGO) based on a combination of approaches by Salvucci and Entekhabi (1995) and Chu (1997) with new integral formulae to calculate singular times (time of ponding, shift time, and time to soil profile saturation). The algorithm was tested successfully on five distinct soils, both against Richards's numerical solution and experimental data in terms of infiltration and soil moisture redistribution predictions, and applied to study the combined effects of varying WT depth, soil type, and rainfall intensity and duration. The results show the robustness of the algorithm and its ability to handle various soil hydraulic functions and initial nonponding conditions under unsteady rainfall. The effect of a WT on infiltration under ponded conditions was found to be effectively decoupled from surface infiltration and excess runoff processes for depths larger than 1.2 to 2 m, being shallower for fine soils and shorter events. For nonponded initial conditions, the influence of WT depth also varies with rainfall intensity. Also, we observed that soils with a marked air entry (bubbling pressure) exhibit a distinct behavior with WT near the surface. The good performance, robustness, and flexibility of SWINGO supports its broader use to study WT effects on surface runoff, infiltration, flooding, transport, ecological, and land use processes. SWINGO is coupled with an existing VFS model in the companion paper (Lauvernet and Munoz-Carpena, 2018), where the potential effects of seasonal or permanent WTs on VFS sediment and pesticide trapping are studied.

AB  - An important policy consideration for integrated land and water management is to understand the spatial distribution of nitrate attenuation in the groundwater system, for which redox condition is the key indicator. This paper proposes a methodology to accommodate the computational demands of large datasets, and presents national-scale predictions of groundwater redox class for New Zealand. Our approach applies statistical learning methods to relate the redox class determined on groundwater samples to spatially varying attributes. The trained model uses these spatial variables to predict redox status in areas without sample data. We assembled the groundwater sample data from regional authority databases, and assigned each sample a redox class. A key achievement was to overcome the influence of sample selection bias on model training via oversampling. We removed additional bias imposed by imbalances in the predictor variables by applying a conditional inference random forest classifier. The unbiased trained model uses eight predictors, and achieves a high validation performance (accuracy 0.81, kappa 0.71), providing good confidence in model predictions. National maps are provided for redox class and probability at specified depths.
   Feature importance rankings indicate that reducing conditions are associated with poorly-drained soils, and to a lesser extent, high hydrological variability, low elevation, and low-permeability lithology. These conditions are common in New Zealand's coastal and lowland plains, where artificial drainage is required to make land suitable for production. The spatial extent of reduced groundwater increases with depth, suggesting a shallow influence of soil infiltration or mobile organic carbon, and a deeper influence of lithological electron donors.
   Our model provides unbiased predictions at a scale relevant for environmental policy development and legislation. Identifying where the ecosystem service provided by denitrification can be utilised will enable spatially targeted interventions that can achieve the desired environmental outcome in a more cost-effective manner than non-targeted interventions.

AB  - Indicators of positive emotions are still scarce and many proposed behavioural markers have proven ambiguous. Studies established a link between acoustic signals and emitter's internal state, but few related to positive emotions and still fewer considered non-vocal sounds. One of them, the snort, is shared by several perrisodactyls and has been associated to positive contexts in these species. We hypothesized that this could be also the case in horses. In this species, there is a clear need for a thorough description of non-vocal acoustic signals (snorts, snores or blows are often used interchangeably) but overall this sound produced by nostrils during expiration has up to now been mostly considered as having a hygienic function. However, observations revealed that snorts were produced more in some individuals than in others, without relationship with air conditions. We observed 48 horses living in two "extreme" conditions: restricted conditions (single stall, low roughage diet) and naturalistic conditions (stable groups in pasture). The immediate place (e.g. stall/pasture) and the behavioural/postural (behaviour performed/ears positions) contexts of snort production were observed. We additionally performed an evaluation of the welfare state, using validated behavioural (e.g. stereotypies) and postural (e.g. overall ears positions) welfare indicators. The results show that 1) snort production was significantly associated with situations known to be positive for horses (e.g. feeding in pasture) and with a positive internal state (ears in forward or sidewards positions), 2) the riding school horses produced twice as many snorts when in pasture than in stall, 3) the naturalistic population emitted significantly more snorts than riding school ones in comparable contexts, 4) the frequency of snorts was negatively correlated with the composite total chronic stress score (TCSS, reflecting compromised welfare based on the horse's rank on the different indicators): the lower the TCSS, the higher the snort rate. Snorts therefore appear as reliable indicators of positive emotions.

AB  - The diversity, humus status, productivity and environment protection ability of cropland soils were studied in the mild and wet pedoclimatic conditions of Estonia, located in the mixed-forest region of the North European temperate zone. Proceeding from the pedocentric principle, the soil cover is treated as a causal factor largely determining the land use, productivity level, soil management technology and environmental status of the area. The research is based on soil data from seven arable land parcels of three experimental stations, where the Cambisols, Luvisols, Retisols, Leptosols and Gleysols are dominating. The taxonomic heterogeneity and contrastiveness of arable soils were estimated at the most detailed level of soil taxa. To determine the humus cover types (pro humus forms) and to evaluate the agronomical quality of soils, the guidelines elaborated for local pedo-ecological conditions were employed. The environment protection ability of soils was evaluated as a complex indicator, which comprises the biological and physical properties of soil cover, soil climate and the character of soil cover substratum. For quantifying the pedodiversity of soil cover and the contrastiveness of soil taxa, it is recommended to use the mineral soil pedo-ecological matrix with lithogenetic and moisture scalars, and the matrix of top- and subsoil texture. The best indicators of the pedodiversity of arable lands are the soil classification taxa determined at the most detailed level and the statistically elaborated data about their spatial distribution and properties. For the precise land use the evaluation of the agronomical quality of soil cover and its suitability for crops in relation to its whole heterogeneity is indispensable. The most informative pedodiversity indicator of arable soil humus status is the humus cover type. Additionally, the problems connected with pedo-ecological equivalence and soil type-specific biodiversity are discussed. The quantitative indicators of pedodiversity enable arranging the use of croplands in harmony with the pedo-ecological properties soil cover.

AB  - Two decades since calls for stream restoration projects to be scientifically assessed, most projects are still unevaluated, and conducted evaluations yield ambiguous results. Even after these decades of investigation, do we know how to define and measure success? We systematically reviewed 26 studies of stream restoration projects that used macroinvertebrate indicators to assess the success of habitat heterogeneity restoration projects. All 26 studies were previously included in two meta-analyses that sought to assess whether restoration programs were succeeding. By contrast, our review focuses on the evaluations themselves, and asks what exactly we are measuring and learning from these evaluations. All 26 studies used taxonomic diversity, richness, or abundance of invertebrates as biological measures of success, but none presented explicit arguments why those metrics were relevant measures of success for the restoration projects. Although changes in biodiversity may reflect overall ecological condition at the regional or global scale, in the context of reach-scale habitat restoration, more abundance and diversity may not necessarily be better. While all 26 studies sought to evaluate the biotic response to habitat heterogeneity enhancement projects, about half of the studies (46%) explicitly measured habitat alteration, and 31% used visual estimates of grain size or subjectively judged habitat quality' from protocols ill-suited for the purpose. Although the goal of all 26 projects was to increase habitat heterogeneity, 31% of the studies either sampled only riffles or did not specify the habitats sampled. One-third of the studies (35%) used reference ecosystems to define target conditions. After 20 years of stream restoration evaluation, more work remains for the restoration community to identify appropriate measures of success and to coordinate monitoring so that evaluations are at a scale capable of detecting ecosystem change.

AB  - The EC Water Framework Directive allows the Member States to designate artificial and heavily modified water bodies under specific conditions. For those water bodies the ecological assessment and the resulting programmes of measures will be based on the "maximum ecological potential" as reference conditions and not on the "high ecological status", which has to be used for natural water bodies. Such designation is possible only, if the hydromorphology of the water bodies concerned has been substantially changed in character to maintain specified uses. The criteria for the designation are fulfilled, if restoration measures needed to meet the high ecological status would have significant adverse effects on the uses and if no other better environmental options would exist to maintain the specified uses.
   In late 1999 the EC-Working Group on Heavily Modified Water Bodies (HMWB) has been established to develop criteria for the designation of artificial and heavily modified water bodies as well as for the determination of the maximum ecological potential. The working group has produced the guidance document "Identification and Designation of Artificial and Heavily Modified Water Bodies" in November 2002, which has been agreed by the European Water Directors on 21 November 2002 in Copenhagen. The guidance document is focusing on two time borders, the provisional identification of heavily modified water bodies until 2004 and the legally binding designation as artificial and heavily modified in the first river basin management plan in 2009 at the latest.
   The guidance document considered the main findings of 34 case studies for rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters carried out in 11 European countries. The results of the case studies as well as a summarizing synthesis were used as a fundamental basis to produce the guidance document. The practical examples given by the case studies were compiled as a toolbox which supplements the guidance for the purpose of its better application.

AB  - In the acceleration of industrialization and urbanization, brownfield is an important resource for land regeneration and restoration targeting to recover its ecosystem function. Landfills, as a type of brownfield distributed in the highly populated areas, occupy massive land resources. The ecological restoration of landfills becomes an engineering approach to achieve multiple effects of society, environment, and economy. This paper aims to monitor and assess the restoration microclimatic effects of landfills restoration in China with remote sensing data and techniques. We selected representative landfill restoration projects, including Nanhaizi Park in Beijing, Nanhu Park in Tangshan, and Tianziling Park in Hangzhou, as the study cases. Using the Landsat imagery, the scenes of the pre-restoration, mid-restoration, and post-restoration were retrieved, and the surface energy balance equation was applied to calculate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (T-s), and evapotranspiration (ET), representing vegetation conditions and hydro-heat microclimate conditions. The study areas are divided into four subzones and extracted the calculated values for statistics and comparison. We defined an indicator of restoration intensity (RI) using the different subzones to the outer contour distance radius and restoration phases to evaluate the spatial-temporal restoration degrees. The spatial pattern dynamics was displayed in the urbanization context in the cases of Beijing and Tangshan. We examined and quantified the relations between RI and the key indicators, NDVI, T-s, and ET. The overall results revealed that with higher restoration intensity, NDVI and ET became higher, and T-s became lower. It suggested that the ecological restoration on the landfills brought better vegetation, cooling, and humidification effects for the microclimatic environment. Our research has the implications for monitoring and assessing the climatic effects of ecological restoration in the brownfield regeneration in a macroscopic and ecosystem perspective.

AB  - Growth is determined by an organism's physiology, physical environment, and biological conditions, including food availability and any intra- and inter-specific interactions that can affect feeding activity. To analyse how all these factors interact to produce final growth in the herbivorous/detritivorous crab Neohelice granulata, we performed field and laboratory experiments with juveniles and adults from three populations which differed genetically as well as in their physical environment and the organic matter (OM) content in the soil that serves as food. We evaluated (a) growth in the field: Juveniles of the three populations were cross-transplanted in exclusion cages; (b) effect of the presence of adults on juvenile feeding: We measured the feeding activity of small juveniles in presence/absence of an adult male as potential predator in the field; and (c) effect of diet on cannibalism: We analysed the cannibalistic behavior of adult males from two of the populations in the laboratory after they had received protein-rich (24%) and protein-poor (3%) diets. In experiment (a), final size was similar for the crabs from all three origins but growth differed between sites. Experiment (b) showed that the presence of adults interfered with feeding activity at the two sites with lower weight indicators. In experiment (c), we observed that low protein diet increased the cannibalistic behavior of adult males, and this effect was more intense in crabs from the poorest food site. Our results contribute to understanding the set of factors and interactions involved in the response of individuals to the prevailing conditions in natural environments in order to maintain a growth rate, perhaps at the expense of different reserve accumulation. They also enable discussion of the limitations of approaches used in laboratory experiments.

AB  - Large amount of phthalate esters (PAEs) used as plasticizers in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products has caused ubiquitous contamination to the environment and potential ecology security risk all around the world, especially in places plastic films were indispensably utilized due to the widely proposing of facility agriculture in China. A case of PAEs contamination in four suburb areas of Nanjing was analyzed and discussed in this study. A new frame work has been put forward based on multi-criteria evaluation model and mathematical method of catastrophe theory, using farming work, laboratory determination and relevant environmental standards to measure the ecology security risk of PAEs in study areas. The factors were selected based on the availability of the data and the local conditions. The assessment model involves the contamination status of PAEs in soil and vegetables, the contamination effects of PAEs to human and soil organisms and the contamination source of PAEs from plastic films and other products in the four study facility agriculture areas. An evaluation system of the model was composed of thirteen mesosphere indicators and twenty-five underlying indicators including total PAEs concentration in soils, single PAE concentration in soils, total PAEs concentrations in roots, leafy, solanaceous and stem vegetables, PAE human risks, soil microbial counts, microorganism diversity indices, atmospheric deposition of PAEs, whether sewage wastewater irrigation, planting mode of the facility agriculture areas and climate condition of study areas. The modified evaluation system was used in the assessment of ecology security of the same place based on the data of 2012, and the results suggested that the ecology security indicators were reliable and were agree well with the practical situation of the study areas. The results could provide guidance for the application of health risk assessment of soil environment for the strong objectivity of catastrophe theory compared with other evaluation methods.

AB  - Soil contamination with petroleum, especially in the area of oil wells, is a serious environmental problem. Restoring soil subjected to long-term pollution to its original state is very difficult. Under such conditions, unique bacterial communities develop in the soil that are adapted to the contaminated conditions. Analysis of the structure and function of these microorganisms can be a source of valuable information with regard to bioremediation. The aim of this study was to evaluate structural and functional diversity of the bacterial communities in soils with long-term impacts from petroleum. Samples were taken from the three oldest oil wells at the Crude Oil Mine site in Weglowka, Poland; the oldest was established in 1888. They were collected at 2 distances: (1) within a radius of 0.5 m from the oil wells, representing soil strongly contaminated with petroleum; and (2) 3 m from the oil wells as the controls. The samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing and the community level physiological profiling (CLPP) method in order to better understand both the genetic and functional structure of soil collected from under oil wells. Significant differences were found in the soil samples with regard to bacterial communities. The soils taken within 0.5 m of the oil wells were characterized by the highest biodiversity indexes. Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria were strongly correlated with biological activity in these soils. Families of Aiphaproteobacteria were also dominant, including: Bradyrhizobiaceae, Rhizobiaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Acetobacteraceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae, and Sphingomonadaceae. The study showed that the long term contamination of soil changes bacterial communities and their metabolic activity. Even so, natural bioremediation leads to the formation of specific groups of bacteria that actively grow at the site of contamination in the soil.

AB  - Lowland rainforest communities are among the most threatened across South-east Asia as a result of ease of access, suitability for agriculture and proximity to population centres along the coast and to ports for export of timber, minerals and agricultural produce. In Australia, coastal lowland rainforest occupies a narrow band between the marine-influenced littoral communities and the forests of the coastal ranges and uplands in the Wet Tropics Bioregion of north-east Queensland. As the coastal lowlands were already highly fragmented, and subject to ongoing conversion for agriculture and urbanization, they were excluded from the World Heritage listing of the Wet Tropics of Queensland in 1988. Littoral rainforest and broad-leaved tea-tree swamps in the coastal zone have both recently been protected under Commonwealth environmental protection legislation; meanwhile, the remnant coastal lowland rainforest faces continued threats from extreme events, climate change, land management activities and introduced species. In a risk assessment based on IUCN guidelines, coastal lowland rainforest was assessed as endangered due to restricted distribution (full extent of the community encompassed by a minimum complex polygon less than 20000 km(2)) in conjunction with qualitative evidence of disruption to biotic interactions. A second criterion related to the historic decline in geographic distribution (60% decline in distribution since 1750) would correspond to a condition of vulnerable. Coastal lowland rainforest on alluvial soils has been particularly impacted, and a 75% decline in distribution since 1760 would correspond to a condition of endangered for this subtype. We had insufficient data to address the remaining IUCN Red List criteria for ecosystems, but point to published studies which address these criteria at the subregional level, and make suggestions for future data collection, monitoring and analyses which may support future reviews or proposals for enhanced protection within an Australian legislative context.

AB  - Environmental concerns are increasing rapidly, and the public and industry are concerned about natural resources. The products are produced to meet the customer's demand as to quality. However, today it is equally important to take into account cost, ecological factors in production and recycling of products. The same way, the dentistry must contribution with a recasting the alloys used to rehabilitation oral.
   This study evaluated the effect of the condition of Ti (as-received and re-cast) on its mechanical properties, microstructure and fractography. Castings (n = 6) with Ti in the as-received and once recast condition were made in a centrifugal casting machine using a high-purity argon gas. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS), proportional limit (PL) and elongation (EL) of the as-received specimens were evaluated in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The fractured specimens were polished down for Vicker's microhardness (VHN) measurement (100 g/15 s) from 25 mu m below the cast surface, then at depths of 50, 100,200 and 500 mu m. The microstructures of the alloys were also revealed. Scanning electron microscopy fractography was undertaken for the fractured surfaces after testing. The data from the mechanical tests and hardness were subjected to the Student's t-test and two-way repeated measures ANOVA, respectively. Tukey's test was used for pairwise comparison (alpha = 0.05). Higher UTS, PL and VHN and lower EL were observed for recast cp Ti. The microstructure was not influenced by recasting, but the mode of fracture was.
   The use of the recasting procedure can lower the costs of cp Ti castings and can be safely in dentistry. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fecal pollution at coastal beaches requires management efforts to address public health and economic concerns. Fecal-borne bacterial concentrations are influenced by different fecal sources, environmental conditions, and ecosystem reservoirs, making their public health significance convoluted. In this study, we sought to delineate the influences of these factors on enterococci concentrations in southern Maine coastal recreational waters. Weekly water samples and water quality measurements were conducted at freshwater, estuarine, and marine beach sites from June through September 2016. Samples were analyzed for total and particle-associated enterococci concentrations, total suspended solids, and microbial source tracking markers (PCR: Bac32, HF183, CF128, DF475, Gull2; qPCR: AllBac, HF183, GFD). Water, soil, sediment, and marine sediment samples were also subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing and SourceTracker analysis to determine the influence from these environmental reservoirs on water sample microbial communities. Enterococci and particle-associated enterococci concentrations were elevated in freshwater, but suspended solids concentrations were relatively similar. Mammal fecal contamination was significantly elevated in the estuary, with human and bird fecal contaminant levels similar between sites. A partial least squares regression model indicated particle-associated enterococci and mammal marker concentrations had the most significant positive relationships with enterococci concentrations across marine, estuary, and freshwater environments. Freshwater microbial communities were significantly influenced by underlying sediment while estuarine/marine beach communities were influenced by freshwater, high tide height, and estuarine sediment. Elevated enterococci levels were reflective of a combination of increased fecal source input, environmental sources, and environmental conditions, highlighting the need for encompassing (MST) approaches for managing water quality issues.
   IMPORTANCE Enterococci have long been the federal standard in determining water quality at estuarine and marine environments. Although enterococci are highly abundant in the intestines of many animals they are not exclusive to that environment and can persist and grow outside of fecal tracts. This presents a management problem for areas that are largely impaired by non-point source contamination, as fecal sources might not be the root cause of contamination. This study employed different microbial source tracking methods to delineate influences from fecal source input, environmental sources, and environmental conditions to determine which combination of variables are influencing enterococci concentrations in recreational waters at a historically impaired coastal town. Results showed that fecal source input, environmental sources and conditions all play a role in influencing enterococci concentrations. This highlights the need to include an encompassing microbial source tracking approach to assess the effects of all important variables on enterococci concentrations.

AB  - The effectiveness of harvesting machines, their reliability, and the level of negative environmental impact depends on the degree of adaptation of the equipment to natural-production conditions (NPC). To choose the equipment it is necessary to allocate groups of areas with close NPC. The purpose of the study is to form methodological tools for forest industry typification of forest areas by NPC. It is proposed to carry out the typification of forest areas based on cluster analysis. For this purpose, a methodology has been developed, including: setting the goal of typing areas by NPC; data collection on NPC; conducting cluster analysis; decision making on typification of areas by NPC. The task of cluster analysis is to divide, on the basis of a certain set of data, the set of forest areas into groups with similar NPCs. It is proposed to use Euclidean distances as a measure of belonging to one of the groups, and to determine the data set by indicators describing the NPC. The proposed methodology has been tested on the example of the European North of Russia (ENR). The study showed that three zones can be distinguished in ENR: zone A, including the Murmansk region; zone B, including the Republic of Karelia, the Republic of Komi and the Arkhangelsk region; zone C, including the Vologda region. Additionally, two subzones are distinguished in zone B: the West Karelian Upland and the territories belonging to the Northern, Subpolar and Polar Urals. The proposed methodology allows to increase the degree of formalization and convenience of the typification process of forest areas by NPC, to take into account a wide range of various aspects of natural-production conditions, their probabilistic nature, as well as to flexibly carry out the typification of areas for specific purposes. The research results may be applicable in solving problems of searching for effective technologies and rational parameters of logging machine systems.

AB  - The production of morphologically different seeds or fruits by the same individual plant is known as seed heteromorphism. Such variation is expected to be selected for in disturbance-prone environments to allow germination into inherently variable regeneration niches. However, there are few demonstrations that heteromorphic seed characteristics should be favored by selection or how they may be maintained. In fire-prone ecosystems, seed heteromorphism is found in the temperatures needed to break physical dormancy, with seeds responding to high or low temperatures, ensuring emergence under variable fire-regime-related soil heating. Because of the relationship between dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds and fire severity, we hypothesize that different post-fire resource conditions have selected for covarying seedling traits, which contribute to maintenance of such heteromorphism. Seeds with low thresholds emerge into competitive conditions, either after low-severity fire or in vegetation gaps, and are therefore likely to experience selection for seedling characteristics that make them good competitors. On the other hand, high-temperature-threshold seeds would emerge into less competitive environments, indicative of stand-clearing high-severity fires, and would not experience the same selective forces. We identified high and low-threshold seed morphs via dormancy-breaking heat treatments and germination trials for two study species and compared seed mass and other morphological characteristics between morphs. We then grew seedlings from the two different morphs, with and without competition, and measured growth and biomass allocation as indicators of seedling performance. Seedlings from low-threshold seeds of both species performed better than their high-threshold counterparts, growing more quickly under competitive conditions, confirming that different performance can result from this seed characteristic. Seed mass or appearance did not differ between morphs, indicating that dormancy-breaking temperature threshold variation is a form of cryptic heteromorphism. The potential shown for the selective influence of different post-fire environmental conditions on seedling performance provides evidence of a mechanism for the maintenance of heteromorphic variation in dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds.

AB  - Ecologically, sea urchins are an important species in marine habitats around the world. Economically, sea urchins are prized for their gonads (uni). With fisheries declining worldwide, intensive sea urchin culture has been proposed. For urchins in commercial culture, any factor that affects survivorship negatively should be addressed to maximize cost benefit. One potential obstacle to optimizing culture of sea urchins is cannibalism. Approximately 2000 adult and juvenile Lytechinus variegatus (1 g-45 g) were collected from Port Saint Joseph Peninsula State Park, FL between June and September 2009. Urchins were held in recirculating tanks at different sizes, densities, and feeding regimes for 4 weeks. Starvation and high density contributed to the highest level of cannibalism among small (12-21 g) urchins (percent cannibalism = 18.8%), whereas fed, high density conditions contributed to the highest level of cannibalism among large (32-37 g) urchins (percent cannibalism = 18.4%). These results suggest that (1) small urchins cannibalize at higher rates than large urchins, and (2) increased density is an important contributing factor leading to cannibalism. We quantified stress, defined as a decrease in production as a result of environmental conditions, by evaluating weight gain within each treatment and suggest that weight loss or minimal weight gain is an indicator of stress. We hypothesize increased stress caused by competitive interference can lead to increased cannibalism and decreased growth rates, even when food is not limiting. Ecologically, there are no reports of cannibalism of urchins in wild populations. Consequently, the role of cannibalism in regulating sea urchin community structure is not known. However, factors affecting cannibalism of L variegatus in the laboratory may provide insight into the conditions that could result in cannibalism in wild populations. From an aquaculture perspective, it is important to determine those factors that contribute to the incidence of cannibalism in sea urchins so that the appropriate culture conditions can be maintained to reduce the incidence of cannibalism.

AB  - The urban environment is stressful not only because of pollution but also due to heat and drought, creating arid conditions. Trees are passively subject to the microclimate but are also actively modifying it, and they perform important urban ecosystem services. Trees function as bio-indicators of urban conditions by morphological features and by dendrochronology and dendrobiochemistry. Anchorage and mechanical stability need to be surveyed. Among the stresses in addition to deposition of metals, there is gaseous pollution of the atmosphere (SO2, NO2, and O-3). Reacting to that are leaf anatomy as well as even the fine-tuning of biochemical pathways, e.g., terpene synthesis. The significant urban stresses are heat and drought. They increase top dieback and lead to a decrease of life crown-top heights from the ground (LCTH), where water relations remain similar in the crowns at various heights. Statistics of dendrochronology allow identification of pointer years with exceptionally wide and narrow tree rings. The prevalence of pointer years helps the selection of species suited for plantation in cities. Measurements of water potential at the turgor-loss point, pi(tlp), indicative of the permanent wilting point also helped identifying whole-plant drought tolerance. Infection by wood-decay fungi is a hazardous urban problem, as wood-decay builds up over many years increasing the danger of tree fall. Ectomycorrhiza is hampered in urban soils having a low inoculum potential due to chemical and physical soil qualities regarding cation-exchange capacity, permanent wilting point, and availability of water. Management should be based on scientific investigations. Allometry modeling allows for quantifying ecosystem services. Surveying stability is possible for instance by noninvasive acoustic tomography. Practices are irrigation and mulching. With appropriate management, cities can be useful habitats for trees contributing to biological richness and the comfort of life in cities.

AB  - To halt the loss of biodiversity in natural habitats, the EU passed the Habitats Directive and established the Natura 2000 network. The network captured forest habitats and habitat types, whose conservation status must be reported under Article 17 of the Directive. Hence, the hatmonization of habitat assessment methods and reporting formats are a critical issue. So far, the EU Commission and Member States have managed to design and issue reporting guidelines. However, as many of these reports are largely based on expert opinions, they tend to be biased and incomparable. To make conservation status assessments and reporting more consistent, this study evaluated a set of indicators with two decision support models. The DEX model operated with linguistic statements derived from numerical values, while the fuzzy model utilized numeric input. Both models were tested with data from Slovenia's three largest forest habitat types (FHT), namely 9110 - Lussuo-Fagetwn beech forests, 91K0 - Illyrian Fagus sylvatica forests (Aremonio-Fagion) and 91L0 - Illyrian oak-hornbeam forests (Erythronio-Carpinion), provided by the Forest and Forest Ecosystem Condition Survey. The DEX model produced uniform results and defined the conservation status of all three FHTs as least favorable. Conversely, the fuzzy model produced three different conservation status grades for the FHTs: a favorable conservation status for the 910 FHT, least favorable for the 9110 FHT and unfavorable for the 91L0 FHT. Its results were logical and in accord with the existing assessments. The study showed that both models could be used for the evaluation of FHT traits. However, because of its larger sensitivity, the fuzzy model allowed detecting subtle differences among the indicator values due to the use of continuous numerical data and more sophisticated mathematical procedures.

AB  - Biological communities often comprise core species that are locally abundant and regionally common. Benthic diatoms are crucial primary producers in wetlands and reflect ecosystem responses to long-term hydrological and nutrient changes, yet few studies explicitly focus on patterns and drivers of diatom core species abundance in these ecosystems. We investigated how benthic diatom core species abundance varies over space, time, and environmental gradients in a major shallow wetland, the Florida Everglades, where environmental gradients and diatom assemblages are spatially structured by water diversion and nutrient loading. We analysed a long-term dataset of species and environmental data collected over 6 locations in 2 major Southern Everglades drainages. We hypothesized that (1) the abundance of 4 diatom core species (present in >90% of the samples with relative abundance >5%) and water depth, benthic algal mat mineral weight and organic content, and mat total phosphorus and total nitrogen would vary more across space than time; and (2) the cumulative diatom core species abundance would increase with decreasing nutrient concentrations and depth. We found that (1) the abundance of 2 of the core species and the environmental conditions varied more between sites than between seasons and years, and (2) the cumulative abundance of the 4 diatom core species increased with oligotrophic and shallow water conditions. This study shows how, on average, the 4 diatom core species comprise similar to 82% of the total diatom abundance in the Everglades' benthic algal mats because these species are adapted to nutrient limitation and water scarcity. Similar dynamics may be at play in other wetlands undergoing hydrological and nutrient changes, thus warranting future work to predict these primary producers' responses to such changes.

AB  - The indicative quality of bioindicators, ranging from organelles, organs or single organisms to complex ecosystems, depends on inherent ecophysiological properties, population dynamics, and stress reactions with regard to physical and chemical changes in site conditions as described in Section 2 of the present contribution. Section 3 provides a systematic review of both typology and rational selection of bioindicators on the species, population, biocenotic, and ecosystem levels. It is to show that the primary task of bioindicators is the general determination of physiological effects in the sense of strain reactions rather than the direct measurement of environmental concentrations of stressors. Thus, in early recognition perspective the lack of specificity has the advantage of a broad-based caveat, inducive to subsequent systematic search for quantitative causal inter-relationships.
   A further advantage of biomonitoring is its comparatively low cost on the one hand and the integrative recording character on the other. Contrary to these positive aspects of bioindicator use there is, however, an essential deficiency resulting from the highly variable susceptibility of the test species exposed to stressors, which leads to difficulties in comparing specific effect data. In view of such problems, the possibilities of fuzzy logic approaches for evaluative data interpretation and inter- and intraspecific comparison purposes are emphasized.
   Active and passive biomonitoring approaches on the basis of single-species reactions yield spatially valid data only on condition the underlying sampling networks are implemented in compliance with geostatistical requirements or the corresponding test methodologies of variogram analysis and kriging procedures, respectively. Analogously, also the selection of complex bioindicators such as biocenoses or ecosystems must be based on rigid criteria of spatial and temporal representativeness. The last section then is a critical comparative appraisal of the problems encountered in biomonitoring, which leads to a set of suggestions for improving both the technical practicability and the data quality of biomonitoring approaches.

AB  - A regeneration process of oak-lime-hornbeam community (Tilio-Carpinetum typicum Tracz., 1962), developing after a clear cutting followed by a plantation of Scots pine stand (Pinus sylvestris L.), is analysed. A study material comes from managed and strictly protected (The Bialowieza National Park) part of the Bialowieza forest. A series of managed Scots pine stands, comprising developmental phases from thicket to old-growth, is compared with an analogical series of managed pedunculate oak stands - Quercus robur L. (in case of managed stands considered to be in a harmony with a target tree species composition for a given site type), as well as with a series of natural (strictly protected since ca. 80 years) stands, occurring in the Bialowieza National Park.
   The three experimental variants, occurring in similar site conditions, are compared with regard to the vegetation and stand structure, as well as to the chemical properties of two uppermost soil layers. Analysis of vegetation includes, i.a., calculation of a species richness, a share of species typical for Scots pine and oak-lime-hornbeam forest, ecological indicator values, as well as an analysis of overall floristic similarity by means of DCA ordination method. Soil conditions are studied by analysis of, i.a. pH in KCl and base saturation.
   It is concluded that the development of Scots pine stands on the site of oak-lime-hornbeam community, under conditions of the Bialowieza forest, has not brought about neither a persistent site degradation nor degeneration of the community. Some differences between pine and oak managed stands occurring on the site of oak-lime-hornbeam forest in the vegetation and chemical properties of the topsoil are generally confined to the comparatively short time period; from thicket to high polewood stages. The acidifying influence of pine needle litter on the site and ground layer vegetation is balanced, or even overridden, by processes associated with the regeneration of the phytocoenosis, first of all by the influence (shading and litter fall) of a rapidly developing hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) layer.
   Intensive regeneration processes of natural oak-lime-hornbeam community, supported by site eutrophication, caused by the input of air-borne chemicals and climate warming, lead to the growing discrepancy between Scots pine stands and site conditions. The results obtained suggest that the restoration of more natural conditions in the replacement Scots pine stands can be achieved, in a greater extent than previously assumed, by a means of spontaneous regeneration processes.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) deficiency and low temperature conditions are the prominent facet of Western Himalayan agro-ecosystems. A slight change in the environment alters the protein expression of the microorganisms. Therefore, proteomes of the two psychrotrophs Dyadobacter psychrophilus B2 and Pseudomonas jessenii MP1 were analyzed using two dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS, to determine the physiological response of altitudinally different but indigenous microorganisms in response to cold stress under N depleting conditions. Functional assessment of 150 differentially expressed proteins from both the psychrotrophs revealed several mechanisms might be involved in cold stress adaptation, protein synthesis/modifications, energy metabolism, cell growth/maintenance, etc. In both the proteomes, abundance of the proteins related to energy production and stress were significantly increased while, proteins related to biosynthesis and energy consuming processes decreased. ATP synthase subunit alpha, beta, ATP-dependent Clp protease, Enolase, groL HtpG and N(2)-fixation sustaining protein CowN proteins were found to be expressed in both B2 and MP1, similarly to previously studied diazotrophs under low temperature N-2 fixing conditions and therefore, can be considered as a biomarker for monitoring the nitrogen fixation in cold niches. Nevertheless, in both the diazotrophs, a good fraction of the proteins were related to hypothetical proteins which are still uncharacterized, thereby, suggesting the need for in-depth studies on cold adapted diazotrophs and their adaptive mechanisms.

AB  - Over the past few decades, coral reef ecosystems have been lost at accelerated rates as a result of global climate change and local stressors. Local management schemes can help improve the condition of coral reefs by enhancing their ecosystem recovery capacity. Caribbean conservation efforts include mitigation of local anthropogenic stressors, and integrating social participation. Here, we analyzed the case of the Bayahibe reefs in the Southeastern (SE) Dominican Republic to identify conservation actions and illustrate a conceptual example of local seascape management. We assessed reef health indicators from 2011 to 2016. Overall, our results show increases in total fish biomass, in both commercial and herbivorous fishes. Mean live coral cover was 31% and fleshy macroalgae was 23% after multiple disturbances such as Hurricanes Sandy and Isaac (2012), Mathew (2016) and heat stress presented in the study area in 2015. We also described actions taken by stakeholders and government institutions, including the implementation of a policy declaring an area of 869,000 ha as a marine protected area (MPA), enhanced water quality treatment, local restrictions to vessel traffic, enforcement of fishing regulations, and the removal of invasive lionfish (Pterois spp.). In addition, a restoration program for the threatened staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) was established in 2011, and currently has eight coral nurseries and six outplanting sites. Considering the biology and ecology of these reefs, we observed good results for these indicators (live coral cover, fish biomass, and water quality) in contrast with severely degraded Caribbean reefs, suggesting that optimizing local management may be a useful example for improving reef condition. Our results provide an overview of trends in reef condition in the SE Dominican Republic and could support current strategies to better protect reefs in the region. Given that Caribbean coral reefs face extreme challenges from global climate change, management measures may improve reef conditions across the region but stronger policy processes and increased scientific knowledge are needed for the successful management of coral reefs.

AB  - The Tangon river (267km long), of India and Bangladesh, is highly affected by the construction of the dam (1989) at 10km west of Boda in Panchgarh district, Bangladesh. The aim of the current work is to find out the impacts of flow change on hydrological and ecological components in the Tangon river and riparian wetlands using indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA). Estimation of threshold flow, the magnitude of hydrological impacts, estimation of eco-deficit state, categorizing the indicators in natural and regulated flow condition are also to be exercised. Day-to-day flow data of the Bamongola river gauge station is used for calculating change and magnitude of the flow regime. The range of variability used for calculating the threshold discharge revealed that in the post-dam period, most of the years register flow below the threshold limit. Flow failure rate in different seasons ranges from 58% to 100% and it is a maximum during the pre-monsoon period. Eco-deficit and eco-surplus which provide the degree of alteration of a stream flow clearly exhibit that in the regulated flow condition most part of the years shows eco-deficit. The magnitude of flow alteration ranges from 0.451 to 0.582 for different flow regime component groups and it is a maximum in the case of frequency and duration of high- and low-flow pulses. Seasonal analysis of the same revealed that the river is highly impacted during pre-monsoon periods. In the regulated hydrological regime, heterogeneity among the components has reduced significantly. All these things clearly indicate that already this river is impacted hydro-ecologically due to the attenuation of flow and fluctuation and if such a condition continues the situation will highly be vulnerable. This ensuing situation is not expected because this river passes through a populous tract and a huge number of peoples are directly and indirectly engaged with this river for their lives and livelihood.

AB  - Separation of natural and anthropogenic influences is required to identify land-use impacts on stream ecosystems. We investigated the effects of water quality and riparian condition on invertebrate assemblages along streams draining agricultural land by partitioning out changes in geomorphological characteristics. There was a strong negative relationship between invertebrate richness and distance downstream, driven by a gradient of reducing stream power and substratum particle size along the streams. When substratum particle size was accounted for, richness was reduced by 24% when there was limited availability of coarse particulate organic matter, resulting from lower riparian forest cover upstream. High concentrations of fertilizer-derived nitrate boosted invertebrate abundances, but only in mid sections of streams, where coarse substrata (>100 mm) and high insolation were available. Sampling of multiple sites along streams facilitated partitioning of land-use impacts from natural gradients. Invertebrate richness was a good indicator of stream biophysical condition (e.g. nature of the substratum, riparian condition) at the stream scale irrespective of taxonomic resolution (family or higher) or sample size (down to 50 individuals per site), and was therefore a useful monitoring tool. The finding that riparian vegetation is a key determinant of invertebrate diversity should encourage catchment-scale maintenance and rehabilitation of native riparian forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of biomonitoring is assessment of environment condition. Biomonitoring studies with the use of mosses focus mainly on analytes accumulation and determining elements' concentrations in the study area. It is often forgotten that a bioindicator should be alive during biomonitoring studies (which can be determined by, e.g., analysis of chlorophyll content). The objective of the carried out research was an assessment of the influence of selected heavy metals concentration: Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb accumulated by Pleurozium schreberi mosses during 3-month exposition within active biomonitoring, on their vitality, assessed by an analysis of a and b chlorophyll concentrations. The studies were also carried out in laboratory conditions, where the content of the dyes was determined with the aid of a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, in mosses reacting with solutions of various concentrations of the analysed metals. The content of elements in mosses after exposition and in solutions prior and after sorption were determined with the use of atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) in a flame atomiser. After the carried out studies it was determined that mosses, during 12-week long exposition, accumulated heavy metals, which did not clearly influence the changes in chlorophyll content. The carried out studies prove that heavy metals are not the only and determining factor, which influences chlorophyll content in mosses as well as the bioindicator's vitality in the conditions of environmental stress.

AB  - Latitudinal patterns of composition, biogeographic affinity and indicators of taxonomic diversity are described for the by-catch fish community in five typical shrimping areas in the Mexican Pacific (Upper Gulf of California, Sinaloa-Nayarit, Jalisco-Colima, Michoacan-Guerrero and Gulf of Tehuantepec). The taxonomic composition included two classes, 20 orders, 65 families, 147 genera and 292 species. The family Sciaenidae was the best represented with 33 species, whereas at the genus level, Anchoa was represented with eight species. A high percentage of the species showed wide distribution ranges (30.2% for Cortez Province similar to Panamic Province; 21.3% for San Diego Province similar to Panamic Province); nevertheless, each ecosystem included a characteristic combination of species, apparently related to the physiographic conditions of the ecosystems. Species richness showed a pronounced decrease from the Upper Gulf of California, which has warm-temperate features, to the Gulf of Tehuantepec, which has tropical conditions; this is an opposite trend to that observed in the taxonomic diversity indicators, suggesting that a taxonomic redundancy was present in tropical areas and higher taxonomic diversity was present in the Upper Gulf of California, despite the lower species richness. This is explained by the prevailing environmental conditions and isolation processes generated during the formation of the Gulf of California.

AB  - Genetic control undoubtedly plays the most decisive role in the development of characters in rhynchonellides, especially in those structural features such as shell microstructure and brachidial architecture. However, considering the relationship between shell microstructure and type of crura in post-Palaeozoic rhynchonellides supported by recent growing research, the present study links this striking matching to the distribution of rhynchonellide morphogroups around the main post-Palaeozoic mass extinction and diversification events, innovatively introducing the ribbing pattern as a feature widely argued as indicator of deeper/shallower habitats and particular ecological conditions. The analyses performed on the Western Tethys rhynchonellide database and, directly on 28 species from the peri-Iberian margins around selected post-Palaeozoic extinction/diversification episodes, reveal a recurrent distribution pattern according to the habitat considered (epicontinental vs. epioceanic). The smooth, eurinoid, septifal/arcual body plan is the distinctive inhabitant of deeper epioceanic environments, also being the last to withdraw from the epicontinental platforms when the environmental conditions were adverse, and the pioneers or opportunistic taxa conducing repopulation of these epicontinental habitats when the conditions were re-established after crises. The ribbed, eurinoid, falciform morphogroup seems to be the more resilient stock on epicontinental platforms in relation to ecological crises. Conversely, the ribbed, leptinoid, raducal group is typical inhabitant of epicontinental seas when normal conditions prevail and shows an uneven distribution unlinked to critical events, suggesting a more specialist pattern with a diversification related with a secondary differentiation. It is suggested that this distribution dynamic of morphogroups was controlled by the availability of requirements to generate each type of crura and microstructure in epicontinental/epioceanic habitats, such as metabolic or oxygen restrictions, or the filter-feeding efficiency of the lophophore. A research line starting-point is thus herein introduced which can lead to shed light into the adaptive strategies of rhynchonellides, relating particular morphotypes with potential triggering factors of mass extinction events.

AB  - Environmental status assessment and monitoring can be performed by the integration of multi-source datasets at continental and global scales. We propose a methodology for the development of a new anomaly indicator (AI) which can highlight the occurrence of anomalous conditions in a synthetic fashion by analysis of a set of spatial input data. Anomalous conditions are defined relative to long-term average assumed as normal or reference status of the vegetated land surface. The indicator is defined according to fuzzy set theory which is a powerful means of handling uncertain and imprecise knowledge of environmental systems. The indicator integrates, in an innovative way, the anomaly scores of a set of contributing factors extracted from the analysis of historical time series, mainly of Earth observations data. These time series are used to automatically derive the fuzzy membership functions that quantify the contribution of each factor to the final indicator. No reference data and expert knowledge are strictly required for the implementation of the AI although the methodology allows customization where this type of information is available. The method was tested over the African continent for the period 1996-2002; monthly AI values were derived with input datasets of vegetation phenology and rainfall estimates. The output AI continental maps bring new information by integrating multiple factors and they highlight patterns of anomalous conditions of the status of the environment. The analysis of the correlation with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) shows that the AI is able to identify the effects of this phenomenon and its spatio-temporal dynamics. The 1997-1998 and 2000-2001 ENSO events are clearly highlighted by the highest AI values in specific regions of the continent. The indicator proposed is a valuable tool which can help guide in depth and detailed investigations of environmental conditions at local scale. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Accumulation of toxic metals and indigenous bacteria in oyster, (Saccostrea cucullata) and their impact on antioxidant enzyme activities in the biological system was studied and used to provide snapshot of environmental condition in different tropical estuarine systems. The sedimentary Cd, Pb, and Hg concentration varied from 0.1 to 1.8, 22.0 to 98.0, and 0.03 to 0.11 mg kg(-1) (dry wt.) respectively. The bioaccumulated Cd, Pb, and Hg concentration in the oysters ranged from 3.6 to 9.0, 0.03 to 8.0, and 0.06 to 0.1 mg kg(-1) (dry wt.) respectively. In the oyster, the Cd concentration was well above the safe limit whereas the Pb and Hg concentrations were below the safe limit recommended by the European Commission (EC No. 1881/2006) for human consumption. The MPN value in the raw oyster for fecal coliforms (33-110 x 10(3)/100 g) exceeded the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved limits. Increase in antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-s-transferase, and metallothionein) activities with increasing pollutants loading was observed. The activities of antioxidant enzymes in the oyster were found to be very useful tool for evaluating environmental condition in any tropical estuarine systems.

AB  - Industrial green development (IGD) is fundamental for curbing serious pollution and over-consumption of natural resources caused by industrial growth, while quantification of the IGD level has become instrumental in guiding further progress. However, three existing research gaps prevent a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the IGD level. These gaps include the ignorance of the underlying conditions, lack of spatio-temporal comparability in the IGD indicator system, and absence of more reasonable assumptions within the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and slack-based measure (SBM) methods. The main goals of this study are to propose an improved evaluation framework to fill these gaps and to provide new knowledge by analyzing the IGD status, weaknesses, and spatio-temporal differences. With the collected panel data across 30 provinces in China from 2006 to 2015, the following findings were revealed based on the proposed evaluation framework: 1) both the performance and quality of IGD increased but their growth rates had significantly declined in the later years; 2) pollution abatement had the maximum improvement, followed by low-carbon production, resource reduction, and economic operation; 3) coastal provinces had higher performance and quality of IGD than inland provinces, especially for low-carbon production and pure technical efficiency; 4) provinces with higher IGD performance usually had higher pure technical efficiency, but not scale efficiency; 5) the traditional evaluation framework either significantly overestimated or underestimated the IGD efforts in some provinces. Our findings highlight the importance of differentiated policies between coastal provinces and inland provinces or between high-IGD-performance/quality provinces and low-IGD-performance/ quality provinces, as well as call for effective measures in response to slowing growth. Moreover, our methodology can comprehensively and accurately evaluate the IGD level by applying an extensive process considering underlying conditions/inputs, a spatio-temporal indicator system, and new integrated methods.

KW  - FRAMEWORK

AB  - This article is the second in a 2-part series assessing the accumulated state of the transboundary Yukon River (YR) basin in northern Canada and the United States. The determination of accumulated state based on available long-term (LT) discharge and water quality data is the first step in watershed cumulative effect assessment in the absence of sufficient biological monitoring data. Long-term trends in water quantity and quality were determined and a benchmark against which to measure change was defined for 5 major reaches along the YR for nitrate, total and dissolved organic carbon (TOC and DOC, respectively), total phosphate (TP), orthophosphate, pH, and specific conductivity. Deviations from the reference condition were identified as hot moments in time, nested within a reach. Significant increasing LT trends in discharge were found on the Canadian portion of the YR. There were significant LT decreases in nitrate, TOC, and TP at the Headwater reach, and significant increases in nitrate and specific conductivity at the Lower reach. Deviations from reference condition were found in all water quality variables but most notably during the ice-free period of the YR (May-Sept) and in the Lower reach. The greatest magnitudes of outliers were found during the spring freshet. This study also incorporated traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) into its assessment of accumulated state. In the summer of 2007 the YR Inter Tribal Watershed Council organized a team of people to paddle down the length of the YR as part of a Healing Journey, where both Western Science and TEK paradigms were used. Water quality data were continuously collected and stories were shared between the team and communities along the YR. Healing Journey data were compared to the LT reference conditions and showed the summer of 2007 was abnormal compared to the LT water quality. This study showed the importance of establishing a reference condition by reach and season for key indicators of water health to measure change, and the importance of placing synoptic surveys into context of LT accumulated state assessments.

AB  - Eryngium maritimum is a perennial species growing exclusively in a coastal littoral zone both on sand dunes and shingle beach and indicated as declining in Northern Europe. The objective of the present study was to prove the use of nondestructive physiological measurement methods to access physiological status of endangered plants, using E. maritimum as a model species. Plants from two Latvian sites were studied in comparison with other populations in Northern Europe (Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, United Kingdom) to find out if local differences in environmental factors affect vitality of E. maritimum individuals. Noninvasive chlorophyll analysis and chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements were used as indicators of plant physiological status through characterization of various aspects of photochemistry of photosystem II activity. Dynamics and morphology of individuals were investigated for evaluation of clonal growth potential of E. maritimum in natural conditions. Highly fluctuating trend of dynamics of individuals (within 40 groups at two Latvian sites) was established for E. maritimum in natural conditions over a five-year period. Disturbance of individuals lead to formation of new shoots from nodal root meristems. An exponential regression between fluorescence parameters F-V/F-M and Performance Index and summary monthly precipitation was found indicating that E. maritimum plants had significant tolerance to water shortage together with susceptibility to increased precipitation. Negative correlation between leaf chlorophyll content and more northern localization of individuals was found (r = 0.95 and r = 0.94, for generative and vegetative shoots, respectively). Northern populations of E. maritimum are endangered by high precipitation in conditions of low air temperature, leading to decrease of photosynthetic productivity and overall physiological status. High developmental plasticity at the root level leads to clonal growth and an efficient survival and relatively long life span of E. maritimum individuals. Chlorophyll a fluorescence is a useful method to search for the effect of suboptimal conditions on physiological status of endangered plant species without elimination and disturbance of individuals.

AB  - The polychaete Sabella spallanzanii (Gmelin) (Sabellidae) is a widely distributed species throughout the Mediterranean where it is commonly found in sheltered shallow areas and tip to 30 m depth, in more exposed waters. The sedentary habit, the filter-feeding behavior and its capability to colonize disturbed environments such as harbors, suggest the potential utility of this organism as a bioindicator in environmental monitoring programs. The aim of this work was a preliminary characterization of S. spallanzanii, integrating chemical data on trace metal concentrations with the biochemical analysis of antioxidant defenses which play an important role in mediating responses and adaptation to stressful environmental conditions. Organisms were collected in four locations of the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Sea, characterized by a moderate impact or influenced by organic enrichment or sulphuric emissions. Trace metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Ph, Zn) were comparable to those of other invertebrate species and quite typical for unpolluted environments. Analyses of individual antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione S-transferases, glutathione reductase) were integrated with measurement of the total oxyradical scavenging capacity toward specific forms of ROS; the TOSC assay, quantifying the overall capability of a tissue to neutralize specific reactive oxygen species provide a more integrated picture of the balance between prooxidant factors and antioxidant defenses, with important indications about the role of different ROS in appearance of oxidative disease. The antioxidant profile was influenced by the different physiological functions of the analyzed tissues, namely the branchial crown, involved in filtration of large volumes of seawater, and the thorax where digestive processes occur. The analysis of antioxidant defenses revealed significant variations in polychaetes from various sampling sites suggesting the influence of specific environmental conditions like those limiting oxygen availability. Our results confirm the role of antioxidants in adaptation to stressful environmental conditions and their importance in ecotoxicological studies for the sensitivity in revealing the occurrence of biological disturbance.

AB  - Under climate change, marine organisms will need to tolerate or adapt to increasing temperatures to persist. The ability of populations to cope with thermal stress may be influenced by conditions experienced by parents, by both genetic changes and transgenerational phenotypic plasticity through epigenetics or maternal provisioning. In organisms with complex life cycles, larval stages are particularly vulnerable to stress. Positive parental carry-over effects occur if more stressful parental environments yield more tolerant offspring while the opposite pattern leads to negative carry-over effects. This study evaluated the role of parental effects in determining larval thermal tolerances for the intertidal mussel, Mytilus californianus. We tested whether thermal environments across a natural gradient (shoreline elevation) impacted mussel temperature tolerances. Lethal thermal limits were compared for field-collected adults and their larvae. We observed parental effects across one generation, in which adult mussels exposed to warmer habitats yielded less tolerant offspring. Interestingly, although parental environments influenced offspring tolerances, we found no clear effects of habitat conditions on adult phenotypes (tolerances). We found indicators of trade-offs in energy investment, with higher reproductive condition and larger egg diameters in low stress environments. These results suggest that parental effects are negative, leading to possible adverse effects of thermal stress on the next generation.

AB  - With a significant rise in popularity of nature areas, particularly in urban settings like Singapore, Nature Reserves are being increasingly opened for public recreational use. In the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve (BTNR), the only remnant primary rain forest reserve in Singapore, trail networks are being expanded to meet this growing public demand. The physical condition of the present trail networks was assessed by monitoring the changes in surface compaction, soil moisture, infiltration rates, soil organic matter content, root density, litter cover and rill development. These parameters were compared with similar data obtained from undisturbed forested slopes to analyse the degree of changes brought about by trail usage. Significant changes occurred in all measured parameters, indicating observable degradation of the trails, particularly on vulnerable slopes. These changes are due to the heavy and increased use of the forest by visitors. Penetration resistance and shear strength of the top surface layers of the trails are important indicators of trail degradation status and these have been plotted, using GIS, to demarcate trails under different levels of stress. This field monitoring provides a relevant local assessment of trail conditions. It has potential for use in decision-making in future planning and forest management under similar site conditions.

AB  - High species richness, resource availability and disturbance are community characteristics associated with forest invasibility. We categorized commonly measured community variables, including species composition, topography, and landscape features, within both mature and 15-year-old clearcuts in West Virginia, USA. We evaluated the importance of each variable for predicting the degree of forest invasion by early-establishing exotic invasive plants. Biotic variables, including overall richness (excluding exotic invasive species) and mutually exclusive native and exotic non-invasive species richness, were the strongest indicators of invasibility. Sites that were located on northeast-facing slopes, more mesic conditions, or in clearcuts were more likely to be invaded by exotic invasive plants. Invasion of clearcut sites was more dependent on available microsites (e.g., lower solar radiation, northeast-facing slopes, and lower elevations) within each site than on the condition of the surrounding landscape, whereas invasion into the mature forests was dependent more on the surrounding landscape (e.g., proximity to paved roads). Our results indicate that exotic invasive plant species in our study area respond similarly as other plant species to resource availability and that competitive interactions are relatively unimportant. Current invasion into this landscape is more likely to be a passive reaction to site conditions instead of a driver of change.

AB  - Diatom and water chemistry data from 35 wetland sites in western Kentucky were used to assess diatoms as indicators of ecological conditions in wetlands. The wetlands were affected by different degrees of acid mine drainage and agriculture. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the distribution of diatoms was highly correlated with conductivity and total phosphorus (TP) two variables commonly associated with acidic mine drainage and agriculture, respectively.
   Diatom-based inference models were developed for use as quantitative indicators of two important environmental variables in wetlands: conductivity and TP. Diatom-inferred conductivity and TP values were highly correlated with measured values. Cross-validation with jackknifing procedures suggested that high apparent r(2) between inferred and measured conductivity was overly optimistic and should be treated with caution. Jackknifing-derived TP inference models performed poorly in predicting TP toward the ends of low and high TP concentrations In general, the conductivity inference models based on plankton had better predictability than those based on epiphyton. Epiphyton-based inference models can predict TP better than plankton. Therefore, diatoms in planktonic and epiphyton assemblages could provide complementary information on ecological conditions.
   Our data suggest that diatoms can reflect major regional environmental gradients and therefore can be used as indicators of the ecological conditions in wetlands. Quantitative inference models with known predictive power can aid the development of realistic and ecologically sound biotic indices for this region.

AB  - Black shale deposited in the transitional period from the Late Ordovician to Early Silurian is the most important source rock and shale gas reservoir in the Yangtze region of South China. However, the source of these sediments is still controversial. In this paper, the changes in total organic carbon (TOC), total sulfur (TS), organic carbon isotopes ((delta C-13(org)), biomarkers, trace elements, and rare earth elements in the Ordovician-Silurian boundary strata of the XK-1 well in northern Guizhou Province, South China, have been systematically studied. The paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions of the Late Ordovician to Early Silurian and their relationship with organic matter enrichment in the Upper Yangtze Platform have been reconstructed. The distribution of biomarkers reflects that the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian shale was deposited in the marine environment and was highly contributed by marine plankton/algae and microorganisms. Paleoclimatic proxies (Sr/Cu, delta C-13(org)) show that the global climate system experienced significant changes from a warm-humid climate to a brief period of cold-dry climate and then back to a warm-humid climate during the Ordovician-Silurian transition. This warm and humid climate condition helps to improve the biological productivity within the photic zone of the water column during deposition. In addition, the low oxygen (reduction) conditions during the deposition of the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian deposits are characterized by low Pr/Ph values (0.39-0.79) and relatively high elemental ratios of V/Ni (1.40-5.77) and V/(V + Ni) (0.58-0.85). This paleoredox condition contributes to the preservation of organic matter during deposition of the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian deposits. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the climate and ocean fluctuated greatly during the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian transition period, and this fluctuation provided necessary control factors for marine anoxia, primary productivity, and subsequent organic-rich black shale deposition in the Upper Yangtze region during the Late Ordovician and Early Silurian intervals.

AB  - We estimated the risk to populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) due to chlorpyrifos (CH), water temperature (WT), and dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) in 4 watersheds in Washington State, USA. The watersheds included the Nooksack and Skagit Rivers in the Northern Puget Sound, the Cedar River in the Seattle-Tacoma corridor, and the Yakima River, a tributary of the Columbia River. The Bayesian network relative risk model (BN-RRM) was used to conduct this ecological risk assessment and was modified to contain an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition pathway parameterized using data from CH toxicity data sets. The completed BN-RRM estimated risk at a population scale to Chinook salmon employing classical matrix modeling runs up to 50-y timeframes. There were 3 primary conclusions drawn from the model-building process and the risk calculations. First, the incorporation of an AChE inhibition pathway and the output from a population model can be combined with environmental factors in a quantitative fashion. Second, the probability of not meeting the management goal of no loss to the population ranges from 65% to 85%. Environmental conditions contributed to a larger proportion of the risk compared to CH. Third, the sensitivity analysis describing the influence of the variables on the predicted risk varied depending on seasonal conditions. In the summer, WT and DO were more influential than CH. In the winter, when the seasonal conditions are more benign, CH was the driver. Fourth, in order to reach the management goal, we calculated the conditions that would increase juvenile survival, adult survival, and a reduction in toxicological effects. The same process in this example should be applicable to the inclusion of multiple pesticides and to more descriptive population models such as those describing metapopulations.

AB  - Cultivated land productivity potential improvement (CLPPI) assessment is the fundamental basis to launch land consolidation, which is one of the most important way to increase the grain productive capacity. Previous studies on CLPPI assessment have focused on factors related to natural conditions of cultivated land, but they ignored the impacts of utilization conditions, including plot characteristics and agricultural infrastructure, which account for substantial CLPPI from land consolidation. Based on the crop-growth model and Agro-ecological Zoning (AEZ) methodology, this paper proposed a modified CLPPI assessment model to estimate the improvement of land productivity potential via land consolidation. Meanwhile, the contribute rates of different factors involved in determining the CLPPI were also analysed to reveal the ideal work focus and policy direction for land consolidation. Results showed that the calculated CLPPI values had obvious spatial variety in Shenyang, of which the average was 326.18. For the consolidation case, total crop production in Shenyang could be increased by as much as 149.89 x 107 kg, 20% of the current yield. CLPPI is the comprehensive outcome of both natural and utilization qualities of land use, and the current productivity potential of cultivated land in Shenyang relied much less on natural conditions such as soil than on utilization conditions such as agricultural infrastructure. In addition, medium-productivity lands were most appropriate target areas for the implication of land consolidation projects. Actually, the arrangement of land consolidation projects should not only consider CLPPI as in the past, but also add the theoretical productivity potential into consideration. Moreover, the realization of estimated CLPPI also calls for active changes of the whole land management system. An integrated institution for the full implementation of land consolidation, proper regulations and laws on the follow-up protection of cultivated land productivity potential, economic policies to stimulate the willingness of farmers, and a transfer mechanism for cultivated land are all needed policy changes.

AB  - Live (Rose-Bengal stained) deep-sea foraminiferal faunas have been studied at four stations between 530 and 3200-m depth in the Mozambique Channel (eastern Africa) to understand how complex environmental conditions (e.g., organic matter, oxygenation) control their ecological structure (i.e., diversity, density, and microhabitats). Two upper-slope stations, located at 530-and 780-m depth off Madagascar, are bathed by well-oxygenated bottom waters. They are characterized by fine sediments enriched in highly degraded organic matter (low amino-acid bio-availability and reduced chlorophyllic freshness). Mineralization of organic compounds results in relatively moderate oxygen penetration depth (i.e., 15 and 30 mm) in sediment. Interestingly, foraminiferal species richness (S) is exceptionally high at both sites. The highest densities are observed in the 780-m deep station, where peculiar sedimentary facies of organic matter are recorded (OC > 2.0% DW). Redox conditions and sedimentary organic matter control the composition and the vertical distribution (i.e. microhabitat) of benthic faunas at both upper-slope sites. Bolivina alata, Bulimina marginata, Haplophragmoides bradyi and Nouria compressa are relevant bioindicators of enhanced burial of organic matter prevailing at the 780-m deep station (i.e., eutrophic conditions), whereas Uvigerina hispida and Uvigerina semiornata are dominant at the 530-m deep station (i.e., relatively mesotrophic conditions). Two other stations are located on well-ventilated terraces from the deep-sea canyons of Tsiribihina and Zambezi (> 3000-m depth). They are characterized by carbonate ooze, which is depleted in degraded organic matter and, where oxygen penetration depth is relatively deep (i.e., > 80 mm). Because of food scarcity, S and densities are relatively low, and agglutinated and organic-walled taxa dominate foraminiferal faunas. Hospitella fulva, a foraminiferal species belonging to Allogromiida, occupies very deep infaunal microhabitat, what disrupts the classical scheme of micro habitat patterns in oligotrophic settings.

AB  - Indicator species are species that readily reflect some measure of habitat characteristics and have become an increasingly appealing tool in environmental monitoring. Traditionally, habitat conditions were derived based on the presence of specific indicator species, but the absence of indicator species may be just as informative. To evaluate the importance of presence vs. absence of indicator species for characterizing habitats across environmental gradients, we evaluated the interactions of zooplankton and acid-stress in 244 boreal lakes. We adopted the statistical methods proposed by Dufrene and Legendre (1997) to identify presence and absence indicator species to characterize high, intermediate and low acid-stress lake categories. Presence indicator species (identified by the statistical analysis) for highly stressed lakes were not entirely appropriate because further evaluation identified them as ubiquitous generalists. In contrast, absence indicators for highly stressed lakes were more appropriate as these habitat specialists were specifically absent from this category of lakes. On the other hand, presence indicators for the low acid-stress category were largely habitat specialists and therefore appropriate indicators. However there were no presence or absence indicators for lakes at intermediate acid-stress level. Thus the combined use of both presence and absence indicators is recommended to characterize habitats across a stress gradient. To evaluate if the successful application of this combined approach is dependent on a stress gradient, we applied the same analyses to a sub-set of uninfluenced (non-sensitive) lakes representing three different environmental conditions. This approach identified statistically significant presence and absence. indicator species for all three different reference conditions. Yet, the absence-based approach was not essential under unstressed conditions, as presence indicator species were habitat specialists for all reference categories. Finally, this study also emphasizes the importance of meaningful ecological traits of species in order to ensure the appropriateness of statistically selected indicator species.

AB  - Maintaining high soil quality is necessary to let healthy living ecosystems and to protect them from disturbances. The present research aimed to: test the quality of soils located inside the Vesuvius National Park (Southern Italy), an example of a peculiar volcanic system of great naturalistic interest affected by high touristic pressure and human impact, by the analyses of 25 parameters. Other goals of the research were to identify the main drivers among site-specific factors (altitude, seasonality, touristic impact) in defining soil quality and to individuate a Minimum Data Set (MDS) able to assess soil quality inside the Vesuvius National Park. The soil quality index (SQI) was calculated by linear scoring technique applying the "more is better" or "less is better" functions. In order to individuate the MDS, two statistical approaches were performed. In the first approach, not redundant parameters and showing the highest loading values were considered (MDS1); whereas, in the second approach, those with the highest sum of correlation coefficients were considered (MDS2). The SQI, calculated for all the parameters, showed intermediate values (0.44-0.67) reflecting the combination of the good level of naturalness and the metal accumulation. Seasonality affected the soil quality with high value in autumn, when the microclimatic conditions were less suitable for microorganisms and the soil metal contamination degree was lower than in spring. Anyway, also the touristic season inside the National Park affected the qualities of the soils along the two roads as they were similar regardless on accessibility and duration of the traffic flow. Also altitude that, regulating the microclimatic conditions, conditioned the type and density of plant cover affected soil quality. In fact, at low altitude most favourable conditions occurred for soil microbial biomass growth and activities. The MDS1 (C content, total Ni concentration, qCO(2) and percentage effect of root elongation for S. saccharatum L.) appeared sufficiently informative to evaluate soil quality.

AB  - The Uvero-Punta Piedras section, a low-developed coastal strip located in the southern area of Quintana Roo, Mexico, is experiencing habitat degradation driven by unplanned population sprawl, unregulated tourism expansion and overfishing. The main objective of this study is to provide an environmental (coastal vegetation and coral reef condition) and socioeconomic (human population condition) baseline data of a poorly documented and weakly managed zone by the use of a set of rapid assessment methodologies, looking to assist the regional efforts to manage these coastal resources. To achieve this goal we used a series of surveying methods including remote sensing, geographic information systems and in situ land/underwater surveys, to allow a broad characterization of the resources' condition in the study zone. Results showed that reef habitat was dominated by macro-algae (61.2 +/- 7.6%), followed by soft coral (gorgonians, 12.4 +/- 4.1%), hard coral (8.2 +/- 5.1%) and sponges (2.5 +/- 1.3%). Zooanthids and tunicates represented less than 1% of the total; coral and macro algae estimates suggest a decline from records of 15 years ago. Highest fish densities were (144 +/- 124 individuals/100 m(2)), while lowest were (83 +/- 25 individuals/100 m(2)). The total average fish density recorded could also be reflecting a decrease trend in the reef community structure. The main economic activities in the area are fishing and land clearing. From December 2003, 22% (corresponding to 44 ha) of the total original vegetation cover in the studied area was deforested. By February 2007, the deforested area increased 4.4 ha more. Should this tendency continue, by 2025 it would only maintain 24% of its total coastal vegetation cover representing a huge habitat loss. The future of economic activities in these areas lie directly on the establishment of appropriate management strategies for the protection and conservation of the renowned biodiversity that this area comprises.

AB  - Biomarker, palaeontological and isotopic evidence suggests that the Late Permian carbonate seas, i.e. the Northern (NPB) and Southern (SPB) Permian basins of northern Pangea, were characterized by significant spatial and temporal variations in the palaeowater-column redox state. This is particularly the case with regard to the deposition of the Lopingian Zechstein cycle 2 carbonate rocks. A shelf to basin reconstruction of environmental conditions was achieved by analysing nearly 400 core samples from 49 wells. This allowed an evaluation of the spatial variations in fades and broad oceanographic conditions at the basin scale. Specifically, in the lower slope and shallow -basin facies of the northern margin of the SPB (present-day northern Poland and eastern Germany), highly variable concentrations of the green sulphur bacterial biomarkers chlorobactane and isorenieratane (and their likely degradation products, C-15 to C-31 2,3,6-aryl isoprenoids, indicative of photic zone euxinia) and homohopane indices (indicative of anoxia), combined with the presence of a benthic fauna and bioturbation, indicate a variable but occasionally anoxic/euxinic water column. Locally in lagoonal facies in the northern and southern margin of the SPB, euxinic conditions also developed but these were likely associated with localised conditions or benthic production in association with microbialites. The presence of gammacerane in the eastern SPB (south-eastern Germany and eastern Poland) suggests elevated salinities there, compatible with the restricted configuration of the basin. However, a lack of these signatures in basinal settings of the eastern SPB indicates that strongly reducing conditions were restricted to the lower slope and shallow-basin locations and restricted lagoons, and were not developed in the basin centre. Moreover, this anoxia/euxinia in marginal settings is restricted to the north-eastern part of the SPB. The south-eastern part of the SPB (SE Poland), in contrast, is devoid of evidence for PZE. The southern margin of the SPB is also characterized by generally oxic-suboxic conditions, with local anoxia limited to more restricted embayments, and elevated salinities limited to restricted oxic-anoxic lagoons. In the western SPB (NE England and adjacent offshore) and the NPB (Outer Moray Firth, offshore Scotland) the water columns were oxic-suboxic. Overall, it appears that high but episodic primary bioproductivity of organic matter was concentrated on (or even limited to) the lower slopes of the SPB's north-eastern margin and the restricted lagoons and shallow basin of its southern margin, leading to the formation of source rocks for petroleum in these areas. In addition, the temporal and geographical restriction of anoxia appears to have prevented the accumulation of large and more widespread quantities of organic matter; in fact TOC contents exhibit a poor correlation with ecological and anoxia indicators. Crucially, this work confirms that the strong evidence for PZE observed in shelf and lower slope/shallow-basin facies of the north-eastern SPB need not be associated with widespread, basin-scale anoxia; this conclusion has implications for organic matter burial, carbon cycling and biotic crises during other times in Earth history.

AB  - We analyzed variation in the functional composition and diversity of understory plant communities across different forest vegetation types in Slovenia. The study area comprises 10 representative forest sites covering broad gradients of environmental conditions (altitude, geology, light availability, soil type and reaction, nutrient availability, soil moisture), stand structural features and community attributes. The mean and variation of the trait values were quantified by community-weighted means and functional dispersion for four key plant functional traits: plant height, seed mass, specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content. At each study site, forest vegetation was surveyed at two different spatial scales (4 and 100 m(2)) in order to infer scale-dependent assembly rules. Patterns of community assembly were tested with a null model approach. We found that both trait means and diversity values responded to conspicuous gradients in environmental conditions and species composition across the studied forests. Our results mainly support the idea of abiotic filtering: more stressful environmental conditions (e.g., high altitude, low soil pH and low nutrient content) were occupied by communities of low functional diversity (trait convergence), which suggests a selective effect for species with traits adapted to such harsh conditions. However, trait convergence was also detected in some more resource-rich forest sites (e.g., low altitude, high soil productivity), most likely due to the presence of competitive understory species with high abundance domination. This could, at least to some extent, indicate the filtering effect of competitive interactions. Overall, we observed weak and inconsistent patterns regarding the impact of spatial scale, suggesting that similar assembly mechanisms are operating at both investigated spatial scales. Our findings contribute to the baseline understanding of the role of both abiotic and biotic constraints in forest community assembly, as evidenced by the non-random patterns in the functional structure of distinct temperate forest understories.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of existing literature on the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation effects on field crops. Earlier reviews on field crop responses to UV-B considered few physiological processes or crops. For this review, we easily located about 129 studies on 35 crop species published since 1975. Here, we report the effects of UV-B radiation on visual symptoms, leaf ultrastructure and anatomy, photosynthetic pigments, UV-B absorbing compounds, photosynthesis, growth and development, yield, genotypic differences, and finally, interactions of UV-B with abiotic and biotic factors of crop plants. Experiments conducted in glasshouses, in closed and open top chambers, and under field conditions, with varying source (solar or artificial) and intensity of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 50-1800 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) and UV-B (0-50 kJ m(-2) per day) are included. It is easy to conduct experiments that purport to evaluate the effects of projected UV-B intensities on crop species by providing supplemental irradiance with lamps or by reducing UV-B with filters; however, it is very difficult to simulate UV-B irradiance spectral changes that are likely to occur in nature. Collated results for each process are presented as percent change from control along with the experimental conditions in tabular format. Many of the studies showed dramatic effects of UV-B radiation, but under conditions with supplemental UV-B irradiance that was higher than would ever occur outside experimental conditions or in which the longer wavelengths in the PAR and UV-A, which moderate UV-B effects, were greatly reduced. Only 25 of the studies reviewed used experimental conditions and supplemental UV-B irradiance that approached realism. However, unrealistic the experimental conditions might be, an increase in understanding of basic plant physiology was gained from most of the studies.
   Visual symptoms consisting of chlorotic or necrotic patches on leaves exposed to UV-B were not unique. Both vegetative and reproductive morphology were altered by UV-B radiation. Leaf anatomy was altered due to changes in thickness of epidermal, palisade, and mesophyll layers. Enhanced UV-B generally decreased chlorophyll content (10-70%), whereas it increased UV-B absorbing compounds (10-300%) in many crops. Decrease in photosynthesis (3-90%), particularly at higher UV-B doses, was due to both direct (effect on photosystem) and indirect (decrease in pigments and leaf area) effects. The decreases in chlorophyll pigments and photosynthesis resulted in lower biomass and yield of most crop plants. Genotypes of crop species exhibited variability in leaf wax layer thickness, loss of chlorophyll, and increase in phenolics as mechanisms of tolerance to enhanced UV-B radiation resulting in changes in biomass/yield. Results from the few studies on interaction of UV-B with other abiotic and biotic factors did not lead to useful conclusions. Studies are needed to quantify the effects of UV-B radiation on crops in order to develop dose response functions that can facilitate development of dynamic simulation models for use in UV-B and other environmental impact assessments.

AB  - Insect and veteran trees are important parts of ecosystems and are usually included in ecological studies of forest management. The loss of veteran trees in woodlands and open landscapes would lead to the loss of saproxylic organisms-an important part of biodiversity. Hence, the persistence of many specialized insects depends on the presence of veteran trees scattered in woodlands (e.g. ancient wood pastures, game parks or protected areas), cities, towns and villages (e.g. avenues, parks or chateau parks) or open landscapes (e.g. fishpond dams, solitary trees or fruit orchards). Veteran tree conditions could be fairly well described by three components-diameter, age and microhabitats present. The problem is that diameter belongs to the most studied characteristics, while age and microhabitats, which can be quite complicated to measure, are much less studied. This paper illustrates that, due to this unbalanced use of indicators of veteran-tree conditions, we are still missing some important information on saproxylic species ecology-and sometimes only large trees might be studied, rather than real veterans. Although we already know that veteran trees are essential habitat for a range of saproxylic organisms, there are still gaps in our knowledge of the specific conditions that veteran trees provide. It is vital that these are quantified and understood so that this information can be used to conserve veteran trees and their associated species.

AB  - Aim : Soil health is a concept that integrates soil physical; chemical and biological indicators into a framework for soil resource evaluation. Quantitative assessment of soil health is required to determine the sustainability of land use in terms of environmental quality and plant productivity. The main objective of the study was to find out the impact of intensive cultivation on soil health under polyhouses condition of mid hill zone of Himachal Pradesh.
   Methodology : The soil samples were collected from polyhouses and adjacent open fields from three districts of Himachal Pradesh, India (Mandi, Solan and Sirmour) and were analysed for physical (bulk density, particle density and porosity), chemical (pH, EC, organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, bicarbonate, chloride, available N, P, K, extractable calcium, magnesium and SO4-S, DTPA extractable Zn, Fe, Mn and Cu) and biological (microbial biomass C) properties. All the soil indicators were combined to calculate soil health index (SHI).
   Results : The soil health indicators like EC, 00, P. S, chloride and microbial biomass had more influence on soil health under polyhouse condition. Majority of the soils in polyhouse conditions were in high soil health (57%) of the surveyed samples, followed by very high (40%) and medium health soil (3%).
   Interpretation : Soil health was found to be affected by the management practices adopted by the farmers and the extent of fertilizer used over a period of time.

AB  - Physiological parameters provide indicators to evaluate how organisms respond to conservation actions. For example, individuals translocated during reinforcement programmes may not adapt to their novel host environment and may exhibit elevated chronic levels of stress hormones and/or decreasing body condition. Conversely, successful conservation actions should be associated with a lack of detrimental physiological perturbation. However, physiological references fluctuate over time and are influenced by various factors (e.g. sex, age, reproductive status). It is therefore necessary to determine the range of natural variations of the selected physiological metrics to establish useful baselines. This study focuses on endangered free-ranging Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni hermanni), where conservation actions have been preconized to prevent extinction of French mainland populations. The influence of sex and of environmental factors (site, year and season) on eight physiological parameters (e.g. body condition, corticosterone concentrations) was assessed in 82 individuals from two populations living in different habitats. Daily displacements were monitored by radio-tracking. Most parameters varied between years and seasons and exhibited contrasting sex patterns but with no or limited effect of site. By combining behavioural and physiological traits, this study provides sex-specific seasonal baselines that can be used to monitor the health status of Hermann's tortoises facing environmental threats (e.g. habitat changes) or during conservation actions (e.g. translocation). These results might also assist in selection of the appropriate season for translocation.

AB  - The predicted distribution of the Chinese Windmill Palm (Trachycarpus fortunes) was modelled using several algorithms with inputs consisting of occurrence information and bioclimatic datasets. A global species distribution model was developed and projected into New Zealand to provide a visualization of suitability for the species in current and future conditions. To ensure model robustness, occurrence data was checked for redundancy, spatial auto-correlation and the environmental variables checked for cross-correlation and collinearity. The final maps predicting suitability resulted from ensembling the predictions of all the algorithms. The resulting ensembled maps were weighted based on the evaluation parameters AUC, Kappa and TSS. When reclassified into low, medium and high suitability categories, results show an expansion of high suitability areas accompanied by a reduction of low suitability areas for the species. The centroids of the high suitability areas also exhibit a general movement towards the Southwest under future climate conditions. The range expansion was proportional with the representative values of emission trajectories RCPs (2.5, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) used in projecting into future conditions. The movement magnitude and direction of predicted high suitability area centroids for the palm supports the use of the plant as an indicator of climate change.

AB  - There are presented data on the adaptive flexibility of goat organism of foreign breeding according linear implement with the use of yard housing box technology on the blood leucogram and the number of integrative indicators (state index, adaptive rate, ratio of lymphocytes and monocytes). The results of a study of the biochemical composition of blood and milk productivity of imported goats are given. It is established that in the new natural climatic and fodder conditions of the Middle Ural, the most stable functional system of immunological protection, phagocytosis, of imported goats begins to dominate, it is confirmed by increasing in the number of banded neutrophils in 2,6-4,3 times in comparison with the species norm. The redistribution of white blood cells (eosinopenia, neutrophilia, lymphopenia) is aimed at preserving functional homeostasis with long-term adaptation to stressful environmental conditions and indicating a peculiar disruption in the adaptation of imported goats in new natural climatic and fodder conditions. Integral indicators: state index -19,6 -19,8; coefficient of adaptation -3,4 -5,6; index of the ratio lymphocytes and monocytes -17,9 -29,3, characterize the functional state of the organism and the degree of tension of the body's regulatory systems when adapting to external influences, indicate the state of strain of the organism of imported goats in the conditions of the Middle Ural. An analysis of the biochemical composition of the blood of imported goats showed that in the blood of animals of all groups the content of total protein and the amount of globulins in its composition were increased in relation to the species norm. In the KRITTER KOUNTRY and THE EG66 lines these changes were more pronounced than in the goats of the STAR-FIRE line, which confirms a different level of adaptive abilities depending on the genetic affiliation of the animals. The yield of animals of the STAR-FIRE line was 727.4 kg, which exceeded the minimum requirements for the milk production of goats of this breed by 21.2%. The advantage of milking for lactation of STAR-FIRE goats before the herdmates of the THE EG66 and KRITTER KOUNTRY lines was 2.8 and 5.3%. A similar dynamics was also in the fat and protein content in the milk of goats. The highest mass fraction of milk fat and protein was in STAR-FIRE goat milk, the lowest line was KRITTER KOUNTRY. This result is confirmed by the results of hematological studies, suggests higher adaptive abilities of goats of the STAR-FIRE line and proves the expediency of further selection-breeding work using animals of this line.

AB  - Global warming is a major threat to agriculture worldwide. Between 2008 and 2013, some coffee producing countries in South and Central America suffered from severe epidemics of coffee leaf rust (CLR), resulting in high economic losses with social implications for coffee growers. The climatic events not only favored the development of the pathogen but also affected the physiological status of the coffee plant. The main objectives of the study were to evaluate how the physiological status of the coffee plant modified by different environmental conditions impact on the pathogenesis of CLR and to identify indicators of the physiological status able to predict rust incidence. Three rust susceptible genotypes (one inbred line and two hybrids) were grown in controlled conditions with a combination of thermal regime (TR), nitrogen and light intensity close to the field situation before being inoculated with the rust fungus Hemileia vastatrix. It has been demonstrated that a TR of 27-22 degrees C resulted in 2000 times higher sporulation than with a TR of 23-18 degrees C. It has been also shown that high light intensity combined with low nitrogen fertilization modified the CLR pathogenesis resulting in huge sporulation. CLR sporulation was significantly lower in the F1 hybrids than in the inbred line. The hybrid vigor may have reduced disease incidence. Among the many parameters studied, parameters related to photosystem II and photosynthetic electron transport chain components appeared as indicators of the physiological status of the coffee plant able to predict rust sporulation intensity. Taken together, these results show that CLR sporulation not only depends on the TR but also on the physiological status of the coffee plant, which itself depends on agronomic conditions. Our work suggests that vigorous varieties combined with a shaded system and appropriate nitrogen fertilization should be part of an agro-ecological approach to disease control.

AB  - We studied the response of the macrofauna to forest conversion from pure coniferous stands into semi-natural montane forests in the southern Black Forest (Germany). The investigation was carried out by comparing existing stands that represent the four major stages of the envisaged conversion process. Major results are: (i) environmental parameters indicate a significant alteration of the soil environment, (ii) neither an overall change nor a clear trend in macrofaunal richness and abundance could be established, and (iii) the data for the different taxa suggest specific responses to the conditions of the individual conversion stages. In general, saprophagous taxa seem to be mainly driven by alterations of the resource base (litter quality, microbial parameters) while predatory taxa tend to respond to changes at the consumer level. Associated alterations in the functional structure occurred for macroengineers (earthworms), primary consumers (diplopods, isopods) as well as a wide range of predators. These changes could partly be explained by changes in environmental conditions that did not follow a gradual adjustment during the conversion process. One essential step is the shift from an organic layer composed of low-quality coniferous litter that is dominated by fungi to a litter layer with higher quality food sources. Within this framework, the specific response of the macrofauna is modulated by factors such as differences in structural features of the ground vegetation and availability of woody litter in a stage-specific way. Since the response of the macrofauna depended far less on site conditions than any of the other environmental factors, this invertebrate group maybe used as a valuable indicator of the changes associated with different stages of the conversion process. As long as no dramatic change of soil conditions - in particular pH - occurs, however, no fundamental restructuring of the soil community is to be expected. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent droughts in Puerto Rico and throughout the Caribbean have emphasized the region's agricultural vulnerability to this hazard and the increasing need for adaptation mechanisms to support sustainable production. In this study, we assessed the geographic extent of agricultural conservation practices incentivized by US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and evaluated their large-scale contribution to drought adaptability. We identified concentrations of drought-related practices (e.g. cover crops, ponds) applied between 2000 and 2016. Using information from spatial databases and interviews with experts, we assessed the spatial correlation between these practices and areas exposed to drought as identified by the US Drought Monitor. Between 2000 and 2016, Puerto Rico experienced seven drought episodes concentrated around the south, east and southeastern regions. The most profound drought occurred between 2014 and 2016 when the island experienced 80 consecutive weeks of moderate drought, 48 of severe drought and 33 of extreme drought conditions. A total of 44 drought-related conservation practices were applied at 6984 locations throughout 860 km(2) of farmlands between 2000 and 2016 through the NRCS-Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Practices related to water availability were statistically clustered along the coasts, whereas soil and plant health practices were clustered in the mountainous region. While these concentrations strongly correlated with areas exposed to moderate drought conditions, >80% did not coincide with areas that experienced severe or extreme drought conditions, suggesting that areas highly exposed to drought conditions generally lacked drought preparedness assisted by EQIP. Climate projections indicate an increase in the frequency and intensity of drought events, particularly in the eastern region of Puerto Rico. Our analysis highlighted the need to implement more conservation practices in these areas subject to drought intensification and exposure. Government programs intended to address vulnerabilities and enhance capacity and resilience may not be reaching areas of highest exposure. Recommendations include raising producer awareness of past and future exposure and making programs more accessible to a broader audience.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential utility of several biochemical parameters as indicators of the toxic effects of cadmium in the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea under two levels of oxygenation (normoxia 21 kPa and hypoxia 4 kPa). These variations in oxygenation are representative of the natural environments of bivalves living at the bottom of the water column, where hypoxic episodes may occur regularly. Cadmium accumulation, metallothionein synthesis. MXR protein induction, lipoperoxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase, glutathione reductase and total and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases) were assessed in the gills of C. fluminea in four experimental conditions: normoxia, hypoxia, normoxia with cadmium and hypoxia with cadmium ([Cd] = 30 mu g l(-1)) over a 14-day period. Behavioural reactions were also followed for the duration of the experiment by monitoring clam activity and valve movements. This study is a first report on biochemical responses under cadmium contamination and hypoxia and will enable us to determine better biomarkers for C. fluminea as they were measured simultaneously. In metal-exposed animals, we found an increasing accumulation of cadmium in the gills with time. and this was more severe in hypoxic conditions. Metallothionein synthesis occurred in contaminated clams and was precocious in hypoxic conditions. MXR protein induction appeared promising due to its quick and significant response to metal with a strong impact from hypoxic contamination. On the other hand, in our experimental conditions, antioxidant parameters did not show decisive responses to contamination and hypoxia, except glutathione peroxidases which decreased systematically with time in a cadmium-independent manner. Lipid peroxidation. expressed as malondialdehyde content, was not stimulated by normoxic contamination, as has been shown in other studies, but was stimulated under hypoxic cadmium contamination, Our study confirms the importance of a multi-biomarker approach in environmental studies as some are not appropriate to all organisms.

AB  - Feathers have a diversity of functions in birds and are costly to produce, so their growth rate and mass can be reliable indicators of nutritional condition at the time of production. Despite the potential for feather metrics to advance our understanding of foraging, they are underused in avian ecology. One reason for this is the difficulty of interpreting whether individual variation is driven by ontogenetic, genetic or environmental effects, which is exacerbated by the fact that most analyses have been done on cross-sectional data. We addressed this deficit using a longitudinal dataset of tail feathers collected from great tits Parus major to test for ontogenetic and genetic effects on growth rate, mass and length, while controlling for body/feather size differences and other confounding factors. First, we found that the type of moult episode and experimentally-induced replacement differentially affected the length, mass and growth of feathers, providing evidence of an ontogenetic effect that should be considered when comparing these feather traits across individuals as a measure of condition. Second, we detected moderate to high repeatability and heritability values from parent-offspring regression for these three feather traits, which are suggestive of an underlying genetic component of variation. Third, we used a mean centring within-individual approach to test whether feather growth rate and feather mass (length-corrected) are indeed positively correlated with each other as overlapping indicators of body condition in birds, and found that this association, although positive, is weak and only significant between individuals. This suggests that both metrics are not so intimately linked as originally thought, and probably have different sensitivities to variation in foraging performance and ecological conditions. Together with the higher plasticity of feather growth rate compared to feather mass, our results support the idea that feather growth rate is better suited for examining short-term responses to environmental variation.

AB  - Structural health monitoring allows the automated condition assessment of civil infrastructure, leading to a cost-effective management of maintenance activities. However, there is still a debate in the literature about the effectiveness of available signal processing strategies to timely assess the health state of a structure. This paper is a contribution to this debate, by presenting the application of different vibration-based damage detection methods using up-to-date multivariate statistical analysis techniques applied to data acquired from a permanently monitored long-span arch bridge. Techniques based on dynamic regression models, linear and local principal component analysis, as well as on their combinations, including, in particular, the newly proposed method based on the combination of dynamic multiple linear regressions and local principal component analysis, and, finally, a method based on the recently proposed approach of cointegration, are considered. A first effort is made to formulate these methods within a unique mathematical framework, highlighting, in particular, the relevant parameters affecting their results and proposing objective criteria for their appropriate tuning and for choosing the length of the training period. Then, the considered damage detection methods are implemented and applied to field data, seeking for damage-sensitive features in the presence of variable environmental and operational conditions. The considered techniques are applied to time histories of identified modal frequencies of the bridge and their capability to reveal structural damage of varying severity is assessed using control charts. The case of an artificially imposed non-linear correlation between the features is also considered. The results provide, for the first time in the literature, an estimation of the minimum level of damage that can be realistically detected in the bridge using dynamic signatures and up-to-date signal processing algorithms, thus contributing to a more aware use of monitoring data and reliance over related health state assessment information.

AB  - Mercury is considered to be a serious risk to wildlife. As a result, the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative and others have developed ambient water quality criteria (AWQC) for the protection of wildlife. These AWQC have been controversial, however. because the AWQC were single values that did not account for site-specific conditions, derivation of the AWQC relied on a single no-observed-adverse-effect level, and the AWQC had an unknown level of conservatism because of reliance on both average and conservative assumptions and uncertainty factors. Rather than develop a single-value AWQC for total mercury, we derived an AWQC model that explicitly incorporates factors controlling bioavailability, methylation rates, and bioaccumulation in the aquatic environment (e.g., pH, dissolved organic carbon). To derive our AWQC model, field data were collected from 31 lakes in Ontario and an additional 10 lakes in Nova Scotia (North America). In the field study, levels of total and methylmercury in water and fish as well as levels of key water quality variables were determined. We conducted multiple-regression analysis to derive a model that estimates mercury levels in prey of mink. Mink are very sensitive to mercury exposure. An independent dataset consisting of 5 1 water bodies in the United States was then used to confirm the validity and robustness of the AWQC model. Next, we combined the results of chronic-feeding studies with similar protocols and endpoints in a meta-analysis to derive a dose-response curve for mink exposed to mercury in the diet. In the final step, we used a probabilistic risk model to estimate the concentrations of methylmercury in water that would lead to levels in fish sufficient for a 10% probability of exceeding the lethal dose affecting 5% of the mink population. The result is an AWQC equation for mercury for the protection of wildlife that can be used with a variety of site-specific conditions.

AB  - Pavlovian fear conditioning is often used in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to investigate the neural substrates of associative learning(1-5). In these studies, it is important to provide behavioral evidence of conditioning to verify that differences in brain activity are learning-related and correlated with human behavior.
   Fear conditioning studies often monitor autonomic responses (e.g. skin conductance response; SCR) as an index of learning and memory(6-8). In addition, other behavioral measures can provide valuable information about the learning process and/or other cognitive functions that influence conditioning. For example, the impact unconditioned stimulus (UCS) expectancies have on the expression of the conditioned response (CR) and unconditioned response (UCR) has been a topic of interest in several recent studies(9-14). SCR and UCS expectancy measures have recently been used in conjunction with fMRI to investigate the neural substrates of aware and unaware fear learning and memory processes(15). Although these cognitive processes can be evaluated to some degree following the conditioning session, post-conditioning assessments cannot measure expectations on a trial-to-trial basis and are susceptible to interference and forgetting, as well as other factors that may distort results(16,17).
   Monitoring autonomic and behavioral responses simultaneously with fMRI provides a mechanism by which the neural substrates that mediate complex relationships between cognitive processes and behavioral/autonomic responses can be assessed. However, monitoring autonomic and behavioral responses in the MRI environment poses a number of practical problems. Specifically, 1) standard behavioral and physiological monitoring equipment is constructed of ferrous material that cannot be safely used near the MRI scanner, 2) when this equipment is placed outside of the MRI scanning chamber, the cables projecting to the subject can carry RF noise that produces artifacts in brain images, 3) artifacts can be produced within the skin conductance signal by switching gradients during scanning, 4) the fMRI signal produced by the motor demands of behavioral responses may need to be distinguished from activity related to the cognitive processes of interest. Each of these issues can be resolved with modifications to the setup of physiological monitoring equipment and additional data analysis procedures. Here we present a methodology to simultaneously monitor autonomic and behavioral responses during fMRI, and demonstrate the use of these methods to investigate aware and unaware memory processes during fear conditioning.

AB  - The Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals requires that the risks from the exposure to substances be controlled throughout the life cycle. This includes that conditions of safe use are established via risk assessments, documented and communicated to the downstream users of chemicals. This also applies to the environmental risks originating from downstream uses of chemicals, for instance, those from the industrial uses of adhesives and sealants. Upon application, these products form solid matrices with low emissions to the environment during the application. Hence, it is expected that environmental exposure is low, provided that good industrial practice is followed. To explore this, an environmental risk assessment for industrial uses of adhesives and sealants is performed for the environmentally most hazardous ingredients. These include several solvents, organotin catalysts, fillers, reactive resins, a pigment, and a preservative. Specific environmental release categories (SPERCs) developed by the Association of European Adhesives and Sealants Industries (FEICA) are used to derive emission estimates. In combination with multimedia fate modeling, the environmental risk in water, sediment, soil, and a sewage treatment plant is investigated. The assessment results indicate no environmental risk for any of the ingredients. The discussion evaluates the conservative nature of the assumed values of the use rates, the release factors, the fate modeling, and assessment factors. It concludes that their combination results in a sufficient degree of conservatism. In view of the conservative nature of the assessment and given that the worst-case ingredients of adhesives and sealants are sufficiently controlled under the generically defined use conditions, it is concluded that the SPERCs used represent safe conditions for use, irrespective of the ingredient substances of adhesives and sealants. The essential SPERC information elements are identified for the purpose of communicating the conditions of safe use. The consolidation of this information in safety data sheets for adhesives and sealants is discussed. Environ Assess Manag 2022;00:1-9. (c) 2021 FEICA aisbl.

AB  - Assessing soil quality indicators is essential for ecosystem function evaluation. This study aimed to compare soil quality indicators of semi-arid forests and rangelands with different condition classes using direct soil quality indicators and landscape function analysis (LFA). Vegetation and soil properties were studied in three forest sites with different densities and 16 rangeland sites. A total of 72 soil samples were collected from various land use/ cover types and their physical and chemical properties were measured. Eleven soil quality indicators were assessed from each patch and inter-patch zone along the established transects in each land use/cover type to obtain three functional indices including soil stability, infiltration, and nutrient cycling. The accuracy of the stability and infiltration indices of the LFA was verified by their correlations with some soil quality indicators. The results revealed a similar trend in soil quality indicators among the land use/cover types indicating that soil organic carbon (SOC), particulate soil organic matters (POM), mean weight diameter (MWD), soil stability index (SSI), and macronutrients had more appropriate conditions in rangelands with good conditions and dense forest sites compared to other land uses/covers. The soils in rangelands with poor conditions and sparse forests required substantial input of organic carbon to achieve an appropriate level of soil quality. The results highlighted the importance of SOC, POM, and soil texture for the prediction of aggregate stability in the region. The regression model showed a significant relationship between MWD and SSI. Moreover, nitrogen and SOC had significant relations with nutrient cycling and the relation between water dispersible clay and infiltration index was also significant (p < 0.01). The methods used in this study underscored the importance of conserving natural ecosystems. These methods can be implemented for assessing other semi-arid ecosystems. Holistic land management is required to conserve natural and productive ecosystems and to prevent soil degradation.

AB  - This review critically evaluates indicators of tidal wetland condition based on 36 indicator development studies and indicators developed as part of U.S. state tidal wetland monitoring programs. Individual metrics were evaluated based on relative scores on two sets of evaluation factors. A rigor score evaluated metric development based on conceptual relevance, indicator development method, degree of independent validation, and temporal and spatial extent tested. An applicability score evaluated metrics based on cost of data collection, probable spatial extent of applicability, technical complexity, and indicator responsiveness. The majority of indicators could be classified as biotic condition indicators (81%), with vegetation (37%) and macroinvertebrate (28%) metrics composing the largest proportion. Most metrics provided a conceptual model or scientific justification (97%), were developed by correlation to environmental gradients (46%), were tested over multiple seasons or years (49%) and at multiple sites (88%). Few were independently validated (18%). Average rigor score was 10 (on a scale of 0-25) and ranged between 1 and 21. Highest rigor scores were for trematode community metrics (community similarity index, species richness) and metrics of grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) individuals (gene expression, relative fecundity, embryo hatching success, larval survival). Most metrics had a high cost of data collection (63%), required field and laboratory processing (84%), would be applicable across the U.S. (72%), and were responsive to the variable of interest (44%). Mean applicability score was 4.9 (range: 2-8). Highest scores were found for metrics that only required field collection of data using simple or no instrumentation. Lowest scoring metrics required expensive equipment, specialized taxonomic knowledge, complex laboratory analysis, and/or culturing of organisms. Scores for individual metrics were grouped by indicator, then averaged and rescaled between 0 and 100 to provide a composite evaluation of the indicator they measured. Among major indicator types, biotic indicators had the highest rigor scores (mean =44, range 20-79), followed by indicators of chemical/physical characteristics (mean = 36, range 16-56), landscape condition (mean = 31, range 24-37), and hydrology/geomorphology indicators (mean = 21, range 4-52). In contrast, biotic indicators scored lowest for applicability (mean = 58, range 25-100) and indicators of landscape condition scored highest. The results of this review suggest that the development and selection of tidal wetland indicators could be vastly improved by employing a standardized development methodology that provides uniform information about each indicator. In addition, tidal wetland indicator research should focus on the development of indicators of ecological processes and disturbance regimes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Achieving good environmental status in the Baltic Sea region requires decision support tools which are based on scientific knowledge across multiple disciplines. Such tools should integrate the complexity of the ecosystem and enable exploration of different natural and anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, eutrophication and fishing pressures in order to compare alternative management strategies. We present a new framework, with a Baltic implementation of the spatially-explicit end-to-end Atlantis ecosystem model linked to two external models, to explore the different pressures on the marine ecosystem. The HBM-ERGOM initializes the Atlantis model with high-resolution physical-chemical-biological and hydrodynamic information while the FISHRENT model analyses the fisheries economics of the output of commercial fish biomass for the Atlantis terminal projection year. The Baltic Atlantis model composes 29 subareas, 9 vertical layers and 30 biological functional groups. The balanced calibration provides realistic levels of biomass for, among others, known stock sizes of top predators and of key fish species. Furthermore, it gives realistic levels of phytoplankton biomass and shows reasonable diet compositions and geographical distribution patterns for the functional groups. By simulating several scenarios of nutrient load reductions on the ecosystem and testing sensitivity to different fishing pressures, we show that the model is sensitive to those changes and capable of evaluating the impacts on different trophic levels, fish stocks, and fisheries associated with changed benthic oxygen conditions. We conclude that the Baltic Atlantis forms an initial basis for strategic management evaluation suited for conducting medium to long term ecosystem assessments which are of importance for a number of pan-Baltic stakeholders in relation to anthropogenic pressures such as eutrophication, climate change and fishing pressure, as well as changed biological interactions between functional groups.

KW  - RESPIRATION
KW  - EMBODIED ENERGY
AB  - The Maximum Respiration Hypothesis (MRH) asserts that matured ecosystems organize their configuration to maximize community respiration. Hence the object of the hypothesis is not individual living organisms but the whole ecosystem. In this paper we use two types of ecosystem models to show how the MRH works in ecosystems. The first is a simple theoretical model that consists of two compartments: a producer and a decomposer. The main results of this first model are as follows. (1) The model presents the community structure which is consistent with the MRH. (2) The dual solution (respiration values) presents the scarcities of different types of matter and energy in an ecosystem with maximal respiration. They operate as similar indicators to the inverse of buffer capacity. (3) The model, when extended to include two types of decomposers, can show the conditions of the coexistence and the competitive exclusion of components. Even if two biological components are strongly overlapping in their ecological niches, a slight differentiation of the ratio of matter exchanges can permit the coexistence. The competition and the coexistence are regulated by the imperative shown by the MRH. The second model is a simulation model for a hypothetical grassland ecosystem which consists of 19 biological components, and 15 kinds of matter and energy. The model includes a grazer system and a decomposer system. The main results are as follows. (1) The ecosystem configuration for biomass production, consumption, egestion, nutrient production, and respiration is presented under the MRH. It especially shows the dominance of the decomposer system. (2) Interspecific substitution guided by respiration values cause an increase in community respiration. If an inferior component undergoes a mutation to increase its production of net respiration value, the component may dominate its competitor and contribute to the increase in the community respiration. This means that the MRH can predict the working of natural selection from the macroscopic point of view.

AB  - In the managed mixed forests of Europe, Prunus serotina increases its territory easily and gradually becomes the predominant component of the shrub layer. However, its impact on species diversity in the invaded stands remains a matter of debate. To assess the relationship between the black cherry and the understorey plant community, 120 releves of comparable habitat properties but of variable intensity of infestation by P. serotina were made in three forest districts in south-western Poland, where the plant has been present for more than 50 years. Habitat features were estimated indirectly for study plots using selected Ellenberg's species indicator values (nitrogen availability, soil reaction, soil moisture and light conditions). The forest floor of the areas infested with black cherry showed higher proportions of certain plant species with higher requirements for nitrogen supply, soil reaction and moisture content. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation has been found between the abundance of P. serotina and the species richness of the understorey. Also in multiple regression analysis black cherry occurring in the shrub layer has appeared as the variable significantly related to the decrease of species number. Despite those established relationships, feeding species composition data into the redundancy analysis (RDA) procedure showed that the black cherry's impact on the herb and moss layer explained only a limited proportion of the general variance. Therefore, it is likely that the effect of P. serotina on the native species composition in different forest stands is significantly modified by a set of site-specific environmental variables, interacting with a number of disturbances caused by natural factors and human activity.

Previous local-scale studies have provided evidence that the expansion of Phragmites is facilitated by disturbance and increased nitrogen (N) associated with agricultural and urban-suburban (developed) land uses along wetland-upland borders. We tested the generality of previous findings across a larger spatial scale and wider range of environmental conditions in Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuarine ecosystem in the USA. We sampled 90 tidal wetlands nested within 30 distinct subestuarine watersheds and examined the relationship between land use and Phragmites abundance and foliar N, an indicator of nitrogen availability. We estimated land use adjacent to wetland borders and within subestuary watersheds and explored the importance of spatial proximity by weighting land use by its distance from the wetland border or subestuary shoreline, respectively. Regression tree and changepoint analyses revealed that Phragmites abundance sharply increased in almost every wetland where development adjacent to borders exceeded 15%. Where development was < 15% but natural land cover at the near the subestuary shoreline was low (< similar to 35%), Phragmites was abundant, suggesting that wetlands in highly modified watersheds also were susceptible to invasion, regardless of land use adjacent to wetlands. Phragmites foliar N was markedly elevated in watersheds with > 14-22% shoreline development, the same level of development that corresponded to high levels of invasion. Our results suggest that development near wetlands is at least partially responsible for patterns of invasion across Chesapeake Bay. Larger-scale phenomena, such as nitrogen pollution at the watershed-subestuary scale, also may be facilitating invasion. Urbanization near coastlines appears to play an important role in the invasion success of Phragmites in coastal wetlands of Chesapeake Bay and probably much of eastern North America.

AB  - The maintenance of multifunctional landscapes is essential for halting biodiversity loss and maintaining a balanced supply of ecosystem services. Policies of the European Union aim at achieving these goals, e.g. by designating protected areas, supporting organic farming or establishing other agri-environmental measures. We analysed the extent to which the application of such regulatory and incentive schemes relates to the supply of ecosystem services at municipal level. Our study focussed on two neighbouring counties in Germany (Wetterau and Vogelsberg, Federal State of Hesse) with contrasting environmental and socioeconomic conditions. Based on indicators for six individual ecosystem services derived from a suite of spatially explicit models, we obtained estimates of total ecosystem service supply (Total Ecosystem Service Value, TESV) as well as indicators for the balance in supply of different ecosystem service categories (ecosystem service clusters). Indicators for total ecosystem service supply as well as for the balance in supply of different service categories showed significant correlations with indicators for efforts made to maintain high and balanced levels of ecosystem service supply. The mechanisms causing the matching spatial patterns of the indicators are likely to differ for regulatory and incentive schemes. Natura 2000 areas are designated where habitats and species of conservation concern occur, and these areas provide co-benefits for balanced ecosystem service supply. The low uptake in highly productive landscapes, by contrast, suggests that agri-environmental measures currently do not motivate farmers to provide a broader portfolio of ecosystem services. At municipal level, indicators for both ecosystem services and policy tools provide valuable insights into the structure of regional socio-ecological systems. Incentive schemes aiming at stimulating high and balanced provision of ecosystem services in productive landscapes need to integrate socio-economic information on the factors driving decision-making by farmers and land managers.

AB  - Political ecology pushes back against the apolitical and ahistorical ecologies frequently found in mainstream scientific accounts of nature and the environment, and has increasingly focused on how scientific knowledge is 'socially constructed.' In this article, we argue for political ecological engagement with the highly influential knowledge-to-action (KTA) movement in science about health and the environment. We introduce KTA using results of a survey conducted under the auspices of a Canada-Latin America-Caribbean 'ecosystem approaches to health' (ecohealth) collaboration, and then narrow our focus to a single illustrative ecohealth project, dealing with the health impacts of small-scale gold mining in southwestern Ecuador. We employ an ecology of knowledge framework for integrating insights from science and technology studies,illustrating the interacting actors, material artifacts, institutions and discourses involved in not only the generation but also the application of health-environment science. The origins of ecohealth research in the Americas reflect interacting epistemological and political factors, as sophisticated, complex systemic analyses of health-environment interactions occurred amidst increasing neoliberalization of knowledge production. Simultaneously, corporate actors such as large mining companies influenced both the distribution of healthdamaging environmental conditions in the Americas, and the ways in which they were studied. This analysis motivates our advocacy of specifically political ecologies of health-environment knowledge, in which inequitable power dynamics and non-human actors are foregrounded in studies of the social production and application of science. The political ecology of knowledge framework that we envision would allow for simultaneous consideration of how societal contexts influence scientific knowledge production, and how the resulting knowledge can be better applied to protect the health of communities facing environmental injustice.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Lake Vrana is shallow, Mediterranean, karstic lake, where water salinity is as an important ecological factor, because the lake is directly connected with the Adriatic Sea. Studies concerning zooplankton communities in these ecosystems are very scarce. To understand this very specific and unique ecosystem, the physical and chemical parameters and the makrozooplankton community structure in Lake Vrana were studied.
   Material and Methods: The investigation was conducetd monthly from January till December 2004 at four stations with different ecological characteristics (primarily depth, salinity, hydrology, nutrients supply). Chlorophyll a concentration was analyzed fluorometrically according to Method 445.0. Physical and chemical parameters (temperature, transparency, chlorinity, salinity, biological oxygen demand - BOD, dissolved oxygen - DO, ortho-phosphate, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a) were measured according to APHA. Data on environmental variables and makrozooplankton community were examined using Redundancy Analysis (RDA).
   Results: Among the 13 different species which are found in macrozooplankton community of Lake Vrana, the dominant species were Calanipeda aquedulcis Kritchagin (Copepoda), and Bosmina longirostris O.F. Muller, (Cladocera) which were present in all four stations during study period. The same occurring had Megacyclops gigas Claus, Alona sp., Alonella excisa Fischer, and Chydorus sphaericus O.F. Muller while other species appeared sporadically.
   The physical-chemical parameters showed temporal and spatial variations in Lake Vrana during study period resulting in different micro-habitat conditions on the studied sites. That is confirmed by the results of the RDA analysis that clearly shows the separation of stations due to the impact of studied indicators. According to multivariate analysis temperature, chlorophyll a and salinity have great influence on dynamics and structure of makrozooplankton in Lake Vrana.
   Conclusions: Temperature, chlorophyll a and salinity are ecological factors which define the development as well as dynamics and structure of macrozooplankton community in the Vrana Lake.

AB  - This is the first assessment of naturalised, invasive and potentially invasive alien plant species present in Laikipia County, Kenya, which hosts the highest populations of endangered large mammals in the country. We undertook broad-scale roadside surveys in Laikipia, recording all naturalised and invasive species, and based on an extensive literature review, also compiled a list of those alien species present that are known to threaten biodiversity and livelihoods elsewhere in the world. The data were supplemented by CLIMEX eco-climatic niche models of nine species that we consider to pose the biggest threat to conservation initiatives in the East African region. Of the 145 alien plant species recorded, 67 and 37 (including four species of uncertain origin) were considered to be already naturalised or invasive, respectively, and a further 41 species had been recorded as being naturalised or invasive outside of Laikipia. Most (141) of these species were introduced as ornamentals only or had uses in addition to being ornamentals, with the majority (77) having their origins in tropical America. Widespread species in the county included Opuntia stricta, O. ficus-indica, Austrocylindropuntia subulata and other succulents. Based on the current eco-climatic conditions, most of Laikipia is unsuitable for Chromolaena odorata, marginally suitable for Mimosa pigra and Lantana camara, and a better climatic match, ranked from least to most favourable, for Tithonia diversifolia, Cryptostegia grandiflora, Parthenium hysterophorus, Prosopis juliflora, O. stricta and Parkinsonia aculeata.
   Conservation implications: Invasive alien plants are known to have negative impacts on biodiversity, and as such pose significant threats to protected area ecosystems worldwide. Without efforts to eradicate, contain or control invasive plant species in Laikipia, one of the most important conservation areas in eastern Africa many rare and iconic wildlife species may be lost.

AB  - 1. Rwanda, a small but rapidly developing central African nation, has undertaken development of natural capital accounts to better inform its economic development through the World Bank's Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES) Partnership. In this paper, we develop ecosystem service (ES) models to quantify ecosystem condition and physical supply components of ecosystem accounts in Rwanda from 1990 to 2015.
   2. We applied the InVEST carbon storage, sediment delivery ratio, nutrient delivery ratio, and annual and seasonal water yield models to map changes in potential ES supply nationwide. We also quantified flows of sediment, water and nutrients to 96 hydroelectric dam, irrigation dam and water treatment plant sites.
   3. Over a 25-year period, we found declines in all ES, which were most strongly driven by conversion of forests to cropland. Declines were most pronounced from 1990 to 2000 and 2010 to 2015; ES were relatively stable from 2000 to 2010 (with the exception of nutrient exports to water bodies, which jumped most sharply from 2000 to 2010). From 2010 to 2015, over 42% of Rwanda's water-use sites (representing 9% of the nation's hydroelectric generation capacity and 59% of its water treatment capacity) had upstream increases in sediment export and quick flow greater than the national average. Half of Rwanda's water treatment plants had upstream phosphorus exports greater than the national average.
   4. Our results quantify nation-wide ES trends, their implications for key water-dependent industries, and the importance of protected areas in safeguarding ES flows and potential supply in Rwanda. They also provide data that can be integrated with existing land, water and economic accounts for Rwanda, as well as a baseline to inform development strategies that better link economic and environmental goals.

AB  - Biodiversity is expected to be an assurance for the maintenance of agroecosystem, being fundamental to preserve basic ecosystem services (ESS). To examine in depth this topic, the present research aimed at: a) evaluating environmental sustainability by measuring the efficiency of some key ESS in agroecosystems with different management; b) searching for relationships among biodiversity groups and ESS and c) exploring the existence of correlations between different bioindication methodologies. The starting hypothesis was that a high ESS efficiency can improve environmental sustainability of agroecosystems. ESS were studied by using several belowground (hypogean) and aboveground (epigeal) bioindicators associated to the functional biodiversity, which guarantees these useful services to crops: earthworms, mesofauna, soil bacteria and fungi, key predators (including carabids) and parasitoids, crop weeds and field margin vegetation. The fieldwork was carried out during 2012-2013 in five organic and five conventional horticultural fields (Venice and Treviso provinces, Italy). After sampling using standard techniques with the aim to investigate the biodiversity guilds, other innovative methodologies were exploited to measure environmental functionality, such as indexes, functional tests and application of devices. Results indicate that some bioindicators (predators and parasitoids) are more sensitive, than others (phytophagous and weeds). Biodiversity within each bioindicator group, described with classical diversity indexes, was not associated to ESS efficiency. Organic agroecosystems, in comparison with conventional ones, demonstrated to have more efficient ESS both in the belowground and in the aboveground sectors and therefore this farming system could be considered more sustainable from an environmental perspective. Finally a wide number of pairwise correlations emerged between many of the analysed indicators (biotic and functional), including crop nutritional properties: these evidences offer workable proxies to monitor agroecosystem conditions.

AB  - Parasites have been recognized as indicators for natural or man-induced environmental stress and perturbation. In this article, we investigated the role of two non-exclusive hypotheses on the response of helminths of wood mice to fire perturbation: 1) a reduction of the helminth infracommunity (species richness) in post-fire areas due to the temporal lack of worms with indirect (complex) life cycles linked to intermediate hosts that are more specialized than the final host, and 2) an increase of the abundance of helminths with direct (simple) life cycles as a response of increasing abundances of the final host, may be in stressful conditions linked to the post-fire recolonization process.
   We studied the helminth infracommunities of 97 wood mice in two recently burned plots (two years after the fire) and two control plots in Mediterranean forests of NE Spain. Species richness of helminths found in control plots (n = 14) was twice large than in burned ones (n = 7). Six helminth species were negatively affected by fire perturbation and were mainly or only found in unburned plots. Fire increased the homogeneity of helminth infracommunities, and burned plots were characterised by higher dominance, and higher parasitation intensity. We found a gradient of frequency of occurrence of helminth species according to life cycle complexity in burned areas, being more frequent monoxenous (66.6 %), than diheteroxenous (33.3 %) and triheteroxenous (0 %), confirming the utility of helminths as bioindicators for ecosystem perturbations. Despite the short period studied, our results pointed out an increase in the abundance and prevalence of some direct life cycle helminths in early postfire stages, whereas indirect life cycle helminths were almost absent. A mismatch between the final host (that showed a fast recovery shortly after the fire), and the intermediate hosts (that showed slow recoveries shortly after the fire), was responsible for the loss of half of the helminth species.

AB  - New insights into the sustainable use of natural resources in human systems can be gained through comparison with ecosystems via common indices. In both kinds of system, resources are processed by a number of users within a network, but we consider ecosystems as the only ones displaying sustainable patterns of growth and development. This study aims at using Network Analysis (NA) to move such "ecosystem perspective" from theory into practice. A Danish municipal Water Management System (WMS) is used as case study to test the NA methodology and to discuss its generic applicability. We identified water users within the WMS and represented their interactions as a network of water flows. We computed intensive and extensive indices of system-level performance for seven different network configurations illustrating past conditions (2004-2008) and future scenarios (2015 and 2020). We also computed the same indices for other 24 human systems and for 12 ecosystems, by using information from the existing scientific literature on NA. The comparison of these results reveals that the WMS is similar to the other human systems and that human systems generally differ from ecosystems. The WMS is highly efficient at processing the water resource, but the rigid and almost linear structure makes it vulnerable in situations of stress such as heavy rain events. The analysis of future scenarios showed a trend towards increased sustainability, but differences between past and expected future performance of the VVMS are marginal. We argue that future interventions should create alternative pathways for reusing rainwater within the WMS, increasing its potential to withstand the occurrence of flooding. We discuss advantages, limitations, and general applicability of NA as a tool for assessing environmental sustainability in human systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pesticide loads in streams are potentially one of the most relevant stressors for macroinvertebrate communities. Nevertheless, real effects provoked at the community level are still largely unknown. Model ecosystems are frequently used as tools for the risk assessment of pesticides, especially for their regulation, however, they can be also applied to site-specific risk assessment in order to gain better understanding of the responses of aquatic ecosystems to chemical stress. In the present work, an experimental system was composed of 5 artificial streams that reproduced a mountain lotic environment under controlled conditions. This study was aimed to better understand, whether (and how) the biological community was influenced by pesticides pulse exposures. 5 mixture load events were simulated over the productive season (March-July 2010): biological community was regularly sampled and nominal concentrations of water were tested. The results were interpreted comparing the output of different metrics and statistical methodologies. The sensitivity of different metrics was analyzed considering single exposure events (maximum Toxic Units) as well as overall temporal trends. Results showed how some common taxonomic metrics (e.g. taxa richness, Shannon's index, total abundance of organisms, and the Extended Biotic Index) were not suitable to identify the effects of pesticides at community level. On the contrary EPT%, SPEAR(pesticide) and the Principal Response Curve methodology proved to be sensitive to this kind of stress, providing comparable results. Temporal trends of these metrics proved to be related to the concentration of chemicals. Remarkably, the first Principal Response Curve illustrates the trend followed by the most vulnerable species, while the second is more related to the trend of opportunistic species. A high potential risk for the invertebrate community was highlighted by a statistically significant decline of 40 points (comparison with the control) in both SPEAR(pesticide) and EPT%.

AB  - Due to freshwater supplement scarcity and heavy human activities, the fresh water wetland ecosystem in Yellow River Delta is facing disintegrated deterioration, and it is seriously affecting the health of the Yellow River ecosystem. This paper identifies the restoration objectives of wetland aiming to protect ecological and economic values and development as well as the water resources of the Yellow River. The hydraulic and groundwater coupling model and Landscape Ecological Decision and Evaluation Support System (LEDESS) of the Yellow River Delta were established to calculate environmental flows of degraded wetlands. LEDESS is a computer-based model developed and used to assess and evaluate the effects of land-use changes on nature. In this study, LEDESS is used to assess and evaluate the ecological effects and the restoration possibilities considering several environmental flows' supplement scenarios. This included the changes of suitable habitat conditions and its ecological carrying capacities for indicator species, e. g., Red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis), Oriental stork (Ciconia boyciana), and Saunder's gull (Larus relictus), and changing of ecological patterns. The results showed that replenishing fresh water to wetlands is one of the effective adaptive measures to mitigate wetland degradation and improve its habitat quality and carrying capacities. This study indicated that landscape ecology approach is not only considered as a good way to solve complex problems in ecosystem management but also can be used to decide on the environmental flows and assess its ecological effects in large-scale wetland rehabilitation. This integrated method could make environmental flows estimated and assessment more rational than the results of hydrologic methods. It could assist decision makers to "see" the ecological effects after water supplementing and so alleviate the contradictions between environmental flows and production water demands, and can facilitate the implementation of environmental flows in most countries with water resources shortage.

AB  - The renewed interest in biomass-derived energy, which was the main source of heat and power until the industrial revolution and still contributes a significant portion to energy consumption in the developing world, is based on the premises that bioenergy can serve to reduce dependence on foreign energy supplies, boost and reduce the volatility of farmers' incomes, develop a sustainable renewable energy basis, and cut greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. Growing urgency to address these problems and the European Union's global leadership role motivate the baseline assessment of the potential for sustainable bioenergy production in the most recent two EU member states (Bulgaria and Romania) and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia and the Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan. Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) by reviewing the literature and drawing on available data. The paper integrates the monitoring and assessment of ecological and environmental indicators with management practices, and shows that there is still a lack of knowledge and approaches at this nexus. The main factors to be considered by the countries included in our study are: the type of energy carrier, the transportation and production processes, as well as the long-term environmental impacts associated with intensive biomass production. Specifically, the baseline assessment is using typical indicators to describe bioenergy carriers and their production and consumption in thermal or mass units as well as in percentage shares of total renewable energy produced or consumed. Our findings indicate that the potential for developing sustainable bioenergy production is generally small but with considerable cross-country variation. Only Bulgaria, Romania, and Kazakhstan are endowed with the necessary natural, climatic, and economic conditions to develop sustainable biomass product ions and markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A newly developed indicator of the pesticide risk for aquatic biocenosis in surface water bodies is applied within an economic sector model, and is used to evaluate alternative designs for an environmental policy programme. For rural districts ('Landkreise') across Germany, different widths of riparian buffer zones adjacent to surface water bodies are evaluated in terms of efficient cost/risk ratios.
   The indicator is defined as acute risk under worst-case input conditions and is based on combining a sectoral model, a national survey on pesticide use and a toxicological risk assessment model. The nationwide survey provides data on pesticide use by agricultural crop. On this basis, crop-specific risk indices for aquatic biocenosis are calculated by means of eco-toxic criteria for indicator organisms and aggregated through crop patterns to the rural-district level. GIS is used to calculate the influences of natural site factors (e.g. soil types. land use distance to water bodies, etc.) on pesticide input in surface water and to calculate the regional risk potentials at regional level.
   An economic cost-impact analysis is conducted based on the new indicator. Opportunity costs of converting agricultural land to riparian buffer strips are estimated using the agricultural sector model RAUMIS, for buffer strip widths of 3.30 and 50 m, as per the European the environmental programme EC 99/1257/EEC. These costs are then compared with estimated risk reduction potentials at the regional level of administrative districts. Results show that cost-impact ratios are most efficient for 3 m buffer strips and in those regions with the lowest costs from changing agricultural land use (e.g. through reduced livestock production). A major furore research need in this area is a higher spatial resolution at the grid-level. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) has emerged as an important and cost-effective climate change mitigation strategy internationally. In many localities around the world, REDD+ and related interventions have been superimposed on, and overlap with, existing decentralized institutional arrangements such as community forests. These interventions often modify local institutions through new rules and practices that comply with mostly carbon-related objectives, prompting questions about the compatibility of a top-down mechanism such as REDD+ with the decentralized approaches of community forestry. Thus, we asked: are REDD+ interventions in community forests enhancing or detracting from communities' abilities to practice adaptive management and governance-key desired components of local social-ecological resilience and the ability of communities to respond to disturbance and global change? We conducted a systematic review of studies examining REDD+ interventions in community forests. We extracted data on 59 case studies reported on in 43 articles, stemming from 14 countries, with two thirds of the cases located in two countries alone. Our meta-analysis found that REDD+ has had mixed impacts on communities' social-ecological resilience. Increases in network ties, connectivity across scales, and increased participation in decision making are indicators of enhanced potential for local adaptability. However, we also see that, through restrictions on local forest practices, rigidity in rules, and communities' natural capital being locked into carbon contracts, REDD+ has limited communities' ability to manage for uncertainty. While not representative of all existing REDD+ projects, our results suggest important implications for REDD+ policymakers and forest-reliant communities engaging in REDD+. Reconciling REDD+ goals with the need for forest communities to retain adaptive capacity will be a challenge moving forward, particularly if REDD+ compromises the ability of forest-reliant communities to respond to unexpected shocks or their ability to adapt to changing environmental or economic conditions.

AB  - In recent decades, much of the progress observed in the study of beaches to aid policy has focused on producing sound substantive and/or contextual knowledge. However, attention has not usually been paid to the procedural manner in which it has been produced. Guided by an open learning process, this study aims to develop and present an expanded reviewed assessment of the Catalan coast operationalized by means of the Double-Looped Beach Quality Index (DL-BQI). Such openness helps us to understand which narratives of beach management in Catalonia are operating (and which are excluded), the extent to which they are unfolding, and the capacity of the DL-BQI to provide information for policymaking. Data collection enabled assessment of 96 representative beaches on the Catalan coast, that may find correspondence with other geographic locations. Both the instrument used for the assessment - the DL-BQI - and its results were co-evaluated at a multi-stakeholder meeting. In general, beaches have mainly been conditioned to supply elements for tourism and leisure. Different pressures have arisen from the orientation towards such activities, usually according to beach type, most of them negatively impacting the ecological assets and natural heritage of beaches. The economic growth narrative, albeit predominant, was shown to be deficient for tackling complex coastal problems, i.e. intensifying ecological deterioration. Alternatively, the study shows the importance for regional coastal policy of considering the value of beaches as natural systems, as advocated, to a greater or lesser extent, by the narratives of sustainability, environmental protection and integrated coastal zone management. This research innovates on considering substantive, contextual and procedural dimensions of knowledge quality for the governance of beach systems, by relating dimensions, narratives and outcomes.

AB  - Many streams in the extensive Central European region have an intermittent flow regime. Conventional hydrological methods used to identify zero-flow conditions, and in particular drying events, have limited use when assessing large areas dominated by low-order streams. We developed a novel multimetric index to recognise antecedent stream drying based on the analysis of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. The data used to develop the index were collected in pristine streams with different flow permanence regimes between 2012 and 2014, using standard sampling methods for ecological status assessment. The data include 64 perennial, 19 near-perennial and 27 intermittent benthic macroinvertebrate samples. Metrics considered for the index included variables based on (i) the occurrence of indicator taxa, (ii) the proportion of biological and ecological traits, and (iii) structural community metrics. Linear discriminant analysis identified the metric combinations that best discriminated among the three flow permanence categories. Different metrics were used in the final multimetric index calculation for the autumn and spring season that followed stream drying. In both seasons, the index included the proportion of indicator taxa and the proportion of taxa with high body flexibility. In addition, the autumn index included the proportion of taxa with a preference for organic substrates, whereas in spring the index included total abundance. Independent data from regulatory monitoring activity were used to validate the accuracy of the index. The correct classification of independent samples was 92% and 96% for samples from perennial and non-perennial sites, respectively. The index can be calculated using data collected by routine monitoring programmes used to assess ecological status and provides information about stream intermittence where conventional hydrological monitoring is limited. As intermittent streams increase in extent in global regions including Central Europe, the tool may be of particular interest to those who use invertebrates to monitor or manage these ecosystems.

AB  - Pesticides are a major burden for stream ecosystems in the central European cultivated landscape. The objective of the present study was to investigate the applicability of ecological indicator methods in relation to toxicity of pesticides under the specific hydro-morphological conditions in small water bodies. Thus, an association of toxicity evaluating methods with different ecological indicators was to be attempted. Based on three random samples taken within the 2016 vegetation period, 23 headwater areas in the Saarland were investigated to test for pesticides and their metabolites. The macroinvertebrate population was also surveyed in 16 of these streams. Evidence was found of 41 substances in total. Most dominant substances include atrazine, isoproturone, quinmerac and tebuconazol as well as metabolites of dimethenamid, chloridazon and metazachlor. At 9 of the 23 sampling points, over 10 plant protection products and metabolites were found. Only 17% of the water bodies investigated contained fewer than 5 substances. Around half of the bodies of water investigated show noticeably high concentrations of metabolites of plant protection products. Maximum concentrations exceeding environmental quality standards or the Health-oriented Guideline Values were measured for 13 substances at individual sampling points.
   Analysis of the biological data for only 4 of the water bodies investigated resulted in the Ecological Status Class (ESC) "good". All others fell short of the quality target, although they were classified as "good" or "very good" according to the Saprobic index. SPEAR(pesticides) as a measurement of the sensitivity of the biocoenosis to pesticides shows their influence in a few water bodies. Likewise, high toxic unit values have also been calculated, indicating the presence of toxic substances at relevant concentrations. However, an actual correlation between SPEAR(pesticides) and toxic unit could not be derived. Clearly in these very headwater streams other habitatdetermining hydromorphological factors overlay the toxic impact of pesticides. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper will argue that understanding animal welfare and the individual vulnerability to stress-related disease requires a fundamental understanding of functional individual variation as it occurs in nature as well as the underlying neurobiology and neuroendocrinology. Ecological studies in feral populations of mice, fish, and birds start to recognize the functional significance of phenotypes that individually differ in their behavioral and neuroendocrine response to environmental challenge. Recent studies indicate that the individual variation within a species may buffer the species for strong fluctuations in the natural habitat. Similarly, evolutionary ancient behavioral trait characteristics have now been identified in a range of domestic farm animals including cattle, pigs, and horses. Individual variation in behavior can be summarized in a 3-dimensional model with coping style, emotionality, and sociality as independent dimensions. These dimensions can be considered trait characteristics that are stable over time and across situations within the individual. This conceptual model has several consequences. First, the coping style dimension is strongly associated with differential stress vulnerability. Social stress studies show that proactive individuals are resilient under stable environmental conditions but vulnerable when outcome expectancies are violated. Reactive individuals are, in fact, rather flexible and seem to adapt more easily to a changing environment. A second consequence relates to genetics and breeding. Genetic selection for one trait usually implies selection for other traits as well. It is discussed that a more balanced breeding program that takes into account biologically functional temperamental traits will lead to more robust domestic farm animals. Finally, the relationship between temperamental traits, animal production, fitness, and welfare is discussed.

AB  - The use of biomass as feedstock for energy is often associated with increased claims on land, competition with food production and impacts on other ecosystem services. Studies on sustainability aspects of bioenergy production often indicate biodiversity as a key concern. This article presents a first comprehensive review of published impacts of bioenergy crop production on biodiversity, evaluates the drivers and pressures of biodiversity change and summarizes current trends and impacts. The review provides insight into the types of biodiversity indicators applied under a range of conditions and the mitigating measures proposed to minimize negative impacts or realize biodiversity benefits. The 53 selected publications give diverse results that are explained by the various spatial scales, production systems and regions, time horizons, methodologies and biodiversity indicators used. Reported impacts depend on initial land use and are mostly negative, especially in tropical regions. The impacts of second generation bioenergy crops tend to be less negative than first generation ones, and are in some cases positive (at the field level), in particular in temperate regions. Land-use change appears as the key driver of biodiversity change, whereas the associated habitat loss, alterations in species richness and abundance are the main impacts addressed. Such changes are often paired with the (initiation of a) process of biological homogenization. The article confirms that concerns about the expansion of bioenergy crop production not only relate to the direct effects on biodiversity by replacing natural vegetation, but increasingly to indirect effects as well. These effects have, however, shown to be difficult to quantify. At the same time, the land sparing vs. land sharing debate receives growing attention, whereas little evidence exists in bioenergy literature on the impacts of large-scale application of these strategies on (agro)biodiversity. Following the findings of the review, the article finally provides recommendations for future research.

AB  - Background: Accumulating evidence shows that the planet is warming as a response to human emissions of greenhouse gases. Strategies of adaptation to climate change will require quantitative projections of how altered regional patterns of temperature, precipitation and sea level could cascade to provoke local impacts such as modified water supplies, increasing risks of coastal flooding, and growing challenges to sustainability of native species.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We linked a series of models to investigate responses of California's San Francisco Estuary-Watershed (SFEW) system to two contrasting scenarios of climate change. Model outputs for scenarios of fast and moderate warming are presented as 2010-2099 projections of nine indicators of changing climate, hydrology and habitat quality. Trends of these indicators measure rates of: increasing air and water temperatures, salinity and sea level; decreasing precipitation, runoff, snowmelt contribution to runoff, and suspended sediment concentrations; and increasing frequency of extreme environmental conditions such as water temperatures and sea level beyond the ranges of historical observations.
   Conclusions/Significance: Most of these environmental indicators change substantially over the 21(st) century, and many would present challenges to natural and managed systems. Adaptations to these changes will require flexible planning to cope with growing risks to humans and the challenges of meeting demands for fresh water and sustaining native biota. Programs of ecosystem rehabilitation and biodiversity conservation in coastal landscapes will be most likely to meet their objectives if they are designed from considerations that include: (1) an integrated perspective that river-estuary systems are influenced by effects of climate change operating on both watersheds and oceans; (2) varying sensitivity among environmental indicators to the uncertainty of future climates; (3) inevitability of biological community changes as responses to cumulative effects of climate change and other drivers of habitat transformations; and (4) anticipation and adaptation to the growing probability of ecosystem regime shifts.

AB  - The prospective aquatic environmental risk assessment (ERA) of pesticides is generally based on the comparison of predicted environmental concentrations in edge-of-field surface waters with regulatory acceptable concentrations derived from laboratory and/or model ecosystem experiments with aquatic organisms. New improvements in mechanistic effect modeling have allowed a better characterization of the ecological risks of pesticides through the incorporation of biological trait information and landscape parameters to assess individual, population and/or community-level effects and recovery. Similarly to exposure models, ecological models require scenarios that describe the environmental context in which they are applied. In this article, we propose a conceptual framework for the development of ecological scenarios that, when merged with exposure scenarios, will constitute environmental scenarios for prospective aquatic ERA. These unified environmental scenarios are defined as the combination of the biotic and abiotic parameters that are required to characterize exposure, (direct and indirect) effects, and recovery of aquatic nontarget species under realistic worst-case conditions. Ideally, environmental scenarios aim to avoid a potential mismatch between the parameter values and the spatial-temporal scales currently used in aquatic exposure and effect modeling. This requires a deeper understanding of the ecological entities we intend to protect, which can be preliminarily addressed by the formulation of ecological scenarios. In this article we present a methodological approach for the development of ecological scenarios and illustrate this approach by a case-study for Dutch agricultural ditches and the example focal species Sialis lutaria. Finally, we discuss the applicability of ecological scenarios in ERA and propose research needs and recommendations for their development and integration with exposure scenarios.

AB  - Despite devastating effects on global biodiversity, efficient mitigation strategies against amphibian chytridiomycosis are lacking. Since the free-living pathogenic zoospores of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the infective stage of this disease, can serve as a nutritious food source for components of zooplankton communities, these groups may act as biological control agents by eliminating zoospores from the aquatic environment. Such pathogen-predator interaction is, however, embedded in the aquatic food web structure and is therefore affected by abiotic factors interfering with these networks. Heavy metals, released from both natural and anthropogenic sources, are widespread contaminants of aquatic ecosystems and may interfere with planktonic communities and thus pathogen elimination rates. We investigated the interaction between zooplankton communities and chytridiomycosis infections in a Flemish agricultural region. Moreover, we also investigated the impact of heavy metal contamination, that was previously investigated in the region and presented in recent work, on zooplankton assemblages and chytridiomycosis infections. Finally, we tested the effect of sublethal concentrations of copper and zinc on Bd removal rates by Daphnia magna in a laboratory assay. Although zinc, copper, nickel and chromium were widely abundant pollutants, heavy metals were no driving force for zooplankton assemblages at our study locations. Moreover, our field survey did not reveal indirect effects of zooplankton assemblages on chytridiomycosis infections. However, sampling occasions testing negative for Bd showed a higher degree of copper contamination compared to positive sampling occasions, indicating a potential inhibitory effect of copper on Bd prevalence. Finally, whereas D. magna significantly reduced zoospore densities in its environment, sublethal concentrations of copper and zinc showed no interference with pathogen removal in the laboratory assay. Our results provide perspectives for further research on such a biological control strategy against chytridiomycosis by optimizing environmental conditions for pathogen predation.

AB  - Non-predatory dead variability in zooplankton remains poorly quantified worldwide. Here, we make the first estimation of the percentage of dead organisms in coastal zooplankton communities in the Humboldt Current System (HCS) under in situ conditions. The study was conducted in four coastal sites of the southern HCS (between 36 and 37 degrees S) over a period of one year. Percentages of dead organisms were based on the classification as live or dead of 158,220 holoplankton and 17,591 meroplankton individuals using neutral red staining technique. The percentage of dead organisms in total-zooplankton was between 4.3% in Coronel Bay (summer) and 76.9% in Llico (autumn). The percentage of dead total-holoplankton varied from 4.2% (Itata River Mouth; autumn) to 77.6% (Llico; autumn), while the percentage of dead total-meroplankton ranged from 1.5% to 56.8% in Coronel Bay and Coliumo Bay, respectively. The most abundant taxa analyzed were the copepods Acartia sp., Paracalanus sp., Calanoides sp., Cladocera, Polychaeta, and the eggs of anchoveta Engraulis ringers. Among these taxa, there was a high degree of interspecific variability in the estimation of the dead organisms. The Pearson correlation shows significant relationships between maximum temperature, and minimum salinity, with the percentage of dead individuals of Acartia sp. and Paracalanus sp. Environmental factors explaining those relationships were: the El Nino 2015-2016 event, and freshwater river runoff. The use of vital staining to estimate non-predatory death for total-zooplankton and selected sentinel species is a promising tool to establish baselines to evaluate natural perturbations (e.g. ENSO), and anthropogenic alterations in coastal pelagic ecosystems.

AB  - Geochemical characteristics of stream sediments [n =31; Upstream section: Zahuapan River (1-12) and Atoyac River (13-20); Downstream section (21-31)] from Atoyac River basin of Central Mexico have been evaluated. The study focuses on the textural, petrography and chemical composition of the fluvial sediments with the aim of analyzing their provenance, the chemical weathering signature and their potential environmental effects. The fluvial sediments are mostly composed of sand and silt sized particles dominated by plagioclase, pyroxenes, amphiboles, K-feldspar, biotite, opaque and quartz. The sediments were analyzed for determination of major (Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Na, K, P, Si, Ti), trace elements (As, Ba, Be, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sc, V, Y, Zn, Zr, Ga) and compared with Upper continental crust (UCC), source area composition and local background values. The elemental concentrations were comparable with the average andesite and dacitic composition of the source area and the local background values except for enrichment of Cu (56.27 ppm), Pb (34 ppm) and Zn (235.64 ppm) in the downstream sediments suggesting a significant external influence (anthropogenic). The fluvial sediments of Atoyac River basin display low CIA and PIA values implying predominantly weak to moderate weathering conditions in the source region. Based on the provenance discrimination diagrams and elemental ratios, it is understood that the collected sediments are derived from intermediate to felsic volcanic rocks dominated in the study region.

AB  - Headwater streams are the smallest parts of rivers but make up the majority of river miles. The chemistry and macroinvertebrate composition of such streams are among the most important indicators of their environmental health. Macroinvertebrates are affected namely by runoff genesis and, in many regions of the world, also by acid atmospheric deposition and its consequences. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of an extreme summer flash flood on the physical environment, chemistry and macroinvertebrates in a small headwater stream located in the Beech-woods National Nature Reserve of the Jizera Mts. (Northern Bohemia, Czech Republic). The studied stream is characterized by a pluvial hydrologic regime with perennial streamflow uniformly distributed within the year, with peak-flows originating mainly from summer rainstorms, and moderate current anthropogenic acidification. During the observed summer flash flood of the return period near 1,000 years, high currents (1-2.5 m s(-1)) flushed out 2.7 m(3) of sand and gravel from the streambed, resulting in a devastating effect on macroinvertebrates. Both number of species/taxa and diversity were reduced by about 50% while the abundance of surviving taxa was reduced to about 10% compared with before the flood. The following spring after the event, both number of species/taxa, diversity and abundance increased, partially due to the temporary unsuccessful colonization of the site by several alien species creating a peak of biological diversity, but complete recovery of the original macroinvertebrate assemblages was not observed even during the subsequent two years. On the other hand, a significant drop in sulphate contents and rising alkalinity observed in stream waters during base flow conditions after the flood indicate positive effects on recovery of the aquatic environment by depleting the catchment sulphur pool. Thus, the flood did not significantly alter the long-term recovery of the studied headwater stream from acidification.

AB  - Testate amoebae are common single-celled eukaryotic organisms in aquatic ecosystems. Despite their important role in these ecosystems, and their potential as bioindicators and paleoindicators, they remain poorly studied in Mexico. The major objectives of this study were to: 1) increase knowledge of testate amoebae in Mexico's tropical lakes, and 2) create a catalog of high-quality scanning electron micrographs that can be used for future ecological and paleoenvironmental studies. We collected surface-sediment samples from 29 lakes, located in the Transmexican Volcanic Belt, one at each lake during June and October 2011, and March 2013. Sediments were collected with an Ekman grab and preserved in anhydrous ethanol. Sub-samples were observed under a stereomicroscope and morphometric data for each species were recorded. Total diameter and aperture diameter were measured on circular tests. Irregularly shaped tests were measured for length and width of the aperture and for the size of the whole test. If a specimen possessed spines, the length of one randomly selected spine was measured. The best-preserved specimen of each taxon was photographed with an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). We found 41 taxa of testate amoebae belonging to the genera: Arcella, Argynnia, Centropyxis, Cucurbitella, Cyclopyxis, Cyphoderia, Difflugia, Euglypha, Lesquereusia, Pentagonia, Pseudodifflugia and Scutiglypha. Twelve species not previously reported for Mexico were recorded, along with 13 varieties. The average number of taxa recorded in each lake was eight, and the highest taxonomic richness was 18. The taxon found in the greatest number of lakes was Centropyxis aculeata var. aculeata. Taxonomic richness varied among lakes in the same region. This could reflect lake-specific differences in environmental conditions, underscoring the need for more detailed studies that include collection of data on physical and chemical variables in the lakes. Our results highlighted the need of further studies for the distribution patterns and ecology of lacustrine testate amoebae.

AB  - Many indicators and indices related to a variety of biological, physico-chemical, chemical, and hydromorphological water conditions have been recently developed or adapted by scientists in order to support water managers in the Water Framework Directive (WFD) implementation. In this context, the achievement of a comprehensive and reliable Ecological Status classification of water bodies across Europe is hampered by the lack of harmonised procedures for selecting an appropriate set of indicators and integrating heterogeneous information in a flexible way.
   To this purpose, an Integrated Risk Assessment (IRA)(2) methodology was developed based on the Weight of Evidence approach. This method analyses and combines a set of environmental indicators grouped into five Lines of Evidence (LoE), i.e. Biology, Chemistry, Ecotoxicology, Physico-chemistry and Hydromorphology. The whole IRA methodology has been implemented as a specific module into a freeware GIS (Geographic Information System)-based Decision Support System, named MODELKEY DSS. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the four supporting LoE (i.e. Chemistry, Ecotoxicology, Physico-chemistry and Hydromorphology), and includes a procedure for a comparison of each indicator with proper thresholds and a subsequent integration process to combine the obtained output with the LoE Biology results in order to provide a single score expressing the Ecological Status classification. The approach supports the identification of the most prominent stressors, which are responsible for the observed alterations in the river basin under investigation. The results provided by the preliminary testing of the IRA methodology through application of the MODELKEY DSS to the Llobregat case study are finally reported and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is used increasingly as a quantitative marker for health in humans and welfare in animals. By evaluating the variability expressed in HRV measures, the information can be used to discern physiological stresses acting on the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems in humans and animals. In equine studies, HRV is used as a noninvasive method to assess stress under various circumstances; however, statistical reliability of HRV measures has not been proven. The purpose of the present study was to establish the statistical stability of HRV measures obtained with a portable heart rate monitor using a test-retest approach. Time and frequency domain measures were obtained for 22 horses during routine activities (free in a box stall, confined on cross ties, and during walking) on two separate days. Within each data set (box stall, n = 19; cross ties, n = 21; walk, n = 7) descriptive statistics were evaluated to determine the group effect between conditions and between days. A comparison of group means on day 1 and day 2 was evaluated using a paired sample t-test. Test-retest reliability estimates were determined with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), which included 95% CI for the ICC estimates. The results indicate that mean values between day 1 and day 2, based on the total group, did not differ across two conditions: box stall and cross ties. When horses were being led at a walk, HRV measurements for mean RR and mean HR were significantly different from day to day; however, no other HRV measurements in either the time or frequency domain were significantly different. ICC estimates of time domain variables were strongest for the box stall condition followed by the cross tie condition and then the walk condition. ICC estimates for the frequency domain variables were strongest for the cross tie condition followed by the walk condition and then the box stall condition. All of the ICCs for frequency domain variables were moderate or strong except for the low frequency:high frequency ratio, which was fair for walking and poor for the stall condition. The results support the hypothesis that HRV measurements from the Polar V800 portable heart rate monitors are statistically reliable and can be easily included in an assessment regimen for horses in different environments. Furthermore, assessment of horses for stress and pain during various circumstances could be reliably conducted using this methodology. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Shelter Quality protocol (SQP) is a concise and easily implemented tool for assessing dog welfare and to identify critical aspects of the shelter environment. A first version of the protocol has been modified to improve its performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the measures included in the second version of the protocol (SQP2) by testing the interobserver agreement between two independent assessors. We evaluated the sensitivity of animal-based measures in detecting the shelter dogs' welfare outputs during two different seasons. Ten Italian shelters were assessed contemporaneously by two assessors to determine the reliability of SQP2 measures. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using the Cohen's kappa for qualitative variables and Pearson' correlation for quantitative variables. The SQP2 was also applied twice (January and August) by the same observer in five Italian shelters to evaluate the sensitivity of the protocol to seasonal condition changes. The quantitative variables, "Number of animals shivering/huddling" and "Number of animals panting" were analyzed by Wilcoxon test. Credible intervals (95%) were calculated using a beta distribution for qualitative variables: "Body condition", "Skin condition", "Dog cleanliness", "Signs of diarrhea", "Coughing", and "Lameness". The level of agreement between the two observers on the qualitative variables such as body condition, lameness, skin condition, was quite high, ranging from substantial (0.61-0.80) to almost perfect (0.81-0.99). Interobserver agreement was also significant with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.51 to 0.92 (e.g., curious = 0.74; sociable = 0.83; barking level = 0.61). "Number of animals panting" and "Signs of diarrhea" showed a significant difference between the assessments (P<0.05). The observations of animals with lameness, coughing, and inadequate body condition increased in the winter season, whereas the observations of animals with skin lesions increased during the summer, but not significantly. The behaviors of shivering/huddling were observed too infrequently to be meaningfully analyzed. Consistent interobserver agreement exists in assessing dogs' welfare using the SQP2 confirming the reliability of the measures included in the protocol. The SQP2 shows potential in detecting changes in dogs' welfare outputs due to different climatic conditions. Further investigations are required to confirm the sensitivity of selected measures to different seasons. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Various methods have been proposed to identify threshold concentrations of nutrients that would support good ecological status, but the performance of these methods and the influence of other stressors on the underlying models have not been fully evaluated. We used synthetic datasets to compare the performance of ordinary least squares, logistic and quantile regression, as well as, categorical methods based on the distribution of nutrient concentrations categorised by biological status. The synthetic datasets used differed in their levels of variation between explanatory and response variables, and were centered at different positions along the stressor (nutrient) gradient. In order to evaluate the performance of methods in "multiple stressor" situations, another set of datasets with two stressors was used. Ordinary least squares and logistic regression methods were the most reliable when predicting the threshold concentration when nutrients were the sole stressor; however, both had a tendency to underestimate the threshold when a second stressor was present. In contrast, threshold concentrations produced by categorical methods were strongly influenced by the level of the stressor (nutrient enrichment, in this case) relative to the threshold they were trying to predict (good/moderate in this instance). Although all the methods tested had limitations in the presence of a second stressor, upper quantiles seemed generally appropriate to establish non-precautionary thresholds. For example, upper quantiles may be appropriate when establishing targets for restoration, but not when seeking to minimise deterioration. Selection of an appropriate threshold concentration should also attend to the regulatory regime (i.e. policy requirements and environmental management context) within which it will be used, and the ease of communicating the principles to managers and stakeholders.

AB  - This study is the first attempt to evaluate the limno-ecological status of freshwater ecosystems in Aras River system (Turkey) using diatom metrics and multivariate analyses according to the European Union Water Framework Directive requirements. Samples were collected using the standard protocols from 17 sampling stations in August and October of 2014, and June of 2015. Deterioration of water quality in the Aras River catchment was remarked from the downstream of Karakoyunlu, Sarsu, and Bozku creeks, which showed higher values of trophic index Turkey (TIT), trophic index (TI), and eutrophication and/or pollution index-diatom (EPI-D). These sites were also characterized by pollution tolerant taxa e.g., Cocconeis placentula, Gomphonema parvulum, Navicula cryptocephala, Navicula trivialis, and Tryblionella angustata. Sites S14-S17 had high ecological status according to TIT, supported by the score of EPI-D which indicated a good ecological condition for S14. The occurrence of pollution-sensitive species (e.g., Hannaea arcus, Cymbella affinis, Didymosphenia geminata, Meridion circulare, and Encyonema silesiacum) and the low nutrients like total phosphorus, orthophosphate and nitrate, conductivity, and BOD5 supported the high ecological status of S14-S17. The relationships between diatom assemblages and environmental variables were also illustrated by multivariate analyses. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that TIT had positive important correlations with total phosphorus (p<0.01, r=0.768). Trophic index and EPI-D had also significant correlations with environmental variables, but they had lower correlation coefficient than that of TIT. It seems that TIT could be a suitable diatom metric for assessing the ecological status of sampling stations in Aras River system and Mediterranean region. Our findings showed also that ecological statuses of surface waters should be evaluated due to the indices developed in their ecoregions.

AB  - Questions: What are the most relevant environmental variables influencing the distribution and the species richness of epiphytic lichens in heterogeneous areas of the Mediterranean region? What is the relative importance of substrate- vs. environmental-related variables? How do climatic and disturbance factors interact?
   Location: The study was carried out in the Liguria region (northwestern Italy). This is a complex region where steep environmental gradients occur over a few kilometres of longitude and latitude.
   Methods: Data on lichen species frequencies, collected on the basis of stratified random sampling, were analyzed using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) and DCA. Indicator Value Analysis (IVA) analysis was used to find indicator species for the environmental predictors.
   Results: In the survey area, epiphytic lichen distribution depends on both substrate- and environment-related factors. Climatic variables (in particular average yearly temperature and rainfall), anthropogenic pressures (particularly harvesting and atmospheric pollution), bark pH and texture were associated with the main axes of variability in the dataset. Mean annual rainfall is the best predictor for epiphytic lichen richness in the survey area. The particular effects of the Mediterranean region (e.g. the influence of forest fires) and of heterogeneous areas (the variability of diversity in relation to habitat) were pointed out. Several indicator species, closely linked to particular ecological conditions, were found for both substrate- and environment-related variables.
   Conclusions: The main variables involved seemed to be the same reported for other areas, but their relative importance and their spatial scale of action were in some cases different, probably due to the geomorphological and climatic heterogeneity of the survey area. The significant influence of climatic predictors and disturbance factors on epiphytic lichens was confirmed, suggesting that these organisms may be used successfully to describe ecological trends in natural environments, also providing practical information at ecosystem level.

AB  - Their pioneering role in the development of biological pest control has rendered the Coccinellidae of great practical and scientific interest. About 90% of the approximately 4200 coccinellid species are considered beneficial because of their predatory activity, mainly against Homopterous insects and mites. Coccinellids live in all terrestrial ecosystems: tundra, forest, grassland, agrosystems, and from the plains to mountains.
   Knowledge of coccinellid life history requires investigation of their bio-ecology. Being holometabolous insects, coccinellids present all types of voltinism. They reproduce in different habitats and show a wide range of behaviours, from stenotropism to eurotropism. In spite of their polyphagy, adults tend to prefer certain types of food (or essential prey), which are eaten voraciously. Many aphidophagous and monovoltine coccinellid species migrate in response to unfavourable environmental conditions; however, in most cases adults endure hostile environmental changes by entering a temporary dormant state, i.e., hibernation, aestivation or aestivo-hibernation. Despite these adaptive behaviours, the coccinellids are very vulnerable to several Limiting factors, including natural enemies and anthropological influences. Therefore, many precautions must be taken throughout the year to protect them.
   Seasonal changes influence the occurrence of aphid outbreaks, the type of plant infested and the behaviour of coccinellids. Reciprocally, the species found in different geographic zones can be recruited as bioindicator insects owing to their climatic and trophic characteristics. In the context of biological control, the coccinellids represent an important cause of mortality of coccids, aphids and mites. The peculiar aggregation behaviour of coccinellids remains to be exploited for acclimatization of a new species in a new country. Their migratory abilities pose challenges and opportunities for the development of effective biological control programs against aphids. Future research on the genetics, physiology and behaviour of coccinellids combined with studies of their flight aerodynamics and interactions with agricultural ecosystems will undoubtedly lead to improvements in coccinellid-based aphid control programs.

AB  - As complex mosaics of lotic, lentic, and terrestrial habitats, intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) sup-port high biodiversity. Despite their ecological importance, IRES are poorly represented in routine monitoring programs, but recent recognition of their considerable-and increasing-spatiotemporal extent is motivating ef-forts to better represent IRES in ecological status assessments. We examine response patterns of aquatic macro-invertebrate communities and taxa to flow intermittence (FI) across three European climatic regions. We used self-organizing map (SOM) to ordinate and classify sampling sites based on community structure in regions with continental, Mediterranean and oceanic climates. The SOM passively introduced FI, quantified as the mean annual % flow, and visualized its variability across classified communities, revealing a clear association be-tween community structure and FI in all regions. Indicator species analysis identified taxa indicative of low, inter-mediate and high FI. In the continental region, the amphipod Niphargus was indicative of high FI and was associated with groundwater-fed IRES, whereas indicators of Mediterranean IRES comprised Odonata, Coleop-tera and Heteroptera taxa, which favor lentic conditions. In the oceanic region, taxa indicative of relatively high FI included leuctrid stoneflies anda limnephilid caddisfly, likely reflecting the colonization of IRES by aerial adults from nearby perennial reaches. The Diptera families Chironomidae and Simuliidae showed contrasting FI preferences among regions, reflecting environmental heterogeneity between regions and the coarse taxonomic resolution to which these organisms were identified. These region-specific community and taxon responses of aquatic biota to FI highlight the need to adapt standard biotic indices to enable effective ecological status assessments in IRES.

AB  - Open-pit mining activities for minerals and metals have left an international legacy of highly polluted soils and degraded landscapes. Reforestation is usually supposed to restore soil fertility and ecosystem services, and therefore to remediate and recover polluted sites. However, our understanding of the effects of tree species and recovery time on the restoration of abiotic and biotic soil properties remains scarce. In this study, the effects of a series of restoration chronosequence (unrestored control, 10-year, 20-year, and natural forest) and plantation types (nitrogen-fixing broad-leaved Alms nepalensis and coniferous Cupressus torulosa monocultures, as well as their mixed plantation) on soil physicochemical and biological properties were explored in a phosphate mine. Our results showed that soil quality index (SQI), which integrates important soil physical, chemical, and biological parameters including bulk density, soil organic carbon and microbial biomass, could provide valuable information about soil health. The average SQI values of 20-year plantations were 1.55 times of 10-year plantations, and the mixed plantation was 1.13 and 1.27 times of A. nepalensis and C. torulosa monoculture, respectively. Thus, recovery time, as well as plantation type, were the main determinants of the alterations in key soil conditions during the phosphate mining restoration. At the beginning restoration (10 years), A. nepalensis monoculture performed better than C. torulosa, providing an efficient restoration strategy for early revegetation. The mixed plantation of C. torulosa and A. nepalensis showed the higher moisture and soil organic carbon than did the monocultures, especially after 20 years of revegetation. Hence, our findings address a helpful guideline for selection of tree species and plantation practices, thereby aiding in long-term success of restoration.

AB  - Question
   What are the differences in trait compositions that enable native plants to colonise comparable natural and man-made habitats? Are these traits independent of phylogenetic relationships between species?
   Location
   Czech Republic.
   Methods
   The relative importance of biological, ecological and distributional traits of native species was studied, using a dataset of 75 species growing in rock and wall habitats in the Czech Republic. Species preferences for individual habitats due to climatic conditions and proportions of different vegetation types in their surroundings were partialled out using partial canonical correspondence analysis. The pattern of plant traits along a gradient from natural rock habitats to secondary wall habitats was analysed using regression trees and generalized linear models with and without phylogenetic correction.
   Results
   The most common native species colonising rock habitats are phanerophytes, mostly woody juveniles, with a CSR life strategy and most are adapted to epizoochory. Summer green leaves, annual life span, CR life strategy, reproduction mostly by seeds and dispersal by ants are all traits positively associated with the ability of species to colonise wall habitats. These species are also characterised by their high demand for nutrients, temperature, base-rich substrates and light. Biological and ecological traits are more important for colonising new habitats than traits related to species dispersal ability or phylogenetic relationships between species. Biological and ecological traits alone explained 29.3% of variability in the species dataset, while dispersal characteristics and phylogeny alone explained 9.1% and 4.8%, respectively.
   Conclusions
   We outline how the process of environmental filtering determines native species assemblages and identify a set of species traits that enable them to persist in particular habitats. We conclude that although urbanisation generally results in loss of natural habitats, there are new, man-made habitats potentially suitable for native species.

AB  - Aquaculture is perceived by governments and international agencies as an economic alternative for poor communities in developing countries. Nevertheless, aquaculture must address environmental issues as well as economic and social aspects to achieve a sustainable development. Aquaculture with native species under semi-intensive conditions is a sustainable production alternative that minimizes the impact on aquatic ecosystems. An aquaculture pilot project with pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus paulensis) was tested in a protected lagoon in Uruguay (Laguna de Rocha). Shrimp were reared in pen enclosures within their native habitat, where natural currents drive water renewal, and the natural food supply was supplemented with commercial food. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of F paulensis aquaculture on the water and sediment quality and the benthic community, and to estimate the maximum number of pen enclosures that Laguna de Rocha can sustain while maintaining the minimal environmental impact. A Before, After, Control Impact (BACT) sampling design was followed and the results of abiotic and biological variables were compared between treatment site (control, pens, and two areas at 15 and 50 m from the pens) and timing (before shrimp addition, during culture and after harvest), through ANOVA. The most significant impact was found inside the pens, where ammonium levels increased and benthos species richness and abundance decreased. A nitrogen-based-model was used to estimate the maximum number of pens in relation to the minimal impact on the ecosystem. Simulation indicated that up to 13 pens could be installed in the southern area of Laguna de Rocha without increasing the usual concentration of total nitrogen in other areas of the lagoon. The BACI design, the statistical analysis and the modeling tools proved to be effective, simple and low cost instruments to assess the environmental impact in a protected area. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The ecological quality of 127 stations from six Adriatic coastal lagoons was assessed using a suite of biotic indices: H', d, 1-lambda' Delta*, Delta(+), W, AMBI, BOPA and FINE. The analysis indicated the difficulties in deriving and using the existing indices from benthic communities in highly variable environmental conditions in coastal lagoons. Different metrics rendered different results: the use of H' resulted in the classification of all stations as "Moderate/Poor/Bad", whereas BOPA classified the majority of the stations as "Good/High". Using Delta(+), most of the stations resulted as "Not anthropogenically impacted", while the W-statistics gave 82 stations as "Undisturbed" and 45 as "Moderately/Grossly disturbed". AMBI classified 55 stations as "High/Good" and 72 as "Moderate/Poor/Bad", whereas those were 32 and 95 with FINE, respectively. The latter, which was developed just for Italian coastal lagoons, was the most conservative among the indices studied. Yet, it showed the highest correlation with the species/abundance matrix. Using indices developed for coastal waters in lagoons can give the distorted indication that the water body is degraded, when it might be just a natural, low diversity, high abundance community, i.e. a lagoonal community. Moreover, the outcome of the use of a certain index has a financial dimension such that lagoons misclassified as being "poor status" will then require expensive remediation measures. For the lagoons studied, there is probably an adequate quality and quantity of benthic data available for making management decisions, but this study highlights the limits of the existing indices for lagoonal ecosystems. The challenge for the next future is to couple long term conservation of the natural environment. with the highly productive activities carried out in lagoonal ecosystems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

KW  - water quality
AB  - Hydropower plants produce renewable and sustainable energy but affect the river's physico-chemical characteristics and change the abundance and composition of the aquatic organisms. The impact of large HPPs on the ecological conditions of surface water bodies have been extensively studied, but less attention has been paid to environmental impact studies of small hydropower plants (SHPs). The impact of hydropeaking on both the river flow regime and ecosystems has been well-studied for peaking mode plants, mainly medium to large-sized ones. However, for small hydroelectric power plants, and especially for those in lowland rivers, the available information on water quality, benthic macroinvertebrates communities and fish abundance, and biomass is not sufficient. Ten small hydropower plants were selected, and the ecological status of water bodies was assessed in different parts of Lithuania. The studies were performed at the riverbed upstream from the SHPs, where the hydrological regime has not changed, and downstream from the SHPs. It was found that the small hydropower plants do not affect the physico-chemical values of the water quality indicators. This study demonstrated that the total number of benthic macroinvertebrates taxa (TS) is influenced by the concentration of nitrogen and suspended solids, the water flow, the river area, and the current speed; the number of EPT (Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Trichoptera (caddisflies)) taxa is influenced by the concentration of nitrogen and suspended solids. The studied indicators do not have a significant impact on biomass. The SHPs affect the fish abundance and biomass. The Lithuanian fish index (LFI) is influenced by the average depth and area of the river. Some SHPs operating in lowland areas may yield somewhat significant hydrograph ramping but more detailed investigation is needed to support the significance of this impact on the biological indices.

AB  - The clam Ruditapes decussatus is distributed worldwide and due to its ecological and economical interest has been proposed as a bioindicator in areas where mussels are not available. The accumulation of several anthropogenic compounds in their tissues suggests that they possess mechanisms that allow them to cope with the toxic effects of these contaminants. Besides pollutant uptake, the use of biomarkers is pointed out in this paper since it is a promising approach to monitor the effect of these contaminants in the marine environment. Biomarkers complement the information of the direct chemical characterization of different types of contaminants. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review the role of several biomarkers: (metallothioneins (MT)), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPx) ( total and selenium-dependent), lipid peroxidation (measured as MDA, one of the final products of lipid peroxidation), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), measured in different tissues of the clam R. decussatus, in laboratory conditions and under various environmental stresses, in two ecosystems (Ria Formosa lagoon, Portugal) and Bizerta lagoon ( Tunisia) in a perspective of a multibiomarker approach to assess environmental changes. Experiment and field studies are in good agreement since MT levels, especially in the gills, the first target tissue of these contaminants, can be used as biomarker of exposure to Cd. GPx and MDA may also be determined in this respect. AChE activity is inhibited by pesticide and, to a less extent, by metal exposure in the gills and whole soft body of clams. However, the induction of GST isoforms experimentally demonstrated is not observed in the field because only global GST activity was determined. The whole set of results opens new research perspectives for the use of this species to assess the effect of mixtures of pollutants in the aquatic environment.

AB  - There has been a steady rise in the use of dormant propagules to study biotic responses to environmental change over time. This is particularly important for organisms that strongly mediate ecosystem processes, as changes in their traits over time can provide a unique snapshot into the structure and function of ecosystems from decades to millennia in the past. Understanding sources of bias and variation is a challenge in the field of resurrection ecology, including those that arise because often-used measurements like seed germination success are imperfect indicators of propagule viability. Using a Bayesian statistical framework, we evaluated sources of variability and tested for zero-inflation and overdispersion in data from 13 germination trials of soil-stored seeds of Schoenoplectus americanus, an ecosystem engineer in coastal salt marshes in the Chesapeake Bay. We hypothesized that these two model structures align with an ecological understanding of dormancy and revival: zero-inflation could arise due to failed germinations resulting from inviability or failed attempts to break dormancy, and overdispersion could arise by failing to measure important seed traits. A model that accounted for overdispersion, but not zero-inflation, was the best fit to our data. Tetrazolium viability tests corroborated this result: most seeds that failed to germinate did so because they were inviable, not because experimental methods failed to break their dormancy. Seed viability declined exponentially with seed age and was mediated by seed provenance and experimental conditions. Our results provide a framework for accounting for and explaining variability when estimating propagule viability from soil-stored natural archives which is a key aspect of using dormant propagules in eco-evolutionary studies.

AB  - In recent years, the change of marine environment due to climate change and declining primary productivity have been big concerns in the East/Japan Sea, Korea. However, the main causes for the recent changes are still not revealed clearly. The particulate organic carbon (POC) to chlorophyll-a (chl-a) ratio (POC:chl-a) could be a useful indicator for ecological and physiological conditions of phytoplankton communities and thus help us to understand the recent reduction of primary productivity in the East/Japan Sea. To derive the POC in the East/Japan Sea from a satellite dataset, the new regional POC algorithm was empirically derived with in-situ measured POC concentrations. A strong positive linear relationship (R-2 = 0.6579) was observed between the estimated and in-situ measured POC concentrations. Our new POC algorithm proved a better performance in the East/Japan Sea compared to the previous one for the global ocean. Based on the new algorithm, long-term POC:chl-a ratios were obtained in the entire East/Japan Sea from 2003 to 2018. The POC:chl-a showed a strong seasonal variability in the East/Japan Sea. The spring and fall blooms of phytoplankton mainly driven by the growth of large diatoms seem to be a major factor for the seasonal variability in the POC:chl-a. Our new regional POC algorithm modified for the East/Japan Sea could potentially contribute to long-term monitoring for the climate-associated ecosystem changes in the East/Japan Sea. Although the new regional POC algorithm shows a good correspondence with in-situ observed POC concentrations, the algorithm should be further improved with continuous field surveys.

AB  - The water quality in South Africa's river systems is rapidly deteriorating as a consequence of increased discharge of wastewater effluents. The natural ability of rivers and reservoirs to trap toxic chemicals and nutrients in their sediments enables these systems to accumulate contaminants, altering the natural balance in environmental water quality, thereby raising a plethora of public and environmental health concerns. Impaired water quality has been linked to an array of problems in South Africa including massive fish mortalities, altered habitat template leading to the thinning of riverine macroinvertebrate diversity, shifts in microbial community structures with drastic ecological consequences and evolvement of antibiotic resistance genes that, under natural conditions, can be transferred to waterborne pathogens. Urban wastewater discharge has also been implicated in increased bioaccumulation of metals in edible plant parts, elevated concentrations of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), which are blamed for reduced fertility and increased cancer risk, excessive growth of toxic cyanobacteria and an increase in concentrations of pathogenic microorganisms which constitute a potential health threat to humans. However, despite the ecotoxicological hazards posed by wastewater effluents, ecotoxicological studies are currently underutilised in South African aquatic ecosystem assessments, and where they have been done, the observation is that ecotoxicological studies are mostly experimental and restricted to small study areas. More research is still needed to fully assess especially the ecotoxicological consequences of surface water pollution by urban wastewater effluents in South Africa. A review of the effects of urban effluent discharges that include domestic effluent mixed with industrial effluent and/or urban stormwater run-off is hereby presented.

AB  - Long-term records of environmental history at decadal to millennial time-scales enable an assessment of ecosystem variability and responses to past anthropogenic disturbances and are fundamental for the development of environmental management strategies. This study examines the local variability of land-use history in the South Swedish Uplands over the last 200 years based on pollen records from three lake-sediment successions. Temporal changes in the proportional cover of 14 plant taxa were quantified as percentages using the landscape reconstruction algorithm (LRA). The LRA-based estimates of the extent of four land-use categories (cropland, meadows/grassland, wetland, outland/woodland) were compared to corresponding estimates based on historical maps and aerial photographs from ad 1769-1823, 1837-1895, 1946 and 2005. Although the LRA approach tends to overestimate grassland cover by 10-30 % for the two earliest time periods, the reconstructed vegetation composition is generally in good agreement with estimates based on the historical records. Subsequently, the LRA approach was used to reconstruct the 200-year history of local land-use dynamics at 20-year intervals around two small lakes. The qualitative assessment of difference approach, which requires fewer assumptions and parameters than LRA for objective evaluation of between-site differences in plant abundances, provides consistent results in general. Significant differences exist in the land-use history between the sites. Local catchment characteristics, such as soil conditions and wetland cover, appear important for the development of human impact on the landscape. Quantifications of past vegetation dynamics provide information on the amplitude, frequency and duration of the land-use changes and their effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and should be taken into account when nature conservation strategies are developed.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the assessment of ecological quality of water bodies based on physico-chemical and biological elements. This paper is focused on the use of phytoplankton as a biological indicator of ecological quality in Portuguese transitional waters (TWs). Phytoplankton is considered to be a sensitive indicator to environmental changes, especially nutrient enrichment, and is therefore useful for evaluating eutrophication processes. According to the WFD, three metrics should be generally considered to assess ecological status: phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a), phytoplankton composition and abundance, and phytoplankton bloom intensity and frequency.
   This work presents an integrated methodology that comprises the first and the last metrics indicated above, analyzed during the growing season (February-October). Significant (p < 0.01) direct relationships between pressures (nutrient concentrations) and the biomass metric (90th percentile of chlorophyll a) were found, which allow confidence in the assessment. Afterwards, reference conditions and the boundaries of a five-class classification were set using phytoplankton biomass. These boundaries were further tested against the results of a risk assessment, carried out on the basis of primary (e.g. high chlorophyll concentrations) and secondary symptoms (e.g. oxygen depletion) of eutrophication, as well as nutrient loads and the susceptibility of systems. Significant (p < 0.01) direct relationships were also found between biomass and the scale of risk. Phytoplankton bloom intensity and frequency data were also used in the analysis although data were too scarce for a detailed evaluation of all water bodies (WBs). The worst ecological status (moderate to poor) were found in only few water bodies in the Ria de Aveiro, Mondego, Sado and Guadiana estuaries. Further research is needed for testing and improving the tool, especially for the phytoplankton bloom intensity and frequency metric. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Birds contribute to the stability of ecosystems and represent a tool used to evaluate a variety of anthropogenic impacts. The area known as El Oro-Tlalpujahua Mining District in central Mexico was subjected to significant environmental impacts as a result of ore extraction, including profound habitat transformations, landscape changes, and the accumulation of potentially toxic elements in their tailings (favoring its bioavailability and dispersion). After more than 60 years without extractive activities, there is no knowledge on extant remaining impacts on biological communities. Assuming the presence of negative impacts on birds, we compared the composition and abundance of bird communities in two locations, representing a site without exposure to tailings (S-1) and another one with tailings deposition (S-2). From June 2014 to June 2015, we recorded 2828 individuals of 108 avian species in 369 point counts (S-1 = 91, S-2 = 95). The Chaol indicator suggested we recorded 96% of the species present. We found a high similarity in the general composition and abundance of bird species between communities (> 85%). However, there were significant differences in the abundances of 18 species (9 of them higher in the control site); these differences might result from differential effects of potentially toxic elements on functional groups (such as feeding guilds), resource availability, as well as other factors not accounted for. Historically, mining activities in the area generated significant changes in the structure and composition of the forest, and disrupted ecological processes. Despite the fact that current conditions appear favorable to the relative stability of the bird community, specific physiological effects on some species of birds sixty years after the cessation of mineral extraction could occur. Further studies on physiological performance and the effects of potentially toxic elements on local birds could unveil unknown effects at the individual level.

AB  - Wetlands harbor rich biodiversity and biomass and provide a variety of ecosystem services. Therefore, environmental assessment of wetlands is critical for those seeking to manage these pivotal ecosystems. While the landscape development intensity (LDI) index is commonly used for wetlands assessment, it is, unfortunately, limited in scope and, in some regions, efficacy. The objectives of this study were to improve and modify methods for wetlands assessment using a multi-metric approach that incorporated both the LDI index and landscape metrics. We calculated the LDI index values for 10 test wetlands across both the area of each wetland and within a 0-600 m wide area (in 100-m intervals). The results showed that the LDI index values varied significantly as the buffer distance increased, and specifically, the wetlands plus a 300-m wide swath was found to encompass the most appropriate area of inclusion for assessment. Furthermore, based on the metrics selective criteria, only LDI index and area metrics were incorporated into the assessment schematic. Due to two types of wetlands identified significantly different in the scatter plots of the LDI index and area, the assessment system was built to accommodate appropriate cut-off points. Four levels were then designated; the coastal wetland had an overall accuracy of 70.0% (kappa coefficient of 0.61), while that of the inland wetlands, which included natural and artificial wetlands, was only 41.7% (kappa coefficient of 0.22). This study confirmed that the extent of assessment had an effect on the LDI value, and there were significant differences in the assessment schematics across wetland types. In addition, LDI and/or area indices could be incorporated into landscape assessments. The assessment methods of this study can be applied in regions with high population density and consequently altered terrain, though the metric, scoring ranges, and levels should be adjusted to local conditions.

AB  - The ability of marine diazotrophs to fix dinitrogen gas (N-2) is one of the most influential yet enigmatic processes in the ocean. With their activity diazotrophs support biological production by fixing about 100-200 Tg N/year and turning otherwise unavailable dinitrogen into bioavailable nitrogen (N), an essential limiting nutrient. Despite their important role, the factors that control the distribution of diazotrophs and their ability to fix N-2 are not fully elucidated. We discuss insights that can be gained from the emerging picture of a wide geographical distribution of marine diazotrophs and provide a critical assessment of environmental (bottom-up) versus trophic (top-down) controls. We expand a simplified theoretical framework to understand how top-down control affects competition for resources that determine ecological niches. Selective mortality, mediated by grazing or viral-lysis, on non-fixing phytoplankton is identified as a critical process that can broaden the ability of diazotrophs to compete for resources in top-down controlled systems and explain an expanded ecological niche for diazotrophs. Our simplified analysis predicts a larger importance of top-down control on competition patterns as resource levels increase. As grazing controls the faster growing phytoplankton, coexistence of the slower growing diazotrophs can be established. However, these predictions require corroboration by experimental and field data, together with the identification of specific traits of organisms and associated trade-offs related to selective top-down control. Elucidation of these factors could greatly improve our predictive capability for patterns and rates of marine N-2 fixation. The susceptibility of this key biogeochemical process to future changes may not only be determined by changes in environmental conditions but also via changes in the ecological interactions.

AB  - This study aims to complement existing fish-based assessment approaches by classifying European lampreys and fish species according to their probability of occurrence in six different longitudinal river regions and five types of floodplain water bodies under unimpaired conditions. The main objective was to provide for the first time harmonized occurrence traits for European lampreys and fishes in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions of floodplain river systems in a Fish Region Index (FRI) and Floodplain Fish Index (FFI), respectively.
   Altogether 163 lamprey and fish species established in European rivers have been scored according to their longitudinal and lateral occurrence probabilities. The species-specific Fish Region and Floodplain Fish indices and their variances inform about species' occurrence probabilities, dispersal traits and potential species inventories of different river regions and floodplain waters. The final scores allow identifying characteristic fish assemblages, i.e. a set of type-specific species for the different longitudinal river regions and lateral floodplain water bodies.
   The species-specific index values and variances serve to calculate summary metrics for the total fish assemblage (FRItotal and FFItotal) as macro-scale indicators for the deviation of the total fish assemblage from a reference state. The resulting index values indicate degradation as well as rehabilitation success at the level of fish assemblages, i.e. at an ecologically relevant macro-scale. Both species-specific and total assemblage indices are directly comparable among all biogeographic regions of Europe independent of the local species pool. As such, the indices serve as assemblage indicators for the fish-based assessment of the ecological status of water body types and river regions in floodplain river systems, which are required in particular for the assessment of large floodplain rivers.

AB  - Nature of exposure is a fundamental driver in nontarget terrestrial plant risk assessment for pesticides; consequently a novel study was designed to generate field-based drift exposure and evaluate corresponding biological effects of the herbicide mesotrione. The approach used a combination of US guideline drift reduction technology and vegetative vigor approaches. In each of 3 independent replicate spray application trials, 10 pots each of lettuce and tomato were placed at distances of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 ft (similar to 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 m) from the downwind edge of the spray boom. Each application was conducted using a commercial 60-ft (18-m) boom sprayer fitted with TeeJet 1 Technologies TTI110025 nozzles, with a nominal application rate of 0.2 lb a. i./A (224 g a. i./ha). The environmental conditions required by the protocol (air temperature 10-30 degrees C and wind perpendicular to the swath (+/- 30 degrees) blowing toward the plants at a mean wind speed of >= 10 mph [>= 4.5 m/s] measured at 2.0mabove the ground) were met for each application. Following exposure, plants were transferred to a greenhouse for the 21-d vegetative vigor phase of the study. Symptoms of phytotoxicity and plant height were assessed at 7, 14, and 21 d after treatment. On completion of the 21-d after treatment assessment, all plants were harvested and dried in an oven to determine shoot dry weight. The biological data indicated that no statistically significant effects were observed at a distance of 30 ft (similar to 9m) from mesotrione drift at wind speeds of >= 10 mph (10.9-12.4 mph); this endpoint (30 ft) is defined as the no observed effects distance (NOED).

AB  - Traditional and emerging human activities are increasingly putting pressures on marine ecosystems and impacting their ability to sustain ecological and human communities. To evaluate the health status of marine ecosystems we need a science-based, integrated Ecosystem Approach, that incorporates knowledge of ecosystem function and services provided that can be used to track how management decisions change the health of marine ecosystems. Although many methods have been developed to assess the status of single components of the ecosystem, few exist for assessing multiple ecosystem components in a holistic way. To undertake such an integrative assessment, it is necessary to understand the response of marine systems to human pressures. Hence, innovative monitoring is needed to obtain data to determine the health of large marine areas, and in an holistic way. Here we review five existing methods that address both of these needs (monitoring and assessment): the Ecosystem Health Assessment Tool; a method for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in the Bay of Biscay; the Ocean Health Index (OHI); the Marine Biodiversity Assessment Tool, and the Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool. We have highlighted their main characteristics and analyzing their commonalities and differences, in terms of: use of the Ecosystem Approach; inclusion of multiple components in the assessment; use of reference conditions; use of integrative assessments; use of a range of values to capture the status; weighting ecosystem components when integrating; determine the uncertainty; ensure spatial and temporal comparability; use of robust monitoring approaches, and address pressures and impacts. Ultimately, for any ecosystem assessment to be effective it needs to be: transparent and repeatable and, in order to inform marine management, the results should be easy to communicate to wide audiences, including scientists, managers, and policymakers.

AB  - Prioritizing total maximum daily load (TMDL) development starts by considering the scope and severity of water pollution and risks to public health and aquatic life. Methodology using quantitative assessments of in-stream water quality is appropriate and effective for point source (PS) dominated discharge, but less so in watersheds with mostly nonpoint source (NPS) related impairments. For NPSs, prioritization in TMDL development and implementation of associated best management practices should focus on restoration of ecosystem physical functions, including how restoration effectiveness depends on design, maintenance and placement within the watershed. To refine the approach to TMDL development, regulators and stakeholders must first ask if the watershed, or ecosystem, is at risk of losing riparian or other ecologically based physical attributes and processes. If so, the next step is an assessment of the spatial arrangement of functionality with a focus on the at-risk areas that could be lost, or could, with some help, regain functions. Evaluating stream and wetland riparian function has advantages over the traditional means of water quality and biological assessments for NPS TMDL development. Understanding how an ecosystem functions enables stakeholders and regulators to determine the severity of problem(s), identify source(s) of impairment, and predict and avoid a decline in water quality. The Upper Reese River, Nevada, provides an example of water quality impairment caused by NPS pollution. In this river basin, stream and wetland riparian proper functioning condition (PFC) protocol, water quality data, and remote sensing imagery were used to identify sediment sources, transport, distribution, and its impact on water quality and aquatic resources. This study found that assessments of ecological function could be used to generate leading (early) indicators of water quality degradation for targeting pollution control measures, while traditional in-stream water quality monitoring lagged in response to the deterioration in ecological functions.

AB  - In Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) (European Commission 2000) - and the recently proposed EU Marine Strategy Directive - have established a framework for the protection of groundwater, inland surface waters, estuarine (transitional) waters and coastal waters. The WFD has several objectives: to prevent water ecosystem deterioration, to protect and to enhance the status of water resources but the most important aspect is to achieve a 'Good Ecological Status' (GES) for all waters, by 2015. In essence, the WFD requires a water body to be compared against a reference condition and then its ecological status designated - if the water body does not meet good or high ecological status, i.e. it is in moderate, poor or bad ecological status, then remedial measures have to be taken (e.g. pollution has to be removed). Many indices were developed from benthic work and are often thought fit for purpose. Based on the successional model proposed by Pearson and Rosenberg (1978), most of these indices were effectively established for soft sediment benthos. However, those developed in the framework of the WFD were derived from work on the subtidal. They are difficult to use in the intertidal and in transitional waters. As they were derived from work on organic pollution, there is no or little evident link with chemical and physical pollution. Ecomorphology brings together a biological approach and a sedimentological approach to estuarine ecology. It considers the use of the biotope and related concepts (biocenosis, bio-facies, ecotone, habitat...) as a basis to a novel approach to environmental quality assessment. It addresses the problem of the estuarine quality paradox in recognising the role of nutrients and organic matter in biogeochemical cycles. The discussion shows the complementarity of biotopes with the Sato-Umi and the ecohydrolgy approaches. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

From 2013 to 2017, the US. Geological Survey completed multi-stressor/multi-assemblage stream ecological assessments in five regions of the United States (434 streams total). Diatom, invertebrate, and fish communities were enumerated, and five types of potential stressors were quantified: habitat disturbance, excess nutrients, high flows, basic water quality, and contaminants in water and sediment. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models for each biological assemblage and region generally included variables from all five stressor types and multiple stressors types in each model was the norm. Classification and regression tree (CART) models then were used to determine thresholds for each BRT model variable above which there appeared to be adverse effects (multi-metric index (MMI) models only). In every region and assemblage there was a significant inverse relation between the MMI and the number of stressors exerting potentially adverse effects. The number of elevated instream stressors often varied substantially for a given level of land-use development and the number of elevated stressors was a better predictor of biological condition than was development. Using the adverse-effects-levels that were developed based on the BRT model results, 68% of the streams had two or more stressors with potentially adverse effects and 35% had four or more. Our results indicate that relatively small increases in the number of stressors of different types can have a large effect on a stream ecosystem. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban environments are ecosystems that differ clearly from the natural environment in numerous factors of nature and intensity. Under the conditions of the urban environment the parameters of climate change, the process of alkalization of the top soil layers and the accumulation of heavy metals, especially zinc, lead and copper as well as a considerable content of bitumen, are in progress (BANASZAK 1998). The species composition of urban phytocenoses becomes poorer and poorer and usually leads to the replacement of herbaceous plant associations with poorly-diversified grass associations. One of the elements of research into the structure deformations and operation rules of urban ecosystems is the evaluation of entomofauna communities, as essential indicators of changes which occur in them. Carabid (Carabidae) beetles are considered to be such bioindicators due to their sensitivity to various changes in the natural environment. At the end of the 1990s research was launched into communities of these beetles on selected green belts of Bydgoszcz and the areas adjacent to this urban area. The present results encompass 2002-2004 and are a continuation of research into Carabidae communities of successive urban green belts (the Kujawskie Roundabout, Dabrowski Hill) as well as forest areas adjacent to the urban area (Myslecinek, Forest Jastrzebie) and also two sites in the vicinity of Swiecie upon Wisla. The following were clear dominants for suburban forest areas: Pterostichus melanarius (L.), Pterostichus oblongopunctatus (Fabr.) and for the area of Forest Jastrzcbie: Pterostichus niger (Schall.) and as for genus Carabus: C. hortensis L., C. violaceus L. and C. arvensis Herbst. A high position in the dominance structure of the green belts of the city was recorded for the following species: Calathus fuscipes (Goeze), and Calathus erratus (C.R.Sahlb) and Harpalus rufipes (De Geer).

AB  - Ground beetles have been often used as indicators for agricultural practices in ecological studies, but little is known about the spatial and temporal variation independent from the agricultural practices. Between 1985 and 1995 the ground beetles (Carabidae) of 53 fields in Schleswig-Holstein (northern Germany) were investigated using three replicate pitfall traps at each site. One field was studied over a period of 9 years from 1988 to 1996, and in addition two adjacent fields subjected to ecological or conventional farming methods were investigated in 1999 using 12 pitfall traps each. Overall, five assemblages of ground beetles could be differentiated, primarily by sand content of the soils and field size. The separation of the assemblages was weak (eigenvalue of 1st axis: 0.39) compared to natural ecosystems. The most common assemblage on loamy soils was dominated by Pterostichus melanarius. Oil both sandy soils and loamy soils in small fields the species Poecilus versicolor and Platynus dorsalis, Bembidion lampros, respectively, dominated. Eight ecologically differentiated groups of ground beetles were found. Most species correlated positively with the sand content of the soils. Only two species, P melanarius and Loricera pilicornis showed a positive correlation with the field size. A higher species richness was observed on fields which have practised for 30 years ecological farming. Comparing the two adjacent fields with ecological and conventional farming, no difference in species richness was detected. Four species showed higher abundance on the field with ecological farming. In this analysis of a long-term dataset ground beetles did not respond to the Cultivated plants, but only to the yearly climate conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - The cultivation of GMPs in Europe raises many questions about the environmental risks, in particular about their ecological impact on non-target organisms and on soil properties. The aim of a multidisciplinary group engaged in a LIFE + project (MAN-GMP-ITA) was to validate and improve an existing environmental risk assessment (ERA) methodology on GMPs within the European legislative framework on GMOs. Given the impossibility of evaluating GMO impact directly, as GMPs are banned in Italy, GMPs have not been used at any stage of the project. The project thus specifically focused on the conditions for the implementation of ERA in different areas of Italy, with an emphasis on some sensitive and protected areas located in the North, Centre, and South of the country, in order to lay the necessary baseline for evaluating the possible effects of a GMP on soil communities. Our sub-group carried out soil analyses in order to obtain soil health and fertility indicators to be used as baselines in the ERA model. Using various methods of chemical, biochemical, functional and genetic analysis, our study assessed the changes in diversity and functionality of bacterial populations, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The results show that plant identity and growth, soil characteristics, and field site climatic parameters are key factors in contributing to variation in microbial community structure and diversity, thus validating our methodological approach. Our project has come to the conclusion that the uneven composition and biological-agronomical quality of soils need to be taken into consideration in a risk analysis within the framework of ERA for the release of genetically modified plants.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) regulates freshwater and coastal water quality assessment in Europe. Chemical and ecological water quality status is based on measurements of chemical pollutants in water and biota together with other indicators such as temperature, nutrients, species compositions (phytoplankton, microalgae, benthos and fish) and hydromorphological conditions. However, in the current strategy a link between the chemical and the ecological status is missing. In the present WFD, no microbiological indicators are foreseen for integrating the different anthropogenic pressures, including mixtures of chemicals, nutrients and temperature changes, to provide a holistic view of the freshwater ecosystem water quality. The main aim of this work was to evaluate if natural microbial populations can be valuable indicators of multiple stressors (e.g. chemical pollutants, temperature, nutrients etc.) to guide preventive and remediation actions by water authorities. A preliminary survey was conducted to identify four sites reflecting a contamination gradient from the source to the mouth of a river suitable to the objectives of the European Marie Curie project, MicroCoKit. The River Tiber (Italy) was selected as a pilot case study to investigate the correlation between bacteria taxa and the chemical status of the river. The main physicochemical parameters, inorganic elements, organic pollutants and natural microbial community composition were assessed at four selected sites corresponding to pristine, agricultural, industrial and urban areas for three consecutive years. The overall chemical results indicated a correspondence between different groups of contaminants and the main contamination sources at the selected sampling points. Phylogenetic analysis of the microbial community analyzed by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization method (FISH) revealed differences among the four sampling sites which could reflect an adaptive bacterial response to the different anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - Biomarkers are an important tool in laboratory assays that link exposure or effect of specific toxicants to key molecular and cellular events, but they have not been widely used in invertebrate populations exposed to complex mixtures of environmental contaminants in their natural habitats. The present study focused on a battery of biomarkers and their comparative analysis in natural populations of the benthic larvae of Chironomus riparius (Diptera), sampled in three differentially polluted rivers (the Con, Sar, and Louro in Galicia, Spain). In our study, some parameters were identified, such as hsp70 gene activity, GST enzymatic activity, total glycogen content and mouthpart deformities, which showed significant differences among populations from the three rivers that differed in the levels and types of sedimentary contaminants analyzed (metals, organic-chlorine pesticides, alkylphenols, pharmaceutical, and personal care products). In contrast to these sensitive biomarkers, other parameters showed no significant differences (hsc70 gene, EcR gene, P450 gene, RNA:DNA ratio, total protein content), and were stable even when comparing field and nonexposed laboratory populations. The hsp70 gene seems to be particularly sensitive to conditions of pollutant exposure, while its constitutive counterpart hsc70 showed invariable expression, suggesting that the hsc70/hsp70 ratio may be a potential indicator of polluted environments. Although further studies are required to understand the correlation between molecular responses and the ecological effects of pollutants on natural populations, the results provide new data about the biological responses to multiple-stressor environments. This field study adds new molecular endpoints, including gene expression, as suitable tools that, complementing other ecotoxicological parameters, may help to improve the methodologies of freshwater monitoring under the increasing burden of xenobiotics.

AB  - Biological value estimation is based on a set of assessment questions and several thresholds to delineate areas of ecological importance (e.g. biodiversity). An existing framework, that was specifically designed to assess the ecosystem biodiversity, was expanded by adding new questions on the productivity, functionality and biogeochemical status of benthic habitats. The additional ecological and sedimentological information was collected by using sediment profile imagery (SPI) and grab sampling. Additionally, information on the performance and comparability of both techniques is provided in this study. The research idea was tested at a site near the harbor of Zeebrugge, an area under consideration as a new disposal site for dredged material from the harbor entrance.
   The sedimentology of the area can be adequately described based on the information from both SPI and Van Veen grab samples, but only the SPI revealed structural information on the physical habitat (layering, a-RPD). The latter information represented the current status of the benthic habitat, which was confirmed by the Van Veen grab samples. All information was summarized through the biological valuation framework, and provided clear evidence of the differences in biological value for the different sediment types within the area. We concluded that the installation of a new dredged material disposal site in this area was not in conflict with the benthic ecology. This area has a low biological value and the benthic system is adapted to changing conditions, which was signaled by the dominance of mobile, short living and opportunistic species.
   This study showed that suitable sedimentological and ecological information can be gathered by these traditional and complementary techniques, to estimate the biological value of an area in the light of marine spatial planning and environmental impact assessments.

AB  - Despite the great contribution of coralligenous communities to Mediterranean biodiversity (second key-ecosystem after Posidonia oceanica meadows), they were never considered in the establishment of multimetric indices for ecological status assessment of marine environment. In this paper, we describe a method to evaluate the ecological status of coralligenous assemblages along Mediterranean French coasts. Several metrics were selected from literature for coralligenous assemblage description and include functional and structural information: percent cover of visible non-vagile species (using photographic quadrats along a transect) and gorgonian demography. Thirty eight field stations were sampled for these metrics in PACA (Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur) region in June 2010 and considered for their morphology (bank, rim), geographical orientation and principal current direction (North, East, West, South) and depth (from 30 to 84 m). Metrics found to be linked to human pressures using ANCOVA and multiple correlation matrix were selected to be included in the index. The index (Coralligenous Assemblage Index, CAI) that we proposed was based on three selected metrics (Bryozoa percent cover, sludge percent cover, builder species percent cover) and considers depth; it was positively and significantly linked to anthropization (related to water quality). The 38 stations studied with theoretically good to bad environmental conditions were classified in levels of status in accordance with our field work knowledge. CAI variation was validated with three stations sampled with 30 other photos. This index could be an effective tool for the assessment of the ecological quality of coralligenous communities. It could be applied in the context of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive as well as in conservation and sustainable management of the marine environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soils perform a number of essential functions affecting management goals. Soil functions were assessed by measuring physical, chemical, and biological properties in a regional assessment of conventional (CON) and alternative (ALT) management practices at eight sites within the Great Plains. The results, reported in accompanying papers, provide excellent data for assessing how management practices collectively affect agronomic and environmental soil functions that benefit both farmers and society. Our objective was to use the regional data as an input for two new assessment tools to evaluate their potential and sensitivity for detecting differences (aggradation or degradation) in management systems. The soil management assessment framework (SMAF) and the agro-ecosystem performance assessment tool (AEPAT) were used to score individual soil properties at each location relative to expected conditions based on inherent soil-forming factors and to compute index values that provide an overall assessment of the agronomic and environmental impact of the CON and ALT practices. SMAF index values were positively correlated with grain yield (an agronomic function) and total organic matter (an agronomic and environmental function). They were negatively correlated with soil nitrate concentration at harvest (an indicator of environmental function). There was general agreement between the two assessment tools when used to compare management practices. Users can measure a small number of soil properties and use one of these tools to easily assess the effectiveness of soil management practices. A higher score in either tool identifies more environmentally and agronomically sustainable management. Temporal variability in measured indicators makes dynamic assessments of management practices essential. Water-filled pore space, aggregate stability, particulate organic matter, and microbial biomass were sensitive to management and should be included in studies aimed at improving soil management. Reductions in both tillage and fallow combined with crop rotation has resulted in improved soil function (e.g., nutrient cycling, organic C content, and productivity) throughout the Great Plains.

AB  - Temperate forests of Chile exhibit high biodiversity, which generates a wide range of habitats for wildlife. These valuable natural ecosystems have been affected by major natural and anthropogenic processes that have reduced habitats, resulting in serious ecological problems, given both the high endemism of certain avian groups in these forests and the complexity of their habitat selection. Continued degradation and ecosystem problems could lead to the extinction of such groups. In spite of this possibility, ecologically valuable wildlife conservation is seldom integrated into forest management decision-making processes. This study aims to integrate wildlife into forest management, identifying potential habitats for two endemic birds of high ecological value, the Black throated Huet-Huet (Pteroptochos tamii), and the Ochre-flanked Tapaculo (Eugralla paradoxa). Both species inhabit an ecotonal area between evergreen and sclerophyllous forests, making them high-quality bio-indicator species for the degree of conservation of temperate forest. The integration of environmental information and a geostatistical model based on the criterion of maximum entropy (Maxent model) identifies the most important variables that explain the presence of each species. Pteroptochos tamii is less restrictive in its choice of habitat than Eugralla paradoxa, requiring merely certain topographical condition (elevation, ground slope and aspect). However Eugralla paradoxa requires not only the same topographical features, but also eco-geographical characteristics such as distance to trails, waterways and ecotones. Maxent analysis showed that for both species, the model most capable of predicting their choice of microhabitat was not random based, but rather one based on topographical and environmental variables. The integration of Maxent and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools could help to solve problems of wildlife habitat conservation and forest planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are constantly changing due to natural and anthropogenic stressors. When dealing with such 'moving targets', one of the greatest challenges faced by scientists, managers and policy makers is to use appropriate time scales for environmental assessments. However, most aquatic systems lack monitoring data, and if a programme does exist, rarely have data been collected for more than a few years. Hence, it is often difficult or impossible to determine the nature and timing of ecosystem changes based on these short-term datasets. Furthermore, as environmental assessments are typically performed after a problem is identified, critical data regarding pre-disturbance (or reference) conditions are rarely available. Here, I summarize some recent studies employing lake sediment analyses (i.e. palaeolimnology) that have provided retrospective assessments of ecosystem changes that have been emerging slowly and often innocuously 'under the radar'. My examples include the identification of legacy effects of acid rain and logging, namely long-term declines in calcium concentrations in softwater lakes, which have led to significant repercussions for ecosystem services. I then show that past trajectories of aerial pollution from the burgeoning oil sands operations of western Canada can be tracked using environmental proxies preserved in dated sediment cores, and how these data can be used to determine the relative contributions of natural versus industrial sources of pollutants. I conclude by reviewing how palaeolimnological analyses have linked climate change with the proliferation of harmful blue-green algal (cyanobacterial) blooms, even without the addition of limiting nutrients. Collectively, these studies show that effective ecosystem management, particularly for incremental environmental stressors, requires temporal sampling windows that are not readily available with standard monitoring, but can be supplemented with high-resolution lake sediment analyses.

AB  - Human occupancy of beaches is an important cause of environmental and landscape transformations, some of which are identifiable through vegetation analysis. Commonly, arboreal vegetation has been socially perceived in a positive way, as it contributes to the creation of environments appreciated as beautiful and natural. This type of vegetation has been recreated in urban coastal areas worldwide, including those located in arid environments where it is not always common or endemic to these areas. The typology of plant species, human impacts on beach environments, and the social perception of vegetation contrast were analyzed to understand the landscape influence and human impact on beach environments from arid regions. The study was carried out on 12 beaches with different degrees of human occupation (4 urban, 4 semi-urban and 4 natural) in Gran Canaria island (Spain). The results indicate that the number of exotic and mderal (first to colonize human disturbed environments) species increases with human occupation of the beaches. A greater number of arboreal species were identified on urban beaches, while shrub and herbaceous species were more common on less occupied beaches (semi-urban and natural). However, when surveyed, the users of semi-urban and natural beaches, considered that arboreal vegetation compose a more attractive landscape than other with herbs or shrubs, even though tree species appear occasionally on these types of beaches. This inconsistency identifies a conflict of values between the development and conservation of beaches in arid environments. This study can be used to establish environmental sustainability strategies on beaches. Conservation and environmental information about ecosystem services related with indigenous plant species is and important issue for integrated management on beaches from arid regions, especially those that may be urbanized in the near future.

AB  - Temporary rivers comprise a significant proportion of river networks globally and their prevalence is expected to increase as a result of future climate change and anthropogenic water resource pressures. Despite this, the influence of drying events on freshwater biomonitoring tools within temporary rivers has received limited research attention within temperate environments. This study examines the effects of flow permanence and longitudinal drying patterns on selected biomonitoring indices used within the United Kingdom to assess the ecological status of waterbodies within the context of the Water Framework Directive. These indices are based on faunal tolerances and preferences to nutrient enrichment (BMWP, ASPT and Ntaxa) and flow velocity (Family LIFE). Long-term biomonitoring data from four rivers within southern England were examined, two of which dry longitudinally from the headwaters and two that dry within the mid-reaches. The results demonstrate that all of the biomonitoring indices examined differed significantly between each 'hydrological class' (i.e. temporary versus perennial reaches), with those based on absolute scores (BMWP and Ntaxa) displaying greater differences compared to those derived using scores standardized by the number of taxa recorded (ASPT and Family LIFE). The individual influence of drying pattern did not have a significant effect on any biomonitoring index. However, the interaction between the hydrological class and drying pattern significantly influenced all biomonitoring indices, indicating that the effect of flow intermittency on the metrics examined differed between drying patterns. Flow permanence explained a greater amount of statistical variation compared to the hydrological class and highlights the importance of the duration of flowing conditions on biomonitoring indices. The results indicate that flow intermittency has a significant effect on freshwater biomonitoring tools and highlights the need to incorporate this knowledge into existing management and environmental policy frameworks to prevent the misclassification of the ecological status of temporary streams.

AB  - To detect changes in ecosystems due to human impact, experimental designs must include replicates at the appropriate scale to avoid pseudoreplication. Although coastal lagoons, with their highly variable environmental factors and biological assemblages, are relatively well-studied systems, very little is known about their natural scales of variation. In this study, we investigate the spatio-temporal scales of variability in the Mar Menor coastal lagoon (SE Spain) using structured hierarchical sampling designs, mixed and permutational multi-variate analyses of variance, and ordination multi-variate analyses applied to hydrographical parameters, nutrients, chlorophyll a and ichthyoplankton in the water column, and to macrophyte and fish benthic assemblages.
   Lagoon processes in the Mar Menor show heterogeneous patterns at different temporal and spatial scales. The water column characteristics (including nutrient concentration) showed small-scale spatio-temporal variability, from 10(0) to 10(1) km and from fortnightly to seasonally. Biological features (chlorophyll a concentration and ichthyoplankton assemblage descriptors) showed monthly changes and spatial patterns at the scale of 10(0) (chlorophyll a) - 10(1) km (ichthyoplankton). Benthic assemblages (macrophytes and fishes) showed significant differences between types of substrates in the same locality and between localities, according to horizontal gradients related with confinement in the lagoon, at the scale of 10(0)-10(1) km. The vertical zonation of macrophyte assemblages (at scales of 10(1)-10(2) CM) overlaps changes in substrata and horizontal gradients. Seasonal patterns in vegetation biomass were not significant, but the significant interaction between Locality and Season indicated that the seasons of maximum and minimum biomass depend on local environmental conditions. Benthic fish assemblages showed no significant patterns at the monthly scale but did show seasonal patterns. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The catastrophic effects that oil spills have on coastal resources, the complex task of decision making during oil spill response, and the need for operational reasoning induce decision makers to seek science-based decisions. In light of these circumstances, spatially explicit, economic-impact assessment models can deliver an immediate assessment tool for preliminary oil-spill damage cost-quantification using a monetary unit as an indicator. The model presented in this study is based on an ecosystem-services assessment using economic evaluation methods such as travel cost, benefit transfer, and direct-market pricing. Ecosystem services were estimated for the 92-km-long Lithuanian coast using existing geographic information system (GIS) data sets. Outputs from the ecosystem-services assessment indicated that the total, annual economic value of biological and socioeconomic resources in the Lithuanian coastal zone (532 km(2)) amounts to more than (sic)524 million/y (approximately US$690 million). Estimated values include marine biotopes, (sic)307 million/y; recreational areas, (sic)215 million/y; seabirds, (sic)1.1 million/y; and commercial fisheries, (sic)0.2 million/y. The estimation of monetary revenue from coastal resources was integrated with scenario-based cost estimation of damage supported by the Baltic Sea's three-dimensional particle-tracking model, Seatrack Web. Model testing was performed for 30 km of vulnerable Lithuanian coast with due consideration of its environmental, social, and economic importance to the SE Baltic Sea and its pertinent oil pollution risks. Results show that monetary losses of coastal resources depend highly on the oil type, impact area, meteorological conditions, and particularly the dispersion of the pollutant in the marine environment, by affecting target marine and socioeconomic resources. The damage cost-assessment tool is applicable in every coastal zone and pertinent to decision makers seeking preliminary cost estimates of damage and compensation for the damage caused by oil spills.

AB  - Leaf traits are good indicators of ecosystem functioning and can affect herbivory and leaf reflectance patterns, allowing a better understanding of changes in environmental conditions, such those observed during forest natural regeneration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the intraspecific variation in leaf traits and their influence on the pattern of herbivory and leaf reflectance in three species distributed along a successional gradient (early, intermediate and late stages) in a tropical dry forest (TDF) in northern Minas Gerais, Brazil. We sampled individuals of the following abundant tree species that occurred in multiple successional stages: Cenostigma pluviosum, Handroanthus ochraceus, and Tabebuia reticulata. We collected 10 leaves from each tree to determine the contents of chlorophyll a, b, and total, carotenoids and water, as well as the percentage of leaf area removed by herbivores and leaf specific mass (LSM). We also measured five spectral reflectance indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI, Simple Ratio-SR, modified Normalized Difference-nND, modified SR-mSR and Water Index-WI) using a portable spectrometer. Our results showed intraspecific differences in most leaf traits along the successional gradient, suggesting that local adaptation may play an important role in plant community assembly. However, herbivory only differed for H. ochraceus in early and intermediate stages, but it was not affected by the leaf traits considered here. Spectral reflectance indices also differed among successional stage for all species together and for each species separately, except for T. reticulata in intermediate and late stages. Thus, leaf spectral signatures may be an important tool to the remote detection of different successional stages in TDFs, with implications for forest management.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine the trophic state of agricultural reservoirs within the four major watersheds and evaluate ecosystem health using a multi-metric fish modeling approach of the lentic ecosystem health assessment (LEHA) in South Korea. Fish survey for the LEHA model was sampled twice from 12 reservoirs (oligotrophic to hypereutrophic reservoirs) during 2008-2010 along with data analysis of water quality monitored by the Ministry of Environment, Korea. The fish sampling gears used in the field were fyke net, trammel net, casting net, and kick net. A regression analysis of N:P ratios showed a negative linear function with total phosphorous (TP) values but not with total nitrogen. The greater relationship to TP was due to low variability and high ambient concentrations of N relative to P. The plots of "TSI (CHL)-TSI (TP)'' and "TSI (CHL)-TSI (SD)'' suggest that other factors other than phosphorus limited algal biomass (CHL-TP < 0), and that non-algal particles dominated light attenuation (CHL-SD < 0). Nutrients input into the reservoirs during the Asian monsoon exceeded actual nutrient availability for phytoplankton growth. A regression model of the fish trophic components against log-transformed TP showed that the proportions of omnivore and insectivore fish had a positive linear function and negative relationship with TP, respectively. According to the multi-metric LEHA model for agricultural reservoirs, the model value averaged 26 +/- 6.5, indicating a "Fair'' condition. Overall, ecosystem health was directly influenced by organic matter pollution and high algal production. This new tool appeared particularly relevant to detect the contamination effects on fish communities in reservoirs. The new national biological monitoring methodology in lentic ecosystem would be used as a key tool for ecological restorations and species conservations in Korean lentic ecosystems.

AB  - The effects of management in maintaining high rice yield with less water have received increasing attention in sub-tropical regions where seasonal drought is very severe. To test whether water management affects soil ecological process we compared the soil nematode communities in paddy field soils following water management treatments imposed during late rice cropping. The treatments were continuously flooded rice cultivation (CF), noncontinuously flooded rice cultivations without (ZM) and with (M) rice straw mulching. A sequential extraction procedure involving Baermann extraction (Baermann) followed by centrifugal sugar flotation (centrifugation) was used to extract the whole nematode community. Based on the analysis of nematode abundance, genera composition, trophic groups and other ecological indices (Margalef richness index, Shannon index, maturity index, enrichment index and structure index), water management significantly affected the nematode community, with the non-continuously flooded condition, in particular combination with rice straw mulching (M), stimulating nematode development. There was a high abundance, richness, and structure in the nematode community in mulched treatments, indicating improved biodiversity and biological interactions. We hypothesize that soil microclimate and available food resources are affected by water management and directly or indirectly influence the establishment of different nematode communities. We suggested that studies aiming to test natural or anthropogenic influences on nematodes might be distorted by sole use of the Baermann method. Although the Baermann step in a sequential extraction procedure gave valuable information on nematode responses to soil treatments, it was not sufficient to detect effects on the whole nematode community. Our results demonstrate that the sequential extraction procedure is an effective tool to obtain comprehensive information on the whole nematode community, with both steps providing complementary ecologically relevant information, on how the soil ecosystem is affected by human management.

AB  - Mediterranean Temporary Ponds (MTPs) constitute priority habitat under the European Union Habitats' Directive. They are inhabited by rare species and subjected to unstable environmental conditions. Lakes and ponds act as early indicators of climate change, to which high altitude ecosystems are especially vulnerable. This study presents a full dataset of the geo-environmental parameters of such habitats (MTPs) along with their current ecological status for the first time. Furthermore, this paper aims to address the lack of basic geo-environmental background on the network of MTPs of Mt. Oiti concerning their geological, geomorphological, mineralogical and geochemical characteristics along with the pressures received from various activities. The study area is located in a mountainous Natura 2000 site of Central Greece, which hosts four MTPs. Fieldwork and sampling of water and bottom sediments were carried out during dry and wet periods between 2012 and 2014. Electrical Resistivity Tomography measurements identified synforms shaped under the ponds that topography does not always adopt them, mostly due to erosion procedures. The most significant feature, distinguishing those pond waters from any other province water bodies is the extremely low content of all studied ions (including NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, PO43-, HCO3-, SO42-, Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Gd, Ge, Hf, Hg, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Rb, S, Sb, Se, Si, Sn, Sr, Ti, U, V, W, Zn, and Zr). MTPs water bodies are of bicarbonate dominant type, and a fresh meteoric water origin is suggested. The main pressures identified were grazing and trampling by vehicles. MTPs of Mt. Oiti were classified according to their ecological status form excellent to medium. Our results can contribute to a better understanding of the mountainous temporary ponds development in the Mediterranean environment.

AB  - The aquatic environment is known to contain a variety of natural and anthropogenic compounds that are capable of interacting with the genetic material of aquatic organisms. The increases in the levels of these anthropogenic contaminants, associated with widespread industrialisation, has led to the requirement for reliable methodologies to monitor their potential impact upon exposed aquatic organisms. Of the molecular techniques currently available, the P-32-postlabelling assay for the detection of DNA adducts offers considerable potential for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of genotoxin exposure. Here we describe several studies in which the technique was adapted for evaluation in two marine bioindicator species the common mussel Mytilus edulis and the flatfish Limanda limanda. Laboratory studies in which M. edulis specimens were exposed to 2-aminofluorene and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide confirmed the species' capacity to form genotoxin-related adducts. However, in further studies, no exposure-related adducts could be detected in M. edulis specimens placed in mesocosms containing environmentally realistic levels of anthropogenic contaminants. Biologically significant levels of adducts were detected in L. limanda specimens exposed to sediment bound contaminants under controlled conditions, although the levels did not appear to be statistically significant. An in situ study in which adduct levels were determined in L. limanda specimens from two sites of contrasting contamination levels proved to be more conclusive. The results were both biologically and statistically significant, suggesting that adduct levels could well be related to the levels of sediment-bound contaminants. Together the studies confirmed that the determination of the levels of DNA adducts could be used as indicators of the exposure of aquatic organisms to environmental genotoxins.

AB  - Limited reviews have investigated sources, behaviour and health risks of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the wastewater-human pathway. The current review seeks to: (1) determine hotspot sources of ARGs, and their behaviour and fate in wastewaters; (2) discuss ARG health risks, and risk factors; and (3) highlight future research directions. Diverse ARGs conferring single and multi-drug resistance to common and last-resort antimicrobials are widely reported. Hotspot sources of ARGs include medical facilities, pharmaceutical industries, aquaculture and animal systems. Non-engineered landfills, on-site sanitation, funeral parlours and gravesites constitute under-studied potential hotspot sources. Hydrological processes, wind and vectors mobilize ARGs from sources into aquatic systems. Wastewater treatment processes, the nature of ARGs and environmental conditions control the behaviour and fate of ARGs. Consumption of contaminated food and water, vectors, inhalation and dermal contact transfer ARGs from wastewaters to humans. Health risks include development of antimicrobial resistance, although evidence directly linking ARGs in wastewater to resistance remains weak. Ecological risks include shifts in physiological behaviour, community structure and ecosystem functions, including expression of shock-responses and virulence, biofilm formation and mutations. These shifts could increase colonization ability and survival of pathogenic microbes, thereby posing significant ecological, human and animal health risks. Overall, the behaviour and risks of ARGs are controlled by complex human-environmental interactions, and have far-reaching policy implications, hence ARGs can be considered as a 'super-wicked' problem. To minimize the risks, a conceptual framework entailing a ten-point strategy is highlighted. Under-studied hotspot sources, behaviour and fate, human ecotoxicology and risk assessments warrant further research.

AB  - Fish-based indices are becoming important bioassessment tools for estuaries since the European Water Framework Directive included fish as a biological quality element to be monitored for the assessment of ecological status of those systems. In particular, data on species composition and abundance of the ichthyofauna must be used to evaluate the ecological status of European estuaries, but other factors like measures of fish health are also considered important metrics. These indicators of fish health include infections by parasites. The common goby, Pomastoschistus microps, and the Lusitanian toadfish, Halobatrachus didactylus, are fairly sedentary fish, very abundant in Portuguese estuaries, and were used to investigate if parasitism in fishes in transitional waters is a good metric to reflect anthropogenic impacts in the environment. No significant relationships were observed between the parasite levels in these two species and the intensity of human pressures, either at a large or small spatial scale. Results obtained also are contrary to the generalized idea that a higher proportion of parasitized fish necessarily reflects a decrease in their condition as a result of habitat degradation. A high degree of temporal and ontogenetic variability in the parasite levels of both P. microps and H. didactylus was detected, which make it difficult to establish the scores for this hypothetical metric even if significant relationships between parasite levels and human pressures are identified in the future. Therefore, the present work does not uphold the hypothesis that parasitism in fish is a good metric to assess ecological water quality in transitional waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study of pastoral resources can take different approaches with the main goal of characterizing pasture vegetation and its potential carrying capacity. In recent times, the pasture-type approach has been developed in several Alpine areas - on a regional and on a district scale - starting from sward surveys carried out taking the approach formerly developed by the French pastoral school. The pasture-type approach may play an important role in defining the management of mountain and marginal environments where grazing pressure reduction remarkably affects the agro-ecosystems functions (production, landscape, wildlife, recreation, etc.). This approach is based on the concept of pasture type, which could be defined as a semi-natural vegetation (mainly exploited by grazing animals), rather homogeneous in terms of botanic composition and influenced by environmental factors and agro-pastoral management. This paper presents the pasture-type approach by discussing the results of two large studies carried out in two areas of the south side of the Alps (Piedmont and Veneto). In order to identify pasture types, the vegetation composition was assessed with a point quadrat method. It allowed the computation of species-specific contribution, and of sward forage value and carrying capacity, after a multivariate statistical procedure for type classification and ordination. The site conditions (altitude, slope, aspect) and other environmental variables were surveyed. Moreover, to characterize the pasture types from the point of view of the ecological and management factors affecting vegetation composition, the Landolt indicators were used. The results achieved in the two areas were synthesised and organised into reference technical tools with the aim of using the pasture-type approach for pastoral planning. For each study area an identification key to recognize pasture types was drafted, and a handbook containing the technical sheets for pasture type identification, description and management was published. The approach here described enhances the knowledge on mountain pastoral resources, laying the foundations for their conservative management.

AB  - Background: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a conservative estimate on rates of sea-level rise of 3.8 mm yr(-1) at the end of the 21(st) century, which may have a detrimental effect on ecologically important mangrove ecosystems. Understanding factors influencing the long-term resilience of these communities is critical but poorly understood. We investigate ecological resilience in a coastal mangrove community from the Galapagos Islands over the last 2700 years using three research questions: What are the 'fast and slow' processes operating in the coastal zone? Is there evidence for a threshold response? How can the past inform us about the resilience of the modern system?
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Palaeoecological methods (AMS radiocarbon dating, stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13)) were used to reconstruct sedimentation rates and ecological change over the past 2,700 years at Diablas lagoon, Isabela, Galapagos. Bulk geochemical analysis was also used to determine local environmental changes, and salinity was reconstructed using a diatom transfer function. Changes in relative sea level (RSL) were estimated using a glacio-isostatic adjustment model. Non-linear behaviour was observed in the Diablas mangrove ecosystem as it responded to increased salinities following exposure to tidal inundations. A negative feedback was observed which enabled the mangrove canopy to accrete vertically, but disturbances may have opened up the canopy and contributed to an erosion of resilience over time. A combination of drier climatic conditions and a slight fall in RSL then resulted in a threshold response, from a mangrove community to a microbial mat.
   Conclusions/Significance: Palaeoecological records can provide important information on the nature of non-linear behaviour by identifying thresholds within ecological systems, and in outlining responses to 'fast' and 'slow' environmental change between alternative stable states. This study highlights the need to incorporate a long-term ecological perspective when designing strategies for maximizing coastal resilience.

AB  - Transitional waters (TWs) provide ecosystem goods and services that are essential for the well-being of human populations. These unpredictable aquatic systems, characterised by large environmental fluctuations, are under severe stress due to human activities. Increasing pressures (e. g. over-harvesting, eutrophication, habitat loss) inevitably lead to the degradation of these ecosystems. Analysis of the complexity of species distribution patterns within and among TW habitats is relevant to understanding the underlying processes and promoting appropriate management strategies. Assessment of the trophic status is one of the most critical aspects of TWs. Untangling the relevance of anthropogenic nutrient inputs from internal biogeochemical processes is of primary importance in defining appropriate restoration strategies. Biotic indices have been suggested as an operational tool to assess environmental quality in TWs. However, the application in TWs of indices developed for coastal waters can give distorted results (e. g. low species diversity and high abundance are natural features). The BITS approach provides a rapid assessment of ecological quality, although its sensitivity in reflecting field conditions remains to be assessed. The major challenge to TWs management is to couple long-term conservation with productive activities. This goal can be achieved using an integrated approach, forecasting conservation of TW ecosystem functioning together with sustainable economic development. North-western Adriatic TW habitats have been exploited for centuries and major shifts in ecological processes have occurred. In this study, knowledge of the ecological features of these habitats is summarised and analysed using recent ecological tools. Based on these findings, possible strategies for conservative management have been discussed.

AB  - Changes in the frequency of individuals with gross abnormalities can be used as an indicator of changes in the occurrence of biologically significant levels of developmental toxicants in the habitats of natural populations. The precise nature of the defects and their relative distribution can often provide clues as to the type of contamination. Such inferences clearly require baseline data on the frequency of such deformities, and that is the purpose of this paper. For Mid-continent lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) nesting at La Perouse Bay, the current rate of gross external abnormalities among embryos and near-hatch goslings at hatch is 3.937 X 10(-4) per egg (95% confidence limits 1.7053 X 10(-4) to 6.507 X 10(-4)) and is consistent with estimates made for other species in minimally or uncontaminated habitats. Among the abnormal specimens, however, the relative distribution of defects of the beak and eye is not consistent with rates of spontaneous abnormalities reported for chickens. If the higher relative frequency of beak defects persists in future or other geographic samples displaying overall levels of abnormalities higher than our benchmark, then contaminants acting as type 1 teratogens should be suspected. Of the compounds this increasingly agriculturally dependent species is exposed to, insecticides rather than herbicides would be the more likely class of candidates. We urge others who may have similar data on other species to make it more broadly available since such benchmarks are crucial for the use of birds as bioindicators of environmental conditions. To that end, we offer our web site as a place where data on and images of abnormal specimens can be posted and, within certain constraints, will curate submitted specimens.

AB  - The organophosphate pesticides pollution in the Volturno River and its environmental impact on the Tyrrhenian Sea (Central Mediterranean Sea) were estimated. Eight selected organophosphate pesticides (diazinon, dimethoate, malathion, chlorpyrifos, pirimiphos-methyl, fenitrothion, methidathion and toldofos-methyl) were determined in the water dissolved phase, suspended particulate matter and sediment samples collected from 10 sites in different seasons. Total organophosphate pesticides concentrations ranged from 0.12 to 65.09 ng L-1 in water (as the sum of the water dissolved phase and suspended particulate matter) and from 1.19 to 23.17 ng g(-1) in sediment samples. It has been calculated that the discharge of pollutants from the Volturno river into the Tyrrhenian Sea was about 71.815, 31 g year(-1); for this reason the river is to be considered one of the main mouths of organophosphate pesticides in the Tyrrhenian Sea. In relation to environmental risk assessment, the concentrations of most OPPs in water and sediments from the Volturno River and its estuary were lower than guideline values, but the mean concentration of chlorpyrifos (5.41 ng L-1) in the Volturno River and Estuary has been shown that the ecological integrity of the river watercourse is possibly at risk.

AB  - Riparian zones ensure freshwater ecosystem processes such as microclimate regulation, organic matter inputs, and fine substrate retention. These processes illustrate the importance of riparian zones for freshwater ecosystem functioning, maintaining biodiversity, and mitigating the effects of anthropogenic pressures on aquatic ecosystems. We aimed to determine the freshwater invertebrate biological traits that are most affected by anthropogenic stressors in the riparian zones of 210 Neotropical savanna headwater streams. We assessed % canopy cover over the streambed, % fine bottom substrate, % leaf pack, substrate heterogeneity, and water temperature. Firstly, we identified bioindicator taxa in response to each local metric gradient. We assessed the functional response, based on biological traits of bioindicators previously selected. We identified 324,015 specimens belonging to 84 freshwater invertebrate taxa. Fifty-one taxa (60%) were bioindicators of anthropogenic stressors. We found three main sets of traits. (1) a set of traits linked to increased disturbance (higher percentage of fine sediments), consisting of organisms with aquatic adult stages, spherical body shape, and long adult life stages. (2) A set of traits linked to lower disturbance (higher substrate heterogeneity), including taxa with short or very short lifespans that live attached to substrates. (3) A set of traits linked to higher water temperature, including organisms with short adult lifespans and lower body flexibility. These patterns suggest that the stressors act as environmental filters and do not act independently on single traits, but rather, selecting sets of biological traits that facilitate taxa surviving and persisting in local environmental conditions. Our results support the development of powerful evaluation tools for environmental managers and decision makers. Because degraded freshwater communities respond in similar ways across large biogeographic areas, these sets of traits can be used for ecological monitoring efforts along other tropical savanna headwaters worldwide.

AB  - Articles in the media that point to logging as the main driver of tropical forest loss have become commonplace. However, this is a misconception that can be attributed to inadequate knowledge of actual forest conditions on the one hand, and to the conflation of logging and agricultural clearance on the other hand. This article, written by a practitioner with a thorough knowledge of the tropical forest context, sets out to assess the impacts of logging on dense tropical rainforests in Africa and South America. In the interests of accuracy, the article distinguishes between the different phases of a logging operation: establishment of the base camp, building of logging roads to ship out the timber and actual felling. Different scenarios are described according to the richness of forest environments, where harvested volumes vary from 3 to 15 m(3)/ha. These estimations confirm that the destruction of forest cover is so low that, except in radical situations, logging is not a threat to the sustainability of tropical forests. Opening up road networks and logging roads affects 4.5% to 5.5% of forest cover. Clear-felled areas never exceed 4% of the forest cover and the figure drops to less than 2% in highly or moderately species-rich forests. Logging is therefore directly responsible for only 5.5% to 8.5% of forest destruction. Although the figure can rise to 12% to 16% in rich forest environments, it does not take into account the natural dynamics of biomass reconstitution between logging sequences. In Southeast Asia where logging is more intensive due to very high commercial potential, forest cover reconstitutes within 20 years. While the economic value of dense tropical rainforests declines with logging, their ecological and biological value remains virtually intact.

AB  - Peatland drainage can have major ecological and biogeochemical impacts on aquatic environments in boreal regions. In the Sanginjoki river catchment in North Ostrobothnia, Finland, peatland drainage is suspected to increase the acidity of recipient waters. Possible reasons are acid sulphate soils (ASS) or black schist deposits, which occur especially in lower parts of the river basin, or increased transport of humic substances. It is not known how long acidification has affected water quality and biota in the river. To study historical pH levels, we examined sediment cores from two ponds in the main channel of the Sanginjoki river and one small lake in the Sanginjoki catchment. Diatom and geochemical analysis and Cs-137-derived chronology were combined to estimate historical pH levels and changes in land use practices. The results suggest that changes in land use in the 1970s have affected runoff acidity. During that period, there was a change in diatom communities and sediment geochemistry, indicating that land use in the catchment area, most likely peatland drainage, had probably changed suspended sediment fluxes and pH conditions. The results also showed that changes in pH levels probably did not originate from ASS or black schist horizons, but rather mainly from humic substances leached from the catchment area. However, ASS and black schist deposits may have had an influence on pH levels in lower parts of the Sanginjoki river during dry/wet periods. Thus, the findings suggest that future changes in land use and land management are likely to cause increased acidity in the Sanginjoki catchment. Therefore actual or potential acidification of river water should be included in risk assessments and future land use practices, and should be avoided by not changing natural humic-rich ecosystems.

AB  - The term payments for environmental services (PES) has rapidly gained popularity, with its focus on market-based mechanisms for enhancing environmental services (ES). Current use of the term, however, covers a broad spectrum of interactions between ES suppliers and beneficiaries. A broader class of mechanisms pursues ES enhancement through compensation or rewards. Such mechanisms can be analyzed on the basis of how they meet four conditions: realistic, conditional, voluntary, and pro-poor. Based on our action research in Asia in the Rewarding Upland Poor for Environmental Services (RUPES) program since 2002, we examine three paradigms: commoditized ES (CES), compensation for opportunities skipped (COS), and co-investment in (environmental) stewardship (CIS). Among the RUPES action research sites, there are several examples of CIS with a focus on assets (natural + human + social capital) that can be expected to provide future flows of ES. CES, equivalent to a strict definition of PES, may represent an abstraction rather than a current reality. COS is a challenge when the legality of opportunities to reduce ES is contested. The primary difference between CES, COS, and CIS is the way in which conditionality is achieved, with additional variation in the scale (individual, household, or community) at which the voluntary principle takes shape. CIS approaches have the greatest opportunity to be pro-poor, as both CES and COS presuppose property rights that the rural poor often do not have. CIS requires and reinforces trust building after initial conflicts over the consequences of resource use on ES have been clarified and a realistic joint appraisal is obtained. CIS will often be part of a multiscale approach to the regeneration and survival of natural capital, alongside respect and appreciation for the guardians and stewards of landscapes.

AB  - This review summarizes the historic, correlative field evidence and experimental research that implicate cultural eutrophication as a major cause of seagrass disappearance. We summarize the underlying physiological responses of seagrass species, the potential utility of various parameters as indicators of nutrient enrichment in seagrasses, the relatively sparse available information about environmental conditions that exacerbate eutrophication effects, and the better known array of indirect stressors imposed by nutrient over-enrichment that influence seagrass growth and survival. Seagrass recovery following nutrient reductions is examined, as well as the status of modeling efforts to predict seagrass response to changing nutrient regimes.
   The most common mechanism invoked or demonstrated for seagrass decline under nutrient over-enrichment is light reduction through stimulation of high-biomass algal overgrowth as epiphytes and macroalgae in shallow coastal areas, and as phytoplankton in deeper coastal waters. Direct physiological responses such as ammonium toxicity and water-column nitrate inhibition through internal carbon limitation may also contribute. Seagrass decline under nutrient enrichment appears to involve indirect and feedback mechanisms, and is manifested as sudden shifts in seagrass abundance rather than continuous, gradual changes in parallel with rates of increased nutrient additions. Depending on the species, interactions of high salinity, high temperature, and low light have been shown to exacerbate the adverse effects of nutrient over-enrichment. An array of indirect effects of nutrient enrichment can accelerate seagrass disappearance, including sediment re-suspension from seagrass loss, increased system respiration and resulting oxygen stress, depressed advective water exchange from thick macroalgal growth, biogeochemical alterations such as sediment anoxia with increased hydrogen sulfide concentrations, and internal nutrient loading via enhanced nutrient fluxes from sediments to the overlying water. Indirect effects on trophic structure can also be critically important, for example, the loss of herbivores, through increased hypoxia/anoxia and other habitat shifts, that would have acted as "ecological engineers" in promoting seagrass survival by controlling algal overgrowth; and shifts favoring exotic grazers that out-compete seagrasses for space. Evidence suggests that natural seagrass population shifts are disrupted, slowed or indefinitely blocked by cultural eutrophication, and there are relatively few known examples of seagrass meadow recovery following nutrient reductions.
   Reliable biomarkers as early indicators of nutrient over-enriched seagrass meadows would benefit coastal resource managers in improving protective measures. Seagrasses can be considered as "long-term" integrators (days to weeks) of nutrient availability, especially through analyses of their tissue content, and of activities of enzymes such as nitrate reductase and alkaline phosphatase. The ratio of leaf nitrogen content to leaf mass has also shown promise as a "nutrient pollution indicator" for the seagrass Zostera marina, with potential application to other species. In modeling efforts, seagrass response to nutrient loading has proven difficult to quantify beyond localized areas because long-term data consistent in quality are generally lacking, and high inter-annual variability in abundance and productivity depending upon stochastic meteorological and hydrographic conditions.
   Efforts to protect remaining seagrass meadows from damage and loss under eutrophication, within countries and across regions, are generally lacking or weak and ineffective. Research needs to further understand about seagrasses and eutrophication should emphasize experimental studies to assess the response of a wider range of species to chronic, low-level as well as acute, pulsed nutrient enrichment. These experiments should be conducted in the field or in large-scale mesocosms following appropriate acclimation, and should emphasize factor interactions (N, P, C; turbidity; temperature; herbivory) to more closely simulate reality in seagrass ecosystems. They should scale up to address processes that occur over larger scales, including food-web dynamics that involve highly mobile predators and herbivores. Without any further research, however, one point is presently very clear: Concerted local and national actions, thus far mostly lacking, are needed worldwide to protect remaining seagrass meadows from accelerating cultural eutrophication in rapidly urbanizing coastal zones.

AB  - The assessment of opportunities of various methods of complex ecologo-biogeochemical monitoring of objects of the accumulated environmental damage (tailings dams) in modern biospheric conditions is very significant. Organisms of different levels of the organization are applied: from infusorians to the highest mammals and the human body. In addition to direct determination of levels of toxicants in organism researchers often use their morphometric parameters, in particular - the fluctuating asymmetry. Calculation of this parameter for sheet plate of the birch growing near the Unalsky tailings dam (North Ossetia) was compared to determination of biologically active sulfur-containing components (metallotioneins, glutathione, cysteine) and pigments (a-chlorophyll, b-chlorophyll, carotene). In the technogenic horizons of urbozem and natural soils, leaves and hay crops of plants the content of microelements is found. In soils and urbozem it is revealed: Pb - 10.5-589, Cu - 7.0-891, Zn - 23-4156, Cd - 0.2-91, As - 5-18.8, Se - 0.05-4.6 mg/kg. High positive correlation between the content of Pb in soils and asymmetry of birch leaves (r = 0.89) is established. On other metals correlation was low (r = 0.18-0.21). Floristic inspection found noticeable decrease in phytovariety and biomass on technogenic platforms. Value of the fluctuating asymmetry is moderately correlated with amount of metals in soils and leaves. The same relation is found between its value and content of glutathione and metallotionein in extracts of birch leaves. Correlation with levels of pigments (a-chlorophyll and carotinoids) was not observed. Comparison of the fluctuating asymmetry of leaves of white birch with the total content of metals and the concentration in water extract confirms certain correlation between these parameters. Higher concentration of the sum of metals and sulfur-containing biologically active agents is followed by increase in value of asymmetry.

AB  - Objective: Nanoparticles have ecotoxicological potential into the environment. The purpose of this paper is a comparative assessment of the effect of Zn and Cu nanoparticles on Eisenia fetida and the activity of soil exoenzymes under the conditions of a model experiment.
   Methods: Morpho-functional indices of E. fetida were studied when 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of soil was applied to the soil. Calculation of bioaccumulation, the degree of absorption and rate of accumulation of zinc and copper in the body of E. fetida was determined. Also, the activity of soil enzymes was investigated. In the experiment, was using metal nanoparticles Zn and Cu were used in concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg in natural soil. Was the study of the effects of NPs, copper and zinc on parameters E. fetida and the level of the soil exoenzymes were carried out.
   Results: The weight of the earthworm increased with soil contamination of CuNPs and decreased against the background of the introduction of ZnNPs. The indicators of the activity system of the enzymes earthworms were sensitive to the effects of metal nanoparticles. Soil enzymes showed selective sensitivity to the introduction of nanoparticles. Suppression of urease was observed when the soil was contaminated with CuNPs, and catalase - ZnNPs in a dose of more than 50 mg/kg. Invertase showed sensitivity at contamination with metals at a dose of 200 mg/kg and more.
   Conclusion: Thus, the entry into the environment and the further deposition of nanoparticles Zn and Cu in the soil will lead to the suppression of the vital activity of the beneficiary soil animals and the activity of soil enzymes involved in cycle C and N. This is a phenomenon is a special kind of ecological risks for the ecosystem.

AB  - Constructed wetlands (CWs) offer an alternative to traditional industrial wastewater treatment systems that has been proved to be efficient, cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Most of the time, CWs are planted with proliferative species such as Phragmites australis or with plants originating from nurseries, both representing a risk for the natural biodiversity conservation of aquatic ecosystems located downstream of the CWs. For the removal of metals and organic pollutant mixtures present in industrial effluents, it is necessary to select tolerant plant species that are able to produce a high aboveground biomass and to develop a healthy belowground system. Wild plant species growing in aquatic bodies at industrial outfalls could constitute suitable tolerant species to use in CWs for industrial effluent treatment. To test this hypothesis, we assessed, under laboratory conditions (using an experimental design), the tolerance to mixtures of metals (Al, As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn, Zn) or/and organic pollutants (THC, PHE, PYR, LAS) of five European sub-cosmopolitan native macrophytes (Alisma lanceolatum, Carex cuprina, Epilobium hirsutum, Iris pseudacorus and Juncus inflexus) that had been collected in a polluted Mediterranean wetland, after a field study (crossing ecological releves and analyses of contaminant concentrations in water and sediments). Our results demonstrated that research on phytoremediation of industrial effluents should focus much more on the use of native macrophytes growing at short distances from industrial discharges (such as C cuprina in this study), and that root/shoot ratio, aerial height and proportion of green leaves are good and cost-effective indicators of plant tolerance to metals and organic pollutant mixtures in laboratory studies.

AB  - Soils are among the most complex, diverse and competitive habitats on Earth and soil biota are responsible for ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration and remediation of freshwater. The extreme biodiversity prohibits the making of a full inventory of soil life. Hence, an appropriate indicator group should be selected to determine the biological condition of soil systems. Due to their ubiquity and the diverse responses to abiotic and biotic changes, nematodes are suitable indicators for environmental monitoring. However, the time-consuming microscopic analysis of nematode communities has limited the scale at which this indicator group is used. In an attempt to circumvent this problem, a quantitative PCR-based tool for the detection of a consistent part of the soil nematofauna was developed based on a phylum-wide molecular framework consisting of 2,400 full-length SSU rDNA sequences. Taxon-specific primers were designed and tested for specificity. Furthermore, relationships were determined between the quantitative PCR output and numbers of target nematodes. As a first field test for this DNA sequence signature-based approach, seasonal fluctuations of nematode assemblages under open canopy (one field) and closed canopy (one forest) were monitored. Fifteen taxa from four feeding guilds (covering similar to 65% of the free-living nematode biodiversity at higher taxonomical level) were detected at two trophic levels. These four feeding guilds are composed of taxa that developed independently by parallel evolution and we detected ecologically interpretable patterns for free-living nematodes belonging to the lower trophic level of soil food webs. Our results show temporal fluctuations, which can be even opposite within taxa belonging to the same guild. This research on nematode assemblages revealed ecological information about the soil food web that had been partly overlooked.

CP  - 12th International Symposium on Problems of Landscape Ecological Research
AB  - High-mountain environment becomes gradually the attractive place for various forms of the investments. Naturally, that is not a new (neither unexpected) trend. The specific, and simultaneously the weak feature of the Tatra Mts is their insular position, since they have no equivalent from north, cast, and even from west. Among the adverse factors belongs also a relatively small area of the mountains, especially the valley systems that arc generally the most attacked by humans, due to their accessibility and hiking possibilities. The Tatra Mts lie in the field of view and interest of two gradually developing post-socialist countries (Poland and Slovakia). They have already prepared plans and particular projects for an intensive development of tourism in this area. Business and political lobby groups both latently and clearly manifest their interest in commercial utilisation of the Tatra Mts. In the paper we mention the significance of geomorphologic research and its applications for more worthwhile landscape-ecological analysis, synthesis, planning, and control of the landscape environment utilisation. Especially in the high-mountain landscape, close to timberline, the georelief attributes (static and dynamic) belong to the main limiting factors for human activity. A natural hazard assessment of actual or potential processes requires existing knowledge about the activity (intensity) of the process, procured either by direct observations (measurements) or by using simplified models combined with aerial or space photograph analysis. The measured (or calculated) parameters should be processed into a database information system. The evaluating process includes analyse of defined spatial units (morphodynamic systems), which is based on two types of criteria: criteria resulting from the human demands and interests (and conversely impacts, influences etc.), and criteria resulting from the proper dynamics of natural processes (and influences of natural conditions on each process). The hazard assessment in high-mountain area is often complicated by the risks related with the concrete estimation of losses and also casualties. Nevertheless, it becomes a component of the indicators for sustainable utilisation of natural resources.

AB  - Environmental flow assessments are becoming increasingly central to ecologically-sustainable river management. Rigorous evaluations of flow-ecology relationships serve a vital role in guiding these assessments to meet targeted ecosystem objectives. However, limited resources and widespread environmental change are outpacing the ability to gain knowledge of species' flow responses and assess environmental needs for rivers individually. Successfully transferring flow-ecology relationships across space and time would facilitate regional-scale environmental flow assessments, yet the necessary contexts for such success remains a knowledge gap. Here, we leverage long-term, multi-species datasets across multiple river basins in southwestern United States as a case study to explore whether relationships between species abundances and hydrological conditions are transferable across space and time. Additionally, we evaluate the potential for ecological guilds based on fluvial dependence and life-history strategies to facilitate the transfer of flow-ecology knowledge across taxonomic boundaries. Species varied in the spatial transferability of their flow-ecology relationships. Spatial transferability was similar when comparing a species' flow-ecology relationships within a river basin versus across different river basins, although transferability was considerably greater across free-flowing rivers compared to regulated rivers. Species' flow-ecology relationships transferred through time just as well as across space. Ecological guilds defined according to fluvial dependence and life-history strategies offered just as much potential for transferring flow-ecology knowledge among species as transferring within species across space or time. Our study provides insights into transferring flow-ecology knowledge to support effective, regional-scale environmental flows. Further research into developing transferable flow-ecology relationships for a wide range of environmental predictors and biological responses across different spatial scales and flow regimes will enable us to keep pace with the increasing demand for science to inform sustainable river management.

AB  - The impact of agricultural practices and soil management on the communities of arthropods living in the agricultural landscape is acknowledged as a critical issue by the literature, and it needs to be better investigated to improve the ecological sustainability of agriculture. In the present study, we aimed to study how soil management affect carabid species distribution in one of the most typical agroecosystem of the Mediterranean region, i.e. the olive grove. In South Italy olive plantations feature different types of soil management, from tillage to half or full-cover cropping. Species distribution has been examined for a total of 10,189 individuals and 62 species collected from 17 sites. Notably from our analysis we have observed that three factors (climax vegetation, soil features and soil management) explained half of the data variability. The composition of species groupings mirrors both bioclimatic conditions (climax vegetation) and soil features, especially watering, while soil management affects the species distribution, with different intensity from site to site. Eleven species have been recognized as the most abundant in the different facets of the studied olive groves and consequently designated as characteristics of the olive agroecosystem. The species traits of the sampled species have been weighted for a compelling evaluation of the effects of agricultural management on biodiversity, showing uniform traits distribution when coping with the ecological factors that characterize the different plantation facets. We have found that carabid beetles can be used as model organisms for studying the effects of agricultural practices. Our study suggests that the interaction of man-induced trasformation with the natural background of the olive agroecosystem may be difficult to disentangle, so that such complexity must be taken into account when carabid beetles are expected to provide an ecosystem service for good agricultural practices.

AB  - Annelids (Lumbricidae and Enchytraeidae) and nematodes are common soil organisms and play important roles in organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling and creation of soil structure and porosity. However, these three groups have rarely been studied together and only few studies exist for urban soils. We studied the diversity and community composition of annelids and nematodes in soils spanning more than two centuries of urban soil development in Neuchatel (Switzerland) and assessed the relationships 1) among these three groups and 2) between each group and environmental (physical, chemical and functional) characteristics of soils and soil age.
   While the groups of environmental variables were correlated (Mantel tests) no correlation was found between pairs of soil fauna groups and between each soil fauna group and environmental variables. More specifically, redundancy analyses showed that earthworm assemblages were best correlated with soil bulk density and with soil depth, the latter being positively correlated with soil age. Enchytraeid assemblages and the proportion of enchytraeid r-strategists were respectively best correlated with soil carbonate content and negatively correlated with soil age. Nematodes assemblages were best correlated with soil water content. Moreover, relationships between pairs of soil biota groups, and between each group and environmental (physical, chemical and functional) variables, varied along the soil age gradient (moving window analysis).
   This study provides new knowledge on urban soil biodiversity and how environmental conditions can influence soil diversity and community patterns in the urban context. The contrasted community patterns of earthworms, enchytraeids and nematodes in urban soils of different ages and their different ecological roles suggest that they represent potential complementary indicators of soil quality and functioning such as soil formation and organic matter dynamics.

AB  - This study reports an investigation of the bryophyte ecology of minimally impacted high-latitude headwater streams, to assess the hypothesis that underlying geology, water physico-chemistry, current velocity and substrate morphology are significant environmental drivers of the species distribution, community composition and abundance of bryophyte vegetation in these naturally highly stressed and disturbed upland ecosystems. Our secondary aim was to determine whether there is evidence that the assemblage and functional attributes of the species present have potential as indicators of water quality and habitat biointegrity in high-latitude headwater streams. The methodology involved repeated intensive surveys, during 2005-2006, at nine sites located on three streams of contrasting underlying geology, within latitudes 56A degrees-58A degrees N, in upland Scotland. Using a stratified random sampling design, quantitative assessments were made of 5 stream vegetation parameters and 52 environmental variables potentially influencing the target sites. TWINSPAN classification, supported by CCA ordination, of the dataset identified four stream bryophyte community types, plus a fifth sample group (characterized by unstable habitat conditions) devoid of bryophytes. The environmental drivers of the vegetation community were primarily associated with streambed stability (flow, substrate composition) and water chemistry (e.g. pH, conductivity, Ca2+), which were products of the prevailing underlying geology. The abundance of stream bryophytes was generally a function of predominant growth morphology and life strategy of the species present. Two bryophyte assemblages were identified as characterizing either upland oligotrophic stream habitats of acid-sensitive and base-poor waters (indicators: Scapania undulata, Hygrohypnum ochraceum), or calcareous and mineral-rich streamwaters (indicators: Chiloscyphus polyanthus, Hygrohypnum luridum). The results support the incorporation of bryophytes into river biomonitoring schemes, for use in high-latitude upland streams.

AB  - Soil nematode community structure reflects soil ecosystem health and is influenced by the soil environment directly and/or indirectly by affecting the soil micro-flora and fauna that they graze. In this study, ecological indices for soil nematode community structure and microbial populations in soils contaminated with mine drainage (CS) from an abandoned mine and of a nearby non-contaminated area (NC) were examined during the seven seasons from July 2007 through December 2008 to reveal influences of mine drainage (especially heavy metals) on the soil nematode community structure. Of the soil physicochemical characteristics measured, nutritional properties such as organic matter content, nitrogen content, and soluble cations were not significantly different between CS and NC; however, significant differences were detected in pH, electrical conductivity (EC), available phosphorus (av.P2O5), and most strikingly, the concentrations of heavy metals such as Cd, Pb, Zn, and Ni. Nematodes were less abundant in CS than in NC, especially for long-living persistor-type nematodes. Comparison of ecological indices between CS and NC indicates that abundance, maturity, richness, and diversity of the soil nematode community were decreased in CS soil, indicating that soil health and function were adversely affected. Of the weighted-soil food-web indices, the structural index (SI) of the soil nematode community was significantly lower in CS than in NC, while no significant difference in the enrichment index (El) was observed between CS and NC, suggesting that the heavy metal contamination may have disturbed the soil ecosystem by suppressing biological activity. Seasonal changes in the ecological indices during the study period showed that the discrepancies between CS and NC persisted throughout most of the seasons, suggesting that the effect of mine drainage (heavy metal) contamination on nematode community structure may be little influenced by seasonal changes in environmental conditions.

AB  - In order to advance ongoing efforts in the (still emerging) field of marine restoration, different forms of knowledge must be combined: not only the biological and technical aspects, but also the social and cultural dimensions of marine restoration efforts. This calls for a newly combined array of methods that allows for a bridging of these different knowledge dimensions. Drawing on our experiences from the ongoing knowledge transfer processes of the INTERNAS project (Scientific Transfer of the results of INTERNational Assessments in the field of Earth and Environmental Research into the German policy context), we provide an overview of methods that were used to link global recommendations with localized marine restoration schemes and policy options. Using a mixed methods approach, we were able to capture and understand the pathways of knowledge transfer from globally synthesized scientific knowledge to local realities related to protecting and enhancing marine biodiversity in Germany. With this structured knowledge transfer approach, actionable solutions for marine conservation and restoration activities could be tailored to the specific national and regional circumstances. Using participatory methods, framework conditions like ecological, social, legal, and sectoral value judgment dimensions can be identified. This allows for the development of concerted solutions and creates a common ground for good governance towards marine restoration. When scientists engage not only as experts but also as reflexive facilitators in such participatory processes, it is ensured that more inclusive forms of knowledge are fostered that are necessary to better anticipate the potentials and likely pitfalls that marine restoration efforts may encounter. We conclude that existing knowledge on ecosystems, their goods and services as well as societal expectations need to be understood from the onset in any kind of marine restoration effort.

AB  - Extensive development and construction in marine and coastal systems is driving a phenomenon known as "ocean sprawl". Ocean sprawl removes or transforms marine habitats through the addition of artificial structures and some of the most significant impacts are occurring in sedimentary environments. Marine sediments have substantial social, ecological, and economic value, as they are rich in biodiversity, crucial to fisheries productivity, and major sites of nutrient transformation. Yet the impact of ocean sprawl on sedimentary environments has largely been ignored. Here we review current knowledge of the impacts to sedimentary ecosystems arising from artificial structures.
   Artificial structures alter the composition and abundance of a wide variety of sediment-dependent taxa, including microbes, invertebrates, and benthic-feeding fishes. The effects vary by structure design and configuration, as well as the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the environment in which structures are placed. The mechanisms driving effects from artificial structures include placement loss, habitat degradation, modification of sound and light conditions, hydrodynamic changes, organic enrichment and material fluxes, contamination, and altered biotic interactions. Most studies have inferred mechanism based on descriptive work, comparing biological and physical processes at various distances from structures. Further experimental studies are needed to identify the relative importance of multiple mechanisms and to demonstrate causal relationships. Additionally, past studies have focused on impacts at a relatively small scale, and independently of other development that is occurring. There is need to quantify large-scale and cumulative effects on sedimentary ecosystems as artificial structures proliferate. We highlight the importance for comprehensive monitoring using robust survey designs and outline research strategies needed to understand, value, and protect marine sedimentary ecosystems in the face of a rapidly changing environment.

AB  - Peatlands are a major source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for aquatic ecosystems. Naturally high DOC concentrations in peatlands may be increased further by drainage. For agricultural purposes, peat has frequently been mixed with sand, but the effect of this measure on the release and cycling of DOC has rarely been investigated. This study examined the effects of (i) mixing peat with sand and (ii) water table depth (WTD) on DOC concentrations at three grassland sites on shallow organic soils. The soil solution was sampled bi-weekly for two years with suction plates at 15, 30 and 60 cm depth. Selected samples were analysed for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), delta C-13(Dom) and delta N-15(DOM.)
   Average DOC concentrations were surprisingly high, ranging from 161 to 192 mg 1(-1). There was no significant impact of soil organic carbon (SOC) content or WTD on mean DOC concentrations. At all sites, DOC concentrations were highest at the boundary between the SOC-rich horizon and the mineral subsoil. In contrast to the mean concentrations, the temporal patterns of DOC concentrations, their drivers and the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) differed between peat-sand mixtures and peat. DOC concentrations responded to changes in environmental conditions, but only after a lag period of a few weeks. At the sites with a peat-sand mixture, temperature and therefore probably biological activity determined the DOC concentrations. At the peat site, the contribution of vegetation derived DOM was higher. The highest concentrations occurred during long, cool periods of waterlogging, suggesting a stronger physicochemical-based DOC mobilisation. Overall, these results indicate that mixing peat with sand does not improve water quality and.may result in DOC losses of around 200 kg DOC ha(-1) a(-1). (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - With growing public awareness that wetlands are important to society, there are intensifying efforts to understand the ecological condition of those wetlands that remain, and to develop indicators of wetland condition. Indicators based on soils are not well developed and are absent in some current assessment protocols; these could be advantageous, particularly for soils, which are complex habitats for plants, invertebrates, and microbial communities. In this study, we examine whether multivariate soil indicators, correlated with microbial biomass and community composition, can be used to distinguish reference standard (i.e., high condition) headwater wetland complexes from impacted headwater wetland complexes in central Pennsylvania, USA. Our reference standard sites existed in forested landscapes, while our impacted sites were situated in multi-use landscapes and were affected by a range of land-use legacies in the 1900s. We found that current assessment protocols are likely underrepresenting sampling needs to accurately represent site mean soil properties. On average, more samples were required to represent soil property means in reference standard sites compared to impacted sites. Reference standard and impacted sites also had noticeably different types of microbial habitats for the two multivariate soil indices assessed, and impacted sites were more homogenized in terms of the fine-scale (i.e., 1 and 5 m) spatial variability of these indices. Our study shows promise for the use of multivariate soil indices as indicators of wetland condition and provides insights into the sample sizes and scales at which soil sampling should occur during assessments. Future work is needed to test the generalizability of these findings across wetland types and ecoregions and establish definitive links between structural changes in microbial habitats and changes in wetland soil functioning.

AB  - In response to increasing environmental and social changes in the past few decades, some Inuit hunters have been turning to scientific tools to help evaluate sea ice conditions. Simultaneously, there has been more scientific interest in understanding local scale processes through Inuit knowledge in order to develop a broader comprehension of dynamic sea ice conditions and implications of long-term change. Building on several years of collaborative research with Inuit sea ice experts in Cape Dorset, Igloolik, and Pangnirtung, Nunavut, and local expressions of interest in increased access and availability of satellite imagery of sea ice, the Polar View Floe Edge Service was expanded to each community in the spring of 2007. Follow-up workshops in November 2007 helped to evaluate and improve the service by considering previous local uses of satellite imagery and tailoring Floe Edge Service regions of interest to local areas of sea ice use. Through workshop discussions, several opportunities for the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery emerged, including: seeing what is on (or within/under) the ice; monitoring seasonal and long-term sea ice changes; hazards assessment; planning travel routes; and facilitating search and rescue operations. A number of challenges were also identified, such as: SAR image interpretation; image spatial resolution; frequency of image acquisition; SAR image representation capabilities; and technological limitations. The workshops also provided some insights into intercultural and intergenerational exchanges and led to a number of recommendations to continue expanding and improving the Floe Edge Service. This case study shows how remote sensing can be incorporated into the suite of traditional indicators and technological tools that hunters draw upon in their evaluations of complex human-animal-environment assessments. In the face of declining and unpredictable sea ice conditions, bridging scales and knowledge systems will be essential in developing integrated monitoring systems to respond to increased political and economic pressures as well as safety concerns for travelling on or within ice-covered oceans.Pour relever les defis poses par les changements environnementaux et sociaux, des chasseurs Inuits ont favorise, au cours des dernieres decennies, l'utilisation d'outils scientifiques pour mesurer l'evolution des conditions de la glace de mer. En parallele, il existe de plus en plus de travaux scientifiques susceptibles d'eclairer, a partir des connaissances des Inuits, les processus qui operent a des echelles locales, afin d'elargir la comprehension des conditions de la glace de mer en evolution et des incidences des changements sur le long terme. Se situant dans le cadre des recherches menees sur plusieurs annees en collaboration avec des experts sur la glace de mer utilisee par les Inuits dans les localites du Nunavut de Cape Dorset, Igloolik, et Pangnirtung, et suite a une demande formulee a l'echelle locale pour accroitre l'accessibilite et la disponibilite des images satellitaires de la glace de mer, l'initiative Polar View du Service d'information sur la lisiere de la banquise a pris de l'ampleur. Depuis le printemps 2007, elle s'etend a l'ensemble de ces collectivites. En novembre 2007, des ateliers de suivi ont ete organises afin d'evaluer et d'ameliorer le service en tenant compte des usages locaux anterieurs de l'imagerie satellitaire et en adaptant les regions ciblees par le Service d'information sur la lisiere de la banquise aux contextes locaux de l'utilisation de la glace de mer.
   Les disussions engagees lors des ateliers ont degage de nouvelles perspectives sur l'utilisation de l'imagerie radar a ouverture synthetique (ROS), notamment pour: visualiser ce qui se trouve sur, dans, ou sous la glace; surveiller l'evolution des changements saisonniers et a long terme de la glace de mer; evaluer les risques naturels; etablir les itineraires; et organiser les operations de recherche et de sauvetage. Parmi les enjeux qui ont egalement ete souleves, soulignons: l'interpretation des images ROS; resolution spatiale de l'image; la definition de la resolution des images; la frequence d'acquisition des images; les modalites de representation des images ROS; et les limites des technologies. D'ailleurs, les ateliers ont permis de degager de nouvelles pistes de reflexion sur les echanges interculturels et intergenerationnels et de proposer une serie de recommandations en vue de developper et d'ameliorer le Service d'information sur la lisiere de la banquise. Cette etude de cas met en evidence la maniere dont la teledetection peut s'integrer, avec des indicateurs classiques et des outils technologiques utilises par les chasseurs, dans les bilans des relations complexes entre les etres humains, les animaux et l'environnement. Compte tenu du recul de la glace de mer et de son caractere imprevisible, il importe de reduire le decalage entre les echelles et les systemes de connaissance, afin de soutenir l'elaboration de systemes de surveillance integres pour reduire les pressions politiques et economiques de plus en plus fortes et pour assurer la securite des deplacements effectues sur ou a travers les oceans couverts de glace.

AB  - Animal structural body size and condition are often measured to evaluate individual health, identify responses to environmental change and food availability, and relate food availability to effects on reproduction and survival. A variety of condition metrics have been developed but relationships between these metrics and vital rates are rarely validated. Identifying an optimal approach to estimate the body condition of polar bears is needed to improve monitoring of their response to decline in sea ice habitat. Therefore, we examined relationships between several commonly used condition indices (CI), body mass, and size with female reproductive success and cub survival among polar bears (Ursus maritimus) measured in two subpopulations over three decades. To improve measurement and application of morphometrics and CIs, we also examined whether CIs are independent of age and structural size-an important assumption for monitoring temporal trends-and factors affecting measurement precision and accuracy. Maternal CIs and mass measured the fall prior to denning were related to cub production. Similarly, maternal CIs, mass, and length were related to the mass of cubs or yearlings that accompanied her. However, maternal body mass, but not CIs, measured in the spring was related to cub production and only maternal mass and length were related to the probability of cub survival. These results suggest that CIs may not be better indicators of fitness than body mass in part because CIs remove variation associated with body size that is important in affecting fitness. Further, CIs exhibited variable relationships with age for growing bears and were lower for longer bears despite body length being related to cub survival and female reproductive success. These results are consistent with findings from other species indicating that body mass is a useful metric to link environmental conditions and population dynamics.

AB  - Aims: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of oxygen on the survival of faecal pollution indicators including Escherichia coli in nondisinfected drinking water.
   Methods and Results: Aerobic and anaerobic drinking water microcosms were inoculated with E. colt ATCC 25922 or raw sewage. Survival of E. colt was monitored by membrane filtration combined with cultivation on standard media, and by in situ hybridization with 16S rRNA-targeted fluorescent oligonucleotide probes. Anaerobic conditions significantly increased the survival of E. colt in drinking water compared with aerobic conditions. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 showed a biphasic decrease in survival under aerobic conditions with an initial first-order decay rate of -0.11 day(-1) followed by a more rapid rate of -0.35 day(-1). In contrast, the first-order decay rate under anaerobic conditions was only -0.02 day(-1). After 35 days, <0.01% of the initial E. coli ATCC 25922 population remained detectable in aerobic microcosms compared with 48% in anaerobic microcosms. A poor survival was observed under aerobic conditions regardless of whether E. coli ATCC 25922 or sewage-derived E. coli was examined, and regardless of the detection method used (CFU or fluorescent in situ hybridization). Aerobic conditions in drinking water also appeared to decrease the survival of faecal enterococci, somatic coliphages and coliforms other than E. colt.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that oxygen is a major regulator of the survival of E. colt in nondisinfected drinking water. The results also suggest that faecal pollution indicators other than E. colt may persist longer in drinking water under anaerobic conditions.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The effect of oxygen should be considered when evaluating the survival potential of enteric pathogens in oligotrophic environments.

AB  - Blooms of cyanobacteria cause ecological imbalance, killing a large number of water plants, fish and other aquatic organisms. In addition to easily cause algae toxin emission, the traditional processing method has drawbacks of short period of time and high energy consumption. Ultrasonic technology, as the environmental and effective method, is put forward to control the algae biomass. However, most studies based on inhibitory effect of ultrasound irradiation on algae were conducted at the algae photosynthesis system, the physiological activity of other indicators was not in-depth studied, and most of which were the short-term effects with unknown timeliness. The objective of this paper was to explore the suitable ultrasonic parameters to remove algae and the influence of ultrasonic frequency and power on physiological activity both from physiological activity and biomass control of algae cells. The results showed that the physiological and metabolic activities of algae were lower and the number of intact cells decreased after ultrasonic radiation. The proportion of damaged cells was proportional to the ultrasonic power density. DNA fragments were not detected after ultrasonic irradiation and DNA chain structure remained complete. The effects of ultrasonic parameters on algae density were also studied. When the power density was 0.02 W/mL, the effect of treatment under ultrasonic frequency of 40 kHz was better than that of 20 kHz and 100 kHz. It is suggested to use ultrasonic treatment with the frequency of 40 kHz and power density of 0.0245 W/mL to treat the blue-green algae.

AB  - Coal and mudstone beds in the Namwele coalfield, lacustrine Rukwa rift basin belong to the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian age. However, their origin, depositional environment, and organic matter enrichment in such a setting have not been well studied. In this study, samples were collected from the field outcrops and analyzed for their hydrocarbon generation potential, trace element (TE), and rare earth element (REE) proxies to examine their origin, paleoproductivity, organic matter enrichment, paleosalinity, and redox conditions. The results show that the total organic contents (TOC) of the investigated samples range from 3.74 to 13.6%, with an average of 7.21%. The anomalous TOC is a proof that sediments deposited in an oxic condition and low sedimentation rate. Concentrations and ratios of various redox indicators such as vanadium, nickel, copper, chromium, uranium, and thorium (V/Cr, V/(V + Ni), Ni/Co, and U/Th) suggest that the organic-rich sediments had strong terrestrial organic matter input and deposited under oxic conditions. The TOC versus redox ratios show negative correlation coefficients proving that oxic conditions are not suitable for organic matter preservation. According to the boron/gallium (B/Ga) ratio, water salinity ranges between 0.2 and 4.15 during sedimentation, indicating a freshwater environment. The more significant content of the trace elements Ni and Cu implies a high flux of organic matter. Lanthanum/ytterbium (La/Yb)n ratio is an indicator for characterizing different enrichment levels between light REE and heavy REE. The results show that samples are enriched in light REE, with (La/Yb)n, indicating a low sedimentation rate. These findings contribute to studies of the same sedimentary environment settings and further extend our knowledge of the potential organic-rich resources in the Rukwa rift basin.

AB  - Helminth eggs are the most difficult biological parasites to inactivate in wastewater and sludge. In developing countries, in particular, they are present in high concentrations and are the cause of many diseases that impact seriously on the human population. The process conditions for affordable inactivation are very variable, leading to different inactivation efficiencies. Temperature, dryness, pH and the developmental stage of the eggs must be taken into consideration to achieve complete inactivation. The objective of this research was to study the inactivation of six species of larval and non-larval helminth eggs of medical importance in developing countries under controlled conditions of temperature, pH, dryness and contact time. Results showed considerable differences in inactivation conditions among helminth eggs and a high level of resistance was confirmed for the eggs of Ascaris lumbricoides and Ascaris suum. The appropriate conditions for inactivation of all types of eggs were found by applying combinations of pH, temperature and dryness. At 45 degrees C it was possible to inactivate all species with a pH of 5.3 and 90% dryness within 6 days. If alkalization was applied, a pH of 12.7 was sufficient over 19 days at the same conditions of dryness and temperature. From these results it is proposed that both Ascaris spp. and Taenia solium may be used as indicators of biological contamination in wastewater and sludge. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In arable systems, seasonal fluctuations of microbiological properties can be significant. We hypothesized that adaptation to soil environmental conditions may contribute to the variation observed, and this was examined by characterization of different microbial community attributes under a range of soil conditions. Soil was sampled from no-till and chisel-tilled fields within a long-term experiment in eastern Washington during growth of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum). The range of soil environmental conditions covered was extended by amendment of crop residues. Soil samples were characterized with respect to biomass N and biomass P, substrate utilization dynamics, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and whole-soil fatty acid (MIDI-FA) profiles, and with respect to soil environmental variables (bulk density, soil organic C [SOC], temperature, moisture, and inorganic N and P). Bacterial and fungal lipid biomarkers were negatively correlated (P < 0.001), confirming that these subsets of fatty acids are associated with contrasting components of the microbial biomass. Biomass N was closely associated with soil conditions, notably N availability. The proportion of substrates used with no apparent lag phase decreased during summer and was negatively correlated with lipid stress indicators. Cyclopropyl fatty acids accounted for more than 60% of the variation in bacteria] PLFA. These observations suggest that adaptation to environmental stresses was partly responsible for the microbial dynamics observed. Tillage practice had little effect on the relationships between soil conditions and microbiological properties. The results showed that MIDI-FA included a significant background of nonmicrobial material and was less sensitive to soil environmental conditions than PLFA.

AB  - The concentration and distribution of organic matter, phosphate nodules, and framboidal pyrite preserved in shales are controlled by organic matter decomposition and the cycles of phosphorus, sulfur, and iron, which, in turn, are controlled by bottom-water redox conditions. The organic-rich shale in the 7th member of the Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation (Ch7) contains high organic carbon concentrations and abundant phosphate nodules and pyrite framboids, providing an opportunity to better understand the redox conditions at the time of deposition. Framboidal pyrite in the Ch7 organic-rich shales are composed of octahedral, pyritohedral, and spherulitic microcrystals with uniform crystal size. SEM photographs and statistical data suggest that pyrite framboids have large mean diameters (10.0 to 18.1 mu m) and standard deviations (2.8 to 5.9 mu m). This may indicate that the organic-rich shale was deposited under oxic-suboxic bottom-water conditions. The C-org:P ratios of the organic-rich shale exhibit considerable variation, ranging from 7.2 to 216, but the majority of them (83.2%) belong to the lower-intermediate range (<130), suggesting that the redox conditions were predominantly oxic-suboxic and intermittently anoxic. The Corg:P ratios also show periodic vertical variation, which suggests that redox conditions fluctuated between oxic-suboxic and anoxic. Additional support for the trends based on Corg:P ratios is provided by DOPT values, which show similar vertical variation and redox patterns. All evidence shows that the redox conditions during deposition of the Ch7 organic-rich shale was predominantly oxic-suboxic accompanied by intermittent anoxic environments. The result of this study will be helpful in better understanding the formation mechanism of the Ch7 organic-rich shale. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the 1970s the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) devised a multiscale system of basin planning and regional implementation that encouraged a balanced mixture of monitoring and modeling-based assessments. By the 1980s, this goal had not been achieved. Modeling and monitoring assessment approaches became largely decoupled. To a significant degree, modeling was viewed as too inaccurate to handle issues such as setting permit limits involving toxics. During the 1980s, EPA also encouraged the idea that monitoring approaches were adequate to document water quality problems, guide the development of management plans, and demonstrate the achievement of management goals. By the late 1990s, large numbers of waters listed under the Clean Water Act's Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) provisions showed the widespread nature of pollutant concerns, but the uneven nature of the listing information also revealed fundamental problems in the ability of state monitoring programs to achieve credible and comprehensive assessments. Statistics are presented from the 1998 and the most current publicly available 2000 baseline periods showing the limitations in the scope of state assessments. There are significant opportunities for the increased use of relatively simple modeling systems that can be flexibly implemented over a variety of spatial scales. In addition to conventional modeling frameworks, the value of bioassessment monitoring techniques is stressed. Bioassessment indicators can often be combined with landscape modeling methods, as well as analyses from conventional modeling outputs, to help target small area monitoring by use of tiered approaches. These findings underscore the value of integrated monitoring and modeling approaches to build properly balanced assessment systems.

AB  - Paleoproductivity and paleoredox conditions were reconstructed in a sediment core in the Parece Vela Basin of the eastern Philippine Sea. The core consists of three units, from youngest to oldest: (1) laminated diatom mats (LDM) formed by Ethmodiscus rex during the last Glacial Maximum (similar to 18-28 kyr B.P.), (2) diatomaceous clay (DC), and (3) pelagic clay (PC). Elevated levels of export productivity during LDM deposition are indicated by high values for excess Ba, opal content, and TOC/Ti ratios. Estimated rates of organic carbon degradation (ca. 98%), opal mass accumulation (average 1322 g m(-2) yr(-1)), and corrected organic carbon flux (average 248 g m(-2) yr(-1)) are comparable to high-productivity regions of the modem ocean. The LDM is also characterized by moderate enrichment of redox-sensitive elements such as U. Mo, Cd, and Zn, highly S-34-depleted pyrite sulfur isotopic compositions (indicating bacterial sulfate reduction in a sulfate-unlimited system), and C-S-Fe systematics reflecting limitation of pyrite formation by organic matter rather than reactive Fe availability. These features suggest mainly suboxic conditions in bottom waters but development of sulfidic-anoxic conditions at or close to the sediment-water interface. Association of intensified anoxia with productivity maxima indicates that export production was a more important control on bottom water redox conditions than lateral ventilation. The DC and PC accumulated under oxic to suboxic conditions. Our observations suggest that redox environments during deposition of laminated marine sediments are more complicated and varied than previously thought, and, thus, the use of sediment lamination as an indicator of anoxic bottom water conditions must be approached cautiously.

AB  - The distribution of soil salinity in coastal wetlands determines gradient distribution and succession of vegetation communities. Due to the inaccessibility of mudflats in coastal areas, soil salinity prediction and mapping is necessary for biodiversity protection and ecological integrity. Yancheng National Nature Reserve (YNNR) is experiencing a salinity-induced invasion of Spartina alterniflora and degradation of native vegetation (Suaeda salsa) since the 1980s, with Suaeda salsa facing the dilemma of disappearing from YNNR. This study was aimed to establish comprehensive land surface factors, such as salinity indices, vegetation characteristics, location, terrain attributes and tidal creeks, for soil salinity mapping from 2015 to 2019. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) linked land surface factors and soil salinity, and RMSE of the soil salinity predictions were 0.83 ds/m for MLR and 0.72 ds/m for RF. The RF model for soil salinity mapping was more suitable. The value of soil salinity varied from 0.9 ds/m to 5.2 ds/m and decreased year by year, with average values of 3.09 ds/m, 2.87 ds/m and 2.67 ds/m for RF in 2015, 2017 and 2019. The distance from sea and vegetation type were the two most important indicators to predict the distribution of soil salinity in these mudflats, thus better predictions on how to predict the response of vegetation communities to shifting soil salinity.

AB  - Coralligenous reefs are the main biogenic constructions of the Mediterranean Sea and they are considered indicators of the ecological quality of coastal systems and of "seafloor integrity" by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The two main coralligenous morphologies are the cliffs and platforms, the former developing in shallow waters (about 20-50 m) on vertical/subvertical rocky substrate and the latter built over horizontal substrates below 50 m depth also on detritic bottoms. The present study aims at assessing whether patterns of spatial variability and ecological quality of the coralligenous cliff assemblages reflect those of platform assemblages. At this aim, six geographic areas around Sardinia (western Mediterranean, Italy) were considered and, within each area, the structure of both the coralligenous cliffs and platforms was investigated by SCUBA and ROV methods, and their ecological quality was assessed by ESCA and CBQI indices, respectively. Overall, 20 morphological groups (seven macroalgae and thirteen invertebrates) were found but differences in community structure were evident both spatially and between systems, platforms vs cliffs. In fact, spatial variability in assemblages structure changed between the two morphologies across the areas. Moreover, a different spatial pattern in the ecological quality was found between platform and cliff assemblages. The results of the present study corroborate the individual peculiarity of coralligenous platforms and cliffs, highlighting the importance of the concurrent assessment of both systems in monitoring programs..

AB  - In recent years, the integration of intelligent condition monitoring systems has become crucial for the Operation and Maintenance in the industry. Condition-based maintenance strategies allow the identification of the current health status of industrial assets. Consequently, downtimes and maintenance costs are reduced by the efficient planning of corrective actions and the early detection of costly damages. However, the implementation of data-based monitoring techniques is often hampered by two main difficulties: Firstly, the lack of understanding of the monitored equipment; and secondly, the lack of data related to failures and their evolution, which is one of the major obstacles for the implementation.
   This article proposes a method based on the use of dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques to perform real-time monitoring of the state of the machine. The performance of the approach is studied with four different DR techniques: PCA, LDA, Relief, and Autoencoders. The algorithms are tested in a simulation of various asset lifetimes in which they determine when the assets are working under abnormal conditions. Next, the results of the simulation are evaluated under a specifically designed evaluation criterion based on three key performance indicators; cost, interpretability, and effectiveness. In this way, a common situation in industrial field applications is imitated, where the information is gathered in real-time and there is not enough prior knowledge of the machine nor data about its degradation or failures.

AB  - The effects of the implantation of oil palm plantations on a series of environmental variables and the diversity and distribution of mayfly nymphs was investigated through a survey of 23 streams located in areas of plantation and natural forest in the eastern Amazon basin. Composition and richness of mayfly genera were compared among streams in order to verify which genera respond to the habitat disturbance gradient and determine thresholds for each variable. The genera number was higher in forest streams, although genus composition was similar between treatments. Only 9 of the 114 physical variables measured differed significantly between plantation and forest, and only three limnological variables were significantly different. Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis indicated that four genera were significantly associated with these variables. Of these, Miroculis and Ulmeritoides were associated with the largest number of variables. Given the different options available for use of soil in the Amazon basin, oil palm plantations appear to be one of the least deleterious for native fauna. In the Brazilian Amazon basin, government-sponsored zoning for the establishment of oil palm plantations as a strategy for the recuperation of degraded land thus appears to be a viable option for the reintegration of areas left damaged by agricultural activities, as long as the process is implemented adequately and monitored systematically. Also, legislation must be respected, in particular the permanent preservation of riparian zones, which may function as effective buffer zones to the runoff of pesticides and sediments.

AB  - Land managers are concerned about the negative effects of alien annual plants on native plants, threatened and endangered species such as the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), and ecosystem integrity in the Mojave Desert. Management of alien plants is hampered by a lack of information regarding the dominance and environmental correlates of these species. The results of this study indicate that alien plant species comprised a small fraction of the total annual plant flora, but most of the annual plant community biomass. When rainfall was high in 1995, aliens comprised 6% of the flora and 66% of the biomass. When rainfall was low in 1999, aliens comprised 27% of the flora and 91% of the biomass. Bromus rubens, Schismus spp. (S. arabicus and S. barbatus), and Erodium cicutarium were the predominant alien species during both years, comprising 99% of the alien biomass. B. rubens was more abundant in relatively mesic microhabitats beneath shrub canopies and at higher elevations above 800-1000m, whereas Schismus spp. and E cicutarium were more abundant in the relatively and interspaces between shrubs, and, for Schismus spp., at lower elevations as well. Disturbance variables were more reliable indicators of alien dominance than were productivity or native plant diversity variables, although relationships often varied between years of contrasting rainfall. The strongest environmental correlates occurred between dirt road density and alien species richness and biomass of E. cicutarium, and between frequency and size of fires and biomass of B. rubens.

AB  - Freshwater protected areas are rare even though freshwater ecosystems are among the most imperiled in the world. Conservation actions within terrestrial protected areas (TPAs) such as development or resource extraction regulations may spill over to benefit freshwater ecosystems within their boundaries. Using data from 175 lakes across Ontario, Canada, we compared common indicators of fish-assemblage status (i.e., species richness, Shannon diversity index, catch per unit effort, and normalized-length size spectrum slopes) to evaluate whether TPAs benefit lake fish assemblages. Nearest neighbor cluster analysis was used to generate pairs of lakes: inside versus outside, inside versus bordering, and bordering versus outside TPAs based on lake characteristics. The diversity and abundance indicators did not differ significantly across comparisons, but normalized-length size spectrum slopes (NLSS) were significantly steeper in lakes outside parks. The latter indicated assemblage differences (greater abundances of small-bodied species) and less-efficient energy transfer through the trophic levels of assemblages outside parks. Although not significantly different, pollution- and turbidity-tolerant species were more abundant outside parks, whereas 3 of the 4 pollution-intolerant species were more abundant within parks. Twenty-one percent of the difference in slopes was related to higher total dissolved solids concentrations and angling pressure. Our results support the hypothesis that TPAs benefit lake fish assemblages and suggest that NLSS slopes are informative indicators for aquatic protected area evaluations because they represent compositional and functional aspects of communities.

AB  - The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is revising its strategy to obtain the information needed to answer questions pertinent to water-quality management efficiently and rigorously at national scales. One tool of this revised strategy is use of statistically based surveys of aquatic resources such as lakes, wetlands, rivers, and streams. Implementing large-extent surveys involves decisions that reflect compromises between scientific rigor, consistent and practical implementation over large areas and many participants, and the realities of time and money Primary constraints result from interactions among management objectives, time lines, funding, and institutional constraints of participants. Secondary constraints arise from the interaction between the survey design (geographic extent, sample size, use of existing data), logistics (sampling period, sample shipping, information management, crew expertise, field training), and the Suite of ecological indicators selected (site-scale sampling design, field and laboratory protocols). We use our experience with the EPA's national Wadeable Stream Assessment and its Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program Western Pilot Study to describe the key constraints and the resulting decisions made to implement those surveys successfully. The experiences from those surveys offer perspectives and information useful for effectively implementing future surveys of similar scope or spatial extent, including advanced planning, compatible survey designs, consistent methods, indicators, and cooperative research.

FX  - The survey results that led to our paper were made possible through the efforts of federal, state, university, and contract cooperators too numerous to mention. Without their dedication to EMAP-West and WSA no data would exist and the possibility of implementing large-extent aquatic resource surveys in the future would be small. Without their persistent critical suggestions and concerns, we would not have learned as much as we did. We also thank D. Olson, R. Ozretich, L. Yuan, S. Paulsen, J. Van Sickle, A. Olsen, P.

AB  - A survey of epiphytic species on annual increments of Quercus petraea twigs in a west Wales woodland has shown that distribution of lichen species and rates of succession are affected by a range of environmental conditions. Lichen communities were recorded for 1-15 years on randomly sampled twigs along marked woodland boundaries affected by a range of climatic and management conditions. Results show that there is a correlation between environmental conditions and lichen communities of twigs, and that indicator species can be used to detect vends towards acidification or eutrophication.

AB  - Human population pressures in coastal drainage basins have increasingly contributed to degraded estuarine habitats. Yet, there are no approaches for rapidly characterizing watersheds and for identifying sources of environmental degradation that affect estuarine habitat and water quality. A rapid watershed assessment (RWA) protocol is described that uses 15 indicators from both contributing watersheds and receptor estuaries to assess coastal watershed condition. The protocol was applied to five small, coastal watersheds to illustrate strengths and limitations of the approach and its sensitivity in quantifying differences in condition among the watersheds.
   The RWA found that the poor condition of the tested coastal watersheds were due to both problems in the contributing watersheds (primarily due to agriculture and field drainage ditches) and problems in the receptor estuaries (primarily due to pollution leading to closed shellfish beds and channel maintenance detrimentally affecting benthic habitats). Indicator data were robust enough to differentiate variations in condition among indicators and sufficient to identify problems that needed to be addressed in contributing watersheds and receptor estuaries. Thus, indicator output can be used to diagnose problems in ways that can guide planning at a small watershed scale, identify ways to minimize future impacts, and help prioritize strategies for improving or enhancing current conditions. Because the RWA protocol integrates the types of data that are readily available for small estuaries, it provides a useful framework that could be adapted for use in small coastal watersheds and sub-estuaries elsewhere.

KW  - INDEXES
AB  - Drought is a creeping phenomenon whose effects evolve with time, yet the start and end is often only clear in the hindsight. The present study assessed drought conditions using two categories of drought indicators computed from precipitation data sets measured by weather stations across the Western Cape Province, South Africa for the period 1985 to 2016. The first category was the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) accumulated over 3-, 6- and 12-months (hereafter of SPI-3, SPI-6 and SPI-12 respectively). The second category consists of the four Drought Monitoring Indicators (DMI) i.e., Drought Duration (DD), Severity (DS), Intensity (DI) and Frequency (DF). Firstly, analysis of SPI-3, SPI-6 and SPI-12 illustrate that between 1985 and 2016, the Western Cape Province experienced recurrent mild drought conditions. This suggests that the drought conditions experienced during 2015/2016 hydrological year (hereafter current) in the Western Cape Province is a manifestation of past drought conditions. Secondly, analysis of trends in DMI series depict a noticeable spatial-temporal dependence wherein the southern and western regions experienced more severe droughts compared to the eastern and northern regions of the Western Cape Province. Results also show that the DMI trends exhibit up to similar to 8% variability over the past decade. Overall, the current drought conditions in the Western Cape Province continues to adversely affect agricultural production while the water reservoirs are at below 30% capacity implying that the socio-economic impacts of these droughts will continue to reverberate for many months to come. Though the on-going drought conditions in the Western Cape Province is a regular part of nature's cycle, analysis of historical drought characteristics based on drought indicators is an important first step towards placing the current drought conditions into perspective, and contribute to triggering action and response thereof. All these lay the foundation for drought monitoring and contribute towards the development of drought early warning.

AB  - This work is focused on the responses of some energy metabolism variables in Cnesterodon decemmaculatus adults exposed to cadmium under controlled laboratory conditions. This species has been used as bioindicator for evaluating the effects of different chemicals on diverse biological processes and is frequently used as test organism in ecotoxicity studies that include cadmium as reference toxicant. Animals were exposed for 12 days to the following concentrations: 0, 0.45, and 0.8 mg Cd/L. Food intake, fecal production, specific assimilation, condition factor, mortality percentage, oxygen consumption, oxygen extraction efficiency, specific metabolic rate, ammonia excretion, and ammonia quotient were measured. The overall balance was expressed as scope for growth (SFG). Cadmium-exposed groups showed a significant decrease in food assimilation and condition factor at the end of the exposure. There was an increase in specific metabolic rate and a decrease in SFG in the group exposed to 0.8 mg Cd/L. The condition factor and the SFG appeared as sensitive biomarkers of health status and growth of the animals, respectively. Cadmium-exposed fish reduced food intake, which was reflected in a decreased assimilation with concomitant decline in the external energy supply from feeding. Our results highlight the importance of considering the metabolic status of the test organisms when analyzing the responses of the biomarkers usually used as effect parameters in ecotoxicological evaluations under experimental conditions.

AB  - The definition of priority areas for the conservation of fish faunas is still relatively incipient in comparison with efforts for the protection of terrestrial systems, despite the fact that fishes are the group of organisms most affected by anthropogenic impacts. Given the lack of adequate management in the most important sectors of the Amazon Estuary, the objectives of the present study were to identify priority areas for conservation, based on the analysis of ecological and economic criteria, and indices referencing the fish fauna, integrated in a GIS environment. This was the first application of a methodological approach of this kind to the Amazon Estuary. Fish specimens were collected in the main channel and tidal creeks of the southern Amazon Estuary Guajara and Marajo Bays and the mouth of the Guama River and associated islands between 2004 and 2011, during both the dry (July to December) and rainy seasons (January to June), using gillnets and trawls. A total of 14 ecological and fishery criteria were grouped in five indices environmental quality and diversity, habitat use, fishery index, and relative abundance (CPUE). Maps were produced, based on different scenarios for the conservation of the fish fauna of the study area. Medium to high conservation priorities were defined by all the indices throughout the study area. The scenarios indicated that the northern portion of Marajo Bay and all sectors during the dry season present medium to very high priorities for conservation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are found in a wide range of environments and may at times be one of few proxies available for the study of palaeoenvironmental conditions. However, the response of benthic foraminifera to changing sea-ice conditions is not well understood. This paper discusses benthic foraminifera as potential sea-ice proxies, with special emphasis on their use in shelf regions of the sub-arctic realm. Four marine sediment records from the Labrador Sea-Baffin Bay region serve as examples; in all four records independent sea-ice proxy will be used for testing the foraminiferal response to changing sea ice conditions. This test suggests that 1) Benthic foraminifera provide information on variations in sea-ice cover, but they are not direct proxies for sea-ice cover and no true sea-ice species has yet been identified. 2) Foraminifera mainly respond to the surplus of food often available at sea-ice edges. 3) Dominance of agglutinated foraminifera may suggest corrosive bottom-water conditions which may at times be linked to seasonal sea-ice cover.

AB  - Community forestry practice in Nepal emerged in late 1970s from the failure of centralized forest governance to implement participatory forest management that improves deteriorating environmental conditions and provides forest products to local populace in the hills. This research assessed the perceptions of socioeconomically heterogeneous forest users from eight community forests of Dhading district on environmental impacts of community forestry practice using group interviews and case studies. Two environmental impact-related concepts: forest products supply and local environmental conditions were assessed using rating scale based perception-indicators among three social groups: elite, women, and disadvantaged. Irrespective of social grouping, statistical analysis of the summated rating scores suggests that users perceived increased forest products supply and improved environmental conditions at the local level. Comparison of perceived environmental impacts among eight community forests indicates some differences due to variation in forest attributes in these community forests. Findings from this study are in agreement with the published literature that the community forestry practice has brought a positive change in the local environmental conditions and forest products supply situations in the hills of Nepal.

AB  - Sexual traits often communicate male condition and so are known to be highly condition-dependent. Thus, it is expected that, under restricted environments, sexual traits will be more heavily impacted than non-sexual traits, and so a negative covariation will be expected between sexual traits and non-sexual traits as only high-quality males will sustain the costs of producing both trait types. Such covariation will not necessarily appear in non-restricted environments. We tested these predictions using males of the American rubyspot, Hetaerina americana. First, fully mature males from different seasons were collected and their sexual [a wing red spot and body size (this corrected for body mass using residuals)], and condition-indicating, non-sexual (phenoloxidase and protein concentration) traits were measured. Second, larvae were reared under different food quantities and the same traits plus another non-sexual trait [pro-phenoloxidase (proPO)], were measured in recently emerged males. Contrary to expected, non-sexual traits showed larger expression variance than sexual traits. We found a significant covariation between body size and proPO for experimental males. Both rich and poor diet groups showed a negative slope for body size and proPO. This supposes a resource allocation trade-off between these two traits for recently emerged animals. On the other hand, the presumed signaling function between sexual traits, such as spot size, and physiological indicators of condition in this species, is not supported.

AB  - It has been argued that certain baseline conditions and social preconditions present in a watershed's community can influence a project's likelihood of collective action and farmer adoption of conservation practices. However, it is unclear exactly how these conditions interact with catalyst events to lead to successful collective outcomes. In this paper, we build upon previous research describing the role of catalyst events in leading to collective action, as well as research that proposes specific baseline social indicators to consider when siting watershed conservation projects. We contextualize the impetus for a successful watershed project and identify new social indicators that were mobilized for project success through a qualitative case study; the Indian Creek, Illinois watershed project. We illustrate that baseline conditions and social preconditions were key to project success and contend that these conditions mobilized the watershed community toward collective action after being faced with an intentional catalyst event. While baseline social conditions were key to the project's success, we found that how the project was structured and managed was also very important. Additionally, baseline conditions changed as a result of the project. This study provides an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to project success and is applicable to practitioners in selecting watersheds for future conservation projects and in determining how to structure and manage a watershed-based project.

AB  - Food forestry is a burgeoning practice in North America, representing a strong multifunctional approach that combines agriculture, forestry, and ecological restoration. The Galiano Conservancy Association (GCA), a community conservation, restoration, and educational organization on Galiano Island, British Columbia in Canada, recently has created two food forests on their protected forested lands: one with primarily non-native species and the other comprising native species. These projects, aimed at food production, education, and promotion of local food security and sustainability, are also intended to contribute to the overall ecological integrity of the landscape. Monitoring is essential for assessing how effectively a project is meeting its goal and thus informing its adaptive management. Yet, presently, there are no comprehensive monitoring frameworks for food forestry available. To fill this need, this study developed a generic Criteria and Indicators (C&I) monitoring framework for food forestry, embedded in ecological restoration principles, by employing qualitative content analysis of 61 literature resources and semi-structured interviews with 16 experts in the fields of food forestry and ecological restoration. The generic C&I framework comprises 14 criteria, 39 indicators, and 109 measures and is intended to guide a comprehensive and systematic assessment for food forest projects. The GCA adapted the generic C&I framework to develop a customized monitoring framework. The Galiano C&I monitoring framework has comprehensive suite of monitoring parameters, which are collectively address multiple values and goals.

AB  - We related stream channel and stream bank plant species composition to eighteen site specific and regional environmental variables in the New Jersey Pinelands (Pine Barrens). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) related major patterns in species composition to complex watershed disturbance gradients. There were significant correlations between the first axes of both the CCA and DCA stream site ordinations and agricultural and developed land cover in a drainage area, pH, specific conductance, and channel sediment. There was a clear contrast between stream stations found within relatively undeveloped watersheds and those in highly developed or farmed drainage areas. Surface waters of the undisturbed sites displayed lower pH and specific conductance values compared with waters in the more disturbed watersheds. The most heavily impacted sites supported a unique group of peripheral or exotic plant species that replaced characteristic Pine Barrens species. Overall species richness did not change in response to watershed disturbance. The presence of disturbance indicator species, or species found only at disturbed sites, provided a good measure of watershed disturbance. High between-site variability in the species present at relatively undisturbed stations and the persistence of some species at more recently disturbed sites complicated the identification of sensitive species, or species found only at undisturbed sites. A comparison of the number of species historically found within and outside the Pine Barrens, rather than the presence or absence of particular sensitive species, provided an additional measure of ecological integrity.

AB  - To better understand temporal variations in species diversity and composition, ecological attributes, and environmental influences for the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale community, we studied 50,900 fossil specimens belonging to 158 genera (mostly monospecific and non-biomineralized) representing 17 major taxonomic groups and 17 ecological categories. Fossils were collected in situ from within 26 massive siliciclastic mudstone beds of the Greater Phyllopod Bed (Walcott Quarry - Fossil Ridge). Previous taphonomic studies have demonstrated that each bed represents a single obrution event capturing a predominantly benthic community represented by census- and time-averaged assemblages, preserved within habitat. The Greater Phyllopod Bed (GPB) corresponds to an estimated depositional interval of 10 to 100 KA and thus potentially preserves community patterns in ecological and short-term evolutionary time.
   The community is dominated by epibenthic vagile deposit feeders and sessile suspension feeders, represented primarily by arthropods and sponges. Most species are characterized by low abundance and short stratigraphic range and usually do not recur through the section. It is likely that these are stenotopic forms (i.e., tolerant of a narrow range of habitats, or having a narrow geographical distribution). The few recurrent species tend to be numerically abundant and may represent eurytopic organisms (i.e., tolerant of a wide range of habitats, or having a wide geographical distribution). Rarefaction curves demonstrate variation in species richness through the GPB and suggest that more stenotopic species could still be discovered with additional sampling. Comparisons between richness and evenness trends suggest that the community is relatively stable overall, despite gradual species turnover through time, especially in assemblages from younger beds. Less diverse assemblages with low species evenness possibly represent the onset of less favourable environmental conditions.
   Fossil occurrences in individual beds were analysed using a range of statistical techniques (Correspondence Analysis, Canonical Correspondence Analysis, Minimum Spanning Tree, Indicator Species Analysis, Mantel Test) to extract community patterns. Results suggest the presence of four fossil assemblages based on distinct species associations. The different assemblages presumably reflect variations in environmental and ecological conditions, some acting through time, leading to species turnover. "Disturbances" (e.g., changes in paleo-redox conditions), differences in substrate firmness, and limited taphonomic biases are probably the main factors contributing to community structure. The influence of ecological factors, however, is also predicted from non-random patterns of species recurrences in successive events. Preliminary comparisons with Lower Cambrian Chengjiang-type assemblages of southern China suggest that the overall structure and ecology of Cambrian communities remained relatively stable until at least the Middle Cambrian in subtidal siliciclastic soft substrate environments.
   Comparisons with modern marine benthic ecosystems further suggest the Burgess Shale community was probably highly dependent on immigration from a regional pool of species after each burial event. This could support the view that species availability, habitat characteristics, and recolonisation processes were more important in structuring the community in the long-term than species interactions or environmental variations at a local scale.

AB  - A number of factors have combined to diminish ecosystem integrity in New Zealand indigenous lowland forest fragments surrounded by intensively grazed pasture. Livestock grazing, mammalian pests, adventive weeds and altered nutrient input regimes are important drivers compounding the changes in fragment structure and function due to historical deforestation and fragmentation. We used qualitative systems modelling and empirical data from Beilschmiedia tawa dominated lowland forest fragments in the Waikato Region to explore the relevance of two common resilience paradigms engineering resilience and ecological resilience for addressing the conservation management of forest fragments into the future. Grazing by livestock and foraging/predation by introduced mammalian pests both have direct detrimental impacts on key structural and functional attributes of forest fragments. Release from these perturbations through fencing and pest control leads to partial or full recovery of some key indicators (i.e. increased indigenous plant regeneration and cover, increased invertebrate populations and litter mass, decreased soil fertility and increased nesting success) relative to levels seen in larger forest systems over a range of timescales. These changes indicate that forest fragments do show resilience consistent with adopting an engineering resilience paradigm for conservation management, in the landscape context studied. The relevance of the ecological resilience paradigm in these ecosystems is obscured by limited data. We characterise forest fragment dynamics in terms of changes in indigenous species occupancy and functional dominance, and present a conceptual model for the management of forest fragment ecosystems.

AB  - Ground-based visual assessment of crown condition is a cornerstone of tree condition assessment globally, and numerous condition assessment approaches have evolved to address the needs and perspectives of different users. In Australia's iconic Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), stands of floodplain eucalypts are increasingly vulnerable to a range of interacting stressors related to climate change and over-extraction of water for consumptive and agricultural use. A standardised approach developed in 2008 for assessing floodplain trees within the MDB provides extensive guidance to ensure field data is collected consistently. However, there is minimal instruction on how to interpret data, and consequently a range of evaluation approaches have evolved. The lack of a standardised reporting framework generated by these different approaches makes it difficult for floodplain managers and environmental water holders to make repeatable, robust decisions for prioritising water allocations across competing locations. To provide improved lines of evidence to support decision making, this paper describes a 'best-practise' approach to calculating a tree condition score from field data. Within, we document existing approaches in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, and recommend a method that meets the needs of floodplain managers as a pragmatic reporting, communication and decision support tool that does not require statistical analysis. Case studies and a revised conceptual model of tree decline and recovery are provided to demonstrate the validity of the recommended approach.

AB  - Due to the complex circuitry and plethora of cell types involved in somatosensation, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to observe cellular activity at the population level. In addition, since cells rely on an intricate variety of extracellular factors, it is important to strive to maintain the physiological environment. Many electrophysiological techniques require the implementation of artificially-produced physiological environments and it can be difficult to assess the activity of many cells simultaneously. Moreover, imaging Ca2+ transients using Ca2+-sensitive dyes often requires in vitro preparations or in vivo injections, which can lead to variable expression levels. With the development of more sensitive genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) it is now possible to observe changes in Ca2+ transients in large populations of cells at the same time. Recently, groups have used a GECI called GCaMP to address fundamental questions in somatosensation. Researchers can now induce GCaMP expression in the mouse genome using viral or gene knock-in approaches and observe the activity of populations of cells in the pain pathway such as dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal neurons, or glia. This approach can be used in vivo and thus maintains the organism's biological integrity. The implementation of GCaMP imaging has led to many advances in our understanding of somatosensation. Here, we review the current findings in pain research using GCaMP imaging as well as discussing potential methodological considerations.

AB  - Riparian ecosystems as components of stream corridors provide a range of regulating ecosystem services including water production. Water quality, a component of water production is a major concern in urbanized watersheds. Water quality monitoring has been a very common method of investigating watershed impairment particularly in case of human impacts but it is now clear that hydrologic and ecological parameters may support and improve monitoring studies substantially. In three major watersheds of the Istanbul city (Alibeykoy, Sazlidere, and Kagithane) we initiated a large-scale study with the objective of evaluating integration, health, and functionality levels of riparian ecosystems. We combined a thorough field survey study with a GIS assessment to reach this objective. A total of 66 sub-watersheds have been selected in the main study watersheds and survey points have been determined at their outlets. All perennial streams in the study have been surveyed for 5 main categories; ecological water quality, water quality for use, riparian integrity, riparian functionality, and riparian habitat potential. We found that a substantial amount of the streams in or close to urban areas had lost their functionality. Furthermore, around 10 percent of all streams in the peri-urban areas had been channelled. Water quality has also been deteriorated in many streams. For example, average NO3-1 concentration at the urban streams was 76.63 mg L-1 while it was 2.67 mg L-1 at the forested part of the same watershed.

AB  - Little is known about the importance of landscape and land cover to the implementation and performance of agricultural conservation projects designed to improve stream quality. In our study, we addressed the potential importance of landscape and land cover to conservation projects by measuring variation across 191 mu-basins (100-2400 ha) and integrating the observed variation into a study design aimed at determining the effectiveness of conservation projects. Our findings indicate that there are strong gradients across which landscape and land cover attributes vary. Land cover varied along a gradient of agricultural intensity, basin morphometry across gradients of stream closure and basin size, basin substrate was described by variation in drumlin formation, glacial landform type, and soil drainage, while agricultural conservation projects varied according to the level of project implementation. Correlation of these gradients found several associations between landscape and land cover, indicating that agricultural intensity was being constrained predominantly by drumlin formation and glacial landform type. Landscape and land cover did not appear to be determining factors in the implementation of conservation projects by land owners. Based on these findings we chose 32 mu-basins which represented the variability along each of the defined gradients for further study. We conclude that landscape scale variables demonstrate important variation and covariation that can and should be integrated into study designs for the assessment of streams and human activities affecting streams.

AB  - The study attempts to assess water quality in Abu-Zirig Marsh which used epiphytic Diatom community for assessing water quality. Many of Diatom indices {Trophic diatom index (TDI), Diatom index (DI), Generic diatom index (GDI) have been used to give qualitative information about the status of the freshwater ecosystem(good, moderate, high pollution). In this study, the epiphytic diatoms on both host aquatic plants Phragmites australis and Typha domengensis were collected from Abu-Zirig Marsh within Thi-Qar Province at three sites in Autumn, 2018 and winter, 2019. Epiphytic diatoms were Identified by the preparation of permanent slides method, some species of epiphytic diatom showed dominance such as Cyclotella meneghiniana, Gomphonema angustatum, Cocconies placentula, Cymbella affinis, Navicula cryptoephala, Nitzschia linearis, N dissipata, Surirella ovalis. Abundant diatoms indicated trophic conditions of the Marsh. The results of diatom indices revealed that IPS (10-12.5) is a moderate pollution condition of marsh, DI (2.9-3.4) range from high to moderate pollution condition, TDI (47.2-60.8) indicates trophic condition ranging from (oligo-mesotrophic to eutrophic) condition of marsh while GDI a range between (11.6-13.7) moderate pollution condition, the aim of the study that is about evaluating water quality of Abu-Zirig Marsh by using Diatom indices (IPS,DI,TDI and GDI), as well as due to scarce local previous studies of epiphytic diatoms and used as bio-indicator of water quality in Abu-Zirig Marsh, therefor suggested this study.

AB  - Concerns on the impacts of disruptive events of various nature on business operations have increased significantly during the past decades. In this respect, business continuity management (BCM) has been proposed as a comprehensive and proactive framework to prevent the disruptive events from impacting the business operations and reduce their potential damages. Most existing business continuity assessment (BCA) models that numerically quantify the business continuity are time-static, in the sense that the analysis done before operation is not updated to consider the aging and degradation of components and systems which influence their vulnerability and resistance to disruptive events. On the other hand, condition monitoring is more and more adopted in industry to maintain under control the state of components and systems. On this basis, in this work, a dynamic and quantitative method is proposed to integrate in BCA the information on the conditions of components and systems. Specifically, a particle filtering-based method is developed to integrate condition monitoring data on the safety barriers installed for system protection, to predict their reliability as their condition changes due to aging. An installment model and a stochastic price model are also employed to quantify the time-dependent revenues and tolerable losses from operating the system. A simulation model is developed to evaluate dynamic business continuity metrics originally introduced. A case study regarding a nuclear power plant (NPP) risk scenario is worked out to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.

AB  - Historic buildings are defining elements of city centres but also responsible for a large share of greenhouse gas emissions. In order to reduce their energy demand, it is important to improve envelopes' thermal transmittance without damaging the historic integrity of their facades by applying interior insulation. Thus, a detailed planning is needed to guarantee that case-specific variables are well considered. In this study, a holistic performance-based evaluation method is developed. Firstly, the hygrothermal risks are investigated through dynamic hygrothermal simulation. Secondly, an energy assessment is performed, followed by a life-cycle assessment to investigate the environmental impact of the intervention. The developed method is applied in the framework of a conservation and rehabilitation case of a residential building, to evaluate six natural-based insulation systems: perlite filled bricks, wood fibre, cellulose, cork, mineral foam, and calcium silicate. Results show that vegetal-based materials have the lowest initial environmental impact. In any case, retrofit interventions proved to be crucial to reduce the overall environmental impact associated with the use of historic buildings. The developed method, proving to be suitable for application to internally insulated historic buildings, supports a clear identification of the design solution with the lowest environmental impact by using a unique indicator.

AB  - The mechanical and hydraulic properties of rocks around mine drifts change significantly during the construction and operation of a radioactive-waste repository, with air intrusion typically causing the oxidation of rock and groundwater in excavation-damaged zones (EDZ). Redox conditions in such zones associated with niches excavated in mudstone at the Horonobe Underground Research Laboratory (URL), which is believed to be generally representative of conditions that could exist in the EDZ of a repository, were studied with the aim of improving our understanding of factors that control redox conditions in such rock-groundwater systems. Groundwater Eh values around the niches have reducing values of less than -150 mV. The SO42- concentration, regarded as an oxidation indicator, is consistently as low as 1 mu mol L-1. Gas occupies > 50% of zone volumes, including CH4 and CO2 with traces of N-2 and O-2. Cores drilled from host rock around a URL gallery were analyzed, with no pyrite dissolution or precipitation of calcium sulfates being found. It is concluded that oxidizing conditions do not exist in the excavation-damaged zones, which is attributed to the suppression of air intrusion by the release of CH4 and CO2 from groundwater as pressures decreased and their accumulation in fractures. The modeling of oxygen diffusion into host rock further indicates that a reducing environment is maintained around the URL drifts.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of the weather conditions and local climate on the temporal and spatial variability of particulate matters (PM 10) in Iasi city which is facing major pollution problems in the recent years. Daily data from 4 monitoring stations of Environmental Protection Agency-Iasi-for main weather parameters and particulate matters - and the temperature from an inner temperature and relative humidity observation network inside the city were used for a three year study (2013-2015). Linear correlation, composite analysis and multiple regression are the main statistical methods applied in the analysis. In brief, the most important meteorological parameters enhancing air pollution in Iasi seem to be represented by thermal inversions developing in the region strongly related to local climate conditions. The Pearson correlation coefficient (stronger than -0.40) between PM10 and thermal gradient, the difference in the PM10 concentration exceeding 20 mu g/m(3) between strong thermal inversions and unstable conditions and the leading role of thermal gradients in multiple regression are the main indicators of the great role of thermal inversion in generating and sustaining pollution conditions in this area. The maximum concentrations of PM10 occur in May and March, gathering more than 30% of the days for the entire year. Complementary studies were taken into account in order to analyse the aerosol optical properties retrieved from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-NASA).

AB  - Environmental temperature is one of the important abiotic factors that influence the normal physiological function and productive performance of dairy cattle. Temperature stress evokes complex responses that are essential for safeguarding of cellular integrity and animal health. Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNA plays a key role cellular stress responses. The present study investigated the differential expression of miRNA in Frieswal (Holstein Friesian x Sahiwal) crossbred dairy cattle that are distinctly adapted to environmental temperature stress as they were evolved by using the temperate dairy breed Holstein Friesian. The results indicated that there was a significant variation in the physiological and biochemical indicators estimated under summer stress. The differential expression of miRNA was observed under heat stress when compared to the normal winter season. Out of the total 420 miRNAs, 65 were differentially expressed during peak summer temperatures. Most of these miRNAs were found to target heat shock responsive genes especially members of heat shock protein (HSP) family, and network analysis revealed most of them having stress-mediated effects on signaling mechanisms. Being greater in their expression profile during peak summer, bta-miR-2898 was chosen for reporter assay to identify its effect on the target HSPB8 (heat shock protein 22) gene in stressed bovine PBMC cell cultured model. Comprehensive understanding of the biological regulation of stress responsive mechanism is critical for developing approaches to reduce the production losses due to environmental heat stress in dairy cattle.

AB  - Estuaries are critical aquatic environments that are used by many fish during their life cycle. However, estuaries often suffer from poor water quality as a result of anthropogenic activities. Fish diversity studies in estuaries are common, although few have examined whether correlations exist between water quality, metal contamination and fish assemblages. In the present study we investigated the effect of abiotic conditions, heavy metals and estuary characteristics on the abundance, diversity and composition of fish in four intermittently open estuaries along the Illawarra coast of south-eastern Australia. The heterogeneity of environmental conditions was reflected in the fish assemblages in each estuary. Environmental variables predicted fish species composition, and estuaries in particularly poor condition contained few species (estuarine residents) in high abundance, indicating their ability to acclimatise and survive in conditions that are hostile to other species. Overall, these findings demonstrate that estuarine fish assemblages may be useful indicators of estuary condition and reveal the importance of managing anthropogenic activities in the surrounding catchment to improve water quality so that biodiversity of fish can be restored in these estuarine environments.

AB  - Plant pathogens cause significant losses to agricultural yields and increasingly threaten food security(1), ecosystem integrity and societies in general(2-5). Xylella fastidiosa is one of the most dangerous plant bacteria worldwide, causing several diseases with profound impacts on agriculture and the environment(6). Primarily occurring in the Americas, its recent discovery in Asia and Europe demonstrates that X. fastidiosa's geographic range has broadened considerably, positioning it as a reemerging global threat that has caused socioeconomic and cultural damage(7,8). X. fastidiosa can infect more than 350 plant species worldwide(9), and early detection is critical for its eradications(8). In this article, we show that changes in plant functional traits retrieved from airborne imaging spectroscopy and thermography can reveal X. fastidiosa infection in olive trees before symptoms are visible. We obtained accuracies of disease detection, confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, exceeding 80% when high-resolution fluorescence quantified by three-dimensional simulations and thermal stress indicators were coupled with photosynthetic traits sensitive to rapid pigment dynamics and degradation. Moreover, we found that the visually asymptomatic trees originally scored as affected by spectral plant-trait alterations, developed X. fastidiosa symptoms at almost double the rate of the asymptomatic trees classified as not affected by remote sensing. We demonstrate that spectral plant-trait alterations caused by X. fastidiosa infection are detectable previsually at the landscape scale, a critical requirement to help eradicate some of the most devastating plant diseases worldwide.

AB  - Biological indicators are frequently used to assess the effects of anthropogenic stressors on freshwater ecosystems. The structure of fish communities and their response to stressors have been commonly described by taxonomic richness, diversity and evenness. More recently, functional structure of communities has also been suggested to be a reliable indicator of disturbance. This article aimed at testing whether taxonomic and functional diversity metrics can provide comparable or complementary information on the response of fish communities to eutrophication and abundance of non-native species in reservoirs. Comparison of the responses of taxonomic and functional diversities to biogeography, habitat and stressors was made in 112 French reservoirs. Widely observed effects of biogeographic and habitat variables on taxonomic and functional diversities were identified. Taxonomic and functional richness metrics notably increased with lake area and temperature respectively. Taxonomic diversity metrics did not respond to any stressor, while all functional diversity metrics were found to be impacted by non-native species. Eutrophication was further found to decrease the impact of non-native species on two functional diversity metrics: evenness and divergence. Our study therefore reveals that functional metrics are more sensitive than taxonomic metrics to anthropogenic stressors in the studied reservoirs. Still, the multiple linear regressions tested had overall low explanatory power. Further refinements will thus be needed to use this type of metrics in an impact assessment scheme.

AB  - BackgroundThe collection of atmospheric deposition by technical samplers and validated deposition modelling using chemical transport models is spatially complemented by using mosses as bioindicator: since 1990, the European moss survey has been providing data on element concentrations in moss every 5years at up to 7300 sampling sites. In the moss specimens, heavy metals (since 1990), nitrogen (since 2005) and persistent organic pollutants (since 2010) were determined. Germany participated in all surveys with the exception of that in 2010. In this study, the spatial structures of element concentrations in moss collected in Germany between 1990 and 2015 were comparatively investigated by using Moran's I statistics and Variogram analysis and mapped by use of Kriging interpolation. This is the precondition to spatially join the moss survey data with data collected at other locations within different environmental networks and to validate spatial patterns of atmospheric deposition as derived by technical sampling and modelling.ResultsThe calculated maps reveal a clear and statistically significant decrease of most heavy metals, but not of nitrogen, in moss. Due to decreasing element concentrations and the unchanged application of the element concentration classification for the mapping, the heavy metal maps for the survey 2015 do no longer depict much spatial variation.ConclusionsTherefore, in an upcoming study, this analysis needs to be complemented for the heavy metals by calculating maps that depict the spatial structure of survey-specific percentile statistics 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2015.

AB  - It is important to determine the water quality of the creeks in the Lake Sapanca basin since it is used for drinking water supply. For this purpose, environmental parameters and diatom assemblages as biological quality components were investigated to determine the ecological status of eight creeks with monthly intervals between March 2015 and February 2016. A total of 132 diatom taxa were identified in eight creeks of the Lake Sapanca basin during the studied period. 19 taxa increased their relative abundance higher than 30% in at least one sample and showed a different seasonal pattern. Environmental parameters [nitrate-nitrogen, orthophosphate, total phosphorus (TP), specific conductance, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen] were effective on the distribution of diatom assemblages. The ecological status of the creeks was characterized by using four different diatom indices (TIT, EPI-D, IPS, and TDI), however, only Trophic Index Turkey (TIT) represented significant positive correlations with log (TP) gradient. Both environmental parameters, the relative abundance of indicator species, and TIT index results stated that 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 8th stations had moderate, while 4th and 6th stations had good water quality. The good correlation of TIT index with log (TP), and its compatibility with the presence of indicator species at different stations indicates that this index could be used in the Lake Sapanca basin, and Sakarya basin where the lake basin is located.
   It is important to determine the water quality of the creeks in the Lake Sapanca basin since it is used for drinking water supply. For this purpose, environmental parameters and diatom assemblages as biological quality components were investigated to determine the ecological status of eight creeks with monthly intervals between March 2015 and February 2016. During the studied period, 19 taxa increased their relative abundance higher than 30% in at least one sample and showed a different seasonal pattern. Main nutrients [(nitrate-nitrogen, orthophosphate, total phosphorus (TP)] and some other parameters (specific conductance, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen) had strong impacts on the distribution of diatom assemblages. The ecological status of the creeks was characterized by using four different diatom indices, however, only Trophic Index Turkey (TIT) represented significant positive correlations with log (TP) gradient and separated the creeks as good and moderate ecological status. According to TIT, the 4th and 6th stations had a good ecological condition and were characterized by pollution-sensitive species such as Cymbella affinis, Reimeria sinuata, and Nitzschia dissipata. On the other hand, TIT resulted in the other stations having moderate ecological conditions, which had high nutrient levels and EC. Moreover, the occurrence of pollution-tolerant taxa such as Gomphonema angustatum, Ulnaria ulna, and Achnanthidium affine endorsed the moderate ecological conditions in these creeks. Based on the results, the TIT as a biological metric could be a useful tool for the assessment of running waters in the Sakarya river basin.

AB  - Formulation of the problem. A national climate program, complying with the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU, is aimed at long-term adaptation measures to climate change, providing for the development of legislation in the field of environmental protection, sectoral strategies, improving air and water quality. These measures require identification of climatic factors' impact on hydrological characteristics of water bodies in any area in order to protect and improve them, as well as a comprehensive approach to the rational management of water resources.
   Analysis of previous research. Using mathematical models of atmospheric circulation allows us to obtain generalized calculations of the average global and regional air temperature, characterized by significant errors in case of different models.
   Problems of further research. Modern changes in climatic conditions in Ukraine are characterized by locality and rapidity: increasing number of anomalous atmospheric phenomena, frequency of droughts, dry winds which, according to preliminary estimates, may lead to reduction of water resources, changes in internal annual redistribution of water temperature and runoff against the background of increasing thermal resources of the territory.
   The purpose. The article analyses climatic indicators' influence on the main hydrological characteristics on the example of the Psyol river basin within Ukraine.
   Research methods. Research methods are presented by statistical and cartographic analysis (correlation analysis method). The initial information is the results of observations contained in the State Climate Cadastre and the State Water Cadastre for the Dnieper Valley.
   Presentation of the main research material. Analysis of climate change in the Psyol river basin indicates a decrease in water consumption, both in the main river of the basin and in its main tributaries. In addition to changes in temperature and humidity, the reasons for this process were the shifts that occurred in the nature of the intra-annual distribution of the runoff. During the late XX - early XXI century the share of spring floods decreased due to the reduced period of ice phenomena and corresponding decrease in the thickness of the snow cover on the rivers. As a result, the most important component of the annual runoff of rivers began to decrease rapidly. The role of groundwater in the formation of water runoff increased against the background of a predominant decrease in precipitation. This is especially true for medium-size and small rivers, subject to significant anthropogenic pressure: over-regulation of channels, creation of artificial lakes, their shallowing.
   Practical value. Based on the main provisions of the national environmental policy of Ukraine on the use of water resources and the implementation of European principles of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60 / EC (ERVD) the study of changes in hydrological regime of rivers is of practical importance for sustainable management.
   Research results. The study of the impact of changes in climatic indicators on hydrological characteristics makes it possible to determine the reference conditions and classes of ecological status of rivers under conditions of anthropogenic pressure against the background of further changes in climatic indicators that will have different trends.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish physiological responses of Piemontese cows to different environmental conditions (ambient temperature, relative humidity and temperature-humidity index). To this end, 43 clinically healthy Piemontese cows aged 2-12 years were used to evaluate the effect of environmental conditions on haematological parameters. For each period, ambient temperature and relative humidity were recorded by means of a data logger and the temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated as indicator of thermal comfort for cattle. Blood samples were collected at 4 time points under different environmental conditions (T1, T2, T3 and T4) and analysed for haematological parameters. One way repeated measure analysis of variance showed a statistically significant effect of time (P<0.0001) on RBC, Hb, Hct, MCV, MCH, MCHC, Plt, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils. The majority of haematological values obtained in the present study, even though within the physiological range for cattle, showed that variations in haematological parameters are related to changes in ambient temperature, relative humidity and temperature-humidity index. These results provide insight into the physiological responses of Piemontese cows to different environmental conditions, allowing to better evaluate its ability to adapt and cope with environmental stress.

AB  - A novel turn-off fluorescent probe based on coumarin and imidazole moiety for extremely acidic conditions was designed and developed. The probe with pK(a) =2.1 is able to respond to very low pH value (below 3.5) with high sensitivity relying on fluorescence quenching at 460 nm in fluorescence spectra or the ratios of absorbance maximum at 380 nm to that at 450 nm in UV-vis spectra. It can quantitatively detect pH value based on equilibrium equation, pH = pK(a) - log[(I-x - I-b)/(I-a - I-x)]. It had very short response time that was less than 1 min, good reversibility and nearly no interference from common metal ions. Moreover, using H-1 NMR analysis and theoretical calculation of molecular orbital, we verified that a two-step protonation process of two N atoms of the probe leaded to photoinduced electron transfer (PET), which was actually the mechanism of the fluorescence quenching phenomenon under strongly acidic conditions. Furthermore, the probe was also applied to imaging strong acidity in bacteria, E.coli and had good effect. This work illustrates that the new probe could be a practical and ideal pH indicator for strongly acidic conditions with good biological significance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to elucidate whether the current withholding period of 4 hours following irrigation of public recreational areas with some classes of recycled water, as prescribed in some Australian state regulations, is valid or whether the holding time can be reduced under specified ambient conditions. A secondary objective was to evaluate laboratory simulations of ambient field conditions for microbial survival experiments. Results suggest that the currently prescribed 4 hour withholding period achieves a reduction of health risk associated P g P with bacterial enteric pathogens that would not otherwise occur if the withholding period was reduced. However, this may not be the case for viral enteric pathogens as the survival of bacteriophages, PRD-1 and MS-2 on turf-grass did not significantly change even after 6 hours, except PRD-1 under high solar conditions. These results suggest that bacteriophages, PRD-1 and MS-2 are more conservative indicators of enteric pathogen survival on UV exposed turf-grass compared with E. coli. The simulations of field conditions in the laboratory were somewhat problematic, with the variations in natural conditions that occur temporally, sometimes for short periods, difficult to reproduce.

AB  - The Miocene fauna of land gastropods from Patagonia is still poorly known. This work presents the first record of a land pulmonate gastropod belonging to the genus Stephadiscus (Mollusca: Stylommatophora: Charopidae), in the Santa Cruz Formation (Argentina, early-middle Miocene). The importance of this find is analyzed in the geological and paleontological contexts and its paleoclimatic and paleogeobiogeographical significance is discussed. The previous fossil record of this Formation has provided indicators of very different climatic and environmental conditions, viz, a trend from warm, humid conditions and arboreal environments to more arid conditions and more open environments. These paleoenvironmental reconstructions have been based on sedimentological studies, functional morphological analyses of different vertebrate species, their phylogenetic relations, and cenograms of mammal communities. Accordingly, the presence of Stephadiscus sp. at fossiliferous level 6 of Santa Cruz Formation indicates a setting of humid environmental conditions at least for the early-middle Miocene, with development of shrubby and forest vegetation, which is consistent with humidity and environmental stability conditions interpreted from the record of paleochannels, floodplains and the most mature paleosol found in the Atlantic coast south of Coyle River.

KW  - Focus construction

KW  - LF movement
AB  - Two groups of Chinese sentences involve LF wh-movement in the same fashion but contrast sharply in grammaticality. We demonstrate in this article that this systematic contrast constitutes a significant puzzle for the well-known claim that LF movement of adjuncts is constrained by the applicable locality conditions whereas that of arguments need not obey those conditions in the wh-in-situ languages like Chinese. We argue that this contrast can be accounted for naturally by appealing to a general condition on the positioning of the Chinese focus marker shi, which has nothing to do with the locality conditions on movement in any form. Furthermore, a reasonable solution of the problem argues for a Pied-Piping approach to deal with the language facts that have been under consideration by many authors but have not received a satisfactory treatment. That is, what is being LF-extracted in those superficially island-violating sentences in fact is the whole island that contains the questioned or focused element rather than the questioned or focused element alone. The LF movement of arguments is subject to the locality conditions very much in the very same fashion as that of adjuncts in the Chinese language.

AB  - In the evaluation of animal welfare under practical husbandry conditions - beside a clear definition of welfare - selection of indicators plays an important role. Using the example of fattening pig husbandry, the usefulness of physiological, immunological and pathological, ethological, and technical criteria of husbandry conditions is discussed. While physiological and immunological parameters can lead to findings about stress reactions under controlled circumstances their direct transfer to practical conditions is hardly possible. On the contrary, ethological indicators as outer signs of inner states can be recorded most reliable. Beside stereotypies and aberrant behaviour as clear signs of reduced welfare, especially in barren environments, the performance of species-specific behaviour can point to a positive influence on welfare. Behavioural observations over a longer period of time considering plenty of (ethological) indicators build a solid base for selection of methods. For further interpretation of results behavioural data should be supplemented by parameters which can be recorded without major distraction of the animals: general condition of the animal including injuries and soiling, performance, technical data of the husbandry conditions as well as the increasingly important evaluation of carcasses.

AB  - COVID-19 confronted many people with an abrupt shift from their usual working environment to telework. This study explores which job characteristics are perceived as most crucial in this exceptional situation and how they differ from people's previous working conditions. Additionally, we focus on job crafting as a response to this situation and how it is related to employees' well-being. We conducted an online survey with N = 599 participants, of which 321 reported that they were telework newcomers. First, we asked participants to indicate the three most important advantages and disadvantages they see in telework. The subsequent questionnaire contained a comprehensive measure of working conditions before and during the pandemic, job crafting behaviors, and indicators of well-being. Based on the qualitative answers, we identified three major advantages and disadvantages. Quantitative results indicate perceived changes in all job characteristics for telework newcomers. Concerning working conditions and well-being, job crafting activities that aim to increase structural and social resources are important mediators. The findings underline the need to design appropriate telework conditions and encourage job crafting activities to foster occupational well-being.

AB  - Wetland condition can be severely altered as a result of a change in hydrology. In this study, we examined several soil-based methods to quantify and assess changes in salt marsh condition as a result of tidal restriction. Soil properties were compared between two tidally restricted and two (paired) unrestricted salt marshes. Organic horizon morphology provided a qualitative metric of marsh peat decomposition. Quantitative measures of the degree of decomposition included stable plant fragment content and bearing capacity. Soil pH provided simple metrics of changes in soil chemistry. Bulk density was measured to estimate marsh peat collapse and soil organic matter content provided a measure of carbon dynamics. Neither marsh showed significant differences in soil organic matter or bulk density relative to their paired reference marsh. In contrast, soil pH, stable plant fragment content, and bearing capacity were significantly different between restricted and reference marshes. With the exception of incubation pH, these soil properties can be simply and rapidly measured in the field to quantify physical, chemical, and biological changes in the wetland condition of salt marshes as a result of tidal restriction. Further studies should be conducted to develop a rapid protocol for measuring incubation pH in the field.

AB  - Monitoring vegetation of and and semi-arid zones by remote sensing can help natural resource management. Techniques previously used in Africa are applied to monitor vegetation conditions and productivity in Jordan. The historical normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were extracted from the FAO ARTEMIS and NASA PAL archives, and processed to stratify the major vegetation zones of Jordan. Statistical distribution of the NDVI for each 10-day period of the year was extracted for each vegetation zone, and quartile probability ranges were used to define four classes of vegetation condition, represented as vegetation productivity indicators (VPI). Images of NOAA LAC were acquired from the local receiving station at the Meteorological Department of Jordan and processed in real time to produce VPI maps that detected the temporal variations in vegetation condition in different parts of the country. In the second part of the research, vegetation productivity of grazing reserves was correlated against the NDVI derived from LAC images. A significant correlation was found between the above-ground biomass of shrubs and the NDVI derived from NOAA LAC images. The study clearly showed the suitability of NOAA AVHRR data for monitoring vegetation conditions and productivity in Jordan. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Preparing for peat production seasons in Finland and experimenting with long range impact forecasting
T2  - CLIMATE SERVICES
LA  - English
AB  - In Finland peat has been used for energy production, for agricultural and horticultural and environmental purposes. Success of peat production depends on weather. Dry and sunny conditions are needed, and weather forecasts give the basis for the planning the activities of relatively short production season. In 2017, by request of the leading Finnish peat production company Vapo, Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) co-designed a long-range-forecast experiment to describe the risk for rainy days in summer 2017. The experiment started in April and continued throughout the peat production season (May-August). We used the CFSv2 forecasts and FMI gridded historical data to downscale the global forecast into regional scale. Here we present an evaluation of the experiment and compare summer 2017 to the current climatic conditions. Overall, the predictions described the conditions rather well: "there will be negative impacts/major negative impacts on peat production due to the lack of consecutive dry days". Interestingly, this time a forecast derived purely from the climatological conditions (1981-2010) would have been a better indicator of the conditions to come. Our conclusion is that current climatic statistics complemented with LRF based predictions may offer help when preparing for the variation in weather in the coming seasons.

AB  - Performance improvement is taken as the primary goal in the asset management. Advanced data analysis is needed to efficiently integrate condition monitoring data into the operation and maintenance. Intelligent stress and condition indices have been developed for control and condition monitoring by combining generalized norms with efficient nonlinear scaling. These nonlinear scaling methodologies can also be used to handle performance measures used for management since management oriented indicators can be presented in the same scale as intelligent condition and stress indices. Performance indicators are responses of the process, machine or system to the stress contributions analyzed from process and condition monitoring data. Scaled values are directly used in intelligent temporal analysis to calculate fluctuations and trends. All these methodologies can be used in prognostics and fatigue prediction. The meanings of the variables are beneficial in extracting expert knowledge and representing information in natural language. The idea of dividing the problems into the variable specific meanings and the directions of interactions provides various improvements for performance monitoring and decision making. The integrated temporal analysis and uncertainty processing facilitates the efficient use of domain expertise. Measurements can be monitored with generalized statistical process control (GSPC) based on the same scaling functions.

AB  - In natural, undisturbed ecosystems the meaning of soil quality should express the features of each system in its own pedoclimatic conditions, without referring quality to an universal standard of "healthy" soil. Forest soil quality may be therefore defined as "the soil ability to match the natural succession of the biocoenosis". This study was conducted to test soil quality indicators based on microbial biomass activity nn Mediterranean forest soils. The influence of different plant communities and management practice on soil characteristics were investigated in eight sites on the Tyrrhenic coast near Rome. Metabolic quotient, C-CO2 production, microbial C to organic C ratio, C/N ratio, Cl estimate and qmC turned out powerful tools to depict both ecosystem dynamics and properties.

AB  - During the construction of an underground car park, archaeological excavations allowed the study of a Middle Neolithic alluvial soil buried under more than 8 m of sediment in the low alluvial plain of the Paillon river (Nice, Alpes-Maritimes). Chrono-stratigraphic, sedimentological, ceramological and paleo-ecological studies document the depositional conditions and the paleo-environmental context. They confirm the role of Neolithic communities in the degradation of the vegetation cover and the impact of agro-pastoral practices and extreme weather events on slope-deposits erosion. These anthropogenic erosion episodes are characterized by a blurred granulometric signature and the presence of heterometric and heterogeneous inclusions disconnected from the background granulometric signal.

AB  - This article critically examines the integration of environmental policy in the European Union (EU), focusing on the development of Policy Guidelines for the trans-European transport network. Key events are charted by which the integration of environmental concerns came to hinge on a single contested issue - the adoption of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). The success of SEA in achieving environmental-policy integration is evaluated. An important aspect of this approach is to explore how the hegemonic discourses in the EU shape the policy process, and condition the success or failure of environmental integration. The al-tide reflects on current debates about ecological modernization in the EU, arguing that the institutional learning model is inappropriate, and suggesting that understanding ecological modernization as cultural politics may bring a clearer understanding of the constructed nature of environmental-policy integration.

AB  - The aquatic ecosystem of the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve is constantly being subjected to various kinds of pollution. This system receives a huge quality and quantity of wastes such as industrial and domestic discharges from several countries crossed by the Danube river. The study was conducted to roughly estimate zooplankton and macroinvertebrates community to establish indicator values of ecological status in four shallow and eutrophic lakes. During five years (2009-2013) the study indicates that zooplankton and macroinvertebrates community are indicators of ecological conditions stems from their position in the food web between the phytoplankton and fish, thus providing information about the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up control and their impact on water.

AB  - Freshwater habitats are one of the planet's most important, yet most manipulated, environments. This is what happens in Sarawak that the environment has been radically changed due to urban developments. This paper is promoting the idea that we do not need a complicated but a simple tool like fuzzy inference system to strike a balance between the existence of peat swamp and the humans who live nearer and nearer to it. Conditions vital to the survival and continuity of a natural wetland system can be adapted as fuzzy rules. These rules are capable of providing indicators of how much wetland can be exploited and at the same time still allow the system to properly functioning as a wetland.

AB  - A high number of species often represents a relevant redundancy in terms of ecological adaptation strategies. Collecting species to groups based on their functional adaptations can handle this redundancy and obtain the "real" functional complexity of ecosystems. Functional traits are proxies of adaptation strategies under particular environmental conditions, and a set of functional traits are interpreted as life-strategies. Organisms with life-strategies occupying a similar niche can be collected in ecological groups (functional group/guild). In this study, we review the latest trait-based approaches and existing attempts at functional classifications in phytobenthos studies. Advantages and shortcomings of these classifications are discussed with perspectives of their utility in ecological status assessment.

AB  - Epipsammic diatoms have important implications for ecosystem processes in lotic environments. Most of the studies on benthic diatoms concentrate on epilithic diatoms and very little is known about epipsammic diatoms. The objective of this study was to assess epipsammic diatom communities in streams in relation to environmental conditions. Epipsammic diatoms and water quality sampling was done at 7 sites during summer base flow period (2008). Forward stepwise multiple regression and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to determine environmental gradients along which species vary with physical and chemical variables. A total of 112 diatom species distributed among 44 genera were recorded. Altitude and the process of eutrophication played a significant role in structuring diatom communities in the study region.

AB  - Sustainable development requires an integrated evaluation of both economic and environmental dimensions. The ensuing debate on the topic, however, was focused on its environmental aspects, as if they were fully independent from the social and economic conditions of sustainability. In this paper, we intend to present a primal approach to develop an exergy-economic accounting allowing to overcome the limits of each analytic discipline through its integration in a sound economic scheme such as environmental accounting; this scheme will be adapted to sea-coastal systems. In order to complete the approach mentioned a specific indicator will be proposed aimed to evaluate the relationship between ecosystem quality and economic added value stemming from the anthropic use of the system.

AB  - Evolutionary theory posits that resource availability and parental investment ability could signal offspring sex selection, in order to maximize reproductive returns. Non-human studies have provided evidence for this phenomenon, and maternal condition around the time of conception has been identified as most important factor that influence offspring sex selection. However, studies on humans have reported inconsistent results, mostly due to use of disparate measures as indicators of maternal condition. In the present study, the cross-cultural differences in human natal sex ratio were analyzed with respect to indirect measures of condition namely, life expectancy and mortality rate. Multiple regression modeling suggested that mortality rates have distinct predictive power independent of cross-cultural differences in fertility, wealth and latitude that were earlier shown to predict sex ratio at birth. These findings suggest that sex ratio variation in humans may relate to differences in parental and environmental conditions.

AB  - The challenges for reversing course in our stewardship of the earth's ecosystems has never been,greater. Biodiversity is in decline on an unprecedented scale and it is tempting to use this as an indicator of the health of the earth's ecosystems. In fact it is one of a number of indicators that collectively provides information on trends in the condition of ecosystems. But the larger problem is the lack of integration between the social and natural sciences. Mainstream scientists continue to reject the notion that solving environmental problems requires an integration of values and processes. A conceptual model shows how these facets may be brought together. A holistic vision requires the integration of natural, social and health sciences. From this perspective the linkage between biodiversity, ecosystem resilience and management options is more dearly articulated.

AB  - We examined the relationship between biopedturbation (animal caused soil disturbance) and several vegetation and soil-based indicators of rangeland condition to evaluate the effects of desertification on animal soil disturbance. The area, volume, and abundance of various biopedturbation types were assessed at 117 sites in south-central New Mexico where vegetative cover and composition had been measured previously. There were significant relationships between biopedturbation and selected rangeland condition indicators. Increasing percentages of grass cover were positively associated with increasing total area of biopedturbation. Increasing percentages of shrub cover and mean bare patch size were negatively associated with total biopedturbation area. Biopedrurbation area and volume were related to indicators of rangeland condition and percent shrub cover best predicts the area of soil disturbed by animals. This relationship, however, cannot reliably predict total biopedturbation area or the area of soil disturbance types. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The limits of acceptable change (LAC) planning framework recognizes that forest managers must decide what indicators of wilderness conditions best represent resource naturalness and high-quality visitor experiences and how much change from the pristine is acceptable for each indicator. Visitor opinions on the aspects of the wilderness that have great impact on their experience can provide valuable input to selection of indicators. Cohutta, Georgia; Caney Creek, Arkansas; Upland Island, Texas; and Rattlesnake, Montana, wilderness visitors have high shared agreement that littering and damage to trees in campsites, noise, and seeing wildlife are very important influences on wilderness experiences. Camping within sight or sound of other people influences experience quality more than do encounters on the trails. Visitors' standards of acceptable conditions within wilderness vary considerably, suggesting a potential need to manage different zones within wilderness for different clientele groups and experiences. Standards across wildernesses, however, are remarkably similar.

AB  - Peracetic acid (PAA) is an environmentally friendly disinfectant and oxidizer used in several water and wastewater treatment applications. In the present study, PAA was utilized for the conditioning of municipal wastewater sludge before thickening and dewatering. It was shown that PAA can effectively prevent odor formation (i.e., H2S and NH3) and provide hygienization (using E. coli. and Salmonella as indicators). Phytotoxicity can be prevented by controlling the amount PAA-conditioned sludge that is mixed in the soil to be fertilized. The required PAA dose for hygienization was relatively high (480 mg 100% PAA per L sludge) but the results indicated that other sludge stabilization processes are not necessarily required. Therefore, the proposed process involving PAA could be feasible in cases where limited land area is available for sludge processing or quick conditioning of sludge is required. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - I studied a dataset of surface sediment samples from 80 lakes with zoological macroremain analysis to assess the potential of fossil ceratopogonids (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), ephemeropterans (Insecta: Ephemeroptera), trichopterans (Insecta: Trichoptera) and oribatid mites (Acarina: Oribatida) as palaeolimnological indicators in Finland. Results showed that late-winter hypolimnetic oxygen and climatic variables were most important in influencing the occurrence and abundance of these taxa. Of the ceratopogonids, the Bezzia type was an indicator of elevated hypolimnetic oxygen conditions, warm climate and oligotrophy, while the Dasyhelea type indicated low hypolimnetic oxygen conditions, moderately cool climate and mild acidity. Ephemeropterans, trichopterans and oribatids indicated warm climatic conditions and oribatids were also indicative of elevated oxygen conditions and small oligotrophic lakes. Results of this study can be useful in palaeolimnological studies because the fauna examined provides a valuable supplementary data source for multiproxy studies.

AB  - We use the linear sampling method (LSM) to identify a crack with impedance boundary conditions from far-field measurements at a fixed frequency. This article extends the work of CakoniColton [F. Cakoni and D. Colton, The linear sampling method for cracks, Inverse Probl. 19 (2003), pp. 279295] where LSM has been used to reconstruct a crack with impedance boundary conditions on one side of the crack and a Dirichlet boundary condition on the other one. In addition, we present two methods to also reconstruct the impedance parameters whence the geometry is known. The first one is based on the interpretation of the indicator function produced by the LSM, while the second one is a natural approach based on the integral representation of the far-field in terms of densities on the crack geometry. The performance of the different reconstruction methods is illustrated through numerical examples in a 2D setting of the scattering problem.

AB  - Corrosion of concrete sewers is associated with the biological oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to sulfuric acid by bacteria of the genus Thiobacillus. Inhibition of acid production by these organisms, was investigated by challenging established cultures with a heterotrophic competitor under controlled conditions. Two-organism competition experiments (T. thiooxidans or T. neapolitanus versus the heterotrophic competitor) were conducted in a bench-scale, continuous-flow, constantly stirred tank reactor. Results were sensitive to the influent nitrogen:carbon ratio. Under conditions designed to produce nitrogen-limited growth, the numbers of thiobacilli were reduced 60- to 1 200-fold after introduction of the competitor. Effluent sulfate concentrations, an indicator of acid production, dropped by 85%. Under carbon-limited conditions, modest reductions in thiobacilli cell density and effluent sulfate concentration were observed. Microbial competition reduced acid production under the conditions of the experiment. The results suggest that strategies based on competitive displacement of thiobacilli to inhibit corrosion of concrete sewers may be feasible.

AB  - Some blood parameters response of carp (Cyprinus carpio) to rearing conditions changes were analysed for one year. Haematological parameters studied, because they can illustrate physiological modifications, are: hematocrit and hemoglobin values, erythrocyte count, plasma glucose and protein levels, immunoglobulin/total protein ratio.
   Rearing conditions tested are those frequently used in Dombes. Two successive periods are considered:
   semi-intensive rearing, caracterised by high densities and supplementary food with carbohydrate or protein-rich diets,
   extensive rearing, with low densities and exclusively natural food.
   Our results show an effect of alimentation and of the spring temperature increase. Important physiological changes are noted when food distribution is stopped. It seems that diet exclusively composed of commercial food with high-protein level can generate a physiological deficience of fish when they are transfered into ponds.

AB  - Desiccant cooling is a technique based on evaporative cooling and air dehumidification using desiccant regenerated by thermal energy. It is particularly interesting when it is driven by waste or solar heat making this technique environmentally friendly.
   In this paper, an experimental investigation is carried on a desiccant air handling unit powered by vacuum-tube solar collectors. First, the components are studied under various operating conditions. Then overall performance of the installation is evaluated over a day for a moderately humid climate with regeneration solely by solar energy. In these conditions the overall efficiency of the solar installation is 0.55 while the thermodynamic coefficient of performance is 0.45 and the performance indicator based on the electrical consumption is 4.5. Finally, the impact of outside and regeneration conditions on the performance indicators is studied. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A quantitative survey of the protozoan microfauna at 17 activated sludge plants, has been carried out during a period of 1 year. The occurrence and abundance of the most important protozoans were compared with the operational parameters of the plant using multivariate statistical procedures. Principal component analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation, performed on 19 species of protozoa and 7 physico-chemical parameters, revealed a clear relationship between the presence and abundance of some species and the prevailing environmental factors and plant operating conditions. In particular the shelled amoebae Arcella and Euglypha, and the sessile ciliate Vaginicola crystallina were directly associated to nitrifying conditions. Conversely, the sessile ciliates Vorticella microstoma and Opercularia spp showed an inverse relationship with the aforenamed operational condition and were directly associated with other plant conditions such as sludge loading, low dissolved oxygen in the aeration tank, and high BOD values in the final effluent.

AB  - The grazing lands of northern Australia contain a substantial soil organic carbon (SOC) stock due to the large land area. Manipulating SOC stocks through grazing management has been presented as an option to offset national greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and other industries. However, research into the response of SOC stocks to a range of management activities has variously shown positive, negative or negligible change. This uncertainty in predicting change in SOC stocks represents high project risk for government and industry in relation to SOC sequestration programs. In this paper, we seek to address the uncertainty in SOC stock prediction by assessing relationships between SOC stocks and grazing land condition indicators. We reviewed the literature to identify land condition indicators for analysis and tested relationships between identified land condition indicators and SOC stock using data from a paired-site sampling experiment (10 sites). We subsequently collated SOC stock datasets at two scales (quadrat and paddock) from across northern Australia (329 sites) to compare with the findings of the paired-site sampling experiment with the aim of identifying the land condition indicators that had the strongest relationship with SOC stock. The land condition indicators most closely correlated with SOC stocks across datasets and analysis scales were tree basal area, tree canopy cover, ground cover, pasture biomass and the density of perennial grass tussocks. In combination with soil type, these indicators accounted for up to 42% of the variation in the residuals after climate effects were removed. However, we found that responses often interacted with soil type, adding complexity and increasing the uncertainty associated with predicting SOC stock change at any particular location. We recommend that caution be exercised when considering SOC offset projects in northern Australian grazing lands due to the risk of incorrectly predicting changes in SOC stocks with change in land condition indicators and management activities for a particular paddock or property. Despite the uncertainty for generating SOC sequestration income, undertaking management activities to improve land condition is likely to have desirable complementary benefits such as improving productivity and profitability as well as reducing adverse environmental impact.

AB  - Vapor intrusion (VI) investigations often require sampling of indoor air for evaluating occupant risks, but can be confounded by temporal variability and the presence of indoor sources. Controlled pressure methods (CPM) have been proposed as an alternative, but temporal variability of CPM results and whether they are indicative of impacts under natural conditions have not been rigorously investigated. This study is the first involving a long-term CPM test at a house having a multiyear high temporal resolution indoor air data set under natural conditions. Key observations include (a) CPM results exhibited low temporal variability, (b) false-negative results were not obtained, (c) the indoor air concentrations were similar to the maximum concentrations under natural conditions, and (d) results exceeded long-term average concentrations and emission rates under natural conditions by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Thus, the CPM results were a reliable indicator of VI occurrence and worst-case exposure regardless of day or time of year of the CPM test.

AB  - Although First World War battles did not directly affect the territory of all participating states, the conflict brought suffering in the form of a decline in their inhabitants' economic situation. This was also true in the Czech Lands. Opportunities for studying the impact of the period's difficult living conditions on the human body are very limited. This study presents pilot research into the possible influence of the wartime environment on children's lives through the example of a 10-year-old boy (1907-1917) from a family of landowners. The circumstances of his death and burial, demonstrated in coffin adjustment, confirm that the war influenced conditions at the time. We therefore considered the possible osteological and nutritional manifestations of the stress of that time, such as difference between biological and chronological age, the presence of skeletal developmental anomalies, signs of nonspecific stress in the form of linear enamel hypoplasia and Harris lines, and diet, also in the family context. The results showed no significant difference between the boy's biological and chronological ages nor body height disorder. There were seven developmental anomalies on his skeleton, some also found in other family members, which supports documented family relationships. Co-occurrence of signs of nonspecific stress and isotopic shifts were also found, indicating the possible presence of nutritional stress before his wartime death.

AB  - The Passhatten Member (Anisian-Ladinian) is the most westward exposure of the Middle Triassic sedimentary sequence of Spitsbergen. The member has an average organic carbon of 2.21 wt %. The sediments were deposited in a shallow shelf environment under conditions of high biological productivity stimulated by a well-developed upwelling system and an enhanced nutrient supply from land areas. The high biological productivity caused a high supply of organic particles to the shelf bottom. Decomposition of organic matter initiated oxygen deficiency in the bottom waters; however, bottom water dynamics on the shallow shelf temporarily replenished the oxygen. Consequently, the Passhatten Mb section is bioturbated, even in thick black shale horizons and consists of alternately spaced lithological layers with variable organic carbon content. The organic matter is dominated by type II kerogen with a mixture of strongly altered marine and/or land derived organic matter. Calculated initial hydrogen index values suggest oil-prone organic matter similar to kerogen I and II types. The organic matter is in the upper intermediate stage of thermo-catalytic alteration, close to the cata- and metagenetic boundary. Maturity indicators including Rock-Eval, Maximum Temperature, Organic Matter Transformation Ratio, Residual Carbon content, as well as the volume of methane generated suggest mature to overmature organic matter. Methane potential retained in the black shales sequence is significant. Unexpelled gas is estimated at 395 mcf/ac-ft for the examined section.

AB  - 'River widenings' are commonly used in river restoration to allow channel movement within a spatially limited area. Restoration seeks to restore fluvial processes and to re-establish a more natural riparian community. This study investigates the performance of five river widenings in Switzerland, focusing on the re-establishment of riparian (semi-)terrestrial habitats and species, and highlights some factors that seem to influence their performance. The restoration projects are compared with pre-restoration conditions and near-natural conditions, which are assumed to represent the worst- and best-case conditions along a gradient of naturalness. Fuzzy ordination of vegetation data and calculation of landscape metrics based on habitat maps revealed marked differences between the degree of naturalness achieved by each individual restoration project. However, in C general river widenings were found to increase the in-stream habitat heterogeneity and enhanced the establishment of pioneer habitats and riparian plants. Analyses of species pools based on a hierarchic list of indicator species and correspondence analysis showed that the ability of river widenings to host typical riparian species and to increase local plant diversity strongly depends on the distance to near-natural stretches. Species dispersal and establishment might be hampered by decisions taken outside the scope of the restoration project. Therefore we conclude that action on the catchment scale is needed to maximize the benefits of local management. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Simple Summary Transport conditions can be a challenge for pigs being transported to market. In this study, 40 trips of commercial market pigs transported from the farms to an abattoir were monitored for thermal conditions including temperature and relative humidity in order to better understand thermal variability within the trailer during transport. Variation in thermal environment inside the pig transport trailer was used as an indicator of ventilation pattern during various weather conditions. During cold weather, the front top and bottom zones were warmer than in the rest of the trailer, indicating less ventilation toward the front of the trailer. Conditions were more uniform throughout the trailer for hot temperatures, indicating sufficient ventilation to limit temperature rise. Misting showed the potential to alleviate high temperatures, but resulted in higher THI conditions. No effect of boarding and bedding combination was observed for spatial distribution of trailer interior temperatures.
   Abstract Extreme weather conditions challenge pig thermoregulation during transport and are addressed by the National Pork Board (NPB) Transport Quality Assurance((R)) (TQA) program that provides guidelines for trailer boarding, bedding, and misting. These guidelines are widely applied, yet very little is known about the microenvironment within the trailer. In this study, TQA guidelines (V4) were evaluated via extensive thermal environment measurements during transport in order to evaluate spatial variability and implications on ventilation pattern. Effects of trailer management strategies including bedding, boarding, and misting were examined and the trailer was monitored for interior temperature rise and THI responses within six separate zones. The trailer thermal environment was not uniformly distributed in the colder trips with the top front and bottom zones were the warmest, indicating these zones had the majority of outlet openings and experienced air with accumulated sensible and latent heat of the pigs. Relatively enhanced thermal environment uniformity was observed during hot trips, suggesting that ventilation patterns and ventilation rate were different for colder vs. warmer weather conditions. Misting applied prior to transport cooled interior air temperature, but also created high THI conditions in some cases. Neither boarding and bedding combinations in the TQA nor boarding position showed impacts on trailer interior temperature rise or spatial distribution of temperature inside the trailer.

TI  - Association of State Policies Allowing Medical Cannabis for Opioid Use Disorder With Dispensary Marketing for This Indication
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
LA  - English
AB  - Importance Misinformation about cannabis and opioid use disorder (OUD) may increase morbidity and mortality if it leads individuals with OUD to forego evidence-based treatment. It has not been systematically evaluated whether officially designating OUD as a qualifying condition for medical cannabis is associated with cannabis dispensaries suggesting cannabis as a treatment for OUD. Objective To examine whether state-level policies designating OUD a qualifying condition for medical cannabis are associated with more dispensaries claiming cannabis can treat OUD. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional, mixed-methods study of 208 medical dispensary brands was conducted in 2019 using the brands' online content. The study included dispensaries operating in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, where OUD is a qualifying condition for medical cannabis, and in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, and West Virginia, where this policy does not exist. Exposures Presence of OUD on the list of qualifying conditions for a state's medical cannabis program. Main Outcomes and Measures Binary indicators of whether online content from the brand said cannabis can treat OUD, can replace US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for OUD, can be an adjunctive therapy to Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for OUD, or can be used as a substitute for opioids to treat other conditions (eg, chronic pain). Results After excluding duplicates, listings for nonexistent dispensaries, and those without online content, 167 brands across 7 states were included in the analysis (44 [26.3%] in states where OUD was a qualifying condition and 123 [73.7%] in adjacent states). A dispensary listed in a directory for West Virginia was not operational; therefore, comparison states were Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, and Ohio. In policy-exposed states, 39% (95% CI, 23%-55%) more dispensaries claimed cannabis could treat OUD compared with unexposed states (P < .001). For replacing medications for OUD and being an adjunctive therapy, the differences were 14% (95% CI, 2%-26%; P = .002) and 28% (95% CI, 14%-42%; P < .001), respectively. The suggestion that cannabis could substitute for opioids (eg, to treat chronic pain) was made by 25% (95% CI, 9%-41%) more brands in policy-exposed states than adjacent states (P = .002). Conclusions and Relevance In this study, state-level policies designating OUD as a qualifying condition for medical cannabis were associated with more dispensaries claiming cannabis can treat OUD. In the current policy environment, in which medical claims by cannabis dispensaries are largely unregulated, these advertisements could harm patients. Future research linking these policies to patient outcomes is warranted.
   This cross-sectional study examines whether state-level policies designating opioid use disorder (OUD) a qualifying condition for medical cannabis are associated with dispensaries claiming that cannabis can treat OUD.
   Question Is making opioid use disorder (OUD) a qualifying condition for medical cannabis associated with dispensaries promoting cannabis as a treatment for OUD? Findings In this cross-sectional study of the online content of 167 medical cannabis dispensaries, compared with dispensaries in states where OUD was not a qualifying condition for medical cannabis, 39% more dispensaries in states where this policy was enacted promoted cannabis to treat OUD and 14% more recommended replacing US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for OUD with cannabis. Meaning In this study, officially designating OUD a qualifying condition for medical cannabis was associated with cannabis dispensaries making unsupported medical claims regarding using cannabis to treat OUD.

AB  - This paper addresses a large-scale problem: the degradation of protective forest plantings on arid lands in southern Russia. The degradation is primarily caused by a drastic reduction in the scope of forest-maintenance works carried out by forestry authorities due to cutbacks in funding and changes in ownership rights to lands with field-sheltering forest belts. The deterioration of forest plantings includes their pollution by domestic and industrial waste; damage caused by fire, illegal felling, diseases, and pests; the development of sod-formation processes in soils; and the thinning and decay of the forest cover. Currently, the sanitary condition of more than half of such plantings is unsatisfactory; they have reached their maximum age and have begun to decay. Due to the scale of the problem, it is suggested that the tools of the concept of land degradation neutrality (LDN) be used to monitor ongoing changes in such forest plantings and the use of accumulated practical experience to supplement the set of global LDN indicators with a number of national parameters, including the following forest taxation (valuation) characteristics: timber deposit, forest-cover percentage, and gross growth (taking into account the mortality). An additional indicator is also suggested: the biological diversity level (i.e., species diversity of the tree and shrubbery vegetation in protective forest plantings). LDN assessment should take into consideration the location of forest plantings on state-owned and private lands with various management goals.

AB  - In this article we develop a concept for the assessment of state's susceptibility to drought based on a political science perspective. Different sources of capacities and sensitivities need to be taken into account to assess the overall susceptibility of states as political systems. We argue that the overall susceptibility of a society depends on an interplay of state capacity and readiness as main elements of political susceptibility, wealth and economic sensitivity as elements of economic susceptibility and the degree of social integration. To transform the conceptual model into a susceptibility assessment we developed an inference model in order to generate quantitative indices. For this purpose we apply fuzzy set theory using data from our case study regions, namely Andhra Pradesh (India), the Volga region (Russia) and (Southern) Portugal. The resulting computed trends for Portugal suggest that the society will be able to deal even with severe natural conditions due to existing political, economic, and social conditions. The assessment results for the Indian and Russian case study regions, in contrast, give reason for precaution since the occurrence of drought-induced crisis events seems much more likely in the light of more crucial, overall conditions, namely lower degrees of state capacity and readiness as well as, in the case of India, a high economic susceptibility. However, further improvements are possible given the improved availability of data and the integration of more qualitative information. Additionally, the expansion to further case study regions could help validate the overall concept.

AB  - The partitioning of the widely used gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) between liquid growth media and gaseous phase was measured daily under laboratory conditions to determine how closely dissolved MTBE concen trations matched nominal concentrations. Total (gaseous and dissolved) MTBE averaged across 6 days for 29.6, 503.2, and 1005.7 mg L-1 MTBE treatments were 89,9, 90.3, and 73.0% of nominal, respectively, and mean dissolved MTBE in these same treatments were 74,6, 73.8, and 69.6% of total MTBE, respectively. This suggests that dissolved MTBE concentrations can vary substantially from nominal. The effect of MTBE on the growth of selected algae was also evaluated under laboratory conditions. Three unicellular algae, Selenastrum capricornutum (Chlorophyta), Navicula pelliculosa (Bacillariophyta), and Synechococcus leopoliensis (= Anacystic nidulans, Cyanophyta = Cyanobacteria), representative of three taxonomic groups, were used as test organisms. Toxicity tests were acute and increase in cell number was used as an indicator of growth. Algal species were exposed by injection of MTBE into sealed vessels containing defined liquid growth media. The growth of N. pelliculosa and S. leopoliensis was negatively affected at nominal 2400 mg L-1 MTBE, whereas the growth of S. capricornutum was negatively affected at nominal 4800 mg L-1 MTBE and positively affected at nominal 600 mg L-1 MTBE. The differential sensitivity of the growth Of these representative species suggests that MTBE may alter algal community composition in the natural environment.

AB  - Soil microbial activities in a reed-bed used for effluent purification of a small cheese-dairy farm under a Mediterranean climate were described and studied. This work aims to demonstrate (i) whether certain enzyme activities used as bioindicators of dairy waste degradation (P-galactosidase and protease) vary over time, which might influence organic matter degradation and (ii) whether specific microbial communities are selected through contact with the discarded effluent using community level catabolic profiles (CLCPs). P-galactosidase and protease activities were followed in a 14-month monitoring experiment. These enzyme activities were strongly expressed during the whey-discarding period from February to May. CLCPs using Biolog Ecoplate showed great microbial diversity, as described by Shannon-Weaver index, and no difference was observed in microbial diversity between areas at the receiving end of the reed-bed (where effluent was discarded) and those at the opposite end. This may be explained by successive environmental factors which made enzyme activities vary: whey discarded from February to May and Mediterranean climate conditions (drying-rewetting effects on summer). Microbial enumeration using epifluorescence microscopy also showed a pattern linked to Mediterranean conditions with a drastic decrease in biomass during summer drought. These results on functional biodiversity were correlated with high purification yields: the minimum decrease in Biological Demand in Oxygen was 84% and that in suspended solids was 75%.

AB  - Some evidence exists that cow body condition score (BCS) is associated with risks to animal health, and that higher BCS in extensively kept animals provides a buffer against cold conditions or other adverse weather events. Not surprisingly, measures of BCS feature in dairy cattle welfare assessment protocols. However, the degree to which BCS predicts welfare state, particularly in relation to the level of "hunger" experienced, is not well researched. The aim of this study was to examine associations between naturally arising variations in BCS in dairy cattle and time spent engaged in activities used as proxy indicators of hunger. Holstein-Friesian cows (n = 113) of either North American or New Zealand ancestry were allocated to 1 of 3 levels of concentrate-feed supplementation (0, 3, or 6 kg of dry matter/d) and also offered pasture in excess of requirements. Body condition score (1 to 10 scale), pasture dry matter intake (DMI), and time budgets for grazing, ruminating, standing, and lying were recorded during early, mid, and late lactation. Body condition score varied over a wide range (2.5 to 8.5) and, within genetic strain and supplementation level, was inversely associated with pasture DMI, rate of DMI, and the proportions of time spent grazing and ruminating. In comparison, variation in BCS (within genetic strain and supplementation level) was directly associated with variations in time spent lying (in late lactation). Nevertheless, pasture DMI and time spent in the key behavioral activities were all within the normal expected limits for pasture-fed dairy cows. Thus, thin cows appeared able to achieve their nutritional requirements. Furthermore, even though thinner cows traded-off a small portion of their lying time in late lactation to forage longer, they still rested for normal periods each day. Based on these results, we found no difference in the welfare status of naturally thin and fat cows when they were offered generous pasture allowances with or without concentrate supplementation. The extent to which this pertains under conditions of persistently low feed allowances that result in reductions in BCS remains to be determined.

AB  - The distributions of certain minor and trace elements in marine sediments should potentially provide forensic tools for determining the redox conditions of the bottom waters at the time of deposition. The ability to identify such conditions in the geological past is important because (1) current models of the conditions of formation of organic-rich rocks require re-examination, (2) a method to determine whether the areal extent of anoxic waters expanded or retracted in response to palaeoceanographic changes is required, and (3) the effects of such environmental changes on the geochemical balance of these elements in the ocean need to be understood.
   Recent research has suggested that some minor and trace elements are precipitated where free dissolved sulphide is present (Cu, Cd, Ni, Zn) without undergoing a valency change, whereas others undergo a change in valency and are either more efficiently adsorbed onto solid surfaces under oxic (1) or anoxic (V) conditions or are precipitated under anoxic conditions (Cr, Mn, Mo, Re, U, V). Hence, the enrichment of these minor and trace elements relative to their crustal abundances indicates that the host sediments accumulated under anoxic conditions, although not necessarily under anoxic bottom waters. Examination of the chemical composition of the sediments of anoxic basins, continental margin sediments and oxidized deep-sea sediments shows that I and Mn enrichments are reliable indicators of bottom water oxygenation, whereas enrichments of the remaining elements reflect either bottom water anoxia or element uptake by subsurface anoxic sediments below a relatively thin surficial oxic veneer. Hence, the absence of metal enrichment in these cases can be taken as firm evidence that the bottom waters of a basin of sedimentation were not anoxic. These behaviours may be used to propose, for example, that the Holocene sapropel in the Black Sea accumulated under oxic bottom waters, whereas the modern facies reflects its formation under the prevailing intensely anoxic conditions, and that the Panama Basin bottom waters were not anoxic during the Last Glacial Maximum when the rate of accumulation of organic carbon increased. Likewise, the enrichment of Mn as a mixed carbonate phase in some ancient black shales strongly suggests that they formed under oxic bottom waters rather than anoxic conditions as is commonly assumed.

AB  - Spatially explicit assessments of ecosystem services (ES) potentials are a key component in supporting a sustainable land use management. The ES matrix method is a commonly used approach as it allows for a comparably fast, comprehensible and accessible ES assessment. As it is often based on land use/land cover data (LULC) with no spatial variability, a main critique is that the results fail to assess spatial variability at landscape levels, which limits the reliability of the outputs for spatial planning applications. By using the case study area of Bornhoved in northern Germany, we analyzed three assessment methods that combine expert judgments, LULC data with different resolutions and ecosystem condition indicators, in order to find the required resolution and data for ES assessment and mapping at a local scale. To quantify map discrepancies, we used the structural similarity index (SSIM) and analyzed the differences in local mean, variance and covariance between the maps. We found that using different spatial resolutions led to a relatively small difference in the outcomes, in which regulation and maintenance services are more affected than the other services categories. For most regulation, maintenance and cultural ES, our results indicate that assessments based only on LULC proxies are not suitable for a local quantitative assessment of ES, as they cannot sufficiently cover the spatial heterogeneity of ES capacities that arise from different ecosystem conditions.

AB  - Predictive maintenance allows industries to keep their production systems available as much as possible. Reducing unforeseen shutdowns to a level that is close to zero has numerous advantages, including production cost savings, a high quality level of both products and processes, and a high safety level. Studies in this field have focused on a novel approach, prognostic health management (PHM), which relies on condition monitoring (CM) for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of a system. However, several issues remain in its application to real industrial contexts, e.g., the difficulties in conducting tests simulating each fault condition, the dynamic nature of industrial environments, and the need to handle large amounts of data collected from machinery. In this paper, a data-driven methodology for PHM implementation is proposed, which has the following characteristics: it is unsupervised, i.e., it does not require any prior knowledge regarding fault behaviors and it does not rely on pre-trained classification models, i.e., it can be applied "from scratch"; it can be applied online due to its low computational effort, which makes it suitable for edge computing; and, it includes all of the steps that are involved in a prognostic program, i.e., feature extraction, health indicator (HI) construction, health stage (HS) division, degradation modelling, and RUL prediction. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied in this study to a rotating component. The study results, in terms of the ability of the proposed approach to make a timely prediction of component fault conditions, are promising.

AB  - The relationships between liver metal (Cu, Zn and Ni) concentration and physical condition of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were compared in fish sampled in five northeastern Ontario Lakes in the spring and seven lakes in the fall of 1997. These lakes represented a wide range of metal contamination, pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and alkalinity. Lakes situated closest to emission point source had lower pH. alkalinity and DOC and higher aqueous metal concentrations than other lakes in this study. Fish from these lakes displayed higher liver metal concentrations. Seasonal variations in liver metal concentrations were observed in the most metal-contaminated lakes, with higher Cu levels in the spring and higher Zn and Ni concentrations in the fall. These fish had lower indicators of physical condition than fish from cleaner lakes. In particular, more metal-contaminated fish were smaller for a similar age, indicating slower growth rate, and had lower relative condition factor and scaling coefficients. The scaling coefficient is a descriptor of the growth pattern of fish, and higher values indicate increased weight gain per unit of growth in length. Negative (P < 0.05) relationships are reported between lake alkalinity and liver Cu concentration (in both seasons) and Zn concentration (in spring only). In both seasons mean liver Cu content was negatively associated (P < 0.05) with the scaling coefficient of the fish samples. With these data, we propose the use of the scaling coefficient as a simple biomonitoring tool to detect metal effects on the physical condition of yellow perch. Data presented here provide information on seasonal variations in liver metal concentration and condition of yellow perch that should be considered in the design of field studies investigating physiological effects of metals in wild fish. This work also describes a gradient of lake and fish metal contamination that is related to the physical condition of yellow perch. This system provides a unique research opportunity to further our limited knowledge of the effects of metals on the physiology of wild fish. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful technique to quantify gene expression. To facilitate gene expression study and obtain accurate results, normalization relative to stably expressed reference genes is crucial. The monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (L.), is one of the most recognized insect species for its spectacular annual migration across North America. Besides its great voyages, D. plexippus has drawn attention to its role as a bio-indicator, ranging from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to natural ecosystems. In this study, nine reference genes from D. plexippus genome were selected as the candidate reference genes. The expression profiles of these candidates under various biotic and abiotic conditions were evaluated using the four readily available computational programs, BestKeeper, Normfinder, geNorm, and.Ct method, respectively. Moreover, RefFinder, a web-based computational platform integrating the four above mentioned algorisms, provided a comprehensive ranking of the stability of these reference genes. As a result, a suite of reference genes were recommended for each experimental condition. Specifically, elongation factor 1 alpha(EF1A) and ribosomal protein 49 (RP49) were the most stable reference genes, respectively, under biotic (development, tissue, and sex) and abiotic (photoperiod, temperature, and dietary RNAi) conditions. With the recent release of a 273-million base pair draft genome, results from this study allow us to establish a standardized RT-qPCR analysis and lay a foundation for the subsequent genomic and functional genomic research in D. plexippus, a major bio-indicator and an emerging model for migratory animals.

AB  - Foraminiferal assemblages has been studied in three regions of the Mekong Delta subjected to different environmental characteristics: the Tra Vinh province, in the middle part of the Delta, under high freshwater influence; the Ca Mau peninsula, to the south, under maximum marine influence; and the Can Gio region, in the northern part of the Delta, with intermediate conditions. Intensive Rice-Shrimp Farming System is developing in these regions. Foraminiferal assemblages show the prevalence of the Mekong's water pressure. Marine influence is strong only at a few stations along the shoreline, mainly in the Can Gio region. The rarity of allochthonous coastal species, in all the samples except one, suggests that up-river transport and settlement of foraminifera and sediment is significant only in the major channels. On a local level, foraminiferal assemblages provide a variety of information on environmental conditions. In a tidal channel of the Tra Vinh province, they suggest that lower reaches are more impacted by pollution than upper reaches; in the Ca Mau peninsula, under marine influence, low density and dominance of agglutinated species indicate the impact of deforestation and extension of acid sulfate soils; in shrimp pools, foraminifera may be used as indicators of the degradation of local conditions, in relation with accumulation of organic matter. The distribution of foraminiferal assemblages described in this study should be used as part of a reference point for further observations with a view to assessing environmental impacts of increasing human activities and/or climatic change.

AB  - Differences in oceanographic conditions over short distances can dramatically affect the distribution of marine organisms over small spatial scales. In southern California, oceanographic conditions vary widely from east to west as the offshore region is impacted by cool, southern flowing California Current water, while the inshore is typically warmer and more productive. We investigated how patterns of distribution and abundance of larval, genetically identified rockfishes related to environmental conditions off southern California, the world's center of rockfish Sebastes spp. species diversity. The rockfish assemblage was dominated by small and short-lived species not typically targeted by recreational or commercial fishing (i.e. shortbelly S. jordani and squarespot S. hopkinsi rockfishes), but also contained moderate abundances of a few larger, targeted species (bank S. rufus and bocaccio S. paucispinis rockfishes). Spawning locations of many species were affected by environmental variability, as abundances of young (0 to 2 d old), targeted larvae were mainly found offshore in the cool, low primary production waters that also were relatively shallow and contained hard substrate. In contrast, untargeted species were more widespread and correlated positively only with hard substrate. Hotspots of species richness and targeted species were high within a large managed region, the Cowcod Conservation Area, indicating that it is effectively protecting important rockfish spawning habitat. This research highlights the need to account for environmental variation in habitat and assemblage structure when conducting marine spatial planning.

KW  - sociology
AB  - Purpose - To provide a coherent theoretical framework for interdisciplinary research on happiness, integrating the psychological, physiological/biological, and social/cultural levels, permitting integration of disparate approaches within and across disciplines.
   Design/methodology/approach - Principles and findings of cybernetics are combined to shed light on difficulties encountered by research on happiness. Using a problem-oriented approach, the reference system is defined as a psychological information-processing and decision-making system. This is an actor system in the social world needing orientation to act. Bossel's systems theory of orientation is applied to emotionality as a subsystem of the psychological system. Happiness, in terms of orientation theory, can be conceived as a meta-orientor indicating wholeness, health, and the functioning of the overall-system.
   Findings - Emotionality and rationality are complementary decision-making systems. Conditions are identified for developing the capability for emotional orientation and happiness in individuals. These conditions are strongly dependent on the social/cultural environment. Among them are the need for diversity in real-life experience and for psychological acceptance of both oneself and the (sociocultural) environment. They can permit (relative) stability of happiness defined as an emotional state.
   Practical implications - Further research can produce methods to improve happiness both by coaching individuals and by developing social conditions more conducive to happiness, e.g. in education. Happiness is a subjective indicator for physical, psychological, and social wellbeing taken together, which is the definition of health of WHO.
   Originality/value - This sociocybernetic approach, combining systems concepts with orientation theory, can serve as an integrative theoretical framework for so far separate theoretical approaches.

AB  - The disposal of municipal solid wastes in landfills represents a major threat for aquifer environments at the global scale. The aim of this study was to explore how groundwater geochemical characteristics can influence the microbial community functioning and the potential degradation patterns of selected organic substrates in response to different levels of landfill-induced alterations. Groundwaters collected from a landfill area were monitored by assessing major physical-chemical parameters and the microbiological contamination levels (total coliforms and fecal indicators-Colilert-18). The aquatic microbial community was further characterized by flow cytometry and Biolog EcoPlates(TM) assay. Three groundwater conditions (i.e., pristine, mixed, and altered) were identified according to their distinct geochemical profiles. The altered groundwaters showed relatively higher values of organic matter concentration and total cell counts, along with the presence of fecal indicator bacteria, in comparison to samples from pristine and mixed conditions. The kinetic profiles of the Biolog substrate degradation showed that the microbial community thriving in altered conditions was relatively more efficient in metabolizing a larger number of organic substrates, including those with complex molecular structures. We concluded that the assessment of physiological profiling and functional diversity at the microbial community level could represent a supportive tool to understand the potential consequences of the organic contamination of impacted aquifers, thus complementing the current strategies for groundwater management.

AB  - Uranium speciation and retention mechanisms onto Savannah River Site (SRS) wetland sediments was studied using batch (ad)sorption experiments, sequential extraction, U La-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, fluorescence mapping and mu-XANES. Under oxidized conditions, U was highly retained by the SRS wetland sediments. In contrast to other similar but much lower natural organic matter (NOM) sediments, significant sorption of U onto the SRS sediments was observed at pH < 4 and pH > 8. Sequential extraction indicated that the U species were primarily associated with the acid soluble fraction (weak acetic acid extractable) and organic fraction (Na-pyrophosphate extractable). Uranium L-3-edge XANES spectra of the U-bound sediments were nearly identical to that of uranyl acetate. Based on fluorescence mapping, U and Fe distributions in the sediment were poorly correlated, U was distributed throughout the sample and did not appear as isolated U mineral phases. The primary oxidation state of U in these oxidized sediments was U(VI), and there was little evidence that the high sorptive capacity of the sediments could be ascribed to abiotic or biotic reduction to the less soluble U(IV) species or to secondary mineral formation. Collectively, this study suggests that U may be strongly bound to wetland sediments, not only under reducing conditions by reductive precipitation, but also under oxidizing conditions through NOM-uranium bonding.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a severe and complex psychiatric disorder with heterogeneous and dynamic multi-dimensional symptoms. Behavioral rhythms, such as sleep rhythm, are usually disrupted in people with schizophrenia. As such, behavioral rhythm sensing with smartphones and machine learning can help better understand and predict their symptoms. Our goal is to predict fine-grained symptom changes with interpretable models. We computed rhythm-based features from 61 participants with 6,132 days of data and used multi-task learning to predict their ecological momentary assessment scores for 10 different symptom items. By taking into account both the similarities and differences between different participants and symptoms, our multi-task learning models perform statistically significantly better than the models trained with single-task learning for predicting patients' individual symptom trajectories, such as feeling depressed, social, and calm and hearing voices. We also found different subtypes for each of the symptoms by applying unsupervised clustering to the feature weights in the models. Taken together, compared to the features used in the previous studies, our rhythm features not only improved models' prediction accuracy but also provided better interpretability for how patients' behavioral rhythms and the rhythms of their environments influence their symptom conditions. This will enable both the patients and clinicians to monitor how these factors affect a patient's condition and how to mitigate the influence of these factors. As such, we envision that our solution allows early detection and early intervention before a patient's condition starts deteriorating without requiring extra effort from patients and clinicians.

AB  - A warm anomaly in the upper ocean, colloquially named the Blob, appeared in the Gulf of Alaska during the calm winter of 2013-2014, spread across the northern North Pacific (NP) Ocean, and shifted eastward and onto the Oregon shelf. At least 14 species of copepods occurred which had never been observed in shelf/slope waters off Oregon, some of which are known to have NP Gyre affinities, indicating that the source waters of the coastal Blob were likely of both offshore (from the west) and subtropical/tropical origin. The anomalously warm conditions were reduced during strong upwelling in spring 2015 but returned when upwelling weakened in July 2015 and transitioned to downwelling in fall 2015. The extended period of warm conditions resulted in prolonged effects on the ecosystem off central Oregon, lasting at least through 2016. Impacts to the lower trophic levels were unprecedented and include a novel plankton community composition resulting from increased copepod, diatom, and dinoflagellate species richness and increased abundance of dinoflagellates. Additionally, the multiyear warm anomalies were associated with reduced biomass of copepods and euphausiids, high abundance of larvaceans and doliolids (indictors of oligotrophic ocean conditions), and a toxic diatom bloom (Pseudo-nitzschia) throughout the California Current in 2015, thereby changing the composition of the food web that is relied upon by many commercially and ecologically important species.

AB  - The interactions of Botrytis cinerea and seven biological control agents (BCAs) were examined in controlled environments to determine the influence of selected relative humidities (RH) (90,95, and 100%) and air temperatures (20, 24 and 28 degrees C) on grey mold of bean. All main effects and interactions were significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) among the 72 treatments. In the control, lesions of grey mold developed under all environmental conditions but were largest at 24 degrees C x 95 and 100% RH, and 28 degrees C x 95% RH. Interactions of environment, BCAs and grey mold were complex. Alternaria alternata, Drechslera sp., Myrothecium verrucaria, Trichoderma viride, Gliocladium roseum and an unidentified pink yeast were all highly dependent on environment for biological control efficacy, and changes of 4 degrees C or 5% RH were associated with variability in disease suppression that ranged from less than or equal to 15 to 100%. Efficacy of Epicoccum purpurascens appeared independent of environment and this BCA suppressed disease by 100% in all of the environmental treatments. Suppression of grey mold by many of the BCAs was most effective under environmental conditions least conducive to disease. Therefore, evaluations of potential BCAs in environmental conditions that are marginal for disease can overestimate their efficacy in field environments. Assessments of biological control efficacy in various environments can be used to more accurately assess the potential of BCAs.

AB  - The article compares the exhaust emissions in road conditions of city buses: LNG and Diesel. Both buses met the Euro VI exhaust emission norm. The current strong drive to diversify fuels in Poland and the creation of a large gas port in Swinoujscie for LNG imports creates an excellent opportunity to use this fuel, also in road transport. Therefore, the attempt to identify the emission in operation, in first place possible applications, i.e. an LNG bus, comparatively with the emission of a Diesel bus. The operational research carried out concerned such a bus and has not yet been carried out in the country, hence their innovation, also methodological. The conducted research, in particular, was aimed at verifying differences in exhaust emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The study was carried out on one urban bus route performing trips on consecutive days in similar environmental conditions. The performed tests were not strictly type approval tests but only used for comparative purposes. Hence, it was necessary to determine the compliance factor for the relevant exhaust gas substances, with the use of an evaluation algorithm based on measurement windows. Based on these results, the assumption regarding compliance with the emission requirements for the tested buses was verified in real traffic conditions. The exhaust emission values (emission indicators) determined in this way did not exceed the permissible emission limit values for carbon monoxide, while for nitrogen oxides and non-methane hydrocarbons certain exceedances were found.

AB  - Dielectric response analysis, performed in time domain and frequency domain is one of the interesting methods used for condition assessment of high voltage equipment. In this article, the degradation of epoxy-mica composite insulation which is widely used in rotating machines has been investigated through frequency domain spectroscopy measurements. Artificial ageing of the carefully prepared stator bar insulation sample was performed through simultaneous application of high temperature and electric field in a designated environmental chamber for specific durations. To study the effect of temperature, the measurements were performed at temperatures ranging from 20 to 60 degrees C at different ageing status. Following experimental work, the measurement results were modelled using Havriliak-Negami model and ageing sensitive parameters were extracted. To study the effect of temperature, the measurements were performed at temperatures ranging from 20 to 60 degrees C. The modelled results matched well with the experimental measurements and certain model parameters sensitive to the ageing condition were identified. The numerical relationships between the insulation status of the stator bar and the aforementioned parameters were identified. It was observed that the nature of the numerical relationship remains identical in the investigated temperature range, although the coefficients vary to some extent.

AB  - The management of assemblages of species across many taxa is a common concern in conservation. Consequently, the use of one or a few surrogate or indicator species to represent an entire assemblage has become an increasingly important tool in conservation science. However, conservation schemes based on the needs of one or two focal species often fail to account for individualistic responses of larger assemblages of species. Data from bird point counts along with vegetation characteristics from a coastal tropical dry forest in Kenya that is subject to elephant disturbance were used to explore the differential responses of bird species to environmental conditions in a forest reserve where wildlife management includes both endangered birds and mammals. Results revealed that even birds with similar foraging habits had idiosyncratic responses to both environmental traits and elephant disturbance. While overall species responded to important characteristics such as percent canopy cover and leaf litter depth, individualistic responses of different species trait diversity defied easy characterization of optimal forest management schemes. Taken together, our analyses highlight the difficulty in basing the development of management plans for entire assemblages of species on the response of a single or a few species. Implications for wildlife conservation in Arabuko-Sokoke Forest and similar forest reserves are discussed, emphasizing the need for a better understanding of individual species' responses to forest conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary: In this placebo controlled study, we exposed 28 dogs to Pet Remedy (a natural stress relief product) to investigate whether Pet Remedy lowered stress-affected behaviour. No statistically significant differences were found when dogs were exposed to Pet Remedy or the placebo condition. We suggest that Pet Remedy, in this particular study, did not have a discernible effect on changes in behaviour. Further research determining the effects of Pet Remedy would be beneficial.
   Abstract: Stress-affected behaviour in companion animals can have an adverse effect on animal health and welfare and their relationships with humans. This stress can be addressed using chemical treatments, often in conjunction with behavioural therapies. Here, we investigated the efficacy of one commercial pharmacological intervention, Pet Remedy, advertised as a natural stress relief product for mammals. We aimed to see whether the product lowered stress-affected behaviour in dogs placed in a non-familiar environment. Behavioural responses of 28 dogs were video recorded using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and counterbalanced repeated measures design. Dogs were exposed to both a placebo and Pet Remedy plug-in diffuser for 30 min with an intervening period of approximately 7 days between conditions. Multivariate regression analysis identified no significant differences in behaviour in either the Pet Remedy or placebo condition. In conclusion, in the current study, Pet Remedy did not reduce behavioural indicators indicative of a stress response. To determine the effects of Pet Remedy, future research using a larger sample size and controlling for breed would be beneficial.

AB  - A 17.81 m sediment core from Lake Naleng, a freshwater lake in the south-eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau was examined for its non-pollen palynomorph (NPP) composition. The frequencies of 15 NPPs and three aquatic pollen types were determined in 160 samples. Since the origin of several NPP types is still unknown, multivariate analysis, supported by findings from the corresponding fossil pollen flora, was carried out to extract information about their ecological environments. The analysis allowed a classification of all microfossils in four groups of environmental response, which provided an approach to tracing lake history and palaeoclimatic changes in the area since the Late Glacial (since 17,700 cal years b.p.). Unstable lake conditions and a low organic productivity were reconstructed for the Late Glacial before 14,600 cal years b.p. with high inputs of terrestrial material. Climate conditions became wetter during the Bolling/Allerod interval indicated by high productivity in the lake. After a short climate deterioration (12,500-11,500 cal years b.p.), stable lake conditions were inferred from the record. During the late Holocene (since 2,700 cal years b.p.) changes in the NPP composition might be related to human impact, the latter being inferred from the pollen data through the presence of grazing indicators.

AB  - Seabirds are often proposed as useful indicators of marine ecosystems because of their typically tight response to varying levels of prey abundance. We demonstrate here how this relationship can be modified for Southern Ocean higher-order predators when prey accessibility changes as a consequence of the temporally varying sea-ice environment. We examined within- and between-year fluctuations in breeding success, foraging trip duration, meal mass and fledgling weights of Ad,lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) at B,chervaise Island (67A degrees 35'S, 62A degrees 49'E) in east Antarctica to determine the degree of concordance between parameters over a 12-year period and how these varied in relation to sea-ice conditions. The penguins responded to extensive sea-ice (predominantly fast-ice) adjacent to their breeding colony by lengthening their foraging trips, and these years typically had reduced breeding success. Some years indicated good conditions for the penguins across parameters and had relatively high breeding success with heavier fledglings, while others indicated difficult conditions with poorer breeding success and lighter fledglings. In other years, there was discordance in the patterns of breeding success, fledgling mass and early versus late stage foraging trip durations, suggestive of different thresholds for different parameters or within-year changes in resource availability. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the temporal variability in prey availability as a function of both accessibility and abundance when interpreting predator response curves.

AB  - Bioremediation efforts worldwide are faced with the problem of metals interfering with the degradation of organic pollutants. There has been little systematic investigation into how the important environmental factors of media composition, buffering agent, and carbon source affect the exertion of metal toxicity on bacteria. This study aimed to systematically separate and investigate the influence of these factors by examining planktonic and biofilm establishment and growth. Two Pseudomonads were chosen, the PCB degrader P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707 and P. fluorescens. The two strains were grown in the presence of Al3+ and Cu2+ under different media conditions of carbon source (Lysogeny broth, biphenyl, succinate, aspartic acid, butyric acid, oxaloacetic acid, putrescine and benzoic acid) and under different buffering conditions (high and low phosphate or MOPS). These experiments allowed for the elucidation of an effect of different metabolic conditions and metal speciation on planktonic bacteria growth and biofilm establishment and development under metal stress. Here we show that the nature of bacterial growth (planktonic and biofilm development) is dramatically affected by the interplay between toxic metals, carbon source and media composition. The capacity of a media to bind toxic metals as well as quality of carbon source greatly influences the amount of metal that bacteria can tolerate, depending on both the bacterium and metal. Future studies evaluating metal ion toxicity should consider these effects, as well as their interactions with specific environments into account in order to improve clean-up success.

AB  - Microbial communities associated with plants represent key determinants of plant health, survival, and growth. However, a good understanding of the structural composition of the bacterial and fungal microbiome present in different plant tissues and growing environments, especially in transgenic woody plants, is required. In the present study, we hypothesized that environmental conditions, ecological niches, and transgenic events could influence the community structure of plant-associated microorganisms (bacterial and fungal endophytes). We sampled the root and stem endospheres of field-grown transgenic and non-transgenic poplar trees (Populus alba x P. berolinensis) and applied 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer amplicon Illumina MiSeq sequencing to determine the bacterial and fungal communities associated with the different plant habitats and tissues. We found that actinobacteria, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, and firmicutes were the dominant endophytic bacteria, and the fungal community was dominated by dothideomycetes, agaricomycetes, leotiomycetes, and sordariomycetes. In conclusion, transgenic events did not affect the endophytic bacterial and fungal diversity of poplar trees. The bacterial and fungal community structure depends on the pH and the soil organic matter content. Each plant tissue represents a unique ecological niche for the microbial communities. Finally, we identified the indicator operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and core microbiome associated with the different plant tissues of Populus and different environmental conditions. The results provide a basis for further study of host-microbial interactions with the identified abundant OTUs of Populus.

AB  - Environmental problems caused by extraction of minerals have long been a focus on environmental earth sciences. Vegetation growing conditions are an indirect indicator of the environmental problem in mining areas. A growing number of studies in recent years made substantial efforts to better utilize remote sensing for dynamic monitoring of vegetation growth conditions and the environment in mining areas. In this article, airborne and satellite hypersectral remote sensing data-HyMap and Hyperion images are used in the Mount Lyell mining area in Australia and Dexing copper mining area in China, respectively. Based on the analyses of biogeochemical effect of dominant minerals, the vegetation spectrum and vegetation indices, two hyperspectral indices: vegetation inferiority index (VII) and water absorption disrelated index (WDI) are employed to monitor the environment in the mining area. Experimental results indicate that VII can effectively distinguish the stressed and unstressed vegetation growth situation in mining areas. The sensitivity of VII to the vegetation growth condition is shown to be superior to the traditional vegetation index-NDVI. The other index, WDI, is capable of informing whether the target vegetation is affected by a certain mineral. It is an important index that can effectively distinguish the hematite areas that are covered with sparse vegetation. The successful applications of VII and WDI show that hyperspectral remote sensing provides a good method to effectively monitor and evaluate the vegetation and its ecological environment in mining areas.

AB  - Simple Summary Working donkeys suffer from many welfare challenges associated with, for example, physical health, poor living conditions, and unfair treatment. The aim of this study is to assess the welfare of working donkeys in the El-Saf brick kilns, identifying the health risk factors, establishing welfare regulations, enacting legislation, and implementing welfare strategies aimed at improving the quality of life of donkeys and owners within communities. The study found that working donkeys in Egypt suffer from many types of wounds associated with parts of the harness, such as the saddle, breeching, and neck collar, and with excessive force/beating, the shaft of the cart, and improper tethering. They often live in unhealthy housing situations, and a high percentage suffer from aggressive behavior. The study found an association between these health risks, behavioral parameters, and body condition in Egyptian working donkeys. Body condition was affected by multiple factors, including the number of hours worked/day, the number of donkeys/kilns, the distance from loading to unloading bricks in an oven, and the amount of concentrated food/donkey. Donkeys are a cornerstone in human existence, having played an important role throughout history in different economic activities, such as working in brick kilns in Egypt. This study was conducted from January 2017 to the end of April 2017 in the El-Saf brick kilns, which are located to the south of the Giza Governorate and 57 Km away from Cairo. Physical clinical health and behavior data were collected from 179 donkeys spanning over a random sample of 20 brick kilns selected from the El-Saf brick kilns. Behavioral, physical health, harness, and environmental parameters were assessed and recorded. The study found that 80 +/- 3% (n = 179) of kiln donkeys have some type of wound, and the most serious wound is a beating wound (49 +/- 3.7%), which is caused by drivers hitting the donkeys. The drivers are mostly children, who have insufficient knowledge, skills, and attitudes to effectively communicate with their donkeys and no motivation to enhance the welfare of these equids. Other wounds are related to the harness, such as the breeching (10 +/- 2.2%), saddle (43 +/- 3.7%), neck collar (40 +/- 3.6%), and shaft of the cart (12 +/- 2.4%). A poor body condition was seen in 56 +/- 3.7% of kiln donkeys. A correlation in terms of the prevalence of wounds was found between the body condition (p-value < 0.01) and/or cleanliness of the harness. There was a negative association between the body condition and wound prevalence in brick kilns (Pearson coefficient of correlation -0.71). The physical enviromental factors that affect the body condition of working donkeys are the working hours of donkeys/day, the number of donkeys in a kiln, the distance from loading to the oven, and the concentrated food/donkey (p-value < 0.01). These three variables can explain 78.85% of the variability in body conditions based on a 1-5 scale. In addition to health parameters, behavior parameters, such as the donkeys' general attitude, reaction to observers, and chin contact are associated with the body condition (p-value < 0.01). As a consequence, it is important for the owners of working donkeys to pay attention to their body condition in order to avoid compromising their body condition and welfare.

AB  - Fluvial levees are assets of major importance for protecting human lives and activities. To prevent the risk of failures and to assess their stability, survey campaigns involving geophysical and geotechnical methods are needed. These two types of methods play highly complementary roles and provide information of different natures, uncertainties and spatial distributions. In this work, we first present the function of fluvial levees and describe the associated physical properties that may become pathological and lead to failure mechanisms. Then for each presented investigation method, we introduce : its basic principles, its ability to characterize specific physical properties (or characteristics) of fluvial levees, and then its advantages and drawbacks under specific environmental conditions. It should be emphasized that geophysical and geotechnical methods are placed on an equal footing in order to assist agencies and levee managers in selecting the most relevant ones to assess the condition of their levees and characterize potential weak zones, according to a specific type of pathology and to the environmental constraints. Throughout this review, we introduce a certain amount of literature that is believed to be of potential interest to the research community as well. We also draw attention to some lack of information on the application of specific methods to levee investigation. Finally, we discuss some complementarities of the presented methods and we propose a dedicated comparative table, leading us to suggest new method combinations for levee investigation.

AB  - The lead scavenger 1,2-dibromoethane (EDB), a former additive to leaded gasoline, is a common groundwater contaminant, yet not much knowledge is available for its targeted bioremediation, especially under in situ conditions. The study site was an aviation gas spill site, which, although all hydrocarbons and most of the EDB were remediated in the mid-1990s, still exhibits low levels of EDB remaining in the groundwater (about 11 mu g EDB/l). To evaluate the effect of phenol on biostimulation of low concentration of EDB, microcosms were established from an EDB-contaminated aquifer. After 300 days at environmentally relevant conditions (12 +/- 2 A degrees C, static incubation), EDB was not significantly removed from unamended microcosms compared to the abiotic control. However, in treatments amended with phenol, up to 80 % of the initial EDB concentration had been degraded, while added phenol was removed completely. Microbial community composition in unamended and phenol-amended microcosms remained unchanged, and Polaromonas sp. dominated both types of microcosms, but total bacterial abundance and numbers of the gene for phenol hydroxylase were higher in phenol-amended microcosms. Dehalogenase, an indicator suggesting targeted aerobic biodegradation of EDB, was not detected in either treatment. This finding suggests phenol hydroxylase, rather than a dehalogenation reaction, may be responsible for 1,2-dibromoethane oxidation under in situ conditions. In addition, biostimulation of EDB is possible through the addition of low levels of phenol in aerobic groundwater sites.

AB  - In recent years, increasing scientific attention has been paid to sea mammals as biological indicators of Arctic environmental change. The usefulness of animals such as ringed seal (Phoca hispida), harp seal (Phoca groenlandica), bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), and harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) as indicator species is due to the close relationship of their range, reproductive cycles, and life histories to sea ice. The behaviour and distribution of these species correlate with ice conditions in the areas where the animals are encountered. The proportions of seal species represented in archaeological deposits may therefore reflect, at least in part, environmental conditions characterizing past seascapes.
   This paper examines zooarchaeological data from several Thule and historic Inuit archaeological sites in Baffin Island and Labrador, sites occupied during the last 700 years, to determine whether regional relationships can be demonstrated between subsistence economies, seal populations, and sea ice conditions. Ratios of ringed seal, harbour seal, bearded seal, and walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) bone frequencies from several archaeological sites are analyzed and discussed in light of new high-resolution proxy sea ice and regional palaeoenvironmental data. This exploratory study suggests that characteristics in seal species composition reflected in these assemblages can, in some circumstances, be correlated with recent sea ice reconstructions. However, a regional comparison of a larger number of more precisely dated archaeological sites is required for a full examination of these relationships.

AB  - A limnological survey was conducted of Little Black Lake, MI, and its tributaries during summer 2007. This small, shallow lake is located in a rapidly developing area of west Michigan. As such, our analytical approach and recommendations can serve as a model for other similar systems threatened by urbanization. Soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrate concentrations in both the inflows to (during baseflow) and Little Black Lake itself were low (<= 0.007 and <= 270 mg/L, respectively). Nutrient concentrations increased during stormflow conditions, although the magnitude of the increase depended on the nutrient and sampling location. Macrophyte growth was extensive throughout most parts of the lake, with Chara and Potamogeton spp. present in most sites; based on the coefficient of conservatism, plant composition was indicative of good water quality conditions. Chlorophyll a concentration averaged 1.7 mu g/L in Little Black Lake, with cryptophytes and cyanobacteria being the most dominant members (by biovolume) of the phytoplankton community. The fish community in Little Black Lake was dominated by bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and pumpkinseed (L. gibbosus), with no invasive species observed. Overall, abiotic and biotic conditions indicate that Little Black Lake is in good ecological health despite increasing pressures of urbanization in its watershed. To maintain this status, it is recommended that the local municipalities develop a comprehensive watershed management plan and implement best management practices to limit nonpoint source pollutant loading to Little Black Lake.

AB  - While much is known about the rise and expansion of the Inca Empire (AD 1438-1532) throughout the Andean region of South America, the health effects of the empire in its capital region remain unclear. The present study addresses the Inca Empire's impact on health in the Cuzco region of Peru through an analysis of four conditions (dental enamel hypoplasias, cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis and periosteal lesions) in 929 pre-Inca and Inca burials. The study results show little change in health from the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000-1438) to the Inca Imperial Period (AD 1438-1532). When the location of the Inca burial sites was analysed, individuals from sites closest to the centre of the empire's capital showed lower frequencies in pathological conditions compared with individuals from sites in the countryside. These results suggest that individuals centred in the Inca imperial sphere benefited from their position and experienced better health. A similar finding was also seen with the previous Wari occupation of Cuzco in the Middle Horizon (AD 600-1000), as burials within the Wari imperial sphere exhibited fewer non-specific stress indicators than those outside of it. Overall, the frequencies of pathological conditions in the Cuzco region, which ranged from 4.6% for porotic hyperostosis to 18.8% for periosteal lesions, were lower than frequencies from many coastal Peruvian sites. These differences may relate to a diverse diet provided by the Cuzco region ecosystem, as well as the absence of ecological challenges that affected coastal populations.

AB  - Recent studies have shown an increasing trend in hydroclimatic disturbances like droughts, which are anticipated to become more frequent and intense under global warming and climate change. Droughts adversely affect the vegetation growth and crop yield, which enhances the risks to food security for a country like India with over 1.2 billion people to feed. Here, we compared the response of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) to hydroclimatic disturbances in India at different scales (i.e., at river basins, land covers, and climate types) to examine the ecosystems' resilience to such adverse conditions. The ecosystem water use efficiency (WUEe: NPP/Evapotranspiration) is an effective indicator of ecosystem productivity, linking carbon (C) and water cycles. We found a significant difference (p<.05) in WUEe across India at different scales. The ecosystem resilience analysis indicated that most of the river basins were not resilient enough to hydroclimatic disturbances. Drastic reduction in WUEe under dry conditions was observed for some basins, which highlighted the cross-biome incapability to withstand such conditions. The ecosystem resilience at land cover and climate type scale did not completely relate to the basin-scale ecosystem resilience, which indicated that ecosystem resilience at basin scale is controlled by some other ecohydrological processes. Our results facilitate the identification of the most sensitive regions in the country for ecosystem management and climate policy making, and highlight the need for taking sufficient adaptation measures to ensure sustainability of ecosystems.

AB  - Streams in the southeastern Piedmont region display varying degrees of bank erosion, which in turn can influence multiple physical and biological processes. In efforts to assess and predict bank erosion, the multi-metric tool Bank Erosion Hazard Index (BEHI) is often calculated. As designed, the BEHI takes into consideration many physical phenomena and scores stream banks categorically from very low to extreme bank erosion hazard; however the power of this index to directly predict in-stream biological conditions is unknown. The predictive ability of BEHI was evaluated on near-bank aquatic biota and organic matter (OM) retention in an AL Piedmont stream with a range of bank conditions. Fifteen banks were characterized using the BEHI and subsequently, macroinvertebrates, crayfishes, fishes and organic matter associated with each bank were quantified. Results suggest increased macroinvertebrate richness and OM retention with low BEHI score. Multivariate analyses suggest functional similarity in macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with low BEHI banks and greater variation in assemblages as BEHI increased. Crayfish were more abundant at banks with high BEHI, a pattern attributed to increases in a generalist species in more-degraded habitats. Fish response showed no discernible pattern in relationship to BEHI score. These results suggest that BEHI may have applications as an informative ecological evaluation tool integrating physical and biological conditions in streams. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Dynamic Ripeness and Analysis (DRA)System in maize cultivation describe with the phenological ripeness, stress and selection indicator, the Silage maize Ripeness Index (SRI), the differentiated ripening development in the whole maize plant in addressing the most dominant ripening, growing and environmental conditions at the time of harvest period. The SRI is the quotient of ripeness of grain and residual plant. In addition to fix the correct optimum or agro-eco-efficiently harvest time. The SRI is also capable of the location suitability of the variety to characterize the ripeness specific type of variety as well as the environmental and cultivation conditions to quantify. The consistent use of the DRA-System by the maize growers leads to the desired momentum of ripeness, harvest and choice of varieties parameter. Only few environmentally stable maize varieties with the greatest variety and resistance performance for all utilization from the supposed varieties oversupply reach a consensus economic and ecological if the genotype for sowing corresponds to the phenotype for harvest. When the reference point of ripeness (SRI 2.8), there are only minor, ripeness-specific differences between the types of use (gas, fattening, grain and milk). Associated with the ripeness difference decrease the ripeness degree, better plant health, higher palatability and structure activity in the dairy cow feeding receiving maximum amounts of absolute ground fodder (healthy residual plant), which ultimately leads to a maximum milk production at a lower metabolic load of animals.

AB  - Information on the adaptation of germplasm pools to specific agroclimatic conditions is essential for ensuring high genetic progress while broadening the genetic base of breeding programmes. This study aimed to provide an ecological classification of global white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) landrace genetic resources on the basis of their adaptation pattern, verifying whether region of origin could conveniently contribute to such a classification. Some 113 landraces representing 11 regional pools were evaluated in three major agroclimatic conditions, i.e., Mediterranean and subcontinental climate in Italy under autumn sowing, and suboceanic climate in France under spring sowing. The classification of regional pools by pattern analysis suggested the presence of five major ecological groups composed as follows: A = Azores, Greece and Italy; B = Madeira and Canaries; C = Maghreb, Portugal and Spain; D = East Africa, Egypt and West Asia; and E = Turkey. This classification implied specific adaptation ranging from the cold-prone, autumn-sown environment (group A) to the spring-sown environment (groups D and E). Ecological grouping accounted for about half of the overall genotypic variation and genotype x environment interaction variation in just 3.6% of its degrees of freedom in an analysis of variance. It reflected largely the entry groups issued by pattern analysis classification of the individual accessions. Our classification of ecological groups can drive the incorporation of exotic genetic resources in European breeding programmes as a function of the targeted agroclimatic conditions. In addition, it can contribute to the definition of global or user-specific core collections.

AB  - Laboratory studies on artificial leaves suggest that leaf thermal dynamics are strongly influenced by the two-dimensional size and shape of leaves and associated boundary layer thickness. Hot environments are therefore said to favour selection for small, narrow or dissected leaves. Empirical evidence from real leaves under field conditions is scant and traditionally based on point measurements that do not capture spatial variation in heat load. We used thermal imagery under field conditions to measure the leaf thermal time constant (tau) in summer and the leaf-to-air temperature difference (Delta T) and temperature range across laminae (T-range) during winter, autumn and summer for 68 Proteaceae species. We investigated the influence of leaf area and margin complexity relative to effective leaf width (w(e)), the latter being amore direct indicator of boundary layer thickness. Normalized difference of margin complexity had no or weak effects on thermal dynamics, but w(e) strongly predicted tau and Delta T, whereas leaf area influenced T-range. Unlike artificial leaves, however, spatial temperature distribution in large leaves appeared to be governed largely by structural variation. Therefore, we agree that small size, specifically w(e), has adaptive value in hot environments but not with the idea that thermal regulation is the primary evolutionary driver of leaf dissection.

AB  - Epilithic diatom communities were sampled every two weeks from February 2001 to February 2002 at three sites in the lower Han River (LHR), South Korea, to investigate how epilithic diatom communities reflected longitudinal gradients in environmental quality measures. The water quality in the LHR differed between the rainy and dry seasons and also varied at different sites according to levels of pollution. The epilithic diatom communities responded to changes in the aquatic environment and hydrological characteristics. There were few predominant diatom species during the rainy season, and they were found at lower concentrations than in the dry season because of the high current velocities caused by heavy rainfall. The predominant species at the three study sites in the LHR were different because of the effects of eutrophication gradients. Cocconeis placentula, Diatoma vulgaris, and Nitzschia dissipata were dominant at site 1 (clean to nutrient-rich conditions). Fragilaria capucina var. gracilis and Gomphonema parvulum were dominant at site 2 and their growth was accelerated by the moderately-nutrient-rich conditions. Luticola goepperitnana, N. palea, small Nitzschia spp., and small Navicula spp. were dominant in the most polluted pools at site 3. We conclude that the LHR has a water quality gradient along its course, and that this causes marked changes in the epilithic diatom species compositions found along the river. The results confirm that epilithic diatoms are important bioindicators for assessing ecological quality in the LHR.

AB  - A cohort of 100 eggs of Panstrongylus geniculatus (Latreille) was reared in the laboratory under constant conditions (temperature 26 +/- 1A degrees C, 60 A +/- 10% RH), with mortality and fecundity data recorded weekly. We calculated stage-specific development times, age-specific mortality and fecundity (18.4 eggs/a (TM) Euro/wk), and stage-specific and total preadult mortality (31.6%), and the weekly intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(o) = 0.096), the finite population growth rate (lambda = 1.109), the net reproductive rate (R-0 = 60.45), and the generation time (T = 46.34 wk). Elasticity analysis showed that the dominant life-history trait determining lambda was survival (particularly the adult female's survival). Adult females dominated the stage-specific reproductive value, and the egg stage dominated the stable stage distribution (SSD). The damping ratio (rho = 1.096) suggests a relatively rapid period of recovery to a disturbed SSD. Results were compared with one previous study and conform relatively well, considering that environmental conditions were not the same. We estimated the colonizing ability of P. geniculatus, using as a criterion the ro/b index, and obtained the value of 0.74, an indicator of a good colonizer, and similar to well-known invasive species such as Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma infestans. The life history traits and demographic parameters here presented for P. geniculatus are discussed in terms of their usefulness for evolutionary studies and vector control activities.

AB  - The energetic and physiological status of parental smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu was investigated across the majority of their latitudinal range at the onset and near the end of care. Variables such as tissue lipid stores, plasma indicators of nutritional status and chronic stress and white muscle were used to define energetic and physiological status. Results showed that northern males (48 degrees N) were larger and heavier than mid-northern (44 degrees N) and southern (36 degrees N) latitude males. For a given body size, northern males had greater whole-body lipid across the parental care period and tended to feed more (based on gut contents) than mid-northern and southern latitude conspecifics. Indicators of nutritional status were also highest in northern males. Conversely, the southern males exhibited the greatest capacity for biosynthesis across the entire parental care period as indicated by the highest level of nucleoside diphosphate kinase activities. Collectively, these finding suggest that the energetic costs and physiological consequences of care vary across latitudes, providing some of the first mechanistic evidence of how environmental conditions can influence both the ecological and physiological costs of reproduction for wild animals during parental care. The data also suggest that lake-specific processes that can vary independently of latitude may be important, necessitating additional research on fish reproductive physiology across landscapes.

AB  - Sea area grading of coastal county-level administrative division and sea area benchmark price formulation is a sea area use management work with Chinese characteristics. Sea area grading is the basis for formulating sea area benchmark price, and its essence is to perform suitability spatial differentiation evaluation for different sea uses. This study technical framework, and conducts an empirical research on the sea area grading for sea reclamation and structures in Zhuanghe City, Liaoning Province. The sea area grading range for sea reclamation and structures includes the marine functional zones except for the "marine protected areas", "special utilization zones" and "reserved zones". Six hundred sixty-three (663) 1 km31 km sized grids are divided as the sea area grading units by the dynamic grid-based method. A sea area grading indicator system for sea reclamation and structures is established from three aspects: Sea area natural conditions, constraints of marine ecological spaces and sea area location conditions, The scores of the sea area grading units are calculated by the ArcGIS 10.2 software, and the sea area is divided into five grades. The final scheme is consistent with the sea area conditions in Zhuanghe City. About a half of the sea reclamation and non-permeable structures in Zhuanghe City are distributed in the grade 2 sea area, and the sea area benchmark price corresponding to the sea area grade will realize the value of the sea area resource assets to a greater extent.

AB  - Belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) from the Eastern Beaufort Sea (EBS) population are harvested annually in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR) during their seasonal migration past coastal communities and harvest camps. The beluga harvest monitoring program is a flagship program of the ISR's Fish and Marine Mammal Community Monitoring Program, and it has provided critical information about beluga health and observed changes in the EBS population. This study aimed to develop a suite of local indicators of beluga health that bridged traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) about beluga condition, illness, and disease, with western science through the co-production of knowledge. Community members from Inuvik, Paulatuk, and Tuktoyaktuk with beluga harvesting and preparation experience were engaged to characterize beluga health from an Inuvialuit perspective. Inuvialuit knowledge about the environment and beluga health, values about hunting beluga, and Inuvialuit cosmology-the foundation of the knowledge-system were documented through semi-structured questionnaires (n = 66), semi-structured interviews (n = 78), and focus group meetings (n = 3). This research furthers our understanding of how Inuvialuit view beluga health from the physical and behavioural characteristics of belugas, values, and appropriate behaviours by harvesters and how observations made about beluga can be explained. To support the co-production of knowledge, a suite of local indicators was developed that bridged TEK about beluga condition, illness, and disease with western science.

AB  - The tropics are assumed to contribute to global contamination with PAHs. However, little is known about the state of pollution in tropical environments. This study aimed to examine concentrations, compositions, and possible sources of 20 PAHs in Bangkok surface soils. We sampled 30 hydromorphic urban soils at 0-5 cm depth. The sum of the 20 PAH concentrations ranged between 12 and 380 mu g kg(-1); far lower than in soils of temperate cities. The reasons may be a shorter accumulation time, the tropical climate enhancing biodegradation, volatilisation, and photo-oxidation, and leaching into the groundwater. The most abundant compounds were naphthalene (on average 14% of the total PAH concentration) > benzo(b + j + k)fluoranthenes (11%)> perylene (10%) but not fluoranthene, pyrene, and chrysene like in many temperate soils. Based on a principal component analysis it may be distinguished between naphthalene, phenanthrene, and perylene and all other compounds, The former compounds were assigned to the same principal component as the ratio of oxalate- to dithionite-extractable Fe. This ratio is a measure of the crystallinity of Fe oxides and thus an indicator for the frequency of reducing conditions. The result suggested that naphthalene, phenanthrene, and perylene had common sources possibly related with anaerobic conditions. While perylene is known to be produced biologically in reducing soils and sediments, there is no clear evidence for biological formation of naphthalene and phenanthrene.

AB  - The freshwater mollusc assemblages and their relationships to some physico-chemical parameters and to water persistence are described for two river basins in South Spain.  The different species found can be grouped in two kinds of associations, one according to its geographical distribution and the other to its abundance.  With respect to the first grouping, neither water persistence, nor physico-chemical conditions seem to influence it.  With respect to its abundance, the species assemblages observed seem to be accidental or due to different successional states.  In relation to physico-chemical preferences, most species and/or assemblages were distributed in the same way as physico-chemical conditions availability.  The exceptions were Lymnaea truncatula which preferred the less eutrophic lentic sites in Guadaira basin; Mercuria confusa and Melanopsis dufouri which preferred higher altitude sites, coinciding with more saline sites in the Guadaira basin too; and the group consisting of Potamopyrgus jenkinsi, Lymnaea peregra, Melanopsis dufouri, Ancylus fluviatilis, and Pisidium sp. was more abundant in higher altitude sites and during non flooded periods in Guadalete basin.  Due to the lack of strong tendencies and to several contradictions in its preferences, we conclude that mollusc have a limited value as environmental indicators of particular conditions in stressed streams or/and with high ionic concentrations.  Finally, we hypothesize that in variable environments, such as those described here, macroinvertebrate assemblages of low dispersal taxa, must be made of by only a few species of wide ecological tolerances and probably wide geographical distribution.

AB  - The condition of Australia's water catchments was assessed in a 2 million km(2) intensive land-use zone (ILZ) as part of a National Land and Water Resources Audit (the Audit). The assessment used existing biophysical data obtained from satellite imagery, digital elevation models, computed or derived values, surrogates and existing spatial data from state and national databases. The data were used to derive indicators and an index of relative catchment condition for 3718 sub-catchments and 197 basins. The spatial patterns for catchment condition were then mapped across the ILZ. The term indicator is used consistently to mean a single attribute (even if it is derived from several variables), whereas a sub-index or an index is an aggregation of scaled indicator values.
   An inventory was made of all potentially relevant biophysical measures of the water, land and biota in catchments that existed in archives. Criteria to assess data quality including a national coverage, ease of interpretation, scale, relevance to policy development and catchment management were applied to some 110 measures from which 21 indicators were ultimately selected and used for tabulation, mapping and interpretation. The data were assembled at 250 m cell resolution and aggregated to 5 km cells as the base unit for analysis. To map the indicators or indices, a five-point classification (quintiles) was used, ranging from relatively poorer to better condition. The class boundaries were based on equal intervals or equal areas under the frequency curve of each indicator or index. Indicator values for each 5 km cell ranged from 1 to 5 (1 being poorer, 5 being better). Index values were calculated by adding the scores for a set of indicators, for example, all the 21 identified and taking a mean for all the 5 km cells within each catchment.
   Data manipulations and analysis used a multi-component decision support system (DSS), geographic information system (GIS) called catchment condition (CatCon). Numerous maps were generated for each indicator and for indices comprising different combinations of indicators, ranging from the complete set (21), a core set (14) to relatively few (6) and for different regionalisations. Cross-comparisons between catchment condition classes and some consumptive outputs from catchments were also carried out. Only maps for the index based on 14 indicators and a single cross-comparison are presented here as illustrations. The web site www.affa.gov.au/catcon/ has more examples.
   The main points to emerge were: clear interpretable patterns of better to poorer condition were defined for the intensive land-use zone; visualisations of catchment condition were markedly different for classes defined by equal area or equal interval; the broad patterns of relative condition could be captured with relatively few aggregated indicators; the cross-comparisons suggested areas where land-use changes are needed to develop sustainable land-use systems. The study illustrates that relatively low quality but extensive data can be used to provide a rational basis to identify priority areas for management action and for natural resource management policy development. We suggest that the development of a higher quality national data set in Australia to assess the condition of the Nation's catchments may be best achieved through the co-ordination and collection of core data sets (indicators) at regional scales.

AB  - Biological activity in soil causes fluxes of O-2 into and CO2 out of the soil with significant global relevance. Hence, the dynamics of CO2 concentrations in soil can be used as an indicator for biological activity. However, there is an enormous spatial and temporal variability in soil respiration, which has led to the notion of hotspots and hot moments. This variability is attributed to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of both plant-soil-microbiome interactions and the local conditions governing gas transport. For the characterization of a given soil, the local heterogeneities should be replaced by some meaningful average. To this end, we introduce a line sensor based on tubular gas-selective membranes that is applicable at the field scale for a wide range in water content. It provides the average CO2 concentration of the ambient soil along its length. The new technique corrects for fluctuating external conditions (i.e., temperature and air pressure) and the impact of water vapor without any further calibration. The new line sensor was tested in a laboratory mesocosm experiment where CO2 concentrations were monitored at two depths during the growth of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The results could be consistently related to plant development, plant density, and changing conditions for gas diffusion toward the soil surface. The comparison with an independent CO2 sensor confirmed that the new sensor is actually capable of determining meaningful average CO2 concentrations in a natural soil for long time periods.

AB  - The limnological conditions during the past 700 yr were reconstructed based on multiproxy analysis of a short sedimentary sequence from El Toro Lake (similar to 40 degrees S, 70 degrees W). Mineralogical and geochemical features, as well as ostracods and chironomids, record hydrologic changes in the El Toro Lake basin. The ostracod Limnocythere rionegroensis var. 1, a reliable indicator of high salinity, and Eucypris fontana, a euryhaline species with preferences for moderate-salinity waters, are studied as paleolimnological proxies. The chironomid fauna indicates less saline conditions in the mid-twentieth century. These salinity changes are interpreted in terms of negative-positive hydrologic balance. High lake level and low salinity between AD 1500 and 1700 match with the wetter and colder climate during the second pulse of the Little Ice Age in northern Patagonia. High-salinity conditions occurred during the late nineteenth century, corresponding to the driest period during the past 400 yr in northeastern Patagonia. An increase in the precipitation around the middle of the twentieth century, in contrast to the records from the Chilean side of the mountains, correlates with a positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode. This is associated, in turn, with a strengthening, poleward shift of the midlatitude westerlies, possibly enhancing easterly moist air flows into central-north Patagonia.

AB  - Neotropical, overseas regions of Europe are subjected to the same water policy objectives as the continental ones but were overlooked during recent developments of bioindicators that fulfil the Water Framework Directive guidelines. We designed a macroinvertebrate-based multimetric index [Indice Biotique Macroinvertebres de Guyane (IBMG)] to assess ecological health in remote headwater-small streams of French Guiana, Europe's only overseas region of continental South America. Invertebrates were sampled at 95 sites including reference and impacted river reaches, following a standardized protocol. Among the 102 biological metrics calculated from site-specific data, we selected metrics exhibiting the best trade-off between high discrimination efficiency, low specificity, low redundancy and high stability under reference conditions. The IBMG is composed of two taxonomic richness-based metrics, two abundance-based metrics, one trait-related metric and a diversity index (Shannon's entropy). Each metric was weighted by its discrimination efficiency. Using a test data set, we found that the IBMG was sensitive to the range of disturbances in French Guiana. Finally, comparing the IBMG with other indices developed in other neotropical countries reveals that, for several reasons, multimetric indices developed in the neotropics may perform well in the context of the data sets used to generate them but would certainly fail to be robust when used elsewhere.

AB  - Recent studies on Neoproterozoic climate change have prompted renewed interest in Neoproterozoic glacial deposits and renewed debate over the criteria used to identify the nature of glacial influence on sedimentation. Analyses of soft sediment deformation structures have provided important clues to distinguish between competing palaeoenvironmental interpretations of Quaternary glacial deposits; a similar approach is presented here in the analysis of Neoproterozoic glacial deposits of the Smalfjord Formation, northern Norway. A detailed sedimentological and structural analysis at several sites in the Varangerfjorden area reveals complex soft sediment deformation at various scales in conglomerate, sandstone and diamictite. Deformation is predominantly ductile and includes anticlinal and synclinal folding, flow noses, flame structures, recumbent folding and shear structures. The deformed sediments are associated predominantly with conglomerate and sandstone, which record glaciofluvial and deltaic depositional conditions. Some deformations can be attributed to rapid deposition and slumping, whereas others appear to record shear stress associated with overriding ice. The scale, style and range of deformation, together with the coarse-grained nature of the deformed sediments and facies associations, suggest that these were unfrozen outwash sediments that were overridden by ice and resedimented in a dynamic ice-proximal setting. Whereas recent studies of diamictite-bearing strata of the Smalfjord Formation had revealed no clear evidence of glacial influence on deposition, deformation structures documented here suggest that glacial conditions prevailed on the basin margin during deposition of Smalfjord Formation sediments, with sedimentary facies and deformation structures typical of temperate ice-proximal settings.

AB  - Silversides arc renowned for their phenotypic plasticity with different populations coexisting as incipient species. The New World silverside Odontesthes argentinensis is an estuarine-resident fish with known populations inhabiting the Rio de la Plata estuary as well as coastal lagoons of Brazil. Uruguay and Argentina, where it constitutes an important resource for artisanal fisheries. Using classical morphometric analysis, we study six morphological variables to determine if there are differences between the New World silversides collected from two Uruguayan Atlantic coastal lagoons (Clarion and Rocha Lagoons), which communicate periodically with the ocean. In collaboration with artisanal fishermen, silversides were measured in fresh condition. After removing the size and allometric effect on the variables, Canonical Discriminant Analysis (DA) was applied to compare the morphometry of individuals collected in the two lagoons. Results supported the existence of two groups with values greater than 80% of accurate classification. The morphometric variables that contributed the most to this result were eye diameter, breadth of mouth, length from mouth tip to anal fin and length of pectoral fin. The first two morphometric variables are related to sensory perception and feeding, which could be indicators of an ecological segregation, conditioned by the characteristics of the environment, considering that the two coastal lagoons differ in their abiotic characteristics, most importantly in their hydrodynamic conditions. This work represents the first study of differences between two estuarine coastal lagoon populations of O. argentinensis.

AB  - Current ecological risk assessment of pesticides fails to protect aquatic biodiversity. For the first time, we tested two potential reasons for this failure with regard to carry-over effects across metamorphosis: their dependence on hatching period, and the lack of studies quantifying adult fitness under seminatural conditions. Using the damselfly Coenagrion puella sampled from six populations, we designed an outdoor longitudinal one-year study starting from the egg stage. We exposed the aquatic larvae to the pesticide esfenvalerate (0.11 mu g/L) during the initial microcosm part. Next, we monitored the lifetime fitness of the terrestrial adults in an insectary. Exposure to the pesticide negatively impacted not only larval traits, but also drastically reduced lifetime mating success of adult females. The impact of this postmetamorphic effect of the pesticide on the population level was three times more important than the effects in the larval stage. Importantly, this carry-over effect was only present in females that hatched early in the season, and was not mediated by metamorphic traits (age and mass at emergence). We provide proof-of-principle under seminatural conditions for two potential pitfalls that need to be considered when improving risk assessment: carry-over effects on adult fitness can (i) be much more important than effects during the larval stage and may not be captured by metamorphic traits, and (ii) be strongly modulated by egg hatching dates.

AB  - When interpreting responses to experimental manipulations or particular environmental cues, it is necessary to have previous knowledge about the natural variation of the response traits. We Studied how nine blood parameters, including four enzymatic activities, varied with time in wild Great Tits by assessing their repeatabilities over periods of 45 days, in the same season (Spring or Autumn/Winter), in the same year and over a four years period. The accuracy of the measurements of these blood parameters was also assessed. Measurement error reflected essentially sample and time of storage rather than assay effects. Hematocrit and haemoglobin had low repeatabilities within Spring, ranging from 0.26 to 0.31; Heterophil/Lymphocyte ratio white blood cell count (WBC), total plasma cholinesterase and red blood cell glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities had moderate to high repeatabilities over periods of 45 days (repeatabilities ranged from 0.47 to 0.81 for GSH-Px and H/L, respectively), but also during longer periods such as during Spring (total plasma cholinesterase activity) and Autumn/Winter (WBC, H/L and GSH-Px). Of the blood parameters measured, total plasma cholinesterase, glutathione peroxidase and the haematological parameter WBC and H/L seem relatively constant and therefore reliable indicators of Great Tit's physiological condition within, at least, a 45 days, time frame.

AB  - A project to deepen shipping and entrance channels in Charleston Harbor was conducted from 1999 to 2002. This generated approximately 22 million cubic yards of sediment for offshore disposal. Assessments of biological and physical conditions in the Charleston Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site and surrounding areas were conducted prior to deepening (1993-94), and partway through the disposal period (2000). Results from the 2000 survey are presented and compared to the baseline survey. The study area was composed of the disposal zone and surrounding areas and divided into 20 one square mile strata. Within each stratum, benthic grab samples were collected from ten random sites for analysis of sediment composition and contaminants and macrobenthic assemblages. No contaminant levels were above effects range low levels. Results revealed that sediments in the western strata had significantly higher silt/clay content in the 2000 survey when compared to baseline sediments, while sediments east of the disposal zone were similar to baseline. Analyses were performed on a subset of the benthic data that compared baseline to 2000 conditions in western and eastern strata. The benthic communities in western strata were altered following disposal operations. The benthic community east of the disposal area was not different from baseline conditions. These alterations in the benthic community were attributed to changes in bottom habitat characteristics rather than pollution effects. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main aim of our research was to show that the body size of the planktonic cladoceran Daphnia cucullata can be used as an indicator of the ecological status of lakes. We selected this species because it is one of the most common zooplankton species in Europe and it exhibits a high degree of morphological variability depending on the environmental conditions. Additionally, D. cucullata is almost entirely ignored as a food source by fish unlike other Daphnia species, and often dominates in lakes where fish predation is intense. Therefore, we could minimize the top-down effects (fish pressure) and enhances bottom-up effects (food quality and availability) for this species. We measured the body length, body width, length of head, and length of tail spine of D. cucullata from 104 lakes with different trophic conditions in northern Poland. The results of our study revealed that D. cucullata grows larger in a better resource environment. The body length and width significantly decreased with increasing trophic status. The larger body classes of D. cucullata were absent in highly eutrophic conditions. Therefore, the body size of D. cucullata seems to be a good and simple indicator of the ecological status of lakes. We propose a simple formula for D. cucullata (Body Size Index) based on which we can assess the ecological status of lakes. We believe that our index could be applied to many other planktonic cladocerans.

AB  - Local changes in land use and climatic conditions provoke transformations of habitats and therefore, distribution changes of species in the landscape. Different insect groups are repeatedly used as indicators of local ecological conditions in biodiversity research. Here we suggest that only highly philopatric groups can be relevant indicators pointing to differences in ecological conditions among spatially close habitats. For our study in open agriculture landscape, we chose aculeate Hymenoptera and hoverflies as two insect, mostly pollinator groups differing in their degree of philopatry within the registered pool of our survey where hoverflies were represented by common generalist species showing high mobility. We tested if these groups appeared in significantly different species numbers in two most contrasting habitats typical for the European open agriculture landscape: patches of flower-rich, semi-natural habitats around fields with a variety of nesting sites and wheat fields in proximity that represented a non-viable agricultural habitat with no nesting and foraging opportunities. For this purpose, comparison of results from attractant based (pan traps) and observational (transect walks) methods were used. Philopatric species were detected in significantly different species numbers in the two habitat types using both methods. In contrast, highly mobile non-philopatric species showed a mixed pattern. We assume that these species can be attracted at any place if containing a suitable attractant (flowers or pan traps in this case) what may not indicate their actual living in the habitat.

AB  - In drylands, the underlying vegetation structure is associated with ecosystem functioning and ecosystem resilience. Although scale-dependent patterns are also predicted, empirical evidence often demonstrates that patch sizes are distributed according to a power-law probability distribution function or truncated power-law probability distribution function for a varied range of environmental conditions. Using satellite images and field measures, we assessed the spatial pattern of vegetation patches for a wide range of vegetation cover values in a large set of Mediterranean dryland (MDL) plots, focusing on the statistical distribution function that better fits the patch sizes. We found that power-law or truncated power-law probability distribution function does not always fit the observed patch size frequencies, while lognormal probability density function always fit well to them, implying that the vegetation structure is scale dependent for a large range of conditions. We show how the sampling approach, fit methods, and system dimensionality can affect the patch size distribution, which can explain some conflicting evidence obtained from the empirical data. Our findings question the robustness of criticality as the underlying mechanism driving vegetation patterns in MDLs. The better fit to patch size distribution provided by lognormal as compared with power-law indicates that multiplicative effects of multivariate local influences underlie pattern formation, and suggests that the role of plant-plant facilitation can be overestimated for a large range of conditions.

AB  - This study aims to contribute toward a better understanding of the current biodiversity patterns existing in the Atlantic Forest of the state of Rio de Janeiro from a paleo-ecological approach. Three soil profiles, each formed from distinct source materials under varied climate and vegetation conditions were selected from the coastal regions of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Soil horizon samples for chemical and physical characterization were collected from 10 cm-interval depths, and the total organic carbon was determined in addition to performing isotype and phytolithic analyses. The phytolithic analysis associated with the isotopic techniques (delta C-13) permitted the characterization of three stages of paleo-environmental evolution for the studied soils, presenting valid trends that indicate small variations within the phytosociological structure of the vegetation along a Spodosols line in the studied areas. These stages indicated that the phytolithic assemblage was formed from a vegetation profile containing more trees, adapted to conditions colder than the existing vegetation, although no environmental changes were detected using the isotopic data. The milder temperature conditions may have favored the pedogenetic processes of the spodic B horizon formation as well as the maintenance of the organic matter contained in the soil. This study serves as the first draft for the paleo-environmental association among the regions where the analyzed profiles are found. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leaf chlorophyll (Chl) content is an indicator of physiological conditions and nutritional status of a plant. However, the conventional methods for estimating the Chl content in leaves are analytical based destructive and time consuming, and these methods do not allow to study on the same sample over time. Valeriana jatamansi, a perennial medicinal herb, is now endangered and at the edge of becoming extinct in India. It is therefore a pressing need to conserve and maintain this species in their natural habitat. One experiment was conducted to ascertain whether the CCM-200, a hand-held Chl meter, could be effectively used to estimate Chl content of V. Jatamansi in a non-destructive manner. The regression equations between CCM-200 reading and actual chlorophyll values have been developed for three accessions of V. jatamansi grown under two different conditions. In the present data-sets, second-degree polynomial regression model has been proven to be the best model with higher R-2 (R-2 = 0.852-0.964, P <= 0.01) and lower ACI values (94.47-171.78) for all the cases (except plastic film greenhouse grown accession-3). For accession-5 and accession-7, the model predicted values of total Chl were very close to conventionally measured values with an RMSE < 3.50 mu g cm(-2). However, the calibrated models were circumstances-specific. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test and select one or more highly sensitive, specific and environmentally successful Egyptian bioindicator plants for ozone (O(3)). For that purpose more than 30 Egyptian species and cultivars were subjected to extensive screening studies under controlled environmental and pollutant exposure conditions to mimic the Egyptian environmental conditions and O(3) levels in urban and rural sites. Four plant species were found to be more sensitive to O(3) than the universally used O(3)-bioindicator, tobacco Bel W3, under the Egyptian environmental conditions used. These plant species, jute (Corchorus olitorius p c.v. local), clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L. c.v. Masry), garden rocket (Eruca sativa c.v. local) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. c.v. local), ranked in order of decreasing sensitivity, exhibited typical O(3) injury symptoms faster and at lower O(3) concentrations than Bel W3. Three variables were tested in search of a reliable tool for the diagnosis and prediction of O(3) response prior to the appearance of visible foliar symptoms: pigment degradation, stomatal conductance (g(s)) and net photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation Pigment degradation was found to be unreliable in predicting species sensitivity to O(3). Evidence supporting stomatal conductance involvement in O(3) tolerance was found only in tolerant species. A good correlation was found between g(s), restriction of O(3) and CO(2) influx into the mesophyll tissues, and P(net). Changes in P(net) seemed to depend largely on fluctuations in g(s).

AB  - We examined the influence of topography, canopy structure and gap light environmental variables on the patterns of vascular ground flora (vascular plants less than 1 m in height excluding tree seedlings) in a subtropical broadleaved forest in S China, using field data obtained from a 4-ha permanent plot. Both topographic and canopy environmental conditions had a significant effect on community composition, species diversity and distribution of the vascular ground flora. However, topographic factors, especially slope position and aspect, had a greater influence as compared with canopy and understory light conditions. Both number of individuals and number of individuals per species of the ground flora varied significantly with different slope position, aspect, slope steepness and transmitted direct radiation, while species richness varied significantly under different slope position and canopy leaf area index (LAI) The effects of topographic and canopy environmental conditions on ground-flora composition and structure was further confirmed by Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Multi-response Permutation Procedures (MRPP) showed significant differences in the ground-flora species composition based on all the topographic, canopy structure and gap light variables. Species indicative of topographic, canopy structure and gap light regimes were identified with a significant indicator value (IV >= 35%) by Indicator Species Analysis (ISA), which indicated that certain species have their ecological preference for a particular environmental gradient.

AB  - Despite many efforts for pollution abatement in aquatic ecosystems, there are still some cases of high accumulation of industrial pollutants due to past activities. In Flix reservoir (Ebro River, Spain), there are around 200,000-360,000 tons of industrial pollutants with a high concentration of heavy metals and organochlorides due to the activity of an organochlorine industry during more than half a century. This exceptional amount of pollutants provides a good opportunity (and need) to analyse their effects on fish populations under natural conditions, which is rarely available to ecotoxicologists. We compared the reproductive traits and prevalence of diseases and parasites at this impacted area with a neighbouring upstream reservoir unaffected by the pollution (reference sites) and also to downstream sites. Deformity, eroded fin, lesion and tumour (DELT) anomalies and ectoparasites were clearly more frequent at the impacted area for several fish species (common carp, roach and pumpkinseed). A significant negative impact of Flix reservoir on condition (eviscerated and liver weights, adjusted for fish size with analysis of covariance) and reproductive traits (gonadal weight and number of mature eggs, adjusted for fish size) was also detected for several fish species. The responses to the pollutants were species-specific, and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) was the species with the clearest effects on fitness-related traits at the impacted area, despite also being among the most tolerant to pollution.

AB  - Empirically derived relationships associating sediment metal concentrations with degraded ecological conditions provide important information to assess estuarine condition. Resources limit the number, magnitude, and frequency of monitoring activities to acquire these data. Models that use available information and simple statistical relationships to predict sediment metal concentrations could provide an important toot for environmental assessment. We developed 45 predictive models for the total concentrations of copper, lead, mercury, and cadmium in estuarine sediments along the Southern New England and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Using information theoretic model-averaging approaches, we found total developed land and percent silt/clay of estuarine sediment were the most important variables for predicting the presence of all four metals. Estuary area, river flow, tidal range, and total agricultural land varied in their importance. The model-averaged predictions explained 78.4, 70.5, 56.4, and 50.3% of the variation for copper, lead, mercury and cadmium, respectively. Overall prediction accuracies of selected sediment benchmark values (i.e., effects ranges) were 83.9, 84.8, 78.6, and 92.0% for copper, lead, mercury, and cadmium, respectively. Our results further support the generally accepted conclusion that sediment metal concentrations are best described by the physical characteristics of the estuarine sediment and the total amount of urban land in the contributing watershed. We demonstrated that broad-scate predictive models built from existing monitoring data with information theoretic model-averaging approaches provide valuable predictions of estuarine sediment metal concentrations and show promise for future environmental modeling efforts in other regions.

AB  - Quantitative and qualitative diatom analyses from the north Nile Delta lakes sediments of Egypt were used to evaluate the paleoenvironmental development of the lakes and climatic changes during the late Holocene. We analyzed 565 samples taken from 19 cores from Manzala, Burullus and Edku lakes. A total of 263 diatom species and varieties were identified. Multivariate statistical analyses distinguished 17 ecological groups that reflect changes in water salinity, lake-level and trophic state of the lakes, which in turn are mainly related to climatic changes and anthropogenic impacts. Manzala and Burullus lakes experienced a series of alternation between fresh, brackish and marine episodes, which were associated with wet and dry climates. Edku Lake cores, however, contained only three ecological groups that are characteristic of brackish water conditions. The general depositional regime in the lakes indicated five environmental phases: (a) a deep freshwater phase when the Nile flood water reach the lakes during humid warm climate; (b) a shallow freshwater phase with some macrophytes during a dry climate; (c) a shallow brackish water phase when Nile floodwater ceased during a dry climate and the lakes shifted to brackish conditions; (d) a mixed environmental phase when the seawater mixed with freshwater from drains and canals (water salinity fluctuated widely from freshwater to estuarine and full marine conditions); (e) a fully marine phase when seawater entered the lakes at all stages of the tide.

AB  - An understanding of the influences of anthropogenic disturbance and variation in habitat quality on organism condition and breeding success may improve future management and conservation decisions. Some authors consider haemoglobin concentration to be a simple biochemical indicator of bird condition. The main goal of this paper is to examine if the level of haemoglobin displays any consistent pattern of variation across habitats differing in quality. We present results concerning long-term variation in haemoglobin concentration in the blood of about 14-day-old nestling Blue Tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) in central Poland in an 11-year period (2003-2013), in two landscapes (an urban parkland and a deciduous forest). The most important findings of the study are: (1) the concentration of haemoglobin of the nestlings from the same brood tended to be consistently similar, with most variation occurring between broods, (2) mean levels of haemoglobin varied between years, and were correlated with caterpillar abundance peaks in the forest study site, (3) mean haemoglobin concentration was significantly higher in the forest area than in the parkland area, (4) haemoglobin levels were positively correlated with breeding and fledging success. We confirmed that haemoglobin concentration displays a spatio-temporal pattern and that the level of haemoglobin is a reliable condition and habitat quality indicator in nestling Blue Tits in the study populations. Although, strictly speaking, the analysed differences are between two particular sites, we think that they reflect differences between urban and non-urban habitats.

AB  - In this study, n-alkane and isoprenoid, saturated and aromatic biomarker distributions of Miocene coals in the can (canakkale) region, were studied to investigate organic geochemical characteristics, depositional environment, and hydrocarbon potential of these coals.
   can formation (Middle Miocene) unconformably overlies the basement can volcanites (Upper Oligocene-Lower Miocene). This formation is composed of lignite, clayey lignite, and ligniferous clayey levels of various thicknesses interlayering with clay and tuffite. The formation represents sediments of small lacustrine basins that are isolated by faults that are formed contemporaneously with Early-Middle Eocene volcanism. Coaliferous units are overlain by lower agglomerate levels.
   The Rock Eval analyses show that the average TOC (Total Organic Carbon) content of the coal is 53.71% and the average HI (Hydrogen Index) value is 180.5 mgHC/gTOC. OI (Oxygen Index) values (avg. 22.33 mgCO(2)/gTOC) show that the depositional environment of peat deposits is suboxic. According to HI-Tmax, S-2-TOC classification diagrams and Pr/n-C-17 vs. Ph/n-C-18 diagram, the organic matter is composed of Type II and Type III kerogen mixing and represents a transitional environment. In gas chromatograms, n-alkanes with high, mostly odd-numbered carbons are dominant and they are associated with a slight algal contribution. CPI22-30 (Carbon Preference Index) and TAR(HC) (Terrigenous/Aquatic Ratio) values indicate a dominance of high-carbon numbered n-alkanes, indicating the presence of terrestrial organic matter.
   P-aq (aquatic plant n-alkane proxy) values (0.2; 0.3) indicate a climate with relatively wet conditions or low precipitation, the presence of emergent macrophyteses, and the scarcity of hydrophilic plants. Pwax (vascular plant n-alkane proxy) ratio (0.8; 0.7) shows moderately wet conditions and a relatively low water level.
   The TOC, ACL (n-alkane average chain length), Q(wood/grass), Q(wood/plant), and Q(grass/plant) values indicate the presence of woody plants in a peat bog and relatively wet and moderately warm climate conditions.
   Based on DBT/P (dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene) ratio, sample c-2 points to the character of marine shale and other lacustrines whereas sample c-6 indicates fluvial/deltaic depositional environment.
   Overall, 20S/(20R + 20S), beta beta/(alpha alpha+beta beta) sterane, 22S/(22R + 22S) homohopane, and moretane/hopane ratios that reflect the maturity of organic matter are indicative of immature organic matter. MA(I)/MA(I + II), TA(I)/TA(I + II) and C28TA/(C29MA + C28TA) steroid, MPI, MPR, and MDR ratios calculated from aromatic biomarkers are quite low, which indicate an immature nature.
   The n-alkane, saturated and aromatic biomarker data on the can coals reveal that deposition should have taken place in a terrestrial environment changing from lacustrine to fluvial under predominately suboxic-oxic and acidic conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A metabolite profiling approach has been implemented to elucidate metabolic adaptation at set culture conditions in five Mycobacterium species (two fast-and three slow-growing) with the potential to act as model organisms for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Analysis has been performed over designated growth phases and under representative environments (nutrient and oxygen depletion) experienced by Mtb during infection. The procedure was useful in determining a range of metabolites (60-120 compounds) covering nucleotides, amino acids, organic acids, saccharides, fatty acids, glycerols, -esters, -phosphates and isoprenoids. Among these classes of compounds, key biomarker metabolites, which can act as indicators of pathway/process activity, were identified. In numerous cases, common metabolite traits were observed for all five species across the experimental conditions (e.g. uracil indicating DNA repair). Amino acid content, especially glutamic acid, highlighted the different properties between the fast-and slow-growing mycobacteria studied (e.g. nitrogen assimilation). The greatest similarities in metabolite composition between fast-and slow-growing mycobacteria were apparent under hypoxic conditions. A comparison to previously reported transcriptomic data revealed a strong correlation between changes in transcription and metabolite content. Collectively, these data validate the changes in the transcription at the metabolite level, suggesting transcription exists as one of the predominant modes of cellular regulation in Mycobacterium. Sectors with restricted correlation between metabolites and transcription (e.g. hypoxic cultivation) warrant further study to elucidate and exploit post-transcriptional modes of regulation. The strong correlation between the laboratory conditions used and data derived from in vivo conditions, indicate that the approach applied is a valuable addition to our understanding of cell regulation in these Mycobacterium species.

AB  - Studies of the body condition of five marine vertebrate predators in the Beaufort Sea, conducted independently during the past 2-4 decades, suggest each has been affected by biophysical changes in the marine ecosystem. We summarize a temporal trend of increasing body condition in two species (bowhead whale subadults, Arctic char), in both cases influenced by the extent and persistence of annual sea ice. Three other species (ringed seal, beluga, black guillemot chicks), consumers with a dietary preference for Arctic cod, experienced declines in condition, growth and/or production during the same time period. The proximate causes of these observed changes remain unknown, but may reflect an upward trend in secondary productivity, and a concurrent downward trend in the availability of forage fishes, such as the preferred Arctic cod. To further our understanding of these apparent ecosystem shifts, we urge the use of multiple marine vertebrate species in the design of biophysical sampling studies to identify causes of these changes. Continued long-term, standardized monitoring of vertebrate body condition should be paired with concurrent direct (stomach contents) or indirect (isotopes, fatty acids) monitoring of diet, detailed study of movements and seasonal ranges to establish and refine baselines, and identification of critical habitats of the marine vertebrates being monitored. This would be coordinated with biophysical and oceanographic sampling, at spatial and temporal scales, and geographic locations, that are relevant to the home range, critical habitats and prey of the vertebrate indicator species showing changes in condition and related parameters.

AB  - Bridge condition assessment is a complex problem influenced by many factors. The uncertain environment increases more its complexity. Due to the uncertainty in the process of assessment, one of the key problems is the representation of assessment results. Though there exists many methods that can deal with uncertain information, however, they have more or less deficiencies. In this paper, a new representation of uncertain information, called D numbers, is presented. It extends the Dempster-Shafer theory. By using D numbers, a new method is developed for the bridge condition assessment. Compared to these existing methods, the proposed method is simpler and more effective. An illustrative case is given to show the effectiveness of the new method.

AB  - The article is devoted to the determination of the conditions for the creation and development of students' media culture. The theme is relevant since students need the skill to analyze and critically comprehend information from different sources in order to become a successful mid-level specialist. The indicators of developed media culture that are addressed in this article are the following: motivational, conceptual, communicative, operational and creative. The paper presents different views of scholars with respect to the impact of media culture on the society, and particularly on the young adults who study. Summarizing the opinions of scholars it should be noted that media culture influences both social and ideological spheres. Some scholars believe that young adults are particularly influenced by media culture because their learning efficiency in an educational institution greatly depends on the skillful use of modern means of communication.
   The aim of the article is to determine and justify theoretically and practically the characteristic features of the conditions for creation and development of media culture in students. A pedagogical experiment was carried out using the method of systematic approach and the principle of relating theory with practice. The results of this study identify conditions for the creation and development of students' media culture.
   It was revealed that the creation and development of media culture in students implied certain requirements both to the teachers (e.g. skills in the use of information and communication tools, self-improvement, professional development, etc.) as well as to the educational institutions (e.g. availability of the developing educational media cultural environment, establishment of the conditions for creative and productive activity of students in the space of media culture).

AB  - Foraminiferal assemblages from the neritic environment reveal the palaeoecological impact of nutrient types in relation to shore distance and sedimentary setting. Comparatively proximal siliciclastic settings from the Boreal Domain (Brora section. Eastern Scotland) were dominated by inner-shelf primary production in the water column or in sea bottom, while in relatively seawards mixed carbonate-siliciclastic settings from the Western Tethys (Prebetic, Southern Spain), nutrients mainly derived from the inner-shelf source. In both settings, benthic foraminiferal assemblages increased in diversity and proportion of epifauna from eutrophic to oligotrophic conditions. The proximal setting example (Brora Brick Clay Mb.) corresponds to Callovian offshore shelf deposits with a high primary productivity, bottom accumulation of organic matter, and a reduced sedimentation rate for siliciclastics. Eutrophic conditions favoured some infaunal foraminifera. Lately, inner shelf to shoreface transition areas (Fascally Siltstone Mb.), show higher sedimentation rates and turbidity, reducing euphotic-zone range depths and primary production, and then deposits with a lower organic matter content (high-mesotrophic conditions). This determined less agglutinated infaunal foraminifera content and increasing calcitic and aragonitic epifauna, and calcitic opportunists (i.e., Lenticulina). The comparatively distal setting of the Oxfordian example (Prebetic) corresponds to: (i) outer-shelf areas with lower nutrient input (relative oligotrophy) and organic matter accumulation on comparatively firmer substrates (lumpy lithofacies group) showing dominance of calcitic epifaunal foraminifera, and (ii) mid-shelf areas with a higher sedimentation rate and nutrient influx (low-mesotrophic conditions) favouring potentially deep infaunal foraminifers in comparatively unconsolidated and nutrient-rich substrates controlled by instable redox boundary (marl-limestone rhythmite lithofacies).

AB  - This study investigated and evaluated the condition of the existing water conveyance, storage and control infrastructure in the Mooi River Irrigation Scheme (MRIS) and the Tugela Ferry Irrigation Scheme (TFIS), in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. An infrastructure condition assessment (ICA) was undertaken based on inspections and condition scoring or grading. In addition, technical experts were consulted to determine the weights of the structural evaluation criteria using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Furthermore, the fishbone 'Ishikawa' diagram and the relative causal index (RCI) method were used to carry out the root cause analysis (RCA). For RCI, questionnaires were administered to stakeholders to capture their perception of the causal factors. According to the study, the fishbone 'Ishikawa' diagram characterized and identified 23 probable causal factors that led to infrastructure dilapidation. The RCI quantified the causal factors and revealed the converging points between technical experts (te) and the extension workers (ex) regarding causal factors. The converging causal factors were related to maintenance (RCIte = 0.8, RCIex = 0.7), people (RCIte = 0.7, RCIex = 0.7), institutions (RCIte = 0.7, RCIex = 0.6) and the environment (RCIte = 0.8, RCIex = 0.7). The study further revealed that the stakeholders involved had points of divergence on causes of infrastructure decay. Follow-up questionnaires were again administered to discover the reasons for diverging thoughts. The study recommends participatory engagement in process and procedure design for enhanced infrastructure conditions. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop a condition assessment (CA) model for a building's indoor 21 environments and to improve the building's asset management process. Design/methodology/approach The methodology is based on dividing the building into spaces, which are the principal evaluated elements based on the building's indoor environmental quality (IEQ). An evaluation scheme was prepared for the identified factors and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique was used to calculate the relative weight of each space inside the building as well as the contribution of each IEQ factors (IEQFs) in the overall environmental condition of each space inside the building. The multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) was then applied to assess the environmental conditions of the building as a whole and its spaces. An educational building in Canada was evaluated using the developed model. Findings Each space type was found to have its own IEQFs weights, which confirms the hypothesis that the importance and allocation of each IEQF are dependent on the function and tasks carried out in each space. A similar indoor environmental assessment score was calculated using the developed model and the building CA conducted by the facility management team; "89%" was calculated, using K-mean clustering, for the physical and environmental conditions. Originality/value IEQ affects occupants' assessment of their quality of life (QOL). Despite the existence of IEQ evaluation models that correlate the building's IEQ and the occupants' perceived indoor assessments, some limitations have led to the necessity of developing a comprehensive model that integrates all factors and their sub-criteria in an assessment scheme that converts all the indoor environmental factors into objective metrics.

AB  - Genetic and environmental parameters for live weight and condition score have been determined for Holstein cows. Genetic correlations with milk traits were also derived. Monthly records were modelled by cubic splines, while the direct, additive effects of animal and the temporary environment (defined as cow environmental effects within lactations) were fitted as random. Lactation number interacted with monthly trends in cow live weight. Cows lost weight in the early part of the lactation. This reduction in live weight was probably because of a loss in body reserves, as suggested by a lower condition score. Cows gained live weight towards the end of lactation. The ultimate live weight of cows increased with parity because of ongoing growth. The heritability (h(2)) estimate for live weight was high at 0.65 +/- 0.04, albeit still within the expected range. Condition score had a medium h(2) of 0.24 +/- 0.05. Genetic and phenotypic correlations of live weight with milk yield were positive, i.e. 0.19 +/- 0.14 and 0.12 +/- 0.05, respectively, while correlations of condition score with milk yield were negative, i.e. -0.42 +/- 0.15 and -0.17 +/- 0.04, respectively. Although live weight could be used as an indirect indicator of feed intake and efficiency of milk production, other body conformation traits could also be used. There is a need in the South African dairy industry for a selection index based on production parameters and some traits such as live weight, condition score or specific conformation traits. However, a large participation of animals in milk recording and measurement of such traits is a prerequisite for such developments.

AB  - This paper presents a computational model along with a thermal comfort criterion aimed at assisting the design of operating rooms (ORs) from the perspective of meeting suitable flow patterns and thermal comfort conditions for the occupants. The computational model is based on the finite volume method (FVM) to describe the air inside ORs along with the human thermoregulation model implemented in virtual mannequins for thermal comfort. The air model considers turbulent fluid motion, species transport and the conservation of energy, including thermal radiation. The human thermoregulation model incorporates two interacting systems of thermoregulation. Namely, the passive system and the active system. The comfort criterion is based on the effective temperature of body parts which is a more suitable indicator than the commonly utilized predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) for body segments. The focus of the study is placed on the influence that the inlet thermal conditions provided by the air conditioning (AC) system have on the flow pattern and thermal comfort of the occupants. The results show that, for the selected conditions, lower air inlet temperatures than previously reported are required to operate at satisfactory comfort standards. It was also observed that smaller inlet temperatures bring about several improvements in the flow pattern inside the OR such as the size reduction of several recirculation zones (RZs). Nonetheless, smaller inlet temperatures bring about some drawbacks such as the size reduction of the ultra-clean ventilation (UCV) zone and the need of extra air-cooling power.

AB  - Simple Summary
   This review attempts to provide information on the various impacts of heat stress on the production and welfare variables of goats. Goats are predominantly distributed in tropical regions, and hence they are considered a species readily able to survive and produce in these demanding environments. However, the production of goats can be compromised to a degree to survive in harsh environments. Hence, having an in-depth understanding of the various impacts of heat stress on goat production and adaptation may yield important biomarkers to assess welfare in goats. Such efforts may help in the future to breed goats, which could survive and produce optimally under harsh conditions.
   This review attempted to collate and synthesize information on goat welfare and production constraints during heat stress exposure. Among the farm animals, goats arguably are considered the best-suited animals to survive in tropical climates. Heat stress was found to negatively influence growth, milk and meat production and compromised the immune response, thereby significantly reducing goats' welfare under extensive conditions and transportation. Although considered extremely adapted to tropical climates, their production can be compromised to cope with heat stress. Therefore, information on goat adaptation and production performance during heat exposure could help assess their welfare. Such information would be valuable as the farming communities are often struggling in their efforts to assess animal welfare, especially in tropical regions. Broadly three aspects must be considered to ensure appropriate welfare in goats, and these include (i) housing and environment; (ii) breeding and genetics and (iii) handling and transport. Apart from these, there are a few other negative welfare factors in goat rearing, which differ across the production system being followed. Such negative practices are predominant in extensive systems and include nutritional stress, limited supply of good quality water, climatic extremes, parasitic infestation and lameness, culminating in low production, reproduction and high mortality rates. Broadly two types of methodologies are available to assess welfare in goats in these systems: (i) animal-based measures include behavioral measurements, health and production records and disease symptoms; (ii) resources based and management-based measures include stocking density, manpower, housing conditions and health plans. Goat welfare could be assessed based on several indicators covering behavioral, physical, physiological and productive responses. The important indicators of goat welfare include agonistic behavior, vocalization, skin temperature, body condition score (BCS), hair coat conditions, rectal temperature, respiration rate, heart rate, sweating, reduced growth, reduced milk production and reduced reproductive efficiency. There are also different approaches available by which the welfare of goats could be assessed, such as naturalistic, functional and subjective approaches. Thus, assessing welfare in goats at every production stage is a prerequisite for ensuring appropriate production in this all-important species to guarantee optimum returns to the marginal and subsistence farmers.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery has been widely used in remote sensing and photogrammetry for some time. Increasingly often, apart from recording images in the red-green-blue (RGB) range, multispectral images are also recorded. It is important to accurately assess the radiometric quality of UAV imagery to eliminate interference that might reduce the interpretation potential of the images and distort the results of remote sensing analyses. Such assessment should consider the influence of the atmosphere and the seasonal and weather conditions at the time of acquiring the imagery. The assessment of the radiometric quality of images acquired in different weather conditions is crucial in terms of improving the interpretation potential of the imagery and improving the accuracy of determining the indicators used in remote sensing and in environmental monitoring. Until now, the assessment of radiometric quality of UAV imagery did not consider the influence of meteorological conditions at different times of year. This paper presents an assessment of the influence of weather conditions on the quality of UAV imagery acquired in the visible range. This study presents the methodology for assessing image quality, considering the weather conditions characteristic of autumn in Central and Eastern Europe. The proposed solution facilitates the assessment of the radiometric quality of images acquired in the visible range. Using the objective indicator of quality assessment developed in this study, images were classified into appropriate categories, allowing, at a later stage, to improve the results of vegetation indices. The obtained results confirm that the proposed quality assessment methodology enables the objective assessment of the quality of imagery acquired in different meteorological conditions.

AB  - Tillage soil erosion is seen as a great problem in the Mediterranean region and is worsened by the climatic conditions. Previous studies have shown a decrease in biodiversity in arable lands across Europe. Weeds are a major component of biodiversity within agro-ecosystems, but few studies have aimed to associate weed species with soil tillage intensity. We performed an analysis to test the potential short-term effects of different tillage systems on weed species under our study conditions. The emerged weed data were measured, comparing a conventional tillage system with conservational tillage systems (minimum tillage and no tillage) in 2 cropping systems (monoculture wheat and a rotation scheme of barley-legume-wheat-fallow). Compared with the tilled soil, higher weed density and weed species richness were observed in the conservation tillage plots. The weed density and weed species richness in the monoculture system were higher compared with those in the crop rotation system. We used classification and regression trees to analyze the relationship between the soil tillage systems and the weed community, taking into account the climatic conditions. The results indicate that different soil tillage systems produced tree models: Silene vulgaris (L.) was associated with the MT system and high and irregularly distributed rainfall; Hypecoum imberbe Sm. and Hypecoum procumbens (L.) were linked to MT plots with low and well-distributed precipitation rates; and Cardaria draba (L.) was present all years independently of climatic conditions but was never found in the NT system, so its presence could be regarded as an indicator of tillage intensity.

AB  - A 'Report Card', which summarises the current knowledge of the status and trend in land condition in the agricultural areas of the south-west of Western Australia, was published in 2013 by the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia. The Report Card draws on best available evidence from government and industry on the current condition and trend of 10 soil-and water-related natural resource themes relevant to agriculture, and discusses the implications of these results for the agricultural industries. The report also discusses the three main factors driving the performance of the land, namely climate, land characteristics and land management. The first two factors are largely out of the control of land managers, but in a drying and warming climate of the agricultural areas of Western Australia, land-management practices need to be able to respond to these changing conditions.
   The paper briefly explains the methodologies used to assess the seven soil-related themes in the Report Card and summarises the major findings. The results indicate that, for soils, the situation and outlook for our natural resources is mixed. Although there has been progress in some areas, such as managing wind and water erosion, the status and trend in many indicators of resource condition, such as soil acidity, soil compaction and water repellence, are adverse. The predicted growth in global demand for food and fibre brings many opportunities to the Western Australian agri-food sector but also challenges, especially in light of the Report Card findings. One of these challenges is our need to achieve agricultural productivity growth while ensuring our natural resources are healthy and resilient.

AB  - The western winter-spring cohort of Ommastrephes bartramii exhibited dynamic stock level associated with concurrent shifts in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) during 2002-2011. To explore the potential mechanism on regional oceanic conditions related to the large-scale PDO phenomenon affecting O. bartramii stocks, we examined variations in the environmental condition on the spawning ground for recruitment, spatial distribution of fishing effort, and habitat hotspots on the fishing ground during different PDO phases. The PDO was found to be highly correlated with the biophysical environmental conditions on the spawning and fishing grounds of O. bartramii. The suitable spawning zone (SSZ) considered as an indicator of incubation condition was not sufficient to explain the recruitment variability. However, the changing chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration induced variations in feeding condition for squid paralarvae and juveniles, primarily influencing the O. bartramii recruitment. Comparing to the cold PDO phase, high frequency of fishing effort occupied the regions with lower sea surface temperature (SST) and relatively enhanced Chl-a concentration during the warm PDO phase. The location of fishing efforts tended to be intensive and shifted westward and northward in the cold PDO phase. Moreover, the warm PDO yielded prominently enlarged squid habitat hotspots. This study suggests that stock level of western winter-spring cohort of O. bartramii can be explained by the local environmental conditions including the food availability on the spawning ground, SST, and Chl-a concentration on the fishing ground affecting squid spatial distributions, which could be reflected by the PDO climate variability in the Northwest Pacific Ocean.

AB  - Worldwide, the frequencies and magnitudes of hypoxic events in estuarine waters have increased considerably over the past two decades. Fish populations are suitable indicators for the assessment of quality of aquatic ecosystems and often comprise a variety of adaptation systems by triggering oxidants, antioxidants and hypoxia-responsive signaling proteins. Signaling pathway may lead to cell survival or cell death which is fine-tuned by both positive and negative factors, which includes hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1 alpha), heat-shock protein-70 (HSP70), phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (p-JNK1/2) and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1). In the present study, we attempt to determine stress-mediated signaling changes and molecular mechanism behind the cell survival by comparing adipocytes of fish from field hypoxic condition and laboratory-induced hypoxic condition (in vitro hypoxia). Comparison of field and laboratory studies in fish adipocytes showed differential expression of HIF1 alpha, HSP70, p-JNK1/2 and ASK1 with altered oxidants and antioxidants. Further, the results also suggest that in vitro hypoxic conditions mimic field hypoxic conditions. Trends of hypoxia response were same in in vitro hypoxia of control adipocytes as in Ennore estuary, and hypoxia response was more pronounced in the test adipocytes under in vitro hypoxic condition. Results of the present work suggest that hypoxia is the major crusade of water pollutants affecting fish by differential regulation of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins probably through HSP70. This may play a vital role by providing cytoprotection in pollutant-induced stressed fish adipocytes substantiated by the in vitro hypoxic studies.

AB  - Intraspecific feeding choices comprise a large portion of herbivore foraging decisions. Plant resource quality is heterogeneously distributed, affected by nutrient availability and growing conditions. Herbivores navigate landscapes, foraging not only according to food qualities, but also energetic and nutritional demands. We test three non-exclusive foraging hypotheses using the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus): (1) herbivore feeding choices and body conditions respond to intraspecific plant quality variation; (2) high energetic demands mitigate feeding responses; and (3) feeding responses are inflated when nutritional demands are high. We measured black spruce (Picea mariana) nitrogen, phosphorus and terpene compositions, as indicators of quality, within a snowshoe hare trapping grid and found plant growing conditions to explain spruce quality variation (R-2 < 0.36). We then offered two qualities of spruce (H1) from the trapping grid to hares in cafeteria-style experiments and measured their feeding and body condition responses (n = 75). We proxied energetic demands (H2) with ambient temperature and coat insulation (% white coat) and nutritional demands (H3) with the spruce quality (nitrogen and phosphorus content) in home ranges. Hares with the strongest preference for high-quality spruce lost on average 2.2% less weight than hares who ate the least high-quality spruce relative to low-quality spruce. The results supported our energetic predictions as follows: hares in colder temperatures and with less-insulative coats (lower % white) consumed more spruce and were less selective towards high-quality spruce. Collectively, we found variation in plant growing conditions within herbivore home ranges substantial enough to affect herbivore body conditions, but energetic stats mediate plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Wheat breeding programs often have a generation of intense selection among space-planted individuals. An ultimate goal is always high yield potential of genotypes when transferred to densely seeded conditions. The goal of this experiment was to identify traits that may be selected in spaced-plants that are correlated with high yield potential under densely seeded conditions. We tested 20 spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes under three planting densities over a 2-yr period under both irrigated and nonirrigated conditions. Several traits were correlated with yield potential within seeding densities, including flag leaf width, grain fill period, and days needed to reach Haun growth stage 5. Additionally, genotype performance in spaced-planted versus densely seeded conditions was highly correlated for many of the measured traits. In particular, genotype performance for grain yield was significantly correlated between the planting densities (r = 0.83). Additionally, flag leaf width and development at Haun growth stage 5 were highly correlated between planting densities on the basis of mean performance over all four environments. These traits were also highly correlated when comparing individual space-planted environments to the mean genotype performance in the densely seeded environments. Genotype performance for grain fill period was highly correlated between planting densities on the basis of means of all four environments (r = 0.87). These correlations were lower, though generally significant, when each of the four space-planted environments was considered independently. In general, data from this study suggest that selection among space-planted genotypes for wide flag leaf, rapid growth to Haun stage 5, and long grain fill period may result in increased yield potential in densely seeded conditions.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to determine if biodegradation of trichloroethylene (TCE) can occur in previously uncontaminated ground water in saturated fractured saprolite (highly weathered material derived from sedimentary rocks). Two undisturbed columns (0.23 m diameter by 0.25 m long) of fractured saprolite were collected from -2 m depth at an uncontaminated site on the Oak Ridge Reservation, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Natural, uncontaminated ground water from the site, which was degassed and spiked with dissolved phase TCE, was continuously pumped through one column containing the natural microbial communities (the biotic column). In a second column, the microorganisms were inhibited and the dissolved phase TCE was added under aerobic conditions (dissolved oxygen conditions > 2 ppm). In effluent from the biotic column, reducing conditions rapidly developed and evidence of anaerobic biodegradation of TCE, by the production of cDCE, first appeared similar to31 days after addition of TCE. Reductive dechlorination of TCE occurred after iron-reducing conditions were established and about the same time that sulfate reduction began. There was no evidence of methanogenesis. Analyses using polymerase chain reaction with specific primers sets detected the bacteria Geothrix, Geobacter, and Desulfbococcus-Desulfonema-Desulfosarcina in the effluent of the biotic column, but no methanogens. The presence of these bacteria is consistent with iron- and sulfate-reducing conditions. In the inhibited column, there were no indicators of TCE degradation. Natural organic matter that occurs in the saprolite and ground water at the site is the most likely primary electron donor for supporting reductive dechlorination of TCE. The relatively rapid appearance of indicators of TCE dechlorination suggests that these processes may occur even in settings where low oxygen conditions occur seasonally due to changes in the water table.

AB  - Body condition (i.e., the amount of the energy stored in organs and tissues) is a key parameter that has been related with health, reproductive performance and density of wild ungulates including the wild boar (Sus scrofa). In this wild pig, a reference method to assess body condition has not yet been agreed and different procedures have been used in recent literature. The aim of this work was to generate an easy and reliable method based on biometrical measurements and with the ability to predict body fat in live or die boars. For this, a total of 207 hunted wild boar from three Spanish populations with contrasting food availability were included in this study. Sex, age, biometrical parameters (body weight, total length and chest girth) and body condition indicators (brisket and rump fat thickness, kidney fat index (KFI), ratio between chest girth-total length and scaled mass index) were assessed for each animal. A boosted regression trees (BRT) approach was carried out to find models based on age, sex and biometrical features that predicted brisket fat thickness in the studied animals. BRT models including sex, body weight, total length and chest girth as explanatory variables were able to predict brisket fat thickness in wild boar (68-73% of deviance explained). These models were not influenced by the location of sampling and their predictive values showed a good agreement with real brisket fat thickness (94.1-95.6). Predictive values obtained in BRT models from each area also agreed with food availability suggesting this is a valid indicator of body condition of wild boar in a broad range of environmental conditions.

AB  - The relationship between different degrees of intraspecific crowding of reedfrog tadpoles and their physiological responses to a deterioration of the natal pond water quality was examined under laboratory conditions. Tadpoles that were reared at a lower density metamorphosed significantly earlier than those raised at a higher density. As density increases, the average body length at metamorphosis decreases. However, at low tadpole density, a significantly higher diversity of body size classes among freshly metamorphosed froglets was observed than under more crowded conditions. Mortality increased during metamorphic climax and was inversely correlated with the tadpole density.
   In ephemeral ponds, an accumulation of nitrogenous wastes from metabolic processes and/or a concentration by evaporation in prolonged rainless periods can pose a considerable chemical stress to reedfrog tadpoles. Hyperolius viridiflavus ommatostictus responded to an increasing ammonia concentration with an activity increase of the ornithine cycle (intensified urea synthesis). In contrast, Hyperolius marmoratus taeniatus exhibited a strong tolerance against high ammonia levels.
   A deterioration of the natal pond water quality caused a v. ommatostictus and a; v. nitidulus tadpoles to adjust to harsher climatic conditions at the time of metamorphosis. This physiological preadjustment enabled the froglets to start feeding and growing immediately after metamorphosis even at low air humidity and rare precipitation events. In contrast, froglets that were raised in daily refreshed water exhibited high mortality rates if subjected to identical conditions. As one possible indicator of the actual climatic conditions prevailing in the surrounding terrestrial habitat, fluctuations in the water ammonia level are discussed.

AB  - We aimed to verify whether a low number of relevant animal-based indicators was able to discriminate 33 semi-intensive (grazing during the day and confinement during the night with access to an outdoor paddock; S-INT) and 8 intensive farms (permanent confinement with access to an outdoor paddock; INT) located in the Mexican semi-desert. In addition, we implemented the resource-based assessment scheme Animal Needs Index (ANI) with the identified animal-based indicators to compare the overall level of welfare in INT and S-INT. In particular, we used a protocol made up of 2 parts. The first comprised 4 evaluation sheets (locomotion, flooring, environment, management) and resource-based indicators derived from ANI, and the second one comprised a set of validated animal-based measures focusing on physical conditions and clinical signs of disease derived from the Animal Welfare Indicators scheme and reported in 2 additional sheets. The scoring system was also derived from ANI, with partial scores for each sheet to be summed to obtain the total score. A total of 1,116 dairy goats were assessed. All the observations and recordings were performed by an expert veterinarian evaluator assisted by an auxiliary, and longevity was retrieved from the farm records. The prevalence of animals displaying dirtiness, ocular discharge, abscesses, and claw overgrowth were higher in INT than in S-INT. Disbudding was routinely performed in INT only. Therefore, scurs, indicating improper disbudding, were recorded only in INT. In addition, the longevity of goats raised in S-INT was higher than in INT. Conversely, the prevalence of goats affected by anemia (i.e., FAMACHA scores >2) or lean (i.e., body condition score <2) tended to be higher in S-INT than in INT. No significant differences between the 2 groups of farms were detected for wounds, nasal discharge, integument alterations, fecal soiling, uterine prolapse, and subclinical mastitis. The results obtained using only animal-based measures were confirmed when resource-based variables were also included in the assessment, as 3 out of 6 sheets of the evaluation scheme (i.e., flooring, environment, and health-physical conditions) were scored higher in the S-INT than in the INT. As a consequence, the total score was also higher for S-INT than for INT. We conclude that the selected set of validated animal-based measures was able to discriminate between farms from different production systems. In particular, higher welfare levels were observed in S-INT farms, where the animals were allowed to spend most of the day on natural pasture, compared with INT farms, where the animals were constantly confined. Nevertheless, a certain degree of improvement should also be promoted in terms of anemia and body condition in S-INT farms.

AB  - Assessment of rooftop rainwater harvesting (RRWH) quality and suitability requires detail and reliable information on roofs. Characterization of roof surface conditions affects the quality of harvested rainwater. Nevertheless, the implementation of the system requires improvement in terms of the roof detection techniques to ensure the roof of the building is selected appropriately. Thus, the classification techniques need to be optimized to detect roof materials and roof surface conditions (new or old) with high accuracy. This study aimed to produce high precision detailed roof materials and roof surface conditions map with using high-resolution remote sensing imagery, WorldView-3 (WV3) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Three different fusion methods; layer stacking (LS), Gram-Schmidt (GS) and principal components spectral sharpening (PCSS) were explored and their performances were compared to improve the spatial and spectral richness of the image. Subsequently, the roof materials and roof surface conditions classes which include old concrete, new concrete, old metal, new metal, old asbestos and new asbestos had been discriminated by employing support vector machine (SVM) and the rule-based technique known as a decision tree (DT). Generally, generated rule-sets present a higher overall accuracy with 87%, 72% and 66% for LS, GS and PCSS, respectively. For SVM classifier, the maximum accuracy recorded for LS, PCSS and GS were 70%, 63% and 43% respectively. Therefore, rule-based classification via LS fusion technique was utilized to identify suitable rooftops for the development of harvested rainwater system in the urban area. Findings indicate that the degradation status of a roof in heterogenous urban environments could be determined from satellite observation and the quality of roof-based harvested rainwater affected by roofing materials and roofing surface conditions can be analysed effectively.

AB  - Defining reference conditions is central to identifying environmental effects of anthropogenic activities. Using a watershed approach, we quantified reference conditions for benthic algal communities and their relations to physico-chemical conditions in rivers in the South Nahanni River watershed, NWT, Canada, in 2008 and 2009. We also compared the ability of three descriptors that vary in terms of analytical costs to define algal community structure based on relative abundances of (i) all algal taxa, (ii) only diatom taxa, and (iii) photosynthetic pigments. Ordination analyses showed that variance in algal community structure was strongly related to gradients in environmental variables describing water physico-chemistry, stream habitats, and sub-watershed structure. Water physico-chemistry and local watershed-scale descriptors differed significantly between algal communities from sites in the Selwyn Mountain ecoregion compared to sites in the Nahanni-Hyland ecoregions. Distinct differences in algal community types between ecoregions were apparent irrespective of whether algal community structure was defined using all algal taxa, diatom taxa, or photosynthetic pigments. Two algal community types were highly predictable using environmental variables, a core consideration in the development of Reference Condition Approach (RCA) models. These results suggest that assessments of environmental impacts could be completed using RCA models for each ecoregion. We suggest that use of algal pigments, a high through-put analysis, is a promising alternative compared to more labor-intensive and costly taxonomic approaches for defining algal community structure.

AB  - Eutrophication of water constitutes a serious threat to global water quality. Light intensity and water disturbance are important factors affecting the growth of algae and the release of algal toxins. In this study, algal growth indicators, algal enzyme systems, and algal toxin release in Microcystis aeruginosa under different light intensities and water disturbances were determined. The results showed that 2500 lx and 120 rpm were the optimal conditions for the growth of M. aeruginosa. The growth of algal cells was inhibited by high light intensity and high water disturbance. However, the optimal conditions for algal growth were not favorable conditions for the release of algal toxin. The highest concentration of microcystin-LR (MC-LR), observed at 4500 lx and 80 rpm, was 198.1 mu g/L, whereas the highest single cell toxin production reached up to 10.49 x 10(-9) mu g/cell at 7000 lx and 120 rpm. Redundancy analysis results showed that the concentration of MC-LR was positively correlated with algal cell density and antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and malondialdehyde [MDA]) and negatively correlated with the total nitrogen and total phosphorus consumption rates and MDA. Single cell toxin production was negatively correlated with algal cell density and antioxidant enzyme activity but positively correlated with MDA content. Practitioner Points There was an optimal water disturbance condition for algae growth affected by the light intensity. Optimal conditions for algae cell growth are not necessarily the optimal conditions for algal toxin release. Enzyme indicators have correlation with the release of algae toxins and the growth of algae cells.

AB  - Interpretation of soil data is necessary to help predict their ecological potentials, limitations, problems, and management needs. We tested the knowledge expressed in taxonomic systems for its ability to be applied in the description and generalization of soil dynamics and behavior. The general hypothesis established for this purpose was "soil subtypes are proxies for ecological processes". To facilitate the detection of process intensity and to obtain well-expressed pedogenetic features, we selected a soil catena from an environment known for its severe weathering conditions. The 'Wildmooswald' catena consists of eight profiles and is situated in the Central Black Forest in South-West Germany. We organized our investigation in the following manner: (i) We ascertained that the catenary soil sequence had a regular pattern (ii) We confirmed that the soils were connected among each other by a physical link which resulted in lateral subsurface matter translocation. (iii) We investigated the extent to which pedogenetic processes were expressed in terms of taxonomic criteria. (iv) We determined whether a given ecological feature, like trace gas emissions was reflected in taxonomic categories. We found that the 'Wildmooswald' soils were linked to each other by a lateral subsurface transport of solutes. We identified redox conditions and an abundance of chelating organic compounds as the main factors in the mobilization/immobilization of elements. Hydrological conditions were the dominant factor of weathering and thus, soil formation, which determined both the intensity of mobilization processes and the intensity of the lateral subsurface transport. Lateral down-slope water movement was identified as the physical link between the soils. Depletion zones were the mid-catena members, where redox conditions led to the removal of manganese and iron. Organic layers, which have accumulated in these soils as a consequence of reducing conditions, acted as sources of dissolved organic carbon. The terminal catena element represents an accumulation zone for Mn, Fe, and dissolved organic carbon. Based on this observation we concluded that, for the greater part of the Wildmooswald soils, taxonomic soil type indeed reflects pedogenetic processes as well as soil matter dynamics. Trace gas time emission patterns, as well as trace gas source strength, which serves as an indicator for short-term ecological dynamics, were found to vary within a soil unit-specific range for either N2O and CH4. We conclude that for the greater part of the 'Wildmooswald' catena, soil subtypes indeed recognizes and combines pedogenetic processes and soil matter dynamics. The functions and dynamics prevalent at the terminal catena member were not represented adequately by neither the German classification system, World Reference Base nor Soil Taxonwomy. This fact should indicate that a review of the classification systems is necessary both generally for their ability to provide functional soil information and specifically for soils showing accumulation of matter at pedon scale.

AB  - Inflow conditions play a key role in the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of wind environment. Taking the micro wind climate of Hong Kong Kowloon Bay costal town as a research object, two kinds of widely used inflow condition determination methods are adopted to test their performances. One is to fit the velocity profile into the empirical (logarithmic/exponential) law, hereafter referred to as the Fitted Empirical Profile (FEP) method. The other is to interpolate the outflow velocities and turbulence properties from a pre-simulation of the upstream region, hereafter referred to as the Interpolated Multiscale Profile (IMP) method. The GIS data of this mountainous/urban area are digitalized and simplified into the CFD geometry model. Computational treatments for numerical algorithms, domain size, grid systems and boundary conditions are carefully configured according to the published CFD Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs). By validating with one year of real scale wind measurement data from two meteorological stations, it is found that these two inflow conditions lead to considerably different results. Having less consideration for the blockage effects of terrain/buildings, the FEP method tends to predict higher wind speed. As more thermal effects are removed by increasing wind speed thresholds, the results of IMP method demonstrate an incremental agreement with the measurement data. Finally, the validated simulation results are applied to the spatial representativeness assessment of two meteorological stations. Both the point-to-surface consistency indicator and point-centered semivariance are employed. The results show that the meteorological stations show a good representation within a range of 400 m.

AB  - The research conducted in static and dynamic conditions was aimed at determining the vulnerability of soluble compounds contained in ashes to leaching with the objective to define the quantity and type of contaminants which may affect soil, ground and surface waters in the case of ash utilization or disposal oil land surface.
   Silica, aluminum and iron oxides are the basic compounds of fly ashes while calcium, magnesium, potassium as well as other oxides occur in significantly less amounts. Taking into account die chemical composition recalculated into SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, SO3, the following 3 categories of ashes have been recognized in Poland: silica, aluminum and calcium ashes.
   Solubility tests of the Polish fly-ashes showed that depending on the ash category, 0,5% (aluminium ashes) up to 10% and more (calcium ash) of their mass may dissolve in water.
   In different conditions of the leaching processes, the vulnerability of fly ashes to the release water soluble compounds contained in them may vary. The main substances leached from the analyzed ashes (in descending order) were sulphates, calcium, sodium and chloride ions, while the trace elements included chromium, cadmium and lead. The leachability of other elements was insignificant.
   Eluates from the investigated fly-ashes were characterised by an elevated reaction and the content of some ions (SO4-2, Cr3+, Cd2+, Pb2+) exceeding the permissible concentrations compared to the standards for wastewater discharged to waters or soil, which in consequence may lead to a negative impact on the water environment in the vicinity of the disposal sites.
   A comprehensive environmental impact analysis has been made based on the effective legal regulations (including Geological and Mining Law, Waste Act and its executive regulations). Doubts have been raised if determining the potential risk to the environment based on the leachability test is sufficient as it does not reflect the volume of the leached substances under natural conditions. Tests conducted in dynamic conditions showed that the total load of the leached substances was significantly higher compared to the leachability test data. The dynamic method (alternative I and 11) simulates the course of the leaching processes taking place in natural conditions and allows foreseeing the concentration distribution the leached contaminants in a given time.
   The conducted research proved the real-time dynamic leaching method more reliable in conducting a preliminary environmental impact assessment.
   Also as a result of the studies the thesis has been confirmed that fly ashes are vulnerable to the release of soluble compounds contained in them and thus show some negative tendencies in their impact on the environment. Disposal of fly ashes in landfills or their underground storage in mines may cause degradation of surface and groundwaters due to the penetration of the leachable compounds from waste in the areas of its disposal.

AB  - The life history of North American Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is characterized by extensive round-trip migrations between freshwater rearing habitats and marine feeding grounds off the coasts of Canada and Greenland. Growth is rapid during the marine migration, and growth rate and condition factor may be indicators of salmon health during this period. Growth data were evaluated from a tag-recovery program conducted from 1969 to 1991 using hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon smolts released in the Penobscot River, Maine, U.S.A. Information from recaptures of 3167 salmon that were at large in the marine environment for 1month to 3yr was analyzed. Length-weight measurements coupled with time-at-large data were used to estimate von Bertalanffy and allometric growth parameters specific to the marine phase. Variations in growth and condition factor in relation to smolt age, release date, and temperature conditions in the northwest Atlantic were also examined. The von Bertalanffy k parameter declined with ordinal release date, indicating faster growth rates during the first year of smolts released earlier in the spring. The 2-yr-old smolts had a larger k than 1-yr-old smolts, although 1-yr-old smolts grew to a larger asymptotic size. Sea surface temperature had variable effects on growth parameters and condition factor, with temperature at the beginning of the migration and in overwintering habitat during the first year at sea having the greatest influence on length-weight relationships. Determining the mechanisms that influence growth of individuals during the marine phase will help elucidate the factors responsible for historic growth trends, establishing a baseline for current research.

AB  - How the interaction between the brain and immune system takes place has not been clearly defined. Because multiple changes are occurring simultaneously in all organ systems (eg., cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, reproductive, renal, respiratory, immune, CNS), how many single systems interacts with the brain becomes extraordinarily difficult to understand. The problem boils down to developing an approach that not only allows one to study the whole organism and define the mediators of the interacting systems, bur also permit one to establish the connection and physiologic relevance of the responses that are being evaluated.
   Conditioning, a phenomenon made popular by the work of Pavlov (1906, 1927), may provide insight into the pathways of communication between the brain and possibly any organ system of the body. Conditioning allows one to separate the afferent from the efferent circuits. That is, signals from the immune system to the CNS (IS --> CNS) can be effectively separated from signals from the CNS to immune system (CNS --> IS). This permits one to study each pathway individually. Simple, single association trial models to condition fever, natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) activities have been developed to evaluate the pathways. Single trial learning is not new. Pavlov has observed that "The electric buzzer set going before administration of food established a conditioned alimentary reflex after only a single combination," whereas the reverse order of presentation failed to condition the animal (Pavlov 1927 p. 27). Thus, conditioning can be used to train the brain to activate the immune system and other organ systems participating in the response. During the course of the conditioned response, presumably the CNS via the hypothalamus integrates in a cohesive orderly fashion all input and output signals and coordinates the responses made by the brain to the organ systems.
   The odor of camphor, the conditioned stimulus (CS) can be associated with the response produced by an unconditioned stimulus (US). The unconditioned stimuli used are poly I:C to raise fever and nonimmunospecific NK cell activity or alloantigens to raise immunospecific CTL activity. The unconditioned stimulus serves only as a means to activate the immune system and unbalance the homeostasis so that a transient but new bidirectional communication loop can be established between the immune system and the CNS (IS <-> CNS). The expression of the conditioned response (i.e., elevation of fever, NK cell, or CTL activity) induced with the CS (odor stimulus) is an outcome of neural activity (CNS --> IS). This infers that during conditioning. the signals generated by the CS and US imprints a neural pathway located within the central nervous system and leaves behind a CS/US memory of the association. The immune activity (NK cell or CTL activity) which is modulated indicate that the memory pathway was activated in the brain of the animal expressing the conditioned response. The immune cells that are modulated can be considered to be casual bystander cells. These cells however must be in the proper (ready) state of activation to receive salient signals from the brain. Along with changes in the indicator cell population, other complex physiological processes are altered by the brain via sympathetic and neuroendocrine pathways to raise the fever response. These observations suggest that the physiological changes which are being evaluated such as fever, NK cell or CTL activities or perhaps blood pressure, heart rate, fat metabolism, oxygen consumption serve only as indicators (readouts). and infer that the CNS has made a coordinated reply in response to the CS signal.

The larval growth rate, triacylgycerol (TAG) and sterol (ST) content, and the width of the marginal otolith increments were determined on the same individual larva as indicators of nutritional condition. The TAG content increased-during the ontogenetic larval development up to an elevated value corresponding to the end of metamorphosis. During metamorphosis, sole larvae continued to accumulate TAG and to increase in length. Seasonal and yearly variations of growth and nutritional condition of sole larvae at the onset of metamorphosis were more important than spatial variations. Analysis of larval growth showed that, during each cruise, the faster growing larvae were generally those with the highest TAG content (and TAG : ST ratio). In 1993, larvae began to metamorphose earlier and their growth (both larval growth and recent growth) were significantly higher than in 1992. Their relatively low nutritional condition, however, seemed to be the result of a low accumulation of TAG. Sole metamorphosis occurs Without growth arrest and the majority of the larvae during this phase are judged to be in good nutritional condition (TAG: ST ratio > 1). In the Bay of Biscay, metamorphosis does not seem to be a critical period in the life cycle of the sole. It is suggested that larvae originating from different cohorts probably have the same chance of survival during or just after metamorphosis when they enter the benthic environment.

AB  - Reliable animal models are invaluable for monitoring the extent of pollution in the aquatic environment. In this study, we demonstrated the potential of huORFZ, a novel transgenic zebrafish line that harbors a human upstream open reading frame of the chop gene fused with GFP reporter, as an animal model for monitoring environmental pollutants and stress-related cellular processes. When huORFZ embryos were kept under normal condition, no leaked GFP signal could be detected. When treated with hazardous chemicals, including heavy metals and endocrine-disrupting chemicals near their sublethal concentrations (LC50), huORFZ embryos exhibited different tissue-specific GFP expression patterns. For further analysis, copper (Cu2+), cadmium (Cd2+) and Chlorpyrifos were applied. Cu2+ triggered GFP responses in skin and muscle, whereas Cd2+ treatment triggered GFP responses in skin, olfactory epithelium and pronephric ducts. Moreover, fluorescence intensity, as exhibited by huORFZ embryos, was dose-dependent. After surviving treated embryos were returned to normal condition, survival rates, as well as TUNEL signals, returned to pretreatment levels with no significant morphological defects observed. Such results indicated the reversibility of treatment conditions used in this study, as long as embryos survived such conditions. Notably, GFP signals decreased along with recovery, suggesting that GFP signaling of huORFZ embryos likely reflected the overall physiological condition of the individual. To examine the performance of the huORFZ line under real-world conditions, we placed huORFZ embryos in different river water samples. We found that the huORFZ embryos correctly detected the presence of various kinds of pollutants. Based on these findings, we concluded that such uORF(chop) based system can be integrated into a first-line water alarm system monitoring the discharge of hazardous pollutants.

AB  - Euryhaline tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus can reproduce in freshwater and in seawater. Regulation of sperm motility appears to be modulated during acclimation of the fish from freshwater to seawater, being independent of extracellular Ca2+ in freshwater and dependent on extracellular Ca2+ in seawater. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, sperm of seawater-acclimated tilapia (SWT) showed motility even in a hypertonic environment, whereas sperm of freshwater-acclimated tilapia (FWT) were not motile. The Ca2+ indicator, fluo-3, revealed that intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, of SWT sperm increased only in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ in hypotonic or hypertonic conditions. Since the increased [Ca2+]i in FWT sperm occurred under hypotonic conditions via intracellular Ca2+ stores, it is likely that tilapia modulate their source of increasing [Ca2+]i from intracellular stores (in FWT sperm) to extracellular stores (in SWT sperm). Experiments using demembranated sperm revealed that Ca2+ is necessary for activation of motility, suggesting that Ca2+ plays a key role in motility regulation in SWT sperm. We detected three phosphoproteins associated with the activation of sperm motility. Serine and threonine residues of two proteins of 15 kDa and 18 kDa became dephosphorylated in hypotonic conditions but remained phosphorylated in hypertonic conditions, suggesting that these protein phosphorylations were not only related to motility activation under hypertonic conditions but also resistant to osmotic pressure. The threonine residue(s) of a 41 kDa protein was also phosphorylated in dry sperm, even in FWT sperm in motility-feasible hypotonic conditions. It is likely that acclimation of the motility apparatus is associated with modulation of the flow of Ca2+ to increase [Ca2+]i and protein phosphorylation.

AB  - Large-scale geographical variation in phenotypic traits within species is often correlated to local environmental conditions and population density. Such phenotypic variation has recently been shown to also be influenced by genetic structuring of populations. In ungulates, large-scale geographical variation in phenotypic traits, such as body mass, has been related to environmental conditions and population density, but little is known about the genetic influences. Research on the genetic structure of moose suggests two distinct genetic lineages in Norway, structured along a north-south gradient. This corresponds with many environmental gradients, thus genetic structuring provides an additional factor affecting geographical phenotypic variation in Norwegian moose. We investigated if genetic structure explained geographical variation in body mass in Norwegian moose while accounting for environmental conditions, age and sex, and if it captured some of the variance in body mass that previously was attributed to environmental factors. Genetic structuring of moose was the most important variable in explaining the geographic variation in body mass within age and sex classes. Several environmental variables also had strong explanatory power, related to habitat diversity, environmental seasonality and winter harshness. The results suggest that environmental conditions, landscape characteristics, and genetic structure should be evaluated together when explaining large-scale patterns in phenotypic characters or life history traits. However, to better understand the role of genetic and environmental effects on phenotypic traits in moose, an extended individual-based study of variation in fitness-related characters is needed, preferably in an area of convergence between different genetic lineages.

AB  - Central air conditioning is the main energy-consuming equipment in modern large-scale commercial buildings. Its energy consumption generally accounts for more than 60% of the electricity load of an entire building, and there is a rising trend. Focusing on reducing central air conditioning energy consumption is a first priority to achieve energy savings in modern large-scale commercial buildings. To study the main influencing factors of central air conditioning energy consumption in large shopping malls, in-depth collection and analysis of energy consumption data of Shenzhen Tian-hong shopping mall were considered, and the impact of factors such as the basic composition of central air conditioning, time, and Shenzhen weather on the energy consumption of shopping malls was considered. The most representative Buji Rainbow store of the Rainbow Group is used as the research object. The influencing factors of central air conditioning on its energy consumption are divided into air conditioning pumps, host 1-1, host 1-2, host 2-1, and host 2-2. The power consumption of the freezer and the eight impact indicators of time and weather in Shenzhen were constructed using Pearson correlation coefficients and a long short-term memory neural network method to construct a regression model of the energy consumption prediction of the mall building. The average relative deviation between the predicted energy consumption values and the measured energy consumption values is less than 10%, which indicates that the main influencing factors selected in this paper can better explain the energy consumption of the mall, and the obtained energy consumption prediction model has high accuracy.

AB  - As a part of an ongoing investigation of the use of isoelectric focusing (IEF) in microfluidic devices, pH gradients were electrochemically formed and optically quantified in microfluidic channels using acid-base indicators. The microchannels consisted of two parallel 40-mm-long electrodes with an interelectrode gap of 2.54 mm; top and bottom transparent windows were separated by 0.2 mm. Gradients in pH were formed as a result of the electrochemical decomposition of water at an applied potential not higher than 2.5 V to avoid generation of gas bubbles. Solutions contained low concentrations of a single buffer. The stability of the pH gradients and their sensitivity to changes in initial conditions were investigated under static (nonflow) conditions. Isoelectric focusing of sample biological analytes, bovine hemoglobin and bovine serum albumin, was performed to illustrate the potential of "microfluidic transverse IEF " for use in continuous concentration and separation systems.

AB  - Vegetation with Cardaminopsis petraea was sampled by phytosociological releves at almost all the known Czech sites, and characterized by indicator values, influence of potential direct solar irradiation, mid bedrock type with the aid of multivariate methods. It has been declared that C. petraea prefers open natural or seminatural drier to mesophilous habitats without some preference to the bedrock. It occupies habitats with various slopes, but it prefers more extreme slants and northerly exposed slopes. The classification and ordination methods showed clear distinction between Moravian and Bohemian habitats. Apart from other types, in Bohemia this species occurs uniquely in acidophilous rock communities, whereas in Moravia it grows uniquely within calcareous grasslands. Relictness of the species was discussed in relation to the specific site conditions (light supply, disturbance regime, and geographical isolation) and to the occurrence of other rare taxa and habitats. Occurrence oil some man-made habitats was also observed.

AB  - The functional importance of bacteria and fungi in terrestrial systems is recognized widely. However, microbial population, community, and functional measurement endpoints change rapidly and across very short spatial scales. Measurement endpoints of microbes tend to be highly responsive to typical fluxes of temperature, moisture, oxygen, and many other noncontaminant factors. Functional redundancy across broad taxonomic groups enables wild swings in community composition without remarkable change in rates of decomposition or community respiration. Consequently, it is exceedingly difficult to relate specific microbial activities with indications of adverse and unacceptable environmental conditions. Moreover, changes in microbial processes do not necessarily result in consequences to plant and animal populations or communities, which in the end are the resources most commonly identified as those to be protected. Therefore, unless more definitive linkages are made between specific microbial effects and an adverse condition for typical assessment endpoint species, microbial endpoints will continue to have limited use in risk assessments; they will not drive the process as primary assessment endpoints.

AB  - The study of the microclimate is a fundamental prerequisite of cultural heritage restoration strategy, as the durability of the interventions strongly depends on the environmental conditions. Before the restoration of the frescoes of the apse, seriously degraded, the microclimate in the Capilla Mayor of the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral was monitored continuously for one year to assess the main environmental risks and elaborate a preventive conservation plan. The main natural and anthropic factors affecting the microclimate of the Capilla were identified, as well as their relevance and the associated risk of damage to the frescoes. In particular, the thermo-hygrometric values measured close to the vault were not fully in compliance with respect to the ranges indicated in literature for the conservation of the frescoes. Finally, solutions were suggested to improve the environmental conditions in the Capilla, thus reducing further damage and enhancing the durability of the frescoes after the planned restoration.

AB  - Soil degradation assessment is important to perform restoration actions, helping to identify priority areas for its attention. However, common assessment methods exclude the participation of landowners, even though they are decision makers on land use and management. The aim of the current study was to generate information that supports decision making for the implementation of soil restoration actions. A participatory methodology was applied for the characterization of degraded areas in five livestock farms of the Mapimi Biosphere Reserve. Results show that 52 % of the 275 evaluated places have regular to priority condition. The main physical indicator of susceptibility to erosion was vegetation cover, which is being affected because of the high number of livestock located in watering places (2,802 hectares per watering place). When action research methodologies are used for social, physical and economic conditions of the protected natural area, participatory planning is workable in soil restoration affected by erosion.

AB  - The qualitative deterioration of the residential space destined to the population of low income in the mains cities of Colombia leads to reflect on the logics of configuration that occur in that territory and its form of evaluation. The nature of the model of the city implanted, its form of production and occupation of the land, has generated a scenario of necessity, deficiency and fragmentation. An analytical look at the factors that determine this quality allows us to approach an evaluation methodology about the conditions of those territories. The objective is to develop a technical proposal to identify the formal aspects of social housing and the environment. For this, a set of indicators based on political regulation, legal instruments and national and international measurement initiatives on the quality conditions of social housing are explored. Research finding concludes with a complex task of limiting the term of quality at the urban level and formulating the set of parameters that define it.

AB  - Just as growth mixture models are useful with single-phase longitudinal data, multiphase growth mixture models can be used with multiple-phase longitudinal data. One of the practically important issues in single- and multiphase growth mixture models is the sample size requirements for accurate estimation. In a Monte Carlo simulation study, the sample sizes required for using these models are investigated under various theoretical and realistic conditions. In particular, the relationship between the sample size requirement and the number of indicator variables is examined, because the number of indicators can be relatively easily controlled by researchers in many multiphase data collection settings such as ecological momentary assessment. The findings not only provide tangible information about required sample sizes under various conditions to help researchers, but they also increase understanding of sample size requirements in single- and multiphase growth mixture models.

AB  - Impacts on the reproductive health of wild fish are thought to be suitable early-warning tools indicating contamination of surface waters with endocrine-disrupting compounds. Ecotoxicological assessment of these field observations depends on the availability of reliable biomarkers to enable a discrimination of natural variations of reproductive functions from anthropogenic impacts.
   Roach and perch were caught at eight sampling sites by electrofishing twice a year in summer (July-September) and late autumn/winter (November-December) over a 2-year period. The sites are characterized by different degrees of anthropogenic impact and are situated within the greater Upper Rhine catchment. Age growths, parasitization and gonadal histology of more than 3,000 fish were examined.
   The two dominant fish species in German surface waters perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) and roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) differ considerably regarding their suitability for biomonitoring. Even in pristine habitats, perch show several variants of sex differentiation in terms of (1) the time of first sexual maturation, (2) the course of seasonal gonadal recrudescence, and (3) the occurrence of heterologous germ cells (testes ova). A statistically significant elevated proportion of males were observed in fish obtained from a TBT-contaminated marina and suppression of gonadal ripening was observed in females caught in a sewage-contaminated brook. Both effects appear to be due to chemical contamination. The only "natural" alteration of sex differentiation in roach was related to parasitization with Ligula intestinalis (Eucestoda, Pseudophyllidea). Other deviations from the normal pattern of sex differentiation were (1) suppression of ovarian ripening and (2) asynchronic seasonal gonadal recrudescence. These are strong indicators of an anthropogenically induced impact on reproductive health. Feminization phenomena were not observed at either the individual or the population level.
   Interpretation of field monitoring results concerning reproductive health requires large numbers of samples and detailed knowledge of the natural plasticity of sex differentiation in the species under investigation. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the plasticity of sex differentiation in perch is indispensable to enable perch to be used as a bioindicator.
   Deviation from the strict and probably endogenous control of sex differentiation in roach is a strong and unequivocal warning signal.
   The subject of fish monitoring should be addressed in the context of a broader spectrum of potential risks. Seasonal and ontogenetic integrity of gonadal development and recrudescence are potent biomarkers, provided the natural process is well documented for the species under investigation.

AB  - Reliable methods for assessing the ecological status of degraded rivers are essential for evaluating restoration efforts in lotic habitats. Several methods are based on biological indicators, such as benthic macroinvertebrates. The Hester-Dendy multi-plate sampler is a commonly used tool for sampling macroinvertebrates, but its performance under different environmental conditions is not well understood. In a laboratory experiment, we assessed if fluctuating and increasing water velocity influences the performance of Hester-Dendy samplers, by studying colonization of the samplers in relation to a pre-determined composition of benthic macroinvertebrates. Biodiversity (Shannon-Wiener index) of colonizing macroinvertebrates was higher in a constant than in a fluctuating flow treatment, but there was no effect on the number of colonizing individuals. The results suggest a potential bias in the interpretation of biodiversity data from sites with sub-daily flow changes, for example, downstream of hydropeaking power plants.

AB  - Ammonia is released in the environment by many industries and other human activities. The major quantifiable sources of ammonia released to aquatic ecosystems across Canada are municipal wastewater treatment plants, at an estimated total quantity of 62,000 tonnes per year. Given the sources of ammonia releases in the environment and the properties of the substance, terrestrial plants and aquatic organisms are potential risk targets. A tiered assessment approach has been used to determine the ecological risk in the aquatic environment from ammonia released in municipal wastewater effluents. The results obtained for two case studies with the probabilistic risk analysis used in the highest tier support the conclusion that the conditions encountered in these two locations can lead to ammonia concentrations capable of producing an adverse ecological impact.

AB  - This study was undertaken to determine whether the Clean Water Act had been effective in improving the biological and chemical conditions of the Delaware and Neches Estuaries and the Flint River. A review of the literature indicated that the effort spent and methods varied so much that there were no firm bases by which one could compare changes over time based on numbers of species and relative abundance. Therefore, the autoecologies of the species were used to determine the ratio of pollution tolerant species to those characteristic of natural water as a basis for determining change. A thorough study of the literature has produced the list of species found and their pollution tolerance.  This list should be of use to others studying the effects of pollution on fresh and brackish water ecosystems.

AB  - Permanent changes in the surrounding environment cause long-term stress in birds, which, when lasting days or weeks, affects the activity of the immune system and increases susceptibility to diseases, leading to changes in the levels of haematological parameters. The heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (H:L-ratio) is generally considered an independent and robust indicator of stress level in birds. This parameter allows in a simple way to evaluate activity of the immune system and individual health state of adult and nestling birds. It also enables assessing a body response to short-and long-term stress induced by, among others, the surrounding environment, social stress, blood parasites or a greater energy expenditure of females during breeding. Under conditions of field work the determination of the H:L-ratio is not difficult because what is only needed to conduct a blood smear test is a drop of blood that can be easily obtained even from birds of a small body mass. Moreover, an increase in the H:L-ratio is observed after about an hour from the moment of catching a bird contrary to other measurements like the determination of a baseline level of corticosterone.
   In this article available literature that discusses the impact of various factors on the H:L-ratio in the Great Tit as a species of 'fast-paced' life is reviewed. In adult and nestling birds the H:L-ratio is influenced by various factors - ecological and ecophysiological ones. In some cases the same factor, e.g. brood size manipulation or a type of habitat, can significantly influence the level of the discussed stress indicator as well as it may not show any impact at all. While interpreting the H:L-ratio one must take into account an impact of various ecological and ecophysiological factors on health state, such as habitat, phase of the annual cycle, differences between brood attempts, sex, age as well as on relations with other indicators of condition e.g. body mass or total blood haemoglobin concentration.

AB  - High tunnels (HTs) are used worldwide for greater crop sustainability and profitability, but producers are finding it difficult to control the trapped heat inside HTs. Clearly, proper ventilation management is crucial for obtaining marketable yield and quality, but the ability to predict HT ventilation based solely on external climate parameters is limited. This project analyzes daytime ventilation rates in a Gothic-type HT located in eastern Tennessee. A numerical energy balance model was developed to calculate air flux, and the estimated values of air flux were compared with measured values from sonic and hot-wire anemometers. Uniquely, this study takes into account the sensible and latent heat exchanges between inside and outside conditions, the radiative and convective transfer mechanisms, and the effects of external wind conditions on the incoming air flux. Moreover, relationships between the external weather conditions and internal microclimate were developed so that air flux, inside temperature, and door opening level could be predicted with the energy balance model using only external weather data. The energy balance model revealed that the HT plastic surface reflected nearly 20% of the solar radiation, that 1% of the solar energy was stored in the air (considered negligible), and that 5% of the solar energy was stored in the soil, while the majority of available solar radiation, 74%, was removed through natural ventilation. There was good agreement between the predictive energy balance model and the direct air flux calculation for ventilation rate (R-2 > 0.70). At the windward end of the HT, the airflow entering the door was mostly perpendicular to the plane of the door opening, which indicated that the fluctuation of outside wind direction had limited effect on the airflow patterns through the door. As a significant indicator of the energy balance model's usefulness, the predicted inside air temperature was validated as similar to the measured values. Thus, the results showed strong evidence that the coupling of the energy balance model and air flux calculation based on external weather parameters can be a valuable method to predict inside microclimate conditions and can be used to estimate the door opening level.

AB  - Mitigation wetland performance is typically assessed with indicators of ecosystem structure and organization, such as plant community composition. While structural indicators can confirm the establisbment of a wetland, the degree to which they measure system function is debatable. We evaluated the potential of coarse particulate litter decomposition as a measure of ecosystem function in three created wetlands of different hydrologic regimes and different ages-4, 12, and 155 years. We evaluated litter decomposition rates among the three wetlands relative to site-specific characteristics of vegetation, substrate conditions, and hydrologic regime. Decomposition rates differed among these wetlands, and age effects were strongly influenced by site conditions and environmental factors. Hydrologic regime was the most significant interaction factor with decomposition and likely was a confounding factor for an age-based trajectory of detrital dynamics. These results suggest that decomposition dynamics can be a useful indicator of developing ecosystem function but only in carefully selected wetlands of similar hydrologic regime.

AB  - Seventeen populations of Pisidium casertanum (Poli 1795) from six rivers and eleven lakes were studied to determine how population demographics were related to environmental conditions.  Univariate and multivariate analyses of the data suggest that natural variation in environmental conditions accounts for a significant amount of variation in the demography of this clam.  Correlations among principal components of environmental variables and of population demographics were used to assess the relationships between environmental variables and population features.  Abundance, production, and biomass were higher in habitats with warmer ice-free temperatures, but the length at which adults first developed shelled larvae, and maximum adult length and weight, were less in such habitats.  Productivity, biomass, and the proportion of adults brooding shelled larvae were higher in habitats that had higher calcium hardness, conductivity, pH, alkalinity, and sulphate levels.  These factors should be considered in studies that attempt to relate variation in population statistics of sphaeriid clams to environmental degradation.

AB  - Lacustrine fossil records provide long time series of data on limnological and climatic conditions; these data are useful for establishing natural patterns of climate variability and for generating testable hypotheses about atmospheric circulation and climate-ecosystem linkages. Shoreline features can indicate past lake-level fluctuations that may reflect changes in moisture balance, but often these records are discontinuous and are evidence of only extreme conditions. The organisms, geochemistry, and sedimentology of lake sediments may provide a more continuous sequence of direct and indirect lake-climate interactions in the past. The most clearly interpretable paleolimnological records of climatic change are those that use several lines of evidence to corroborate a climatic hypothesis and are from sites near an ecotone or in regions of extreme climate. In all cases, hydrologic setting mediates a lake's response to climate and must be considered in interpreting sedimentary sequences.

LA  - German
AB  - Demands of pet birds on their environment and also on management include the construction of the cage or aviary, the volume and equipment of their restricted artificial habitat, biological and social requirements and also specialised medical care.  For general health prophylaxis, particular emphasis has to be given to species-specific social and grooming behaviour (e.g. no single caged birds, secure resting and sunbathing places).  Sufficient possibilities for flying must be provided (not just opportunity to flutter or jump).  Feeding must also meet the species-specific requirements.  Vectors for pathogens (e.g. mice, sparrows, craws) and also parasites (e.g. mites, lice, nematodes, protozoa) have to be controlled meticulously.  Aviaries and cages should be checked and cleaned at short intervals.  External lesions should always prompt immediate critical examination of the environment of the birds since they are indicators of deficient management conditions.  For treatment and prevention of such lesions, looking for alternative conditions to create an optimal environment and management is the only choice.

AB  - An analysis of ecological groups has been performed on the, Dutch Holocene palaeobotanical record excluding wood and pollen data and compared with the recent flora.
   Although all ecological groups are represented by plants that are preserved by both waterlogging and charring, this especially concerns plants indicative of ruderal places, arable fields, dry underwood, fresh water and banks. On the level of environmental conditions, it is shown that the representation of the subfossil record is biased by the type of preservation, the archaeological context and the frequency by which plants are found.
   For the reconstruction of environmental conditions on the basis of a select number of plants, groups of indicator plants have been compiled for the following (a)biotic characteristics: salinity, moisture regime, nutrient availability, and the structure of vegetation and the stage of succession. These groups are suitable for the comparison of samples and sites with respect to different feature types, locations and periods.

AB  - A taxonomy of environmental indicators was developed to inform management of aquatic ecosystems, and its utility was evaluated through application within the Chesapeake Bay Program. We considered a set of 82 metrics generated by this Program, using qualitative assessment of descriptive materials. We found that 30 of these metrics conveyed sufficient information about the larger system to be considered true indicators. These 30 were classified according to the proposed taxonomy into one or more of five types: condition, evaluation, diagnostic, communication, or futures. We also evaluated the scales at which these indicators function temporally and spatially. We conclude that only a limited number of indicators are designed to be diagnostic and/or designed to forecast future conditions. The scale analyses suggest the indicator set is not focused on local scales and/or the watershed component of the Bay system. The taxonomy succeeds in framing an assessment of existing indicator sets that can productively guide future development efforts.

AB  - Land degradation in the southern central part of the South Island, New Zealand is a pressing environmental issue. There is a requirement for a method encompassing integrated monitoring and modelling. This paper describes an approach that combines ecological modelling using regression methods and neural networks with spatial information including remotely sensed information. Regression techniques are used initially for modelling with result of r(2) = 0.68. Prompted by some residual concerns about disaggregation, a series of neural networks were designed. The result of these latter tests produced r(2) = 0.86. A study was undertaken to analyse these results and to use the models for extrapolation. The models were useful for the prediction and simulation of ground based land monitoring data, and successfully predicted the condition of a large area of land when applied to a spatial dataset.

AB  - Analysis of the spatial distribution of the dinoflagellate cyst assemblages in 19 surface sediment samples collected from 3 Buzzards Bay (Massachusetts, USA) embayments revealed the potential applicability of dinoflagellate cysts as biological indicators of environmental conditions in estuarine systems. Sites with the highest levels of toxic pollution and hypertrophic conditions are characterized by the lowest dinoflagellate cyst species-richness and concentrations. Among the abiotic factors influencing the distribution of dinoflagellate cysts, nutrients and toxic pollution are the major controls, as in these embayments salinity and temperature variability is low. Principal component analysis, based on the proportions of cyst taxa, indicated that cyst assemblages gradually change when moving away from the sources of nutrient pollution, sewage outfalls in particular.

AB  - Soil microorganisms are pivotal in ecological systems, it may not be possible to define an ecosystem where an impact on overall microorganism populations would not mean a severe impact on the ecosystem. They are as relevant to an ecosystem as any group of organisms could be. Rt the same time, it is very difficult to link impact on measurable microbial activities to ecological impacts. We lack the required understanding. The linkage fails because of: compensation processes - the ecological process is continued by organisms other than those measured; non-specific assays - the method used to measure activity may impose conditions that do not reflect ecological conditions and multiple and unknown interacting factors. Overall, the ambiguity in benefit/detriment relationships for impacts on microbes is the largest problem. Here we describe several examples of successes and failures of soil microbial bioassays in applications related to soil cleanliness criteria and ecological risk assessment. The usefulness of the microbial bioassays remains in question.

AB  - To investigate dinoflagellate cyst production and seasonality in relation to major environmental factors, such as water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and dissolved nutrients, and to propose dinoflagellate cysts as possible biological indicators for the reconstruction of past environmental conditions, a sediment trap study was conducted for one year, from March 2011 to February 2012, in Jinhae-Masan Bay, Korea. Marked increases in dinoflagellate cyst production were documented in Jinhae-Masna Bay during two distinct seasons (summer and late autumn) characterized by different environmental conditions. Summer (July and August) was characterized by relatively high water temperature, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and chl-a concentrations and low salinity, whereas late autumn (November and December) exhibited high dissolved inorganic phosphorus, low water temperature and high salinity, compared to those of the summer. Fourteen dinoflagellate cyst taxa were identified. These assemblages were dominated by Brigantedinium species (round brown cyst), cysts of Scrippsiella species, Spiniferites species and cysts of Alexandrium species (ellipsoidal cyst). The total flux of dinoflagellate cysts ranged from 781 cysts m(-2) day(-1) to 5602 cysts m(-2) day(-1), and the production of autotrophic dinoflagellate cysts was mainly restricted to the wannest months (July-September) and autumn. Multivariable analysis revealed that the production of major dinoflagellate cysts, excluding those of Brigantediniunt species, can be enhanced by environmental conditions during summer in Jinhae-Masan Bay. In particular, the increased production of cysts of Scrippsiella species was related to increased water temperature, and the increased production of Spiniferites species was associated with lower salinity. Two peaks in cyst production of Alexandrium species in August and November corresponded with significant increases in DIN and DIP; however, no significant relationship was found between the production of Brigantedinizun species and environmental factors in Jinhae-Masan Bay. These results suggest that the cysts of Scrippsiella species, Spiniferites species and cysts of Alexandrium species present in sediment samples from Jinhae-Masan Bay can be used as biological indicators to reconstruct past environmental conditions involving relatively high water temperature, low salinity and enhanced nutrient level.

AB  - Nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations in stream water often respond uniquely to changes in inter-annual conditions (e.g., biological N uptake and precipitation) in individual catchments. In this paper, we assess (1) how the spatial distribution of NO3-N concentrations varies across a dense network of nonnested catchments and (2) how relationships between multiple landscape factors [within whole catchments and hydrologically sensitive areas (HSAs) of the catchments] and stream NO3-N are expressed under a variety of annual conditions. Stream NO3-N data were collected during two synoptic sampling events across > 55 tributaries and two synoptic sampling periods with > 11 tributaries during summer low flow periods. Sample tributaries drain mixed land cover watersheds ranging in size from 0.150 to 312 km(2) and outlet directly to Cayuga Lake, New York. Changes in NO3-N concentration ratios between each sampling event suggest a high degree of spatial heterogeneity in catchment response across the Cayuga Lake Watershed, ranging from 0.230 to 61.4. Variations in NO3-N concentrations within each of the large synoptic sampling events were also high, ranging from 0.040 to 8.7 mg NO3-N/l (March) and 0.090 to 15.5 mg NO3-N/l (October). Although Pearson correlation coefficients suggest that this variability is related to multiple landscape factors during all four sampling events, partial correlations suggest percentage of row crops in the catchments as the only similar factor in March and October and catchment area as the only factor during summer low flows. Further, the strength of the relationships is typically lower in the HSAs of catchment. Advancing current understanding of such variations and relationships to landscape factors across multiple catchments - and under a variety of biogeochemical and hydrological conditions - is important, as (1) nitrate continues to be employed as an indicator of regional aquatic ecosystem health and services and (2) a unified framework approach for understanding individual catchment processes is a rapidly evolving focus for catchment-based science and management.

AB  - The trophic status of the Ramsar-accredited Nyl River floodplain, which is stressed by sewage treatment effluents, and its ability to restore normal conditions, were assessed in 2014-2015 using diatoms as biological indicators. The Trophic Diatom Index, Specific Pollution Sensitivity Index and the Generic Diatom Index were used to characterise water quality under high and low flow conditions in 2014. An additional survey was conducted in May 2015, following an accidental sulphuric acid spill above the Sewage Treatment Works (STW). Significant linear correlations were identified between physico-chemical parameters and the indices, as well as between the three indices themselves, validating their use to infer water quality. Water quality deteriorated from the source of the Klein Nyl River, especially at the STW, but improved within the Nylsvley Nature Reserve wetland sampling site (NYL).

AB  - The assessment of environmental effects of livestock production systems assume a methodical strategy to analyze qualitative and quantitative effects of biological processes to the several media and the used resources. Important starting-points in reducing and minimizing environmental impact can be found by a process-integrated analysis and increasing efficiency of used materials and energy. Several methods (input/output-flows, analysing of material and energy streams, balances) are to be used and need a pool of specified data. Strategies for a sustainable discharge of the nitrogen cycle are:
   need-based nutrients supply of the animals
   conditioning of animal wastes
   fertilizer input strictly adapted to production level of plants
   recycling of sludge nutrients in land using systems
   Waste conditioning by litter ventilation in broiler houses for example is a simple method to reduce ammonia emission by 70%. Concerning the nitrogen efficiency of the whole production cycle for example in dairy cow livestock the influence of farm type and process engineering on the ammonia emission level per hectare is made clear.

AB  - In the frame of a project concerning the evaluation of the pollution level and the ozone experimental effect upon some bacterial indicators of a protected ecosystem, water samples were estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min. We found that the ozone treatment decreased the concentration in all different bacterial indicators by reducing their number for more than six times after 15 min of application. Total inactivation was observed for C. perfringens vegetative cells. Since there are complex relations between the microbial loading the water characteristics and the action of ozone, further studies are needed to determine the optimum conditions of ozone effect, as its use consists of a promising technology.

AB  - The Cuu Long river Delta, covering majority of the downstream portion of the Mekong Delta, has four diverse wetland ecosystems in Dong Thap Muoi: coastal, inland, coastal estuarine and special wetland ecosystems. In the past decades, these ecosystems and their services (especially provisioning ecosystem) have been strongly exploited that resulted to its declining ability to meet increasing human demand for natural resources. Based on analysis of trends of change in ecosystems and their services, drivers of change in ecosystems and their services in the Cuu Long River Delta are rapid population growth, economic development pressure and management. Recommendation on management responses at macro-level for the whole region and at micro-level for provinces and environment and natural resource sectors were formulated based on the condition and trend assessment and driver analysis.

TI  - Analysis of similarity between genotypes with respect to ecologic and ontogenetic variation of a growth trait
T2  - GENETIKA
LA  - Russian
AB  - A growth trait is considered an indicator of ontogeny in plants with determined genotypes (cultivars, Fl hybrids, clones, etc.). A new biometrical-genetic approach is proposed to analyze similarity between genotypes; similarity is estimated from shape of reaction of a growth trait under changing growth conditions in serial competitive field trials. The method is based on regression models that approximate curves of relative variation of growth of a trait in two genotypes. To estimate similarity quantitatively, two parameters are used: smoothness of curves and their divergence under different conditions of trials (years, regions, etc.) of two genotypes. This work describes the way to analyze the interrelation between genotypic variation of these paired ontogenetic parameters of similarity and the following parameters: (1) the degree of relationship between genotypes and (2) the adequacy of regressions on means used to study genotype-environment interaction in ecologic gradients (from final values of the trait in genotypes).

AB  - Agriculture is a dominant land use worldwide with approximately 40% of the land's surface used for farming. In many countries, particularly parts of Europe, this figure is substantially higher and most agricultural land is under intensive practices aimed at maximising the production of food. The intensification and expansion of modern agricultural practices led to the biological simplification of the farmed environment, which has resulted in declines in farmland biodiversity during the last century. As with other taxa, many bat species have suffered severe population declines during the 20th century, with agriculture believed to be one of the main drivers reducing roost availability and foraging habitat. Lower intensity farming methods, and the creation or management of habitat features on farmland could potentially mitigate some of these negative impacts but the effects of this on bats, in comparison to other taxa, have received relatively little attention. Here, I review evidence on the impacts of efforts to increase biodiversity in agricultural landscapes on bat populations, and explore whether responses of bats to agricultural activities are similar to those of other taxa, a necessary requirement if they are to be used as bioindicator species.
   There are relatively few studies with which to assess the effects of management interventions on bats in agricultural landscapes, and these are restricted to only a few countries. Nevertheless, there is evidence that bats benefit from lower intensity agricultural systems, specifically organic farming and shaded agroforestry: these systems tend to be associated with higher bat abundance, species richness and diversity, and are more heavily utilised by foraging bats. Whilst very few studies have explicitly tested the utility of bats as bioindicators in agricultural landscapes, overall, the response of bats to lower intensity agricultural systems also reflects responses by other taxa. These studies have been largely restricted to temperate regions, however. The review highlights several major gaps in our knowledge of bats in agricultural landscapes and where future research could be usefully directed including: (1) a broader geographical range of studies examining both the efficacy, and the underlying mechanisms through which lower intensity agricultural systems may benefit bats; (2) the potential for lower intensity systems in key crops such as oil-palm; (3) studies of the demographic effects of conservation management on bats; (4) in order to assess the potential of bats as bioindicators, studies quantifying the response of both bats and other taxa to environmental change in a wider range of biomes and regions are needed.

AB  - Biological communities change in response to human alteration. The response of individual taxa and the community can be used to establish preventive criteria to halt further biodiversity deterioration. Here we explore how consistent are the boundaries between Good and Moderate ecological status derived from classification systems used in North-NW Spain: NORThern Spain Indicators system (NORTI), River type specific multimetric (METI) and Iberian Biomonitoring Working Party (IBMWP), by using common interpretation of normative definitions of Water Framework Directive. We applied the three classifications to a monitoring dataset of Nalon River basin, comprising samples from different stream types and reference conditions. We applied Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis to the invertebrate community along the most relevant environmental pressures and biological impairment gradients represented by the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) scores of the classification systems. Only NORTI provided a true community ecological threshold and the change point (cp) 95% quantile (Q95%) range of 0.760 was assumed to be the boundary from Good to Moderate (G/M) status, used to standardize the number of taxa loss in all systems. Since the average number of taxa at reference sites was 34, the estimated loss of sensitive taxa was up to 97.1% in IBMWP, 73.5% in METI and 52.9% in NORTI when passing from Good to Moderate status, revealing very permissive boundaries. The loss of common sensitive taxa in NORTI at Q95% was used as G/M threshold and applied to the other classifications, resulting all in a common biodiversity loss of 21% of sensitive taxa richness at values of NORTI-EQR = 0.760, MET1- EQR 0.818 and IBMWP-EQR = 0.753. Results indicate that significant community changes along pressure gradients allow for establishing quantitative criteria consistent with normative definitions. This understanding derived from Directive monitoring programs can assess the risk that invertebrate communities face in terms of species loss derived from anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - In the intertidal seagrass beds of Zostera noltii of Mira estuary (SW, Portugal) the harvesting practices are frequent. The traditional bivalve harvesting not only affects the target species as the remaining biological assemblages. The main aim of this study was to assess the disturbance caused by sediment digging in the recovery of the seagrass beds habitat, through an experimental fieldwork. The responses of the seagrass plant condition, the sediment microbial activity and the nematode assemblages were investigated after the digging activity in seagrass beds. A total of four experimental plots were randomly demarcated in situ, two plots were subjected to the disturbance - "Digging" - while other two were "Control"; the sampling occurred in five occasions, from May to October: T-0-before digging; T-1-14 days after digging; T-2-45 days; T-3 -75 days; and T-4-175 days. The environmental variables measured in the sediment and the photosynthetic efficiency (alpha) of the Z noltii plants in each plot and sampling occasion registered similar values, throughout the experiment. The extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) clearly presented a temporal pattern, although no significant differences were obtained between digging and control plots. Nematode assemblages registered high densities, revealing the absence of the digging effect: control plots maintained similar density and diversity throughout the experiment, while the density and diversity between digging plots was significantly different at T-0 and T-4 ; the trophic composition was similar for both control and digging plots, characterized mainly by non-selective deposit feeders (1B) and epigrowth feeders (2A).Organic matter, nitrate and mean grain size explain a significant amount of the variation in the nematode genera composition. This study demonstrated the capacity of the seagrass habitat to recover under low intensity physical disturbance associated to harvesting. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary The environment receives different sources of pollutants, resulting from human industrial pollution as well as activities. This review updates and focuses the light on the relation between the toxicity of heavy metals resulting from bioaccumulation in fish and the parasite bioindication role and its infestation.
   Abstract As a result of the global industrial revolution, contamination of the ecosystem by heavy metals has given rise to one of the most important ecological and organismic problems, particularly human, early developmental stages of fish and animal life. The bioaccumulation of heavy metals in fish tissues can be influenced by several factors, including metal concentration, exposure time, method of metal ingestion and environmental conditions, such as water temperature. Upon recognizing the danger of contamination from heavy metals and the effects on the ecosystem that support life on earth, new ways of monitoring and controlling this pollution, besides the practical ones, had to be found. Diverse living organisms, such as insects, fish, planktons, livestock and bacteria can be used as bioindicators for monitoring the health of the natural ecosystem of the environment. Parasites have attracted intense interest from parasitic ecologists, because of the variety of different ways in which they respond to human activity contamination as prospective indices of environmental quality. Previous studies showed that fish intestinal helminths might consider potential bioindicators for heavy metal contamination in aquatic creatures. In particular, cestodes and acanthocephalans have an increased capacity to accumulate heavy metals, where, for example, metal concentrations in acanthocephalans were several thousand times higher than in host tissues. On the other hand, parasitic infestation in fish could induce significant damage to the physiologic and biochemical processes inside the fish body. It may encourage serious impairment to the physiologic and general health status of fish. Thus, this review aimed to highlight the role of heavy metal accumulation, fish histopathological signs and parasitic infestation in monitoring the ecosystem pollutions and their relationship with each other.

AB  - Coastal dunes are dynamic systems exposed to multiple environmental changes; therefore, specific, sensitive, and cost-efficient indicators are needed for ecological assessment and monitoring. We addressed whether biochemical indicators of plant physiological stress could provide a complementary approach to classic disturbance indicators for identifying dune areas undergoing ecological change. We hypothesized that disturbance related to a shift from (meta-) stability to erosive dynamics would promote increased stress on foredune plants, which would exhibit adaptive physiological responses that could be captured through standard biochemical tests. Such responses would anticipate other reported responses of foredune communities, such as loss of facilitation capacity or decrease of species richness. We also hypothesized that such responses would be influenced by biogeographic context, based on reported interactions between regional and local gradients. We compared patterns of proline accumulation and membrane lipid peroxidation in plants of sand-couch (Elytrigia juncea), a foredune specialist, from 27 transects at nine locations under contrasting dynamics along a climatic gradient in northern Portugal. Next, we evaluated effects of coastal dynamics and biogeographic context on proline accumulation and lipid peroxidation and compared physiological stress patterns with variations in topographic and phytocoenotic attributes of dune ecosystems related to contrasting coastal dynamics. We found proline accumulation to be significantly higher (and lipid peroxidation proportionally lower) in plants from sites under chronic erosive dynamics. This response of physiological stress indicators was further confirmed by their significant correlation with topographic and phytocoenotic indicators. We also confirmed significant effects of regional gradients on the ecophysiological responses to contrasting coastal dynamics, which were better discriminated under Mediterranean climate than among Atlantic sites. This interaction between regional climate and local disturbance suggests caution in the wide use of ecophysiological responses for ecological assessment and monitoring before regionally stratified models are calibrated to compensate for interactions among processes operating at different scales.

AB  - Chitobiase is involved in exoskeleton degradation and recycling during the moulting process in arthropods. In aquatic species, the moulting fluid is released into the aqueous environment, and chitobiase activity present therein can be used to follow the dynamics of arthropod populations. Here, chitobiase activity was used for monitoring the impact of mosquito candidate larvicides on Daphnia pulex and Daphnia magna under laboratory conditions. Both species were exposed to spinosad (2, 4, 8 mu g L-1) and diflubenzuron (0.2, 0.4, 0.8 mu g L-1) for 14 days. Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti: 0.25, 0.5, 1 mu L L-1) was used as the reference larvicide. Chitobiase activity, adult survival, individual growth and fecundity, expressed as the number of neonates produced, were measured every 2 days. Average Exposure Concentrations of spinosad were ten-fold lower than the nominal concentrations, whereas only a slight deviation was observed for diflubenzuron. In contrast to Bti, spinosad and diflubenzuron significantly affected both species in terms of adult survival, and production of neonates. As compared to D. pulex, D. magna was more severely affected by diflubenzuron, at low and medium concentrations, with reduced adult growth and much lower chitobiase activity. Chitobiase activity was positively correlated with the individual body length, number of neonates produced between two consecutive observation dates, and number of females and neonates. In addition, the significant positive correlations between chitobiase activity measured on the last sampling date before the first emission of neonates and the cumulative number of neonates produced during the whole observation period strongly support the potential of the activity of this chitinolytic enzyme as a proxy for assessing the dynamics of arthropod populations exposed to larvicides used for mosquito control.

AB  - Rapid anthropogenic climate change is a major threat to ocean biodiversity, increasing the challenge for marine conservation. Strategic conservation planning, and more recently marine spatial planning (MSP) are among the most promising management tools to operationalize and enforce marine conservation. As yet, climate change is seldom incorporated into these plans, potentially curtailing the effectiveness of designated conservation areas under novel environmental conditions. Reliable assessment of current and future climate change threats requires the ability to map climate-driven eco-evolutionary changes and the identification of vulnerable and resistant populations. Here we explore the heretofore largely unrecognized value of information gained from physiological, ecological and evolutionary studies to MSP under ongoing climate change. For example, we explore how climate threats do not necessarily follow latitudinal gradients, such that both risk hotspots and refugia occur in mosaic distributions along species ranges - patterns that may be undetectable without knowledge of biological vulnerabilities at regional and local scales. Because co-occurring species can exhibit markedly different vulnerabilities to the same environmental changes, making ecological predictions requires, when possible, measuring the fundamental niches of key species (e.g., with the use of thermotolerance experiments). Forecasting also requires development of tools to identify the likelihood of community-level thresholds or tipping points (e.g., with the use of near-real world mesocosms), and assessment of the potential of populations for adaptation (e.g., with common garden experiments). Such research will facilitate better predictive models for the fate of populations, species, ecosystems and their functions. Ultimately, unfolding the complexity of the processes underlying climate change impacts will facilitate quantifying and reducing uncertainty in spatial planning decision processes and will enable the development of practical tools to validate adaptive conservation strategies.

AB  - The Adyar estuary has lost its pristine condition and is under great ecological stress due to urbanization, discharge of untreated sewage, solid waste disposal, industrial effluents and encroachments for the past two decades. As a result of degradation, many vital attributes of Adyar estuary such as clean water, faunal and floral diversity and its role as spawning and nursery ground of commercially important finfish and shellfish were lost. In order to restore the ecology of Adyar estuary, Govt.of Tamil Nadu has taken up restoration measures. The present paper deals with the diversity of meiobenthic fauna in the eco-restoration part and non-restoration part to assess the ecological status of Adyar creek and estuary with the help of their ecological indices and physicochemical parameters. In the present study, a total of thirty-nine species belonging to twenty groups of meiofauna were recorded from four stations of Adyar creek and estuary. The Number of meiofaunal species recorded in stations I, II, III and IV were 21, 22, 29 and 34, respectively. Nematodes and rotifers occurred in higher diversity than other meiofaunal groups. The overall density of meiofauna from four stations were ranged between 30 +/- 8.33 to 3264.44 +/- 378.65 Ind. / 10 cm(2). In general, higher density of meiofauna was recorded in estuary than the creek. Percentage composition of individual meiofauna groups ranged from 0.01% (gastrotrichs) to 54.9% (rotifers) in all the four stations. Monthly variations in the ecological indices of diversity, dominance and evenness of meiofauna of the four stations of Adyar creek and estuary showed variations in different stations, months and seasons. Results indicate restoration process of the Adyar creek enhanced the physicochemical parameters and meiofaunal diversity. These measures have helped to assess the eco-restoration of the Adyar estuary and are reflected in the favourable diversity of pollution indicator species of meiofauna. The ecological diversity indices and colonization of the restored station provide base-line data for estuarine ecosystem. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The ecological and biological aspects of the creation of a protective forest stands are considered. The results can serve as a basis for the development of measures for the rational use of land resources and the creation of protective forest plantations in arid conditions. An assessment of the introductory resources of dendroflora for the creation of protective forest stands is given, and the mycotrophy of species is studied for the first time in order to determine the possibilities of their use in protective forest stands. The criteria that determine the mycotrophy of woody plants and diagnostics of their resistance make it possible to assess the effectiveness of work on the introduction and reproduction of tree species and can also be used in the development of a general program for the restoration of natural forest phytocenoses.

AB  - We describe five examples of how, by ignoring fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK), marine researchers and resource managers may put fishery resources at risk, or unnecessarily compromise the welfare of resource users. Fishers can provide critical information on such things as interannual, seasonal, lunar, diel, tide-related and habitat-related differences in behaviour and abundance of target species, and on how these influence fishing strategies. Where long-term data sets are unavailable, older fishers are also often the only source of information on historical changes in local marine stocks and in marine environmental conditions. FEK can thus help improve management of target stocks and rebuild marine ecosystems. It can play important roles in the siting of marine protected areas and in environmental impact assessment. The fact that studying FEK does not meet criteria for acceptable research advanced by some marine biologists highlights the inadequacy of those criteria.

AB  - The fate (stability, multiplication) of S. aureus, E coli and E faecalis was determined in three classes of recreational waters (seawater, estuarine, stream) supplemented with nutrients in the form of sewage and peptone. In the absence of sunlight (24 +/- 2 degrees C), all bacteria in all water samples did not multiply and were slowly (days) inactivated. When 50% sewage was added to all water samples, E. coli and E. faecalis multiplied but S. aureus did not. When peptone (0.05%, 0.5%) was the added nutrient, the three bacteria multiplied. In the presence of sunlight (15-27 degrees C), S. aureus was inactivated rapidly (hours) in all water samples. These results show that when their nutritional requirements are met, S. aureus, E. coli and E. faecalis can multiply in the high salinity conditions of seawater. However, under environmental conditions, sunlight is an effective natural bactericidal agent.

AB  - Long time series are necessary to separate natural variability from that due to climate change and make it possible to interpret the impact of environmental change on ecosystems. Sclerochronological analysis of environmental records in the shells of mollusks make it possible to reconstruct environmental-ecological linkages over sufficiently long time scales to detect ecosystem change. Annually resolved archives can be key indicators of how climate change manifests in the marine ecosystem and are especially important in areas with limited instrumental records. We developed a master growth chronology of the Greenland Cockle (Serripes groenlandicus) from Bear Island (Bjornoya), Svalbard, Norway (74 degrees 41'N, 18 degrees 56'E) from analysis of annual shell growth increments. The chronology was developed from 13 individuals collected from 80 m deep and ranging in age from 40 to 48 years old (the oldest known individuals of this species to date). The master chronology, expressed as a growth index (GI), extended from 1968 to 2012 and exhibited a cyclical pattern with decadal periods of high growth alternating with slower growth intervals. We identified significant relationships between variations in large-scale climate regimes (e.g. Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation), local environmental conditions (e.g., sea temperature, sea ice), and shell growth. A model using sea temperature and sea ice explained 34-49% of the annual variations in shell growth patterns. The growth chronology and environmental linkages for cockles at this site in southern Svalbard near the southern extent of Arctic water in the Barents Sea were substantially different than at other locations in Svalbard. We conclude that the Greenland Cockle is quite sensitive to environmental changes over annual to decadal scales and therefore can serve as a proxy of climate change effects on ecosystem processes in the Arctic, but that local environmental processes that regulate food availability to the seabed are key determinants of environmental regulation on shell growth.

AB  - Globally, planted forests are increasing, providing increased resources to forest industries and ecosystem services (ES) to local and wider communities. However, assessment of the impacts of plantations on ES has been limited. Planted forests have expanded rapidly in Vietnam over the last 20 years, with much of the planting undertaken by smallholder growers using exoticAcaciaandEucalyptusspecies. This study aimed to test a framework to assess changes in four ES due to an increase inAcaciaplantations from 2005-2015 in central Vietnam: carbon sequestration, sediment retention, water yield and habitat. Quantitative and qualitative indicators for each service were derived from the literature. Results showed that the area of planted forests in Qung Tr and Tha Thien-HuLATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH CIRCUMFLEX AND ACUTE Provinces increased from 130,930 hectares (ha) to 182,508 ha, mostly replacing non-forest areas (degraded lands, grasslands and agricultural lands) and poor forests. The framework demonstrated capacity to assess the effect of planted forests on wood flow, carbon stocks, sediment retention, streamflow and the extent of wildlife habitat. Apart from the wood supply and carbon sequestration, more research is required to translate biophysical indicators to benefit relevant indicators related to human welfare. The study also revealed that the area of rich forests decreased by 20% over the ten years, mostly through degradation to poorer quality natural forests. Therefore, at the landscape scale, improvement in ES due to conversion of non-forests to planted forests was offset by a reduction in some services as a result of degradation of native forest from rich to poorer condition. Assessment of changes in ES due to planted forests also needs to consider other landscape changes. These analyses can inform policymakers, forest owners and managers, environmental organizations and local communities of the benefits and impacts of planted forests and provide an improved basis for payments for ES and potential additional income for smallholder tree growers.

AB  - Effective water management within urban settings requires robust multidisciplinary understanding and an appreciation of the value added to urban spaces by providing multifunctional green-blue spaces. Multifunctional landscapes where ecosystem service provisions are 'designed-in' can help 'transition' cities to more sustainable environments which are more resilient to changing future conditions. With benefits ranging from the supply of water, habitat and energy to pollutant removal, amenity and opportunities for recreation, urban water bodies can provide a focal point for reconnecting humans and nature in otherwise densely built-up areas. Managing water within urban spaces is an essential infrastructure requirement but has historically been undertaken in isolation from other urban functions and spatial requirements. Increasingly, because of the limits of space and need to respond to new drivers (e. g. mitigation of diffuse pollution), more sustainable approaches to urban water management are being applied which can have multiple functions and benefits. This paper presents a review of ecosystem services associated with water, particularly those in urban environments, and uses the emerging language of ecosystem services to provide a framework for discussion. The range of supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services associated with differing types of urban water bodies are identified. A matrix is then used to evaluate the results of a series of social, ecological and physical science studies co-located on a single stretch of a restored urban river. Findings identify the benefits of, but also barriers to, the implementation of a transdisciplinary research approach. For many, transdisciplinary research still appears to be on the edge of scientific respectability. In order to approach this challenge, it is imperative that we bring together discipline specific expertise to address fundamental and applied problems in a holistic way. The ecosystem services approach offers an exciting mechanism to support researchers in tackling research questions that require thinking beyond traditional scientific boundaries. The opportunity to fully exploit this approach to collaborative working should not be lost.

AB  - Within Canada, and internationally, an increasing demand that forests be managed to maintain all resources has led to the development of criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management. There is, however, a lack of understanding, at an operational scale, how to evaluate and compare forest management activities to ensure the sustainability of all resources. For example, nationally, many of the existing indicators are too broad to be used directly at a local scale of forest management; provincially, regulations are often too prescriptive and rigid to allow for adaptive management; and forest certification programs, often based largely on public or stakeholder opinion instead of scientific understanding, may be too local in nature to permit a comparison of operations across a biome. At an operational scale indicators must be relevant to forest activities and ecologically integrated. In order to aid decision-makers in the adaptive management necessary for sustainable forest management, two types of indicators are identified: those that are prescriptive to aid in planning forest management and those that are evaluative to be used in monitoring and suggesting improvements. An integrated approach to developing standards based on an ecosystem management paradigm is outlined for the boreal forest where the variability inherent in natural systems is used to define the limits within which forest management is ecologically sustainable. Sustainability thresholds are thus defined by ecosystem response after natural disturbances. For this exercise, standards are proposed for biodiversity, forest productivity via regeneration, soil conservation and aquatic resources. For each of these standards, planning indicators are developed for managing forest conditions while forest values are evaluated by environmental indicators, thus leading to a continuous cycle of improvement. Approaches to developing critical thresholds and corresponding prescriptions are also outlined. In all cases, the scale of evaluation is clearly related to the landscape (or FMU) level while the stand level is used for measurement purposes. In this view the forest should be managed as a whole even though forest interventions are usually undertaken at the stand level.

AB  - Long-term trends in macrobenthic communities of the lower Chesapeake Bay, USA, were examined using data collected quarterly (March, June, September and December) from 1985 to 1991 at 16 stations along a salinity gradient from tidal freshwater regions of the major tributaries (James, York and Rappahannock rivers) to the polyhaline region of the main-stem of Chesapeake Bay. A non-parametric trend analysis procedure was applied to five parameters characterizing macrobenthic community structure: community biomass, species richness, abundance of individuals, proportion of biomass composed of opportunistic species (opportunistic biomass composition) and proportion of biomass composed of equilibrium species (equilibrium biomass composition). For the parameters tested 36 trends were detected. For community biomass, five trends were significant; all had positive slopes and occurred in the James and York rivers. For species richness, six trends were significant; all had positive slopes with three trends in the James River, two trends in the York River and one trend in the main-stem of Chesapeake Bay. For abundance of individuals, 17 trends were detected; all abundance trends were seasonally dependent, had positive slopes and occurred at 12 of the 16 stations. For opportunistic biomass composition, four trends were significant; an had positive slopes with one trend in the lower Rappahannock River and three trends in the main-stem of Chesapeake Bay. For equilibrium biomass composition four trends were significant; two trends had positive slopes (one in the James River and one in the York River) and two trends had negative slopes (one in the Rappahannock River and one in the main-stem of Chesapeake Bay). Trends in the James and York rivers were considered to indicate improving conditions for the benthos, while trends in the lower Rappahannock River and the main-stem of the Chesapeake Bay were considered to indicate deteriorating conditions. Deteriorating conditions for the benthos were associated with regions exposed to summer, low dissolved oxygen events. The trends in the indicators of benthic biological community health were inferentially related to trends observed in water quality conditions in the tributaries and main-stem of Chesapeake Bay. All major water quality and biotic trends appeared to correspond in an ecologically meaningful manner.

AB  - Functional diversity is considered an important tool for the identification of ecological mechanisms shaping the coexistence patterns of species communities along different environmental gradients. However, there is a huge gap in knowledge regarding the importance of ecological mechanisms in shaping the composition of lichen communities. We analyzed the functional diversity patterns of the lichen species in a European lowland primeval forest ecosystem, taking into consideration levels of forest communities, phorophyte species and substrates. The greatest functional diversity of lichens at the community level (functional richness and functional dispersion) was found in mixed deciduous forests, where Fraxinus excelsior and Carpinus betulus revealed the highest values of functional dispersion. The most functionally diverse lichen communities were found on the bark of trees, the branches of trees, and the bark on trunks or branches of fallen trees. The lowest functional diversity was found in coniferous forests, evidenced by the low functional dispersion of lichen assemblages, indicating lower heterogeneity of possible niches and harsher environmental conditions comparing with deciduous forests. In coniferous forests, lichens produced small ascomata and ascospores, while in deciduous forests, ascomata and spores of lichens were larger. We concluded that two contrasting mechanisms shaped the functional diversity of lichens in the primeval forest ecosystem: (i) niche-partitioning in deciduous forests, and (ii) environmental filtering in coniferous forests. Our study has substantially broadened and enhanced the existing knowledge concerning the assembly rules of lichen communities and can be considered as a model for the distribution of lichen functional traits in the natural lowland forests of Europe. This approach may also be used to model future changes taking place in this type of ecosystem. Our results are particularly important for forest managers responsible for protection, as they highlight the fundamental importance of certain tree species and specific forest substrates for maintaining high lichen functional diversity. Focus on the protection of all features of diverse forest structures and of diverse forests providing high variety of niches is essential for the successful conservation of forest lichen biota.

AB  - Fish otoliths have provided biologists with a treasure-house of valuable life history information across levels of biological organization from individuals to ecosystems. Otoliths have long been used to provide the age and growth estimates which are basic data that underpin scientific fisheries and fisheries ecology. The traditional use of calcified tissues (CS) has been augmented by new applications to address questions of population connectivity, migration, and trophic ecology. These tools have become increasingly important in meeting the demands for spatially explicit and ecosystem-level management tools. Analysis of CS is now extended to applications related to spatial use (essential habitats) and as a record of past and present environmental conditions. This special volume of the ICES Journal of Marine Science contains contributions from the 5th International Otolith Symposium (IOS 2014), an ICES Science Symposium held in October 2014, in Mallorca, Spain. IOS 2014 is a continuation of a series of symposia that started in 1993 to encourage the exchange of information and expertise and to promote the development of new techniques and applications for otolith-based analysis in ecology, management, and conservation. IOS 2014 was the largest meeting to date, with 329 participants from 45 countries. The aim of IOS 2014 was to explore the use of CS as tools to support management and define indicators at environmental, community, population, and individual levels. This international forum is the centre for the exchange of information about developments in the field. New techniques of analysis, statistical treatment, and indeed new areas of application are all presented in this forum. Regular attendees are often the prominent users of otolith analyses in their home institution, and many are active in ICES work. This is also a premier venue for interaction between ICES scientists and those working in other parts of the world. North America, Japan, Taiwan, and Australia are particularly active in advancing otolith techniques, and exchange of ideas and information is crucial to improving the science in the ICES community.

AB  - Soil quality or health is a fuzzy concept that has been vigorously criticized due to the extreme variability of soil and the difficulty of linking soil indicators to soil functions and sustainability. In most soil quality studies some obvious factors or typologies are used as a basis to select the "best indicators" of soil quality, i.e. those that best explain the differences among the plots under study. This is not the case for a variety of natural or agro-ecosystems including the Talamanca cacao-based agroforestry systems (AFS), which present neither a pre-established typology nor a clear framework to evaluate their soil quality. This situation required a selection of indicators based on the literature that was oriented by the non-equilibrium thermodynamic theory. A framework was elaborated through full and minimum indicator sets of baseline soil physical and chemical indicators, along with macrofauna groups. A minimum set of four well-accepted abiotic soil quality indicators (bulk density, sum of bases, pH and carbon) was able to separate cacao AFS plots and forests into five distinct clusters along a low-to-high "soil quality" gradient. The AFS rated as "good" soil quality did not differ from the forest. Abundances of selected macrofauna groups were well correlated with these indicators and helped elucidate the soil quality clusters identified. In particular, high predator abundance indicated proper energy flow and confirmed the high abiotic soil quality, thus confirming the potential of macrofauna groups as apt soil quality indicators. However, these indicators need to be tailored to local conditions. Consequentially, cacao-based AFS in Talamanca are able to conserve soil and provide a high level of soil-related ecological services. Considering the soil an open system where the non-equilibrium thermodynamic theory applies successfully guided indicator selection and could help to reformulate the soil quality definition.

AB  - Background: The neuroendocrine system is an important modulator of phenotype, directing cellular genetic responses to external cues such as temperature. Behavioural and physiological processes in poikilothermic organisms (e. g. most fishes), are particularly influenced by surrounding temperatures.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: By comparing the development and growth of two genotypes of coho salmon (wild-type and transgenic with greatly enhanced growth hormone production) at six different temperatures, ranging between 8 degrees and 18 degrees C, we observed a genotype-temperature interaction and possible trend in directed neuroendocrine selection. Differences in growth patterns of the two genotypes were compared by using mathematical models, and morphometric analyses of juvenile salmon were performed to detect differences in body shape. The maximum hatching and alevin survival rates of both genotypes occurred at 12 degrees C. At lower temperatures, eggs containing embryos with enhanced GH production hatched after a shorter incubation period than wild-type eggs, but this difference was not apparent at and above 16 degrees C. GH transgenesis led to lower body weights at the time when the yolk sack was completely absorbed compared to the wild genotype. The growth of juvenile GH-enhanced salmon was to a greater extent stimulated by higher temperatures than the growth of the wild-type. Increased GH production significantly influenced the shape of the salmon growth curves.
   Conclusions: Growth hormone overexpression by transgenesis is able to stimulate the growth of coho salmon over a wide range of temperatures. Temperature was found to affect growth rate, survival, and body morphology between GH transgenic and wild genotype coho salmon, and differential responses to temperature observed between the genotypes suggests they would experience different selective forces should they ever enter natural ecosystems. Thus, GH transgenic fish would be expected to differentially respond and adapt to shifts in environmental conditions compared with wild type, influencing their ability to survive and interact in ecosystems. Understanding these relationships would assist environmental risk assessments evaluating potential ecological effects.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to measure the difference in landscape visual character as an indicator of landscape change. We used seven map-based landscape character indicators calculated in two situations in a study area in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. The first situation corresponds to the current landscape and the second to a reference landscape, assumed to be its historical condition. The results show that the difference in landscape character is mainly due to the loss of naturalness and the increase in landscape complexity brought about by agriculture and urban development. This work is replicable and transparent, and constitutes a methodological step for landscape indication, since it adds a reference value for analysing differences in landscape character and can be used to explain its change.

AB  - In many European countries, the condition of the majority of waters still does not meet advanced ecological standards. In this context, conservation of riparian habitats is of particular importance. A recently increasing demand for cultivable land led to changes in the EU's subsidy policies. We argue that these changes to land use policies can affect aquatic terrestrial intersections. We used media reporting on beaver-related aspects as a parameter for conflict potentials within riparian habitats. We detected a considerable increase in conflicts occurring concurrently with the re-intensification of agricultural land use. Our results provide cause for concern that recent tendencies in land use in the EU might have destructive impacts on freshwater ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exposure to the oestrogen-mimic nonylphenol under laboratory conditions can cause imposes in dogwhelks Nucella lapillus. There were also elevated levels of imposex in N. lapillus collected from a shore adjacent to a gull roost, and from shores beneath cliffs which supported breeding colonies of seabirds. Gulls carry trematode parasites Par orchis acanthus which infect N. lapillus as intermediate hosts but, although parasites can affect the development of the genital system in gastropods, there was no relationship between levels of infestation and the severity of imposes. It is possible that, in these cases, compounds in the birds' excreta had caused imposes. These data have implications on the use of imposes as an indicator of environmental levels of TBT.

AB  - In Southwestern France, 245 sites were studied along eight rivers from their headwater to their mouth. On the whole, 420 exotic plant species were found in riparian corridors. The more invaded stream is the Adour River. These 420 exotic species show a large pattern of biogeographic, historical, morphological, ecological and biological attributes. Most of these exotics were not pre-adapted to riparian conditions. The structure of the corridor, the hydrological regime, the human impact, and the climate control the establishment and the development of exotic species in riparian zones.
   The percentage of exotics in the total species richness was studied in 32 sites along the Adour River. This percentage was not constant. It changed according to the environmental gradients identified along the river. The percentage of exotics reflects the vulnerability of riparian zones to plant invasions, and it can be used as an indicator of riparian system dysfunction.

AB  - Urbanization induces changes in species abundance and richness that are beginning to be extensively described. However, the functional structure of urban communities still requires attention to provide a basis for a more accurate understanding of urban ecosystems' functioning. This study has been performed in order to assess functional changes in ecological communities related to changes of urban landscape features along an urbanization gradient. Species abundance and richness of birds and butterflies in the city parks of Marseille (south-east France) have been used to assess these changes. On the basis of easily accessible traits (reproduction parameters, size, feeding habits), we have examined whether different contexts of urbanization favour some strategies more than others. Some differences occur between butterflies and birds in terms of species abundance and richness through the urbanization gradient, showing that at least some species of birds manage to colonize city centre and/or exploit urban resources better than butterflies. But our results also clearly reveal general patterns in biological traits for both birds and butterflies that further reflect the gradient of urban features from outskirts to city centre. Species associated with the city centre tolerate a wide range of conditions whereas species associated with city outskirts have more specialized abilities. Urbanization acts as an environmental filter for bird and butterfly communities selecting species able to colonize and settle in the city centre on the basis of their biological traits. In our context, environmental filters induce a biotic homogenization with urbanization through loss of species (taxonomic homogenization) and over-representation of generalist species (functional homogenization). This homogenization reflects an underlying process of disruption of biotic interactions for butterflies and birds. This study has enabled us to identify a combination of biological traits sensitive to urban features that may represent useful indicators for both theoretical and applied purposes in order to understand the impact of urbanization on animal communities.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the relationship between concentration of metals in the host-parasite system (cod acanthocephalan Echinorhynchus gadi) and Fulton's condition factor (FCF) of the host. The relationship between metal (Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb, Sr, Zn) concentrations in E. gadi and cod tissues was expressed as a bioconcentration factor (BCF), the ratio of the concentration in the parasite tissue to that in host tissues. Acanthocephalans accumulated mainly toxic metals (Cd, Pb), as well as Sr, Ca, Na. Cadmium showed the highest bioconcentration in parasites (BCF>200) compared to fish muscle. Significant negative correlation was detected between FCF and the concentration of Cd and Hg in cod liver. In contrast, FCF was positively correlated with the concentration of Hg in acanthocephalan tissues. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The temporal and spatial dynamics of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi were investigated in a desert ecosystem. Soil samples under the canopy of Zygophyllum dumosum were collected monthly between November 1999 and October 2000 from 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths. VAM fungal colonization and spore density were used to compare the responses of VAM fungi to soil conditions. The mean percent colonization and spore density of VAM fungi reached maximal values in November 1999 and September 2000. Soil moisture was positively correlated with colonization of VAM structure groups. Vesicular and arbuscular colonization were positively correlated with soil organic. matter and total soluble N. Spore density was also positively correlated with total soluble N. Our results suggest that spore density and the extent of vesicular and arbuscular colonization are useful indicators for evaluating changes in desert soil ecosystems.

AB  - River ecosystems world-wide are affected by altered flow regimes, and advanced science and practice of environmental flows have been developed to understand and reduce these impacts. But most environmental flows approaches ignore flow intermittency, which is a natural feature of 30% of the global river network length. Ignoring flow intermittency when setting environmental flows in naturally intermittent rivers might lead to deleterious ecological effects.
   We review evidence of the ecological effects of flow intermittency and provide guidance to incorporate intermittency (non-flow events) into existing methods judged as suitable for application in temporary waterways.
   To better integrate non-flow events into hydrological methods, we propose a suite of new indicators to be used in the range of variability approach. These indicators reflect dry periods and the unpredictable nature of temporary waterways. We develop a predictability index for protecting those species adapted to temporary conditions.
   For hydraulic-habitat models, we find that mesohabitat methods are particularly effective for describing complex habitat dynamics during dry phases. We present an example of the European eel to show the relationship between discharge and non-flow days and wet area, habitat suitability and connectivity.
   We find that existing holistic approaches may be applied to temporary waterways without significant structural alteration to their stepwise frameworks, but new component methods are needed to address flow-related aspects across both flow and non-flow periods of the flow regime.
   Synthesis and applications. Setting environmental flow requirements for temporary waterways requires modification and enhancement of existing approaches and methodologies, most notably the explicit consideration of non-flow events and greater integration of specific geomorphic, hydrogeologic and hydraulic elements. Temporary waterways are among the freshwater ecosystems most vulnerable to alterations in flow regimes, and they are also under great pressure. The methodological modifications recommended in this paper will aid water managers in protecting key components of temporary flow regimes, thereby preserving their unique ecology and associated services.

AB  - For many species of marine megafauna, strandings remain the most important source of biological samples. Because of their opportunistic nature however, strandings data have long been under- or misused in the assessment of population conservation status. Even if many national and international regulations promote the use of strandings in monitoring strategies, the interpretation of strandings remains controversial. The aim of this study is to provide a context for the interpretation of marine megafauna stranding data, in order to assess the achievement of specific objectives against Good Environmental Status criteria in the context of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive or other regional agreements. The first step is to construct an a priori spatial distribution under a null hypothesis HO. The a priori spatial distribution of theoretical dead animals can either be set uniformly, consistent with current knowledge on abundance of marine vertebrates, or based on management objectives. The drift prediction of these theoretical carcasses would provide a time series of strandings expected under the null hypothesis. The reverse drift of observed strandings would highlight mortality areas of stranded animals. The correction of these areas by the probability of getting stranded according to drift conditions would provide an estimated distribution of dead animals inferred from strandings. The differences between expected and observed situations constitute anomalies and highlight cases where inferred distribution departs from the a priori spatial distribution. This work proposes several population indicators that can be used anywhere in the world and can be applied for all large marine vertebrates found stranded. The integration of these indicators in MSFD and various regional agreements could provide cost-effective and relevant information on protected species. In the context of impaired ecological situations, the complementary use of several population indicators could strengthen the diagnosis made regarding conservation status and hence conservation strategies.

AB  - Data-rich restoration experiments offer opportunities to test the ability of bioassessment tools, such as those currently used to assess the ecological status' of waterbodies targeted by the European Water Framework Directive, to detect observed ecological changes. Minimum flow increases in four regulated reaches of the French Rhone River modified the invertebrate and fish communities in a predictable way, as detailed in other articles of this Special Issue. We tested the ability of several fish and macroinvertebrate metrics currently used in bioassessment to detect these changes. In addition, we considered changes in metrics that are expected to respond specifically to flow increase. These metrics were related to the habitat requirements of species, the ecological specialisation of communities and the abundance of macroinvertebrate functional groups (seen as surrogates for ecosystem attributes). For invertebrate communities, bioassessment metrics based on richness had equivocal responses to restoration and the Potamon-Type Index demonstrated no or contradictory responses to restoration. The French biotic index was not sensitive to restoration and instead depicted spatial differences in biological quality. For fish communities, the French fish index was marginally sensitive in the reach with the largest minimum flow increase and some of its metrics were sensitive in other reaches. Contrasting with commonly used bioassessment indices and metrics, several metrics related to habitat requirements appropriately indicated the observed changes in community structure. Large flow changes increased the proportion of fish and macroinvertebrate individuals with preferences for midstream habitats, fast currents, deep waters and/or coarse substrates. However, these changes did not translate into the expected increase in ecological specialisation. In addition, functional metrics indicated that restoration led to higher proportions of grazers and higher availability of suspended food for filtering collectors, suggesting a return to the ecological conditions of a large river. The mixed and potentially contradictory responses of the different metrics confirm the difficulty of establishing benchmarks for ecological indicators in large-regulated rivers and the need to design appropriate bioassessment metrics.

AB  - In this study we investigated the spatial distribution of the plankton community, bacterio-, phyto-, and zooplankton, in relation with environmental conditions along the intertidal coast of the Rio de la Plata estuary, Argentina. Plankton was analyzed in terms of species composition, abundance, biomass (carbon content), and size-structure. We aim to evaluate the potential effects of anthropogenic impacts (e.g., nutrient enrichment) and physicochemical gradients alongshore (e.g., salinity, turbidity) on the composition and functioning of the plankton. We asked whether the natural structuring of the plankton by salinity and turbidity, known to be true of estuaries, is modified by eutrophication along the studied shoreline. We found that the density and biomass of bacteria and phytoplankton were strikingly enhanced by high eutrophication levels along the intertidal southwest coast of the Rio de la Plata estuary. We also found that the highest zooplankton density in the most polluted area but the biomass showed a different distribution pattern. Nevertheless, when zooplankton was analyzed by means of its size fraction, we accordingly found that the microzooplankton biomass was positively associated with smaller-size phytoplankton groups and the most polluted study sites. Copepods were the major taxonomic groups that best represented the mesozooplankton biomass. We therefore expected that its distribution was modulated by the presence of its food items (i.e., large cells) which, in turn, were more abundant in the middle-outer zone. In contrast, we found that the highest biomass of copepods occurred at the innermost site of the estuary and we found no significant association with other planktonic groups. Overall, this study highlights the noteworthy impacts of human activities modifying the functioning of this coastal ecosystem. The differences found in the taxonomic composition and size structure of the planktonic community assemblage between the most polluted and less polluted sites constitutes excellent baseline for considering plankton as ecological an indicator of water quality.

AB  - Ostracoda (microscopic, aquatic Crustacea) from brackish waters have a great potential for ecological monitoring and palaeoenvironmental analyses in highly variable environments. This has been proven in many articles during recent decades but their potential has yet to be fully developed or utilised. The analysis of ostracod assemblage composition, species distributions, eco-phenotypic variability and the analysis of stable isotopes and trace elements in ostracod shells provide valuable information on present and past water salinity, temperature and chemistry, hydrodynamic conditions, substrate characteristics, climate, sea level variations, oxygen and nutrient availability. This article provides an overview on the application of ostracods from brackish waters for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction in the Quaternary and for environmental studies in present day environments.

AB  - Arid areas are faced with frequent droughts and sandstorms, and through variations of the harsh natural conditions. Urban green space is an important ecological infrastructure to improve the harsh climate, but green space system planning often exposes strong subjectivity. The suitability evaluation of urban green space can be based on the powerful spatial analysis capabilities of GIS, through investigation and comprehensive analysis of the suitability of the land for various uses, the level of quality and its restriction status, etc., so as to classify and grade the ecological functions of urban green space. Taking Beitun city in Xinjiang Province as an example, according to local conditions, evaluation factors were selected from five aspects: wetland resources, flora and fauna habitat, landscape features, anthropogenic disturbance and temperature risk; the factor weights were determined by analytic hierarchy process; a green space suitability evaluation system based on three levels of "target-criterionindex" was established, and on this basis. Using the GIS spatial overlay analysis module, five levels of urban green space ecological suitability zones were delineated: the most suitable green area (23.6%); the high-suitability area (32.1%); the mid-suitability area (21.6%); the low-suitability area (14.5%); and the unsuitable area (8.2%), Combined with the current situation of land use and the demand of urban development in Beitun city, the functional zoning of urban green space ecological facilities arc divided into a green ecological restoration area, a green ecological conservation area, low-and medium-impact development areas and a green suitable development area; on a scientific basis, allocation of green space resources and protection countermeasures are proposed to construct green space in each area as part of the theoretical guidance for Beitun. The results show that appropriate indicators and methods can more accurately reflect the actual and demand of urban green space development in arid areas, and play a practical guiding role. The research provides a useful attempt and supplement for the practice and application of the method of division of green space ecological suitability in arid cities.

AB  - Shenbei district of Shenyang city, Liaoning province, northeast China is a typical urban-rural (peri-urban) fringe of a megacity that is undergoing rapid urban expansion and the intensification of agricultural management, which threatens the quality of shallow groundwater in the area. This study selects proper indices relevant to vulnerability, stress, function, and adaptability based on the results of groundwater monitoring and the collection and processing of hydrogeological data. Based on the theory of natural disaster risk, an evaluation index system was then established, followed by constructing a groundwater environmental-risk assessment model. Next, the model was used to perform environmental risk grading and spatial pattern assessment on the groundwater based on the statistics and spatial analysis function of ArcGIS. The assessment results were then subjected to a correlation analysis with land use indices and socioeconomic indices, to explore the effects of natural geological conditions, urban expansion and intensive agricultural management on groundwater environment. The results of the study will provide support for land use optimization and water environmental management decision-making during the development and construction of the urban-rural fringe of the area. The results of the study showed that: (1) the spatial distribution of groundwater environmental risk of the Shenbei district is similar to that of groundwater vulnerability. At present, geological conditions are still the main influential factors of groundwater environmental risk in the region; (2) the scale and intensity of urbanization and intensive agricultural management have shown an obvious potential risk to the groundwater environment; (3) the large area paddy fields in the northwest have certain ecological function value, which should be further protected to ensure a win-win situation of agricultural production and environmental safety; (4) it is necessary to put more environmental protection efforts such as ensuring natural vegetation protection, strengthening artificial afforestation, and increasing the number of waste water treatment facilities during the urbanization process, as these measures are significantly effective in maintaining the groundwater quality.

AB  - Forest biogeocenosis is a necessary environment for the normal existence of many species of wild animals, including birds. Recently, however, a gradual decrease in their numbers is observed in most forest areas of the Forest-Steppe zone.
   This indicator is one of the most important criteria for estimation of the general condition of this or that ecosystem. In this regard, specialists-zoologists, ornithologists, etc. pay great attention to the study of this issue (Koval' N.F. 1982).
   Currently, there is a quite extensive and often conflicting material regarding the number of birds. The most fundamental is the book by D. Lack, "The number of animals and its regulation in nature" (1957), which shows the influence of the food supply, the number of nesting places, "shelters", and enemies on the reproductive ability, survival and general dynamics of the number of many bird species. Determining the breeding intensity of specific species populations of bird, we proposed to use the so-called productivity coefficient, which allows us to compare both the degree of biomass stability over the breeding period during a number of years and its geographical differences. The total number of birds on nesting can be different in various parts of the range under the influence of environmental conditions. The number of birds nesting on the ground and in the underwood has recently decreased significantly due to the large recreational burden of forest cenoses. Consideration of the dynamics of the number of daytime predatory birds and owls is of special attention. Their numbers have recently stabilized, although it continues to decline in some regions according to the available literary data. Ornithologists consider this mainly as a consequence of environmental pollution, killing of birds by humans, destruction of their habitats. The number of animal populations, for example, can vary significantly during the year or on average over the years. It is determined by the breeding rate and mortality of individuals.
   The breeding rate of birds is directly dependent on the size of egg laying, the success of eggs brooding and the percentage of flying out of viable young animals, which in total determines the success of breeding.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether water quality parameters commonly associated with primary productivity may be used to predict the susceptibility of a specific water body to exceed proposed fish consumption advisory limitation of 0.3 mg kg(-1). South Dakota currently has nine lakes and impoundments that exceed fish tissue mercury advisory limits of 1.0 mg kg(-1) total mercury, far exceeding US Environmental Protection Agency and Food and Drug Administration 0.3 mg kg(-1) consumption criteria. Previous studies suggest that increased aquatic productivity may mitigate the effects of biological production and subsequent uptake of methyl mercury through bio-dilution; however, it is uncertain whether these trends may exist within highly alkaline and highly productive aquatic conditions common to South Dakota lakes and impoundments. Water quality parameters and fish tissue mercury data for northern pike and walleye were collected and assessed using existing South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources and Game Fish and Parks data. The data was initially screened using both parametric linear regression and non-parametric Mann-Whitney rank sum comparisons and further assessed using binary logistic regression and stepwise logistic regression methodology. Three separate phosphorus measurements (total, total dissolved, and Trophic State Index) and pH were determined to significantly correlate with increased mercury concentrations for the northern pike-in-impoundments model. However, phosphorus surprisingly was not a strong predictor for the remaining scenarios modeled. For the northern pike-in-natural lakes models, alkalinity was the most significant water quality parameter predicting increased mercury concentrations. Mercury concentrations for the walleye-in-natural lakes models were further influenced by pH and alkalinity. The water quality and fish tissue mercury interrelationships determined within this study suggest aquatic productivity, and consequential eutrophication processes appear to be reasonable indicators of fish tissue mercury susceptibility for aquatic conditions common to South Dakota and highlight the continuing need to minimize eutrophication through effective watershed management strategies.

AB  - Purpose The objective of this study was to determine the long-term environmental changes induced by ancient landslide in the mountain fen. Attempts were made to demonstrate the progress of the soil cover restoration process about 200 years after the landslides and associated with changes in vegetation and soil microarthropod biodiversity and occurrence pattern associated with the restoration of soil cover. Material and methods The study covered mountain fen of the Caltho-Alnetum in the Babiogorski National Park in Outer Flysch Carpathians, Poland, where ancient landslide deposits are causing disturbance in fen hydrologic regime and over time related to various rate of fen area natural restoration processes. The drill test has been used to assess changes in layering and thickness of the fen soils. The following soil parameters, such as pH and total organic carbon content, were determined at each distinguish layer. The diversity and distribution pattern of soil microarthropods, represented by Collembola, was examined in two parts of the fen: restored and not-restored. The soil parameters, such as pH, electrical conductivity, total exchangeable base, total organic carbon, and nitrogen content, were determined in the soil samples simultaneously. The assessment of the vegetation structure recovery within studied mountain fen after landslide was referred to average parameters of the community completed for other natural mountain fens under the Caltho-Alnetum community. The research results were statistically verified. Results and discussion The test drillings showed that landslides change soil layering, site-specific soil properties of mountain fen such as chemistry (the statistically significant differences were noted only in the case of total organic carbon content), vegetation structure, and soil microarthropod communities. By changing site-specific conditions, landslides influence on the biodiversity and peatland ecosystems functioning. Conclusion Our results clearly demonstrate that the landslide itself initiated a complex and lengthy process of changes in biological aspects of peatlands including the biodiversity of the underground fauna and plant community. Soil microarthropod communities represented by Collembola can be used as a good indicator of mountain fen restoration process.

AB  - Ecological data obtained from field plots can provide detailed information about ecosystem structure and function. However, this information typically reflects processes that occur over small spatial areas. Accordingly, it is difficult to extrapolate these data to patterns and processes that take place at regional scales. Satellite imagery can provide a means to explore environmental variables over a larger area. Therefore, our main objective was to examine the utility of a regional ecological assessment tool using landscape indicators of ecosystem health in a rapidly developing area of West Georgia near the city of Columbus. Indicator variables included in the assessment were: population density and change, road density, percent forest land-cover, forest patch density, landscape Shannon's Diversity Index, proportion of all streams with roads within 30 m, proportion of area that has agriculture on slopes >3%, proportion of all streams with adjacent agriculture, and proportion of all streams with adjacent forest cover. Cluster analysis was used to combine these variables into different groups, and resulting cluster means were used to rank regional areas according to degree of environmental impact. To assess the spatial accuracy of this tool results were compared to those obtained from a separate plot-level field-based forest condition Study. Results derived using the landscape ecological assessment tool suggest that rural areas were the least environmentally impacted (or most healthy) of all areas in West Georgia, and support the findings from the field study. Results for developing areas were mixed between the two different studies and may be attributed to differences in scale. Overall, it appears that this tool is useful for broad generalizations about a given landscape, but is not detailed enough for site-specific management goals due to its inherent coarse spatial resolution (30 m x 30 m). However, these site-specific goals may be achieved using higher resolution (1 m x 1 m) satellite imagery and warrants further research. In any case, this tool is a useful asset for anyone needing a rapid diagnosis of ecosystem health in an inexpensive and timely manner. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We describe broadly applicable principles for the conservation of wild living resources and mechanisms for their implementation. These principles were engendered from three starting points. First, a set of principles for the conservation of wild living resources (Holt and Talbot 1978) required reexamination and updating. Second, those principles lacked mechanisms for implementation and consequently were not as effective as they might have been. Third, all conservation problems have scientific, economic, and social aspects, and although the mix may vary from problem to problem, all three aspects must be included in problem solving. We illustrate the derivation of, and amplify the meaning of, the principles, and discuss mechanisms for their implementation.
   The principles are:
   Principle I. Maintenance of healthy populations of wild living resources in perpetuity is inconsistent with unlimited growth of human consumption of and demand for those resources.
   Principle II. The goal of conservation should be to secure present and future options by maintaining biological diversity at genetic, species, population, and ecosystem levels; as a general rule neither the resource nor other components of the ecosystem should be perturbed beyond natural boundaries of variation.
   Principle III. Assessment of the possible ecological and sociological effects of resource use should precede both proposed use and proposed restriction or expansion of ongoing use of a resource.
   Principle IV. Regulation of the use of living resources must be based on understanding the structure and dynamics of the ecosystem of which the resource is a part and must take into account the ecological and sociological influences that directly and indirectly affect resource use.
   Principle V. The full range of knowledge and skills from the natural and social sciences must be brought to bear on conservation problems.
   Principle VI. Effective conservation requires understanding and taking account of the motives, interests, and values of all users and stakeholders, but not by simply averaging their positions.
   Principle VII. Effective conservation requires communication that is interactive, reciprocal, and continuous.
   Mechanisms for implementation of the principles are discussed.

AB  - The percentage of phenolic containing cells (PCC) and total phenolics in the leaves of different ecotypes of three ecological important grass species were determined during cultivation under uniform environmental conditions. Results obtained clearly indicate that ecotypes of these species exhibit a significant degree of variation with regard to percentage PCC and total phenolics. Furthermore, no anti-herbivory function can be assigned to phenolic compounds in these species, as ecotypes with Decreaser-species ecological status (highly palatable) have higher levels of total phenolics, compared with other less palatable ecotypes with lower levels of total phenolics. Percentage PCC and total phenolics represent two of various ecological important characteristics to be used in conjunction with other ecological characters to construct a usable, special purpose classification system. This system will assist rangeland ecologists in identifying functional ecotypes within grass species, thus facilitating the understanding and interpretation of vegetation dynamic models and rangeland condition assessments.

Due to this biological invasion, Argentina and Chile signed an agreement to restore affected ecosystems by eradicating beavers. In southern Patagonia, the beavers' ecological impacts are well studied, but there is a relative lack of information on how their invasion (and potential removal) could affect bird communities. In the southern portion of Tierra del Fuego's 'big island' (Isla Grande), we conducted passive acoustic monitoring and avian point counts in intact riparian forests, beaver ponds and beaver meadows (i.e. drained ponds) to assess spatial and seasonal differences in acoustic activity and avian abundance, species diversity and functional diversity. During spring and summer, acoustic activity was significantly higher in meadows than in forests, with ponds exhibiting intermediate values. Abundance and species diversity exhibited similar patterns, driven largely by resident passerines, while functional diversity tended to be highest in ponds, largely due to ducks and raptors. Effects were weaker in fall and winter. Acoustic metrics exhibited moderate to strong correlations with all point-count-derived metrics. Synthesis and applications. At the patch level, the avian community was more abundant and diverse in beaver-modified habitats than in intact riparian forests, though communities in modified patches may not differ substantially from those in analogous natural open and wetland habitats. Dam breaching and pond drainage did not yield a return to an intact forest bird community, indicating that active reforestation may be necessary to restore avian communities to pre-beaver conditions in the short to medium term, as sought by the binational agreement. Given the immense challenges of eradication and restoration, its social-ecological costs and benefits-including those related to avifauna-should be thoroughly considered in establishing goals or indicators of success.

AB  - Water accounts aim to capture the value of water resources and their use within the economy. The accounts complement the National Accounts as the latter's main indicator (GDP) does not reflect changes in natural capital. Botswana developed water accounts for the period 2010/11-2014/15 using the UN's standard System of Environmental Economic Accounting for water (SEEA-water). The article focuses both on the construction of physical flow accounts as well as on the policy implications for development planning and water resource management through the use of policy indicators. It also shows long-term trends in water abstraction and water use efficiency linking the SEEA water accounts with results of earlier (non-SEEA) water accounting projects in Botswana. The water accounts results show that water abstraction and consumption have been largely stable since 2010/11 despite population (1.9% p.a.) and economic growth (around 5% p.a.) likely due to a combination of water sector reforms and drought conditions in south eastern Botswana; the latter led to the drying up of several dams and the imposition of severe water restrictions. While public attention focuses mostly on water service providers, self providers (mines and the agricultural sector) account for more than 50% of total water abstracted from the environment of water, demonstrating the need to pay more attention to self-providers in IWRM implementation. Water consumption is highest for the agricultural sector (70.2 Mm(3)) followed by households and mines at 41.2 and 39 Mm(3) respectively in 2014/15. In terms of water use efficiency, value added per m(3) has increased in time, showing (some) decoupling of water consumption and economic growth. This positive trend needs to be enhanced in the pursuit of economic diversification, which should focus on growth of water-efficient economic sectors. Finally, per capita water consumption has decreased over time; while this may indicate that people conserve water, it may also point at delivery problems associated with water sector reforms. This requires further analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment (ERA) is a process that evaluates the potential for adverse ecological effects occurring as a result of exposure to contaminants or other stressors. ERA begins with hazard identification/problem formulation, progresses to effects and exposure assessment, and finishes with risk characterization (an estimate of the incidence and severity of any adverse effects likely to occur). Risk management initially sets die boundaries of the ERA. and then uses its results for decision-making. Key information required for an ERA includes: the emissions, pathways and rates of movement of contaminants in the environment; and, information on the relationship between contaminant concentrations and the incidence and (or) severity of adverse effects. Because of specific properties and characteristics of metals in general and of certain metals in particular, a generalized ERA process applicable to organic substances is inappropriate for metals. First, metals are naturally occurring and can arise, sometimes in very high concentrations, from non-anthropogenic sources; organisms can and do adapt to a wide range of metal concentrations. Second, certain metals (e.g., copper, zinc) are essential for biotic health, which means there is an effect threshold for both deficiency and excess, and dial standard body burden indices such as bioaccumulation factors (BCFs) can be misleading. Third, metals can occur in the environment in a variety of forms that are more or less available to biota but adverse biological effects can only occur if metals are or may become bioavailable. Fourth, whereas the bioavailability and hence the possibility of toxicity of persistent organic substances are mainly dependent on their intrinsic properties (i.e., lipophilicity), those of metals are generally controlled by external environmental conditions. Examples include pH and ligands, which affect the metal speciation and coexisting cations (e.g., H+, Ca2+) which compete with the metal ions. ERAs involving metals must include the above four major considerations; other considerations vary depending on whether the ERA is for a site, a region, or is global in scope.

AB  - Tea, Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze, is grown conventionally (application of chemical fertilizer and pesticides) as well as organically in Darjeeling hills and adjoining plains. Studies on parasitic Hymenoptera gain relevance due to their effective role as biocontrol agents for maintenance of ecological balance and as biological indicators of health of tea agro-ecosystem. Diversity of the hymenopterans was studied using Shannon-Weaver index (1963) both at morphospecies and family levels. The analysis reflected the changing diversity of this group with season, pesticide application and the condition of the tea crop. It further indicated that mainly four parasitoid groups such as braconids, ichneumonids, eulophids and scelionids, showed greater diversity in organic plantation as compared to conventional. Since species (= RTU : recognizable taxonomic unit) diversity and family diversity indices agreed with one another a surrogacy based system (family for RTU) could be adopted for diversity analysis.

AB  - A method is presented for quantification of aquatic nature conservation value based on desmid assemblages present. Species richness (indicative of internal structural and functional differentiation of the ecosystem), the occurrence of rare taxa (often indicative of particular environmental conditions) and the presence of species indicative of ecosystem maturity are the parameters chosen to determine conservation value. For the sake of utility, schemes have been developed to transform the values scored for the various parameters to a simple scale ranging From 0 to 10, relative to regional and historical standards. By way of illustration, two examples are presented. The first shows the decline of desmid-related conservation value along a gradient of increasing eutrophication in a series of interconnected shallow lakes, the other illustrates the course of this value through time in a polluted and subsequently restored moorland pool.

AB  - 1. Focal species (i.e. indicators, keystones, umbrellas, and flagships) have been advocated for the management and conservation of natural environments.
   2. The assumption has been that the presence or abundance of a focal species is a means to understanding the composition and/or state of the more complex community.
   3. We review the characteristics of focal species, and evaluate their appropriateness and utility judged against conservation objectives.
   4. It appears that indicator species (of both composition and condition) may be of greatest general utility, and that several types of focal species may exhibit useful indicator properties. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Sub-halocline oxygen conditions in the deep Baltic Sea basins depend on natural forcing and anthropogenic impact. HELCOM has a long tradition of characterizing the status of the seabed and deep waters by estimating the extent of anoxic and hypoxic bottoms. A eutrophication-related indicator "oxygen debt" has been used in the recent HELCOM assessments and a more sophisticated "oxygen consumption" indicator has been introduced. We describe the oxygen conditions in the Gulf of Finland (GoF) in 2016-2017 based on observations at the Keri profiling station where vertical profiles of temperature, salinity and oxygen were acquired up to 8 times a day. The main aim of the study is to test the applicability of high-frequency data from this fixed automated station and the three adapted oxygen indicators for the eutrophication-related status assessments. The results show that the GoF bottom area affected by hypoxia varied in large ranges from 900 to 7800 km(2) with a seasonal maximum in autumn (> 25% of bottoms were hypoxic in autumn 2016). Oxygen debt is the simplest indicator, and the assessment results are less influenced by the wind-induced changes in hydrographic conditions. We suggest that oxygen debt should be assessed just below the halocline and based on data from the stratified season only since, in the GoF, the halocline could be destroyed in winter. For the "oxygen consumption" indicator, a rough oxygen budget, where the contributions of advection and mixing are included, was formulated. Average seasonal consumption values of 0.82 and 0.31 mg.l(-1).month(-1) were estimated in the 50-60 m water layer of the GoF in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The found large difference in consumption values between 2016 and 2017 could partly be related to the uncertainties of advection estimates. We concluded that all three indicators have their advantages and methodological challenges. To increase the confidence of eutrophication assessments both high-frequency profiling should be implemented in the monitoring programs and more accurate estimates of changes due to physical processes are required.

AB  - We present an approach for monitoring and forecasting landscape level indicators of the condition of protected area (PA) ecosystems including changes in snowcover, vegetation phenology and productivity using the Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS). TOPS is a modeling framework that integrates operational satellite data, microclimate mapping, and ecosystem simulation models to characterize ecosystem status and trends. We have applied TOPS to investigate trends and patterns in landscape indicators using test cases at both national and park-level scales to demonstrate the potential utility of TOPS for supporting efforts by the National Park Service to develop standardized indicators for protected area monitoring. Our analysis of coarse resolution satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements for North America from 1982-2006 indicates that all but a few PAs are located in areas that exhibited a sustained decline in vegetation condition. We used Yosemite National Park as our park-level test case, and while no significant trends in NDVI were detected during the same period, evidence of drought-induced vegetation mortality and recovery patterns dominated the 25 year record. In our Yosemite analysis, we show that analyzing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products (vegetation indices, absorbed radiation, land surface temperature and gross primary production) in conjunction with ground-based measurements, such as runoff, lends additional utility to satellite-based monitoring of ecosystems indicators, as together they provide a comprehensive view of ecosystem condition. Analyses of MODIS products from 2001-2006 show that year-to-year changes in the onset of spring at Yosemite were as large as 45 days, and this signal in the satellite data record is corroborated by observed changes in spring runoff patterns. Finally, we applied TOPS to assess long-term climate impacts on ecosystem condition at the scale of an individual park. When driven by projected climatic changes at Yosemite of 4-6 degrees C warming by 2100 with no changes in precipitation patterns, TOPS predicts significantly reduced winter snowpack and an earlier onset of the growing season, resulting in prolonged summer drought and reduced vegetation productivity.

AB  - Large-scale peat extraction, in Finland and elsewhere, typically takes place on rather small extraction sites but has major impacts on surrounding aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The environmental conditions prior to drainage (baseline conditions) must be quantified in a statutory environmental impact assessment (EIA), but this is generally difficult due to lack of historical data. In this study, we developed and tested a method for EIA based on a reference area approach and remote sensing. The method calculates the normalized difference vegetation index in preextraction and postextraction periods using Landsat images of affected areas and reference surrounding areas. In a case study, we applied the method to assess changes after peat extraction at a site in northern Finland. The peat extraction area showed significant transformation from peatland vegetation to bare soil. Adjacent areas downstream and upstream were also affected by extraction. These results indicate that our method is a useful tool for EIA of peatland drainage.

AB  - This study presents a multi-proxy reconstruction of the evolution of Smolak Lake from harmonic to dystrophic conditions. The lake's history and environmental conditions, such as zooplankton and vegetation compositions, trophic state, water temperature and water level fluctuations, are discussed. Smolak Lake is located in the southern part of the Masurian Lakeland, northern Poland. A 350 cm core comprising thick sediments (Sm profile) are mainly composed of homogenous organic gyttja and dy was taken from the lake and analysed for geochemical and biological (cladoceran and pollen) proxies. Radiocarbon data show that the sediments accumulated from the Late Glacial (Younger Dryas period) to recent times. Based on the results of pollen data, six local pollen assemblage zones were recognized. The subfossil cladoceran fauna in the sediments are represented by 25 species belonging to four families. Five zones of Cladocera development were distinguished. The Cladocera species indicate the initial oligotrophic status of the lake and its subsequent slight increase in trophic status. From similar to 9000 yr cal BP (at the beginning of the Atlantic period), Smolak Lake began a fast transition to a dystrophic state. At this time, the amount of total organic carbon (TOC) in the sediments significantly increased to above 50%, and deposits containing more than 97% water were transformed into dy. The sedimentation rate was extremely low, i.e., 0.08-0.2 mm/yr. Dystrophic conditions are also reflected in the Cladocera and pollen found in the core during this period: Cladocera composition was dominated by species very resistant to acid conditions (e.g., Alonella excisa); the abundance of green algae was at its lowest level and dominated by only one genus (Botryococcus); no hydrophytes were found; and rush vegetation disappeared. Currently, Smolak Lake is a shallow, humic lake characterized by brown water and the presence of floating mats. This study shows that it's current status is a result of it's small, relatively undisturbed catchment, which should be protected in order to maintain this unique dystrophic habitat.

AB  - Soil ecosystem functions underpin many ecosystem services. Understanding the drivers of these functions and their stability in response to disturbance is important given land-use intensification and the predicted increase in disturbance frequency with climate change. Changes in land use and soil abiotic conditions are likely to impact on soil ecosystem functions and their stability, but the effects of changes in soil microbial community structure (i.e. traits, diversity, composition and biomass) are poorly understood. We measured soil abiotic properties, microbial community structure, ecosystem functions (carbon and nutrient cycling) and the stability of functions in response to a dry-rewet cycle, across a land-use gradient consisting of natural forest, planted forest, high- and low-producing grassland, and vineyards. Results from additive modelling, where explanatory variables were added in a hierarchical manner and retained if significant (land use followed by abiotic variables followed by biotic variables), showed that measures of soil microbial community structure were the only variables able to explain variation in several measures of stability. In contrast, microbial community structure was rarely able to explain further variation in functions measured under static conditions once land use and abiotic factors were accounted for. Consistent with current theory, correlation analysis indicated that fungal:bacterial ratios were negatively related to measures of carbon and nutrient cycling, whereas the Gram-positive:Gram-negative ratio was positively related to measures of nutrient cycling and stability. In contrast to current theory, the fungal:bacterial ratio was negatively related to the resistance of soil water-soluble N contents to drying. Our results show that measures of microbial community structure can be good indicators of a wide range of soil functions and their stability in response to a dry-rewet cycle. Further, they suggest that soil microbial community structure may have a far greater influence on process rates under disturbed, compared to static, conditions. The delivery of ecosystem services in the future may therefore be strongly dependent on the characteristics of the soil microbial community.

AB  - We employ a nonparametric distribution dynamics approach to examine the long-run trend of particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution in China. Analysis of the data from 288 Chinese prefectural and above (PAA) level cities over the 2001?2019 period shows evidence of convergence in the estimated long-run distribution of air pollution, which is consistent with Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis (EKC). However, presence of strong persistence suggests that convergence process takes considerable time. Conditioning analysis shows that China?s environment policy since 2013 has been successful in driving the air pollution in several cities to converge to a lower level. Furthermore, we uncover a poverty-environment trap in the estimated long-run distribution. Our analysis highlights the need for targeted environmental policies in heterogeneous city clusters in China. Lessons learned from China?s experience can also be useful to policy makers in other developing countries.

AB  - People derive benefits from river networks under free flowing conditions, through ecosystem services such as fishery yield, floodplain agriculture, desirable geomorphic form, and the cultural significance of native riverine biodiversity. However, water management decisions have historically emphasized the production of ecosystem services such as hydropower and irrigation that depend on the construction of extensive infrastructure. Such decisions typically impose tradeoffs that reduce benefits from free flowing services, yet neither these losses nor the costs of future ecosystem rehabilitation have been well represented in decision support analyses. Ecosystem service assessments can and should account for benefits in the absence of water infrastructure to inform balanced water policy and watershed management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecological problems are mainly caused by growth processes. The energy input is a key indicator for ecosystems. In this context, the use of the most valuable kind of energy is of special importance. Economic systems may be considered as special ecosystems. The most valuable kind of energy used in economic systems of industrialised countries is electricity. For some industrialised countries the growth pattern of electricity consumption and its relation to the gross domestic product is considered in this contribution. A linear relation between both indicators for about 3 decades after the Second World War and a coupling of these indicators starting at 1973 has been found. The aim of the contribution is to present this relation and to initiate a discussion about its reason and its interpretation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Biological invasions are pervasive in freshwater ecosystems, often causing native species to contract into areas that remain largely free from invasive species impacts. Predicting the location of such ecological refuges is challenging, because they are shaped by the habitat requirements of native and invasive species, their biotic interactions, and the spatial and temporal invasion patterns. Here, we investigated the spatial distribution and environmental drivers of refuges from invasion in river systems, by considering biotic interactions in geostatistical models accounting for stream network topology. We focused on Mediterranean amphibians negatively impacted by the invasive crayfishes Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus.
   Location River Sabor, NE Portugal.
   Methods We surveyed amphibians at 168 200-m stream stretches in 2015. Geostatistical models were used to relate the probabilities of occurrence of each species to environmental and biotic variables, while controlling for linear (Euclidean) and hydrologic spatial dependencies. Biotic interactions were specified using crayfish probabilities of occurrence extracted from previously developed geostatistical models. Models were used to map the distribution of potential refuges for the most common amphibian species, under current conditions and future scenarios of crayfish expansion.
   Results Geostatistical models were produced for eight out of 10 species detected, of which five species were associated with lower stream orders and only one species with higher stream orders. Six species showed negative responses to one or both crayfish species, even after accounting for environmental effects and spatial dependencies. Most amphibian species were found to retain large expanses of potential habitat in stream headwaters, but current refuges will likely contract under plausible scenarios of crayfish expansion.
   Main conclusions Incorporating biotic interactions in geostatistical modelling provides a practical and relatively simple approach to predict present and future distributions of refuges from biological invasion in stream networks. Using this approach, our study shows that stream headwaters are key amphibian refuges under invasion by alien crayfish.

AB  - Between June 2001 and December 2002, 18 hyporheic and groundwater bores were sampled for fauna and environmental data using phreatic traps. The bores were situated in three different natural geographic regions in Palatinate, Southwestern Germany.
   Faunal data correlated with the relative amount of detritus, bacterial abundances and the standard deviation of temperature, while very few and weak correlations were found with physical-chemical variables. Dissolved oxygen was assumed to be a limiting factor for most metazoans with a critical concentration at around 0.5-1 mg 1(-1).
   To quantify the strength of the hydrological exchange with surface water and its effects on fauna, a so-called GW-Fauna-Index was developed and calculated using the relative amount of detritus, standard deviation of temperature, and oxygen concentration. From all environmental data and on all spatial scales, this index best explained the total faunal abundance and taxonomic richness.
   To describe the availability of organic aliments in the groundwater, the terms of "alimonic" and "alimony" [from lat. alimonium = (food) supply] were proposed.
   Although stygofauna was different in the geographic regions investigated, the GW-Fauna-Index was independent from these regional particularities. Using the GW-Fauna-Index, three groups of groundwater habitats could be classified according to the alimonic conditions. From oligo-alimonic group I samples, fauna was mostly absent, while meso-alimonic group II samples were prevailingly populated by stygobites, and eu-alimonic group III samples by ubiquists and stygoxenes. Total abundances and taxonomic richness increased significantly from group I to group III. Group I samples were characterized by low index values, group II samples by intermediate and group III samples by high values.
   The GW-Fauna-Index provides promising perspectives for application, but needs some improvement. First of all, detritus should be analysed quantitatively and qualitatively, rather than semi-quantitatively. Also, a standard protocol for sampling has to be developed. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Conservation and protection of soil and water resources and Visual aspects of landscape, as well as the promotion of biodiversity, are some of the central tasks of environmental policy development and social politics in the future. One of the main questions is: 'which agricultural systems are able to guarantee sustained resource-conserving land use?' Based on the ecological risk concepts of the 1970s and 1980s, a potential impact model was developed using a universal assessment algorithm derived from fuzzy logic. The model estimated the potential impact of agricultural land use on ecosystem function using a few resource indicators. Intervention intensities of agricultural land-use are set in relation to site conditions and aggregated for each of several defined potential impact categories. The interpretation with respect to risk and the calculation of potential impact values are explained. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Palaeoenvironmental evolution of formation of Bayanjargalan oil shale: evidence from trace elements and biomarkers
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - The genetic type of the Bayanerhet Formation oil shale in the Bayanjargalan mine area is an inland lacustrine oil shale deposit. Inorganic element analysis and organic geochemical testing of oil shale samples collected in three boreholes show that the Bayanerhet Formation oil shale has relatively high organic contents, e.g., average TOC values of 6.53, 7.32 and 8.84 (corresponding to oil contents of 5.49%, 6.07% and 7.50%) in boreholes BJ3807, BJ3405 and BJ3005, respectively. Analysis of organic matter sources with biomarkers indicates that lower aquatic organisms such as algae contribute more to the organic matter than higher plants do. According to research on the values of Fe2O3/FeO, Rb/Sr and w (La) n/w (Yb)n in cores from the three boreholes, the Bayanjargalan oil shale is inferred to have formed in a humid paleoclimate with a relatively high sedimentation rate. In research on the evolution of the paleoaquifer in which the oil shale formed, the values of Fe3+/Fe2+, V/V+Ni, Ni/V, Ceanom and delta Ce are applied as sensitive indicators of the redox conditions in the aqueous medium. These values indicate that the Bayanjargalan oil shale formed in a water body with a weak redox environment. Moreover, the values of Ca/(Ca+Fe) and Sr/Ba and the values of gammacerane/alpha beta C30 hopane in biomarkers show that the oil shale was formed in a saltwater environment. Analysis of Mo and U shows high endogenous lake productivity, corresponding to high TOC, which suggests that the lacustrine productivity played an important role in organic matter enrichment. The Lower Cretaceous Bayanerhet Formation (K1bt) in the Bayanjargalan mine area encompasses a complete sequence and was formed during lowstand, transgression, highstand and regression periods. The dominant oil shale deposits were formed in the transgression system tract and high stand system tract, and these oil shales have a high oil content and stable occurrence. A large set of thick, high-TOC and high-oil-content oil shales in the second member of the Bayanerhet Formation was deposited under such conditions. The abundant terrigenous supply under warm and humid conditions significantly promoted the primitive biological productivity, and the weak redox saltwater environment had relatively high productivity. All the favorable conditions promoted the formation of high-quality oil shale.

AB  - We compared two indices of nutritional condition, the relative weight of the digestive gland (RWDG) and the ratio of weight to carapace length (weight/CL ratio), of the first three benthic phases, algal juveniles (725 mm CL), postalgal juveniles (25-45 mm CL), and subadults (45-79 mm CL) of Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) dwelling in a shelter-poor reef lagoon before (1995) and after (2005) deployment of large artificial shelters ("casitas") in 1998. To provide an experimental baseline, in 2005 we also conducted a laboratory experiment to assess the effect of starvation on both nutritional indices. Through 25-day trials, starvation significantly decreased the mean RWDG of all three juvenile phases, but did not affect their weight/CL ratios. in the field, casitas significantly enhanced juvenile lobsters relative to control sites and to prior values, but between 1995 and 2005 there was a significant decrease in condition of algal juveniles (both indices) and postalgal juveniles (only the RWDG), but not of subadults. These results would appear to counter previous findings that, for P. argus, food is not limiting and nutritional condition is not density-dependent. However, in 2000, a new pathogenic virus that has a distinct predilection for small juveniles, Panulirus argus Virus 1 (PaV1), emerged in the reef lagoon. Among other effects. this lethal virus causes a marked atrophy of the digestive gland. Through the laboratory trials and in the field, prevalence of visibly diseased individuals was highest in algal juveniles and lowest in subadults. These individuals were excluded from statistical analyses, but the disease progression may affect the digestive gland progressively given that newly infected lobsters take several weeks to become visibly diseased. Up to 2006, PaV1 had not significantly impacted lobster density on casita sites, but because P. argus is highly gregarious and transmission of PaV1 appears to be mainly by contact, futher investigation is required. These issues are relevant to enhancement of spiny lobsters and assessment of ecological impacts of marine diseases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stormwater infiltration systems (SIS) have been set up to collect and infiltrate urban stormwater runoff in order to reduce flooding and to artificially recharge aquifers. Such practices produce environmental changes in shallow groundwater ecosystems like an increase in organic matter concentrations that could drive changes in structure and functions of ground water microbial communities. Previous works suggested that SIS influence groundwater physico-chemistry during either rainy and dry period but no study has examined the impact of SIS on ground water microorganisms during both periods. This study aimed to fill this gap by assessing SIS impacts on groundwater quality parameters in three SIS with vadose zone thickness < 3 m during two contrasting meteorological conditions (rainy/dry periods). Physicochemical (dissolved organic carbon and nutrient concentrations) and microbial variables (biomass, dehydrogenase and hydrolytic activities, and bacterial community structure) were assessed on SIS-impacted and non-SIS-impacted zones of the aquifers for the three SIS. Using clay beads incubated in the aquifer to collect microbial biofilm, we show that SIS increased microbial activities, bacterial richness and diversity in groundwater biofilms during the rainy period but not during the dry period. In contrast, the significant differences in dissolved organic carbon and nutrient concentrations, biofilm biomass and bacterial community structures (Bray-Curtis distances, relative abundances of main bacterial orders) measured between SIS-impacted and non-SIS-impacted zones of the aquifer were comparable during the two periods. These results suggest that structural indicators of biofilm like biomass were probably controlled by long-term effects of SIS on concentrations of dissolved organic matter and nutrients whereas biofilm activities and bacterial richness were temporally stimulated by stormwater runoff infiltrations during the rainy period. This decoupling between the structural and functional responses of groundwater biofilms to stormwater infiltration practices suggests that biofilms functions were highly reactive to fluxes associated with aquifer recharge events.

AB  - Research Highlights: The developed National Set of Indicators for the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) implementation in Greece at the national level sets the official, national basis on which future studies will be conducted for MAES reporting for the achievement of targets within the National and the European Union (EU) biodiversity Strategy. Background and Objectives: Greece is currently developing and implementing a MAES nation-wide program based on the region's unique characteristics following the proposed methodologies by the European Commission, in the frame of the LIFE-IP 4 NATURA project (Integrated actions for the conservation and management of Natura 2000 sites, species, habitats and ecosystems in Greece). In this paper, we present the steps followed to compile standardized MAES indicators for Greece that include: (a) collection and review of the available MAES-related datasets, (b) shortcomings and limitations encountered and overcome, (c) identification of data gaps and (d) assumptions and framework setting. Correspondence to EU and National Strategies and Policies are also examined to provide an initial guidance for detailed thematic studies. Materials and Methods: We followed the requirements of the EU MAES framework for ecosystem services and ecosystem condition indicator selection. Ecosystem services reported under the selected indicators were assigned following the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services. Spatial analysis techniques were applied to create relevant thematic maps. Results: A set of 40 MAES indicators was drafted, distributed in six general indicator groups, i.e., Biodiversity, Environmental quality, Food, material and energy, Forestry, Recreation and Water resources. The protocols for the development and implementation of an indicator were also drafted and adopted for future MAES studies in Greece, providing guidance for adaptive development and adding extra indicators when and where needed. Thematic maps representing ecosystem services (ES) bundles and ES hotspots were also created to identify areas of ES importance and simultaneously communicate the results at the national and regional levels.

AB  - Hydrologic regimes are essential to riverine, lacustrine, and wetland ecosystems, and every component of a hydrologic regime has a specific ecological environmental function. In an outflow lake-river system, water levels are reduced by a reservoir constructed at the river, which interferes with the river-lake interrelationships by impairing the river's blocking effect. This increases the lake-river hydraulic gradient and accelerates the lake's drainage to the river, resulting in shrinkage of the lake and damaging environmental issues. To respond to these issues, we propose an environmental flow assessment that considers the river's blocking effect on the lake. This novel methodology consists of four steps: data preparation, assessment of the lake's environmental water level, assessment of the river's environmental water level, and environmental flow assessment. We estimated the river's environmental water level through a hydraulic correlation between the lake and the river, and found that the river's blocking effect could be sustained. The Yangtze-Poyang system was selected as a case study to illustrate the methodology's procedures and applicability. The impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir, during the fall retreating season, decreased the Yangtze's water level and weakened the Yangtze's blocking effect on Poyang Lake. Poyang Lake's environmental water level, which ranges from 11.71 to 15.81 m in the month of October, was used to estimate the Yangtze's environmental water level as falling in a range of 11.95 to 16.17 m, which corresponds to an environmental flow range of 16,822 to 32,371 m(3)/s. This study offers a solution for reservoir-induced accelerated lake drainage, which may be helpful in mitigating the negative impacts of reservoirs and sustaining natural rive-lake interactions.

AB  - Anthropogenic Trace Compounds (ATCs) that continuously grow in numbers and concentrations are an emerging issue for water quality in both natural and technical environments. The complex web of exposure pathways as well as the variety in the chemical structure and potency of ATCs represents immense challenges for future research and policy initiatives. This review summarizes current trends and identifies knowledge gaps in innovative, effective monitoring and management strategies while addressing the research questions concerning ATC occurrence, fate, detection and toxicity.
   We highlight the progressing sensitivity of chemical analytics and the challenges in harmonization of sampling protocols and methods, as well as the need for ATC indicator substances to enable cross-national valid monitoring routine. Secondly, the status quo in ecotoxicology is described to advocate for a better implementation of long-term tests, to address toxicity on community and environmental as well as on human-health levels, and to adapt various test levels and endpoints. Moreover, we discuss potential sources of ATCs and the current removal efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to indicate the most effective places and elimination strategies. Knowledge gaps in transport and/or detainment of ATCs through their passage in surface waters and groundwaters are further emphasized in relation to their physico-chemical properties, abiotic conditions and biological interactions in order to highlight fundamental research needs. Finally, we demonstrate the importance and remaining challenges of an appropriate ATC risk assessment since this will greatly assist in identifying the most urgent calls for action, in selecting the most promising measures, and in evaluating the success of implemented management strategies.

AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) cell and module temperature profiles, T-c and T-pv, respectively, developed under solar irradiance were predicted and measured both at transient and steady state conditions. The predicted and measured T-c or T-pv covered both a bare c-Si PV cell, by SOLARTEC, at laboratory conditions using a solar light simulator, as well as various c-Si and pc-Si modules (SM55, Bioenergy 195W, Energy Solutions 125W) operating in field conditions. The time constants, , of the T-c and T-pv profiles were determined by the proposed model and calculated using the experimentally obtained profiles for both the bare PV cell and PV modules. For model validation, the predicted steady state and transient temperature profiles were compared with experimental ones and also with those generated from other models. The effect of the ambient temperature, T-a, wind speed, v(w), and the solar irradiance, I-T, on the model performance, as well as of the mounting geometries, was investigated and incorporated in the prediction model. The predicted temperatures had the best matching to the measured ones in comparison to those from six other models. The model developed is applicable to any geographical site and environmental conditions.

AB  - The marine ecosystem off British Columbia (BC), Canada, has experienced various changes in the last two decades, including reduced lipid-rich zooplankton biomass, increased marine mammals, and deteriorated commercial fisheries, particularly those targeting pelagic species such as Pacific Herring (Clupea pallasii). Understanding how stressors interactively and cumulatively affect commercially important fish species is key to moving toward ecosystem-based fisheries management. Because it is challenging to assess the cumulative effects of multiple stressors by using empirical data alone, a dynamic, individual-based spatially explicit ecosystem modeling platform such as Object-oriented Simulator of Marine Ecosystems (OSMOSE) represents a valuable tool to simulate ecological processes and comprehensively evaluate how stressors cumulatively impact modeled species. In this study, we employed OSMOSE to investigate the cumulative effects of fishing, plankton biomass change, and marine mammal consumption on the dynamics of some fish species and the BC marine ecosystem as a whole. We specifically simulated ecosystem dynamics during the last 20 years under two sets of scenarios: (1) unfavorable conditions from the perspective of commercial fish species (i.e., doubling fishing mortality rates, halving plankton biomass, and doubling marine mammal biomass, acting individually or collectively); and (2) favorable conditions with the three factors having opposite changes (i.e., halving fishing mortality rates, doubling plankton biomass, and halving marine mammal biomass, acting individually or collectively). Our results indicate that, under unfavorable conditions, the degree to which species biomass was reduced varied among species, and that negative synergistic and negative dampened effects were dominant under historical and doubled fishing mortality rates, respectively. Under favorable conditions, species biomasses did not increase as much as expected due to the existence of complex predator-prey interactions among fish species, and positive synergistic and positive dampened effects were prevailing under historical and halved fishing mortality rates, respectively. The ecosystem total biomass and the biomass to fisheries yield ratio were found to be good ecological indicators to represent ecosystem changes and track the impacts from the multiple drivers of change. Our research provides insights on how fisheries management should adapt to prepare for potential future impacts of climate change.

AB  - Discriminating amongst spatial configurations and climax size of trees in forests along varying physical gradients from time since last disturbance is a significant component of applied forest management. Understanding what has led to the existing vegetation's structure has important implications for monitoring succession and eco-hydrological interactions within the critical zone: the near-surface environment where rock, soil, air, and biota interact and regulate ecosystem services. This research demonstrates the utilities of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) to (1) quantify natural variation in forest structure as derived from aerial Light Detection and Range (LiDAR) across topographically complex landscapes at ecologically relevant scale, i.e., individual trees; (2) map previously recorded but poorly defined forest disturbances; and (3) link scalable topographic indices to observed tree size distributions. We first selected a priori undisturbed and disturbed stands scanned by aerial LiDAR that included: preservation, mechanical fuels treatment, and logging in two similar semi-arid forest ecosystems. Next, we compared two topographic indices: the topographic position index (TPI) and topographic wetness index (TWI) to climax tree height and two related LISAs: the Getis-Ord G(i) and Anselin local Moran's I. G(i) and I measure local spatial clustering, producing z-scores that represent the significance of each statistic. The tallest trees in each study area were found to be located on negative TPI and greater TWI values (valley bottom positions and higher wetness conditions, respectively). Stands of trees with positive z-scores (i.e., overstory trees with similarly tall neighbors) were most likely to be located in the a priori undisturbed areas. Disturbed locations, on the other hand, were defined by neighborhoods of negative z-scores (i.e., shorter trees with short neighbors). Future applications include locating and reconstructing historical disturbances and developing a consistent strategy for characterizing stands for forest inventory monitoring.

AB  - This work describes a new method for assessing the ecological quality of intertidal seagrass in estuaries and coastal systems, the Seagrass Quality Index (SQI). The design of the SQI aims to fulfil the Water Framework Directive requirements in terms of compliance (e.g., metrics, sampling procedure, pressure relationship, uncertainty of misclassification and comparability to other methodologies in terms of concept). The index includes three common and easy-to-measure structural parameters of seagrass (i.e., the no. of taxa, bed extent and shoot density) combined in a calculation rule that allows the index to report all five of the quality classes (i.e., high, good, moderate, poor and bad). The present study contains analyses of the relationships between the ecosystem-quality results produced by the index and the pressures measured in the system as well as the relationships between the SQI and the seagrass parameters composing it (both the correlation between the SQI and metrics and the SQI sensitivity to the individual variation of each metric). These relationships were tested using a Spearman rank-correlation analysis, producing significant correlations between the biological metrics and the index results as well as between the index results and the environmental quality-pressure category (i.e., the concentration of winter DIN and turbidity). In terms of management, it is possible to apply the methodology on a broad geographical scale in systems where the reference condition for the number of taxa is even higher than one (for the Mondego studied here, the reference value was one species). The tool fulfilled the WFD requirements, had a robust sampling design and proved to be able to track the inertia that usually exists from the moment the pressure is alleviated as well as the biological response that characterises the recovery phase in systems under restoration.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the anthropogenic pressure in the St. Lawrence River by assessing the relationships between chemical contamination of sediments and benthic community structure with the trait-based approach. Organic and inorganic contaminants as well as other sediment variables (sediment grain size, total organic carbon, nutrients, etc.) and benthic invertebrate assemblages were determined in 59 sites along the river. Biological and ecological traits of taxa were coded, taking into account regional dimate and ecosystem conditions. The aims of this study were to (1) describe the relationships between traits and macroinvertebrate taxa and identify homogeneous dusters of taxa with the same combinations of functional traits, (2) describe spatial patterns in traits of macroinvertebrates in the St. Lawrence River, (3) link trait-based metrics and site groups to sediment quality and (4) define a trait-based strategy for diagnosing the ecological quality of the St. Lawrence River. Seven groups of taxa sharing similar trait-category attributes were defined. Moreover, four groups of sites were identified using the 'K-mean' non-hierarchical clustering approach. The 'IndVal' method enabled us to specifically defined trait categories corresponding to site groups on the basis of their indicator value. The relative abundances of taxa from five functional groups significantly varied among site groups. For example, some indicator traits such as multivolline cycle, long life span, fixed dutches, tegumental respiration, asexual reproduction, and collector/gatherer feeding habit were associated to the most heavily polluted sites located in the Montreal harbour which showed the highest sediment concentrations in Pb. Zn and Cu. Three trait-based pressure-specific models were built, based on the random forest approach, for respectively (1) heavy metals. (2) BPCs and PAHs, and (3) TBTs occurring in the environment. These models could be applied to assess sediment quality using macroinvertebrate assemblages in a large Canadian river. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many of the features that make estuaries among the most productive natural systems on earth also make them prone to acidification. Understanding the effects of estuarine acidification on different components of an ecological community is an important step in identifying indicators of ecosystem degradation. This study examined the impact of estuarine acidification, as a result of acid sulfate soil runoff, on wild Sydney rock oysters Saccostrea glomerata and their associated epifaunal communities in estuaries experiencing acid sulfate soil runoff in New South Wales, Australia. The responses of oysters and their invertebrate epifaunal communities to chronic acidification (greater than 6 mo; represented by oyster source site conditions) were assessed by examining the differences in oyster communities associated with moderate acidification (3.5 km from the source of acidification) or low acidification (8.2 km from the source). Oysters from moderate-or low-acidification sites were transplanted to a site with high exposure to acidification (less than 3 km from the source) or back to their original source sites (control) to mimic episodic acidification (2 wk). Epifaunal mussels Xenostrobus securis and limpets Patelloida mimula showed a negative association with oyster mortality, suggesting that these communities are closely tied to oyster survival. Oyster-associated epifaunal communities exposed to both chronic and episodic acidification were significantly different from communities with low exposure. Epifaunal communities exposed to episodic acidification were significantly less diverse than the control. Spionid and syllid worms were significantly less abundant and the mussel X. securis was significantly more abundant on oysters with moderate exposure or chronic exposure to acidification, as compared with communities from areas with low exposure to acidification. The mussel X. securis and the snail Bembicium auratum were significantly less abundant in oyster communities that were exposed to episodic acidification, as compared with the control. In systems where community composition depends on a single habitat-forming species, maintaining resistance may rely on the ability of that species to persist in the face of environmental stress.

AB  - Diatom-based indices are increasingly becoming important tools for the assessment of ecological conditions in lotic systems. The applicability of regional and foreign diatom-based water quality assessment indices to streams around Sao Carlos-SP, Brazil, is discussed. The relationship between measured water quality variables and diatom index scores was assessed. The indices, when compared to chemical analyses, proved useful in providing an indication of the quality of the investigated waters. Though all borrowed indices were applicable to the study area because many widely distributed diatom species have similar environmental tolerances to those recorded for these species elsewhere, ecological requirements of some diatom species from Brazil need to be clarified and incorporated in a diatom-based water quality assessment protocol unique to the region.

AB  - This paper discusses a new environmental flow method based on the adapted building block approach. A four-step procedure is outlined in this paper:
   (1) selecting biota of interest and organizing a team of specialists
   (2) selecting river reaches of interest
   (3) defining flow requirements of selected biota
   (4) defining environmental flow indicators
   The focus is placed on two elements of river and wetland ecosystems: fish and floodplain wetland vegetation. The method is applied to identify changes in the environmental flow indicators between 1976-83 ("past") and 2001-08 ("present") in 16 selected river reaches of the Narew basin, a large semi-natural lowland catchment situated in northeastern Poland. The results indicate that hydrological conditions for fish and floodplain wetland vegetation were significantly better in the past period compared to the present.

AB  - Widespread impacts of changes in land use, climate, and disturbance regimes continue to affect mature forests and their subsequent post-disturbance recovery. In South American temperate rainforests, the recovery of the original composition, structure, and ecological services of now-degraded old-growth forests is additionally hampered by the aggressive competition that the native Chusquea bamboo understory exerts on juvenile trees, thus arresting ecological succession. In this study, we aim to evaluate the early performance of Nothofagus nitida seedlings (pioneer tree species that tolerate shade) planted beneath nurse canopy following removal of the understory, and to define which microsite conditions can facilitate N. nitida growth. For this, we monitored 45 N. nitida plantings established in 2014 in Chiloe Island (North Patagonia, Chile) for five years. After this period, planted seedlings presented relatively good indicators of performance with low mortality (similar to 30% of dead seedlings), good vitality (similar to 60% of healthy seedlings), and relatively high mean periodic annual increments in root collar diameter and height (similar to 1.7 mm/year and similar to 17.4 cm/year, respectively). Furthermore, our results show that the planted N. nitida seedlings can tolerate and grow under low-light conditions, though their diameter and height increase significantly with higher light availability. However, physiological stress of planted seedlings increased in open areas with more available light and planted seedlings were most stressed during the summer season. Increased summer-season stress was attributed to the months with highest depth of the water table, highest maximum and mean photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) values, highest temperature, and lowest precipitation. Our results show for first time with field-based data that different microsite and canopy conditions facilitate the initial performance of N. nitida plantings after removal of the Chusquea bamboo understory. In this context, we conclude that the removal of the Chusquea bamboo understory is the key to overcome arrested succession of coastal temperate rain forests Furthermore, supplementary planting of pioneer tree species that tolerate shade, like N. nitida, assists natural forest recovery, especially in humid and open sites with some protection of a nurse canopy.

AB  - In the semiarid conditions of the Sa similar to o Francisco River Basin, Brazil, irrigated fruit crops are replacing natural vegetation, being lemon highlighted by incentives for the national and international markets. This paper aimed to support the rational water management of lemon orchards under different irrigation systems under these conditions. We present a methodology based on the use of the visible and near infrared images from Landsat 8 (L8) satellite together with weather and actual yield data (Y-a), to assess the energy balance components and irrigation performance indicators (IPI) by applying the SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) in six commercial farms under different irrigation systems inside the basin in the northern Minas Gerais state, Southeast Brazil. The ET rates averaged 2.7 mm d(-1), 2.9 mm d(-1), and 3.7 mm d(-1), for drip, micro sprinkler, and pivot irrigated orchards, respectively. The evaporative fraction (latent heat flux by the available energy) reached above 1.00 for localized irrigation (drip and micro sprinkler), and 1.30 for pivots, during the lemon phenological stages from fruit growth to harvest peaks. Pivot irrigation systems were not recommended under the semi-arid conditions, due to large water direct evaporated from the soil and air close to the surface. For drip and micro sprinkler irrigated orchards, crop coefficient curves were modeled based on the accumulated degree-days (DDac) to estimate lemon crop water requirements. Drip irrigated orchards presented better water productivity levels being recommended together with deficit irrigation strategies which could allow good lemon yields with saving water savings. The most important findings of the current research are that the SAFER algorithm can be applied to estimate crop ET with satellite images without the thermal bands which together with modelled Ya data, irrigation assessments can be carried out at high spatial resolution following the principles of precision agriculture. For replication of the methods in other regions, simple calibrations of the modelling equations can be performed to infer the specific environmental conditions.

AB  - Bottom trawling alters the abundance, diversity, size-composition, and function of benthic communities. However, the ability to detect these impacts over large spatial scales can be obscured by various complicating factors, such as community adaptation to disturbance and co-varying environmental conditions. An ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management therefore requires ecological indicators which can 'disentangle' trawling effects from other natural and human drivers, and respond effectively to shifts in ecological quality. We collected benthic macrofaunal samples at 21 sites across a Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus fishing ground in the Kattegat, and separated the benthic community into small (1-4 mm) and large ( > 4 mm) size fractions. Four taxonomic indicators (total density, species density, Shannon diversity, and biomass) and four functional indicators (functional diversity, functional richness, functional evenness, and functional dispersion) were calculated based on each size fraction, and the two fractions combined (pooled community). Here, we compare the ability of these indicators to detect trawling impacts across size categories. We show that indicators derived from large macrofauna were highly effective in this regard, and were less influenced by other environmental drivers, such as depth, sediment grain size, bottom current velocity, salinity, and temperature. This suggests that the taxonomic and functional characteristics of benthic communities display a size-dependent sensitivity to trawling disturbance, and therefore community metrics based on large benthic macrofauna may provide useful indicators. By contrast, indicators derived from the small fraction performed poorly, and those based on the pooled community demonstrated a varied ability to detect trawling. Small macrofauna are typically characterised by high density, diversity, and population growth rates, and their relative resilience to trawling may mask the response of the more sensitive macrofauna. This highlights an underlying issue with calculating indicators based on the whole benthic community. The approach outline here is easily applied, improves indicator performance, and has the potential to reduce laboratory workloads due to the fewer taxa and individuals required for analyses.

AB  - Monitoring tools are needed to assess changes in peatland biotic communities and ecosystem functions in response to on-going climate and other environmental changes. Although the responses of soil organisms and plants to ecological gradients and perturbations do not always correlate, peatland monitoring is mainly based on vegetation surveys. Testate amoebae, a group of protists, are important contributors to carbon and nitrogen cycling in organic soils and are useful bioindicators in peatland ecology and paleoecology. There is however little comparative data on the value of testate amoebae, vascular plants and bryophytes as bioindicators of micro-environmental gradients in peatlands.
   We compared the relationships of testate amoebae, bryophytes, and vascular plants with soil temperature, water table depth, micro-habitats and the carbon and nitrogen content of Sphagnum mosses in four peatlands along a 1300 m altitudinal gradient in Switzerland. We used the full diversity of vascular plants and bryophyte but only a selection of ten easily identifiable testate amoeba morpho-taxa (i.e. species or species-complexes).
   Indirect and direct gradient ordinations, multiple factor analysis (MFA) and transfer function models for inferring water table depth showed that a selection of ten testate amoeba taxa are more powerful (% variance explained in RDA) and accurate (discrimination among habitats) indicators of local conditions (micro-habitat type, water table depth and Sphagnum C/N ratio) than the vegetation (vascular plants and bryophytes either individually or combined and considering the full diversity).
   Our study showed that a limited list of ten easily identifiable testate amoeba taxa have higher bioindication value than the full bryophytes and vascular plants. Furthermore, testate amoebae can be analyzed on samples collected at any season (accessibility allowing and if precise sampling sites are well marked) - a clear advantage for biomonitoring and can be used to infer past changes from the peat record at the same taxonomic resolution. This simple approach could therefore be very useful for biomonitoring of peatlands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Selecting an appropriate and efficient sampling strategy in biological surveys is a major concern in ecological research, particularly when the population abundance and individual traits of the sampled population are highly structured over space. Multi-stage sampling designs typically present sampling sites as primary units. However, to collect trait data, such as age or maturity, only a sub-sample of individuals collected in the sampling site is retained. Therefore, not only the sampling design, but also the sub-sampling strategy can have a major impact on important population estimates, commonly used as reference points for management and conservation. We developed a simulation framework to evaluate sub-sampling strategies from multi-stage biological surveys. Specifically, we compare quantitatively precision and bias of the population estimates obtained using two common but contrasting sub-sampling strategies: the random and the stratified designs. The sub-sampling strategy evaluation was applied to age data collection of a virtual fish population that has the same statistical and biological characteristics of the Eastern Bering Sea population of Pacific cod. The simulation scheme allowed us to incorporate contributions of several sources of error and to analyze the sensitivity of the different strategies in the population estimates. We found that, on average across all scenarios tested, the main differences between sub-sampling designs arise from the inability of the stratified design to reproduce spatial patterns of the individual traits. However, differences between the sub-sampling strategies in other population estimates may be small, particularly when large sub-sample sizes are used. On isolated scenarios (representative of specific environmental or demographic conditions), the random sub-sampling provided better precision in all population estimates analyzed. The sensitivity analysis revealed the important contribution of spatial autocorrelation in the error of population trait estimates, regardless of the sub-sampling design. This framework will be a useful tool for monitoring and assessment of natural populations with spatially structured traits in multi-stage sampling designs.

AB  - Identifying and characterizing top predators' use of trophic resources provides important information about animal ecology and their response to changing conditions. Information from sources such as stable isotopes can be used to infer changes in resource use as direct observations in the wild are difficult to obtain, particularly in the marine environment. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values were recovered from the canine teeth of grey seals collected from haul outs in the central North Sea in the 1970/1980s (n = 44) and 2000s (n = 25), spanning a period of marked ecosystem changes in the region. Extracting material deposited during juvenile and adult life-stages, we reconstructed a multi-decadal record of N-15 and C-13 variation. Using established correlations between stable isotope ratios and sea bottom temperature we created a proxy for baseline isotopic variability to account for this source of temporal change. We found 1) a significant long-term decline in juvenile grey seal N-15 values, suggesting trophic position has decreased over time; 2) a decline in adult N-15 values and contraction in stable isotopic niche space after the North Sea regime shift, signifying both a decline in trophic position and change in foraging habits over the 20th century; and 3) evidence for dietary segregation between juvenile and adult animals, showing juvenile individuals feeding at a lower trophic position and in more nearshore areas than adults. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of mining archived biological samples to address ecological questions and imply important ontogenetic and long-term shifts in the feeding ecology of a top predator. Long-term changes in grey seal trophic dynamics may be partly in response to well documented ecosystem changes in the North Sea. Such indirect monitoring of marine predators may have utility when set in the context of ecosystem assessments where paucity of long-term monitoring data is prevalent.

AB  - Businesses may be missing opportunities to account for ecosystem services in their decisions, because they do not have methods to quantify and value ecosystem services. We developed a method to quantify and value coastal protection and other ecosystem services in the context of a cost-benefit analysis of hurricane risk mitigation options for a business. We first analyze linked biophysical and economic models to examine the potential protection provided by marshes. We then applied this method to The Dow Chemical Company's Freeport, Texas facility to evaluate natural (marshes), built (levee), and hybrid (marshes and a levee designed for marshes) defenses against a 100-y hurricane. Model analysis shows that future sea-level rise decreases marsh area, increases flood heights, and increases the required levee height (12%) and cost (8%). In this context, marshes do not provide sufficient protection to the facility, located 12km inland, to warrant a change in levee design for a 100-y hurricane. Marshes do provide some protection near shore and under smaller storm conditions, which may help maintain the coastline and levee performance in the face of sea-level rise. In sum, the net present value to the business of built defenses ($217 million [2010 US$]) is greater than natural defenses ($15 million [2010 US$]) and similar to the hybrid defense scenario ($229 million [2010 US$]). Examination of a sample of public benefits from the marshes shows they provide at least $117 million (2010 US$) in coastal protection, recreational value, and C sequestration to the public, while supporting 12 fisheries and more than 300 wildlife species. This study provides information on where natural defenses may be effective and a replicable approach that businesses can use to incorporate private, as well as public, ecosystem service values into hurricane risk management at other sites.

AB  - Brachyuran crab community structure was compared between mangrove sites under different management systems from four locations along the Melaka Straits-Andaman Sea Coast. Klong Ngao, a mangrove estuary in Ranong Province of southern Thailand, lies within a Biosphere Reserve designated in 1997. Sites were positioned in plantations at a former charcoal concession forest, a disused tin mine, and an abandoned shrimp pond along this estuary. The Merbok estuary in Kedah, Malaysia, is partiatly managed: the mangroves are cut for charcoal and poles on a small scale and the forests are left to regenerate naturally. The Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve in Perak, Malaysia, is heavily exploited but well managed, for Rhizophora wood to produce charcoal, and has been for 100 years. Sites were positioned in plantations of different ages. Kuala Selangor Nature Park, Selangor, Malaysia, was established as a nature reserve in 1987 and contains mature mangrove forest regenerating naturally from previous selective felling. At Klong Ngao and Matang, mature reserve forest sites were also studied for comparison with plantation sites. The sites included both upstream and downstream locations and were of similar area, minimizing effects from possible species-area relationships. Sites were chosen with similar environmental conditions and with a dominance of Rhizophora spp. At each site per location, the brachyuran crabs were sampled quantitatively in 100 m(2) quadrats by three independent 15-min timed crab catches. The crab community recorded was analyzed by univariate and mulltivariate statistical techniques. Management history plays an important role in moderating the crab community structure. The crab community also changes with the age of the mangrove forest stand. Sesarmid crabs consistently dominated in mature forests, whereas young plantations were colonized mainly by ocypodid crabs. The findings show that heavily effected sites-e.g., disused tin mining areas, former concession forests, and abandoned shrimp ponds-can be rehabilitated by planting mangroves and that the crab community is a useful ecological indicator of habitat status.

AB  - The relevance of the research is determined by the problems of the effective mineral exploration in the Arctic due to refusal to use building materials (concrete products, bricks, etc.) imported from thousands of kilometers away. The maximum distance from industrial-urban centers combined with the extremely severe natural and climatic conditions of the Far North significantly affect the economy of extraction and the ecology of the territory, where the cost of building materials reaches 70 % of the oil and gas cost. The access to the shelves of the Arctic seas of Russia and other countries requires innovative materials and breakthrough technologies, including the construction of artificial islands and underwater structures on the shelf. The implementation of these innovative technologies requires materials and structures with higher strength and durability.
   The main aim of the research was to develop multifunctional rock-glass ceramics based on the Polar Urals raw materials with a unique combination of physical, mechanical and chemical properties for advanced technologies.
   Objects of researches: dump rocks of the basic rock class of the Polar Urals gold fields, metasilicate melts, glass and sitall (glass-ceramics).
   Methods of researches: theoretical and experimental studying of raw materials; calculation of the feed composition for metasilicate glass-ceramics - a new class "sikam" (SCS); methods for determining the main technological parameters, studying the basic properties of products, methods for creating new innovative building structures; methods for substantiating technical and economic indicators. The chemical composition of the feedstock is determined by mass spectroscopic methods with inductively coupled plasma.
   Research results. The research has substantiated the original compositions and established the physico-chemical properties of rock glass-ceramics from the local raw materials of the Polar Urals gold fields. The research introduces the economic efficiency and environmental usefulness of this material production on site with the use of a cheap energy carrier (associated gas) in comparison with imported reinforced concrete. In special Arctic conditions, this material is indispensable for production of a pile-trestle road structure and construction of a durable transport infrastructure on its basis, industrial and civil facilities in the conditions of permafrost and the Arctic shelf.

AB  - Exhibition of lanthanide tetrad effect in PAAS-normalized REE patterns, and non-CHARAC (non-CHArge-RAdius Control) behavior of Y/Ho and Zr/Hf in limestone of the Ruteh Formation, Kanigorgeh district (NW Iran), were studied in order to understand the reasons of occurrence of lanthanides tetrad effects. The computed values show that the third and fourth tetrads can be used as a good and powerful geochemical tool for investigation of physico-chemical conditions of the depositional environment of the limestones. Here, a new mathematical-based method using polar coordination system for tetrad effect values (T-p ) was used to evaluate under studying limestone. The correlation between T-p and some geochemical parameters revealed that the limestone was likely deposited under two different conditions. The obtained results indicated that paleo-redox conditions, adsorption and scavenging by kaolinite and metallic oxides, degree of detrital input, diagenesis intensity, and complexation by polycarbonate ligands are likely the main mechanisms for occurrence of tetrad effect phenomenon in REE distribution patterns in the limestone. This means that tetrad effect phenomenon in REE distribution patterns of limestone can be applied as a good geochemical indicator to evaluate the deposition conditions in limestones.

AB  - A better management of nutrient inflows into lakes has led to an improvement in their conditions (i.e. reversal of eutrophication) and the effects of this on macroinvertebrate communities that inhabit different lake-depth zones is largely unknown. This paper reports a comparison of macroinvertebrate communities living in the eulittoral, infralittoral and sublittoral/profundal zones of Lake Nemi (Central Italy) before and after its natural recovery from eutrophication following the deviation of domestic Wastewater. The infralittoral zone responded more rapidly than the other two depth-zones to the improved ecological conditions, as shown by larger differences in community composition between the two periods. In the eulittoral sand, the combined effects of hydromorphological pressures and reversal of eutrophication hindered the biotic response. In the eulittoral and infralittoral zones, typical taxa of mesotrophic waters appeared or increased their abundances after the eutrophication reversal. Benthic invertebrate response was slower in the sublittoral/profundal zone due to deoxygenation that continued to prevail in the deepest area of the lake during summer. However, both tolerant and more sensitive taxa were collected there for the first time. After the reversal of eutrophication, the percentage of molluscan + large crustaceans increased in the infralittoral zone, whereas the oligochaete/chironomid ratio decreased in both sublittoral/profundal and infralittoral zones. Functional feeding metrics (percentages of filter-feeders, collector-gatherers, miners and scrapers/grazers) differently tracked the reversal of eutrophication in the three depth-zones probably according to the effects of the-reduction of nutrients on food-web structure influencing macroinvertebrates. Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) and the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) seemed to respond to eutrophication reversal only in the sublittoral/profundal zone, where deoxygenation plays a major role as a structuring agent of the community. Our results suggest that the effects of re-. versal of eutrophication can be better assessed by examining the response of the communities belonging to each zone individually. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Modelling the local density of tropical saplings can provide insights into the ecological processes that drive species regeneration and thereby help predict population recovery after disturbance. Yet, few studies have addressed the challenging issues in autocorrelation and zero-inflation of local density. This paper presents Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling (HBM) of sapling density that includes these two features. Special attention is devoted to variable selection, model estimation and comparison.
   We developed a Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) model with a latent correlated spatial structure and compared it with non-spatial ZIP and Poisson models that were either autocorrelated (Spatial Generalized Linear Mixed, SGLM) or not (generalized linear models, GLM). In our spatial models, local density autocorrelation was modeled by a Conditional Auto-Regressive (CAR) process. 13 explicative variables described ecological conditions with respect to topography, disturbance, stand structure and intraspecific processes. Models were applied to six tropical tree species with differing biological attributes: Oxandra asbeckii, Eperua falcata, Eperua grandiflora, Dicorynia guianensis, Qualea rosea, and Tachigali melinonii. We built species-specific models using a simple method of variable selection based on a latent binary indicator.
   Our spatial models showed a close correlation between observed and estimated densities with site spatial structure being correctly reproduced. By contrast, the non-spatial models showed poor fits. Variable selection highlighted species-specific requirements and susceptibility to local conditions. Model comparison overall showed that the SGLM was the most accurate explanatory and predictive model. Surprisingly, zero-inflated models performed less well.
   Although the SZIP model was relevant with respect to data distribution, and more flexible with respect to response curves, its model complexity caused marked variability in parameter estimates. In the SUM, the spatial process alone accounted for zero-inflation in the data. A refinement of the hypotheses employed at the process level could compensate for distribution flaws at the data level. This study emphasized the importance of the HBM framework in improving the modelling of density-environment relationships. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Grain for Green Program which is an important part of the strategy of Western development was initiated to protect the ecological environment and mitigate disasters. The upper reaches of the Min River basin is one of the key pilot regions for Grain for Green Program implementation in the mountainous areas of Sichuan Province, southwestern China. Therefore, monitoring the effect of the Grain for Green Program on the ecosystem services (ESs) in the montainous areas is important. Especially, several authors have emphasized the need to quantify spatial characteristics and evaluate ES values of land uses in mountainous areas from spatial and temporal perspectives. In this study, we firstly analyzed the spatial pattern of land uses in mountainous settlements before and after implementation of Grain for Green Program in the upper reaches of Min River, Sichuan Province of China. Based on lacunarity analysis, we explored the spatial characteristics of land uses including spatial heterogeneityand cluster. The results suggested that the spatial characteristics of land uses occurred at different scales, and there is strong relationship between spatial characteristic scales and the different distribution pattern of land use. We then quantified the relationships between geometrical features for land use pacthes and vegetation habitat suitability by multilevel Bayesian model. We found that the vegetation habitat suitability significantly affected on spatial location, size, and complexity of different land use patches in mountainous settlements. Based on assignment method of ES value per unit area, we finally quantitatively analyzed and compared the changes in ES values of land uses in mountainous settlements caused by Grain for Green Program from spatial and temporal scales. It is an important indicator for defining ecological potential by quantifying the change in ES value. After implementation of Grain for Green Program, the total ES value dramatically increased because of increase in forest and pasture areas. It suggests that the Grain for Green Program could bring effectively ecological benefit on protecting ecosystem functions in some degree. Application of spatial characteristics analysis of land uses and ES valuation in mountainous settlements to study the spatial structure of land use and service supplies should provide a better understanding of service provision and enable evaluation of the ecological integrity of land uses in mountainous areas.

AB  - Habitat modifications induced by humans severely impact biotic components of freshwater ecosystems. In China, shallow lakes in the Yangtze River basin are facing severe habitat degradation induced by pollution, habitat losing, macrophytes disappearing and fishery activities. Effectively modeling the fish communities on the basis of biotic and abiotic environmental descriptors would be helpful to understand the relationships between fish and their environment, and to develop suitable conservation strategies to sustain the biodiversity in these ecosystems. From 2007 to 2009, investigations were carried out on fish and their environment in 6 lakes distributed in the mid-reach of the Yangtze River basin. According to the CPUE values of each fish species from each sampling, 117 datasets were ordinated using self-organizing map (SOM). Fish communities were classified into three clusters of species assemblages, spatial and temporal distributions were showing in it. Seasonal changes in fish community were more obvious in vegetated habitats than in unvegetated areas. The total CPUE, fish diversity and species richness were significantly different among the assemblages (p < 0.01). Based on the indicative value of each species in each cluster calculated by Indval method, 16 species were identified as indicators: 13 indicators in cluster G1 are pelagic or benthopelagic fish, the only one indicator species in G2 is a tolerant species (Culter dabry B.), while the other two indicator species in G3 are demersal fish (Rhinogobius giurinus R. and Odontobutis obscurus T. & G.). These results are in agreement with the contributions of different ecological groups of fish in each assemblage in the trained SOM, pelagic and benthopelagic fish were found having more activities in spring and winter, while more activities of demersal fish were found in summer and autumn. Fish community assemblages, the total fish CPUE, diversity and species richness in those lakes were then predicted by 15 abiotic and biotic factors using random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART) predictive models. The predicted assignment of each site unit to the correct assemblage had an average success of 74.4% and 60.7% in RF and CART models, respectively. The dominant variables for discriminating three fish assemblages were water depth, distance to the bank and total phosphorus. While the two important variables in prediction fish CPUE, diversity and species richness were lake surface area and water depth, density of rotifer and water depth, water depth and water temperature, respectively. The overall percentages of successful prediction varied from 56.5% to 67% utilizing leave-one-out for cross-validation tests. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - African freshwater ecosystems are increasingly being impacted by humans, requiring an effective tool to assess these impacts for future conservation action. Such a tool, the Dragonfly Biotic Index (DBI), was earlier developed to assess the quality of South Africa's freshwater ecosystems and is based on combining the scores of three subindices (geographical distribution, threat status, and habitat sensitivity) for each South African dragonfly species. The sum of the DBI scores for all the species recorded at assessed sites indicates the relative quality of these sites. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature/Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC) has assessed the threat status of certain aquatic taxa in Africa, including dragonflies. These assessments, coupled with the latest information on the geographical distribution of each species, makes it possible here to geographically expand the South African DBI into a continental-scale assessment index (the African Dragonfly Biotic Index (ADBI)) by adapting the South African DBI sub-indices. We develop this continental index here. However, there are challenges when undertaking an assessment at the continental scale compared to a national scale. In particular, the habitat sensitivity sub-index of the South African DBI is a relative, quantitative measure based on numbers of individual dragonflies recorded from natural versus human-modified or artificial freshwater systems. While the data for the two sub-indices, species' geographical distribution and Red List threat statuses, are available across the continent, this is not the case for the habitat sensitivity sub-index at this large spatial scale. This meant that an alternative sub-index measure was required. We overcame this challenge by exploring an alternative sub-index, i.e. the 'species vulnerability sub-index', based on knowledge of the vulnerabilities of the species to certain types of landscape transformation. Then, the species vulnerability sub-index scores were calculated and combined with the geographical distribution and Red List threat status sub-index scores to develop ADBI scores for a core of 604 dragonfly species with adequate data across the African continent. These ADBI scores provide a workable framework and baseline for determining freshwater quality, both lotic and lentic, relative to human disturbance at a continental spatial scale. The ADBI enables the monitoring of quality changes, for better or worse, over the continent in years to come. Overall, the ADBI also has the potential to help identify threats to, and sensitivities of, African freshwater ecosystems, leading to conservation action.

AB  - Understanding the patterns of land degradation indicators can help to identify areas under threat as basis for designing and implementing site-specific management options. This study sort to identify and assess the patterns of land degradation indicators in selected districts of western Kenya. The study employed the use of Land Degradation Sampling Framework (LDSF) to characterize the sites. LDSF a spatially stratified, random sampling design framework consisting of 10 km x 10 km blocks and clusters of plots. The study broadly identified and classified the indicators and attributes of land degradation into soil and site stability, hydrologic function and biotic integrity. Assessment of general vegetation structure showed that over 70% of the land was under cropland with forests accounting for 8% of the area. Sheet erosion was the major form of soil loss. High variability was observed for the soil properties and this can be due to both inherent soil characteristics as well as land management practices. There was distinct variation in the soil properties between the topsoil (0-20 cm) and the subsoil (20-30 cm) with the topsoil having higher values for most of the parameters compared to the subsoil. Using coefficient of variation (CV) as criteria for expressing variability, Ca, TON, Mg, SOC and silt were most variable soil properties for the 0-20 cm depth. Moderate variability (CV 0.15-0.35) was observed for CEC, P, K and clay while Na, Sand and pH had the least variability (CV<0.15). For the subsoil (20-30 cm), Ca, Mg and silt were the most variable. About 94% of the farms sampled were recorded to have very strongly acidic soil levels (pH 4.5-5.5) while 6% of the farms had moderately acidic soil levels (pH 5.6-6.0). Over 55% of the farms had low (<2%) total organic carbon levels and this varied with land use. Soils with SOM below this 'critical level' are at a threat of degradation if not well managed. The principal component analysis (PCA) identified three main explanatory factors for soil variability: 'soil fertility potential', 'soil physical properties' and 'available P'. Improving productivity of land therefore calls for the adoption of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) options as a strategy to ensuring nutrient availability while at the same time building the natural nutrient reserve through soil organic matter build up.

AB  - We analysed the effect of the invasive perennial plant Heracleum sosnowskyi on soil nematode communities and diversity, and plant species composition, by comparing invaded and non-invaded (control) areas in natural conditions. Invasion of H. sosnowskyi caused significant shifts in plant species composition, which subsequently modified nematode assemblages. Stress-sensitive omnivores, fungivores and root-biomass-dependent obligate plant parasites best reflected changes in soil nematode communities under the influence of H. sosnowskyi invasion. The negative effect of H. sosnowskyi was most evident on Aphelenchus, Tylencholaimus, Geocenamus, Helicotylenchus, Pratylenchus, Tylenchorhynchus and Aporcelaimellus. Our results indicate that significant changes in the herbaceous layer after H. sosnowskyi invasion in ecosystems where H. sosnowskyi eventually became dominant impacted soil nematode communities but did not affect nematode diversity. This was in contrast to the habitats where a solitary plant of H. sosnowskyi grew and no significant changes in nematode communities were observed.

AB  - I. pumila natural populations usually occur in two different habitat types: dune and forest. These I. pumila habitats differ in many abiotic environmental factors, but mostly in available light intensity and quality. The effects of different light intensity on the developmental stability of I. pumila floral traits were analyzed on clones taken from two different natural light habitat types that were raised in contrasting light treatments in experimental garden conditions (common garden experiment). As an indicator of developmental stability, we used two fluctuating asymmetry indices (FA1 and FA8a) of three bilateral symmetric traits of I. pumila flower (FW-fall width, SW-standard width and STW- style branch width). In addition, statistically significant treatment x population interaction was observed for style width. According to the presented results, the observed FA patterns of particular traits did not reflect the whole organism buffering capacity under the given environmental conditions.

AB  - Monitoring changes in the environment and the corresponding effects on biological systems still represents a major challenge in many marine and terrestrial ecological studies. Infrared thermography (IRT), and its application within the marine environment, represents an effective non-invasive tool for measuring the temperatures of organisms and their surrounding environment in situ. The use of IRT within the intertidal zone is particularly useful since habitat and organismal temperatures are highly variable across both fine spatial and temporal scales. We review the growing number of intertidal studies that utilise IRT to investigate the role of small-scale temperature variability in contributing to various demographic and ecological processes. In particular, we introduce two indicators of the thermal quality of intertidal habitats that can be readily used by ecologists but also management and conservation policy makers to assess the suitability of a given habitat for a range of species under actual and predicted climatic conditions. We also outline a range of potential applications involving IRT that have yet to be explored for monitoring coastal environments. These include combining photogrammetry, unmanned aerial vehicles and IRT to large-scale three-dimensional thermal maps of intertidal habitats. We also suggest ways in which this technology could facilitate environmental management objectives in a warming world, such as the identification and quantification of thermal refugia across various spatial and temporal scales. We affirm with previous studies that such thermal refugia are vital for the adaptation of intertidal communities to climate change and that IRT could facilitate more effective management and conservation of these areas. The IRT applications outlined in this review are by no means exhaustive or limited to rocky intertidal environments. We envision that IRT will become increasingly popular as environmental management agencies become increasingly concerned about global climate change and how to combat its negative consequences on ecosystems.

AB  - The phytoplankton community structure exhibits seasonal and spatial variations in response to the environmental conditions, which aids in understanding the ecosystem's health. Given this, four samplings were conducted between October 2013 to April 2015, encompassing the monsoon, post-monsoon, and pre-monsoon seasons, from the Haldia port ecosystem of India. The samples were collected from the flowing estuary and an extended semi-enclosed dock. We hypothesized that the seasonal phytoplankton community (diversity, abundance, and carbon biomass) response will differ based on the environmental and hydrographical characteristics of the study site. Picophytoplankton and nano-microphytoplankton dominated the phytoplankton community in terms of numbers and biomass, respectively. Bacillariophytes dominated the nano-microphytoplankton abundance and total biomass, except during the monsoon when Dinophytes contributed (inner-zone). The dominance of Bacillariophytes and Chlorophytes in the outer-zone with picophytoplankton and Dinophytes in the inner-zone indicated group-specific hydrographic preferences that supported the hypothesis. The positive correlation of the picophytoplankton abundance (pre-monsoon) with Secchi disc depth and the negative correlation of diatoms (post-monsoon) with temperature signify the seasonal role of light and temperature, respectively. The highest nano-microphytoplankton species diversity (Shannon-Wiener's index) during the pre-monsoon (inner-zone) with more rare species indicated the probable influence of stable waters with increased water transparency. However, the community was unevenly distributed in the estuary due to the high abundance of the diatom, Aulacoseira granulata. Although harmful algal blooms were not detected, the higher temperature and nutrient concentrations could have favoured potentially harmful species (Pseudonitzschia delicatissima, Dinophysis acuta) during the monsoon. The system ranged from oligo- to mesotrophic state with moderate pollution levels (Carlson's Trophic State Index and Shannon's Index), indicating a reduction of the nutrient accumulation effects by the existing water renewal frequency. This study recommends incorporating qualitative and quantitative phytoplankton assessment in ecological monitoring of the stable coastal sites to prevent future harmful algal episodes.

AB  - Humid tropical forests are increasingly exposed to devastating wildfires. Major efforts are needed to prevent fire-related tipping points and to enable the effective recovery of fire-affected areas. Here, we provide a synthesis of the most common forest restoration strategies, thereby focusing on post-fire forest dynamics in the humid tropics. A variety of restoration strategies can be adopted in restoring humid tropical forests, including natural regeneration, assisted natural regeneration (i.e. fire breaks, weed control, erosion control, topsoil replacement, peatland rewetting), enrichment planting (i.e. planting nursery-raised seedlings, direct seeding) and commercial restoration ( i.e. plantation forests, agroforestry). Our analysis shows that while natural regeneration can be effective under favourable ecological conditions, humid tropical forests are often ill-adapted to fire, and therefore less likely to recover unassisted after a wildfire event. Active restoration practices may be more effective, but can be costly and challenging to implement. We also identify gaps in knowledge needed for effective restoration of humid tropical forests after fire, hereby taking into account the ecosystems and socio-economic conditions in which these fires occur. We suggest to incorporate fire severity in future studies, to better understand and predict post-fire ecosystem responses. In addition, as fire poses a recurring and intensifying threat throughout the recovery process, more emphasis should be placed on post- restoration management and the prevention of fire throughout the different phases of the restoration process. Furthermore, as tropical wildfires are increasing in scale, establishing collaborative capacity and setting priorities for efficient resource allocation should become a major priority for restoration practitioners in the humid tropics. Finally, as global fire regimes are changing and expected to intensify in the context of climate change, land use and land cover change, we suggest to put continuous effort into fire monitoring and modelling to inform the development of effective restoration strategies in the long-run.

AB  - Background: The growing requirement of hazard and risk assessment of environmental chemicals and the efforts to minimize animal testing, increases the demand for innovative and predictive in vitro test systems in toxicology, reflecting the physiological conditions of human nature. Here, an elemental factor regulating a variety of physiological processes is the day-night rhythm. This circadian rhythm, describing a biological oscillation with a 24-h period is hardly acknowledged in toxicology and test method development. Whilst, in animals or humans the entire organism exhibits a rigorous cellular circadian synchrony, in conventional in vitro systems each cell follows its own rhythm, due to the absence of appropriate synchronizing signals.
   Objective: Here we investigated whether circadian synchronization of human cells in an in vitro system improves the cellular response and, thus, increases the sensitivity of the test system. Since the circadian regulation of metabolism is particularly well understood, and dioxin and dioxin-like compounds are of major concern for environmental health we focused on the ubiquitous drug metabolizing detoxification system mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).
   Methods: To this end, we applied various prototypical AHR activators onto different human cell lines under non-synchronized or circadian synchronized conditions and determined the dose response on representative endogenous target genes.
   Results: Remarkably, the cellular response dynamic upon chemical treatment was substantially enhanced in circadian synchronized cells and followed a rhythmic expression pattern. This broader dynamic range was associated with a strikingly higher induction of AHR target genes and the corresponding enzymatic activity, thereby rather mimicking the in vivo situation.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that a synchronized circadian rhythm in a cell culture based test system can improve the physiological relevance of an appropriate in vitro method by reflecting the biological in vivo situation more closely. Accordingly, it is a promising tool to facilitate the wide acceptance of in vitro methods in the field of regulatory toxicology and to further optimize the toxicological assessment of environmental chemicals.

AB  - Better understanding of interactions among belowground and aboveground components in biotopes may improve our knowledge about soil ecosystem, and is necessary in environment assessment using indigenous soil organisms. In this study, we proposed that in disturbed biotopes, vegetation play important role in the buffering of contamination impact on soil communities and decrease the ecological pressure on soil biota. To assess the effects of these interactions we compared nematode communities, known for their bioindication abilities, from four types of disturbed and undisturbed biotopes (coniferous forest, permanent grassland, agricultural field, clearings), where the main stress agent was represented by long-term acidic industrial emissions containing heavy metals (As, Cd, Cu, and Pb). To understand the ecological interactions taking place in studied biotopes, we studied abiotic factors (soil properties) and biotic factors (vegetation, nematode communities). Except significant increase in metals total and mobile concentrations in disturbed biotopes soil, we found acidification of soil horizon, mainly in the clearings (pH= 3.68), due to SO2 precipitation. These factors has caused in clearings degradation of native phytocoenoses and decrease in decomposition rate characterized by high amount of organic matter (C-ox = 4.29%). Nematodes reacts to these conditions by shifts in trophic structure (bacteriovores to fungal feeders), increase in c-p 2 genera (Aphelenchoides, Acrobeloides, and Cephalobus), absence of sensitive groups (c-p 3-5, omnivores, predators), and decrease in ecological indices (SI, MI, MI2-5, H'). Similar contamination was found in forest biotope, but the nematodes composition indicates more suitable conditions; more complex community structure (presence of sensitive trophic and higher c-p groups), higher abundance and indices values, comparable with less stressed field and grassland biotopes. As showed our results, the vegetation undoubtedly plays an important role not only as a resource of services indispensable for the ecosystem, but also as a significant buffer of negative impacts acting within.

AB  - The European Early Modern period provides examples of stagnating and even declining production and energy consumption per capita, which can be interpreted as indicators of an emerging crisis. With a focus on agriculture sector, some have suggested that the crisis was 'conditional'-meaning that a crisis can only be observed in some cases. This article investigates one such case, a village in Southern Sweden during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and investigates the mechanisms that mediate population growth to deteriorating living standards and environmental degradation. It provides new insights into the conditions of pre-industrial agriculture, particularly as regards the consequences of intensified demand pressure in ecologically fragile areas, and argues that human societies must be studied in tandem with their natural surroundings.

AB  - The Proposed Guidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment (USEPA, 1996) identify five criteria for determining ecological adversity: nature and intensity of effects, temporal and spatial scale, and potential for recovery. Assessing changes in the assessment endpoints and reaching conclusions on ecological adversity or significance is ultimately founded on information obtained through monitoring and measurements on ecological systems. Although some monitoring programs have previously been criticized for lack of scientific rigor, answers to questions related to ecological and societal significance must come from assessments founded on ecological monitoring efforts. Identifying the appropriate questions and assessment endpoints for monitoring are critical steps in the design and implementation of the monitoring program. However, the process must be completed. This monitoring information subsequently must form the foundation for assessments that interpret and present the ecological and societal signficance of observed status and trends in resource condition.

AB  - The relationship between tourism development and vegetated landscapes is analyzed for the Luya Mountain Nature Reserve (LMNR), Shanxi, China, in this study. Indices such as Sensitive Level (SL, Landscape Importance Value (LIV), information index of biodiversity (H-'), Shade-tolerant Species Proportion (SSP), and Tourism Influencing Index (TII) are used to characterize vegetated landscapes, the impact of tourism, and their relationship. Their relationship is studied by Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) and Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). TWINSPAN gives correct and rapid partition to the classification, and DCA ordination shows the changing tendency of all vegetation types based on tourism development. These results reflect the ecological relationship between tourism development and vegetated landscapes. In Luya Mountain Nature Reserve, most plant communities are in good or medium condition, which shows that these vegetated landscapes can support more tourism. However, the occurrence of the bad condition shows that there is a severe contradiction between tourism development and vegetated landscapes.

AB  - The ability of Candida albicans to aggregate and adhere to biological surfaces is a topic of major biological and medical importance. One factor which has been implicated in such properties is the hydrophobic nature of the cell surface. Two simple spectroscopic techniques are described which permit the rapid determination of this property. The first involves the use of arylnaphthalenesulfonate, the fluorescence emission maximum of which was shown to be a sensitive indicator of dielectric polarity. This was used to identify the hydrophobic characteristics of the cell surface of C. albicans. The second technique involves the use of 90 degrees Rayleigh-Debye light scattering as an indicator of the aggregation state of a fungal suspension. These techniques were then used to compare the surface properties of three different strains of C. albicans and the effects of culture conditions: the hydrophobicity of the strains varied, and galactose-based culture media promoted the greatest degree of cell surface hydrophobicity.

The year class strength of young crabs is strongly linked to ocean indicators during their planktonic larval development. Many of the same physical and biological ecosystem indicators used in salmon forecasting are also correlated with green crabs, but in the opposite direction. While cold ocean conditions benefit salmon, warm ocean indicators are positively linked to green crab year class strength. Among the best indicators for green crab year class strength are winter water temperatures, the sign of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index, the day of physical and biological spring transitions, and negative biomass anomalies of northern copepods. These correlations suggest that green crabs need (1) warm winters (temperature > 10 degrees C), which enable larvae to complete their development in the near-shore, (2) strong northward flow of coastal waters during winter, which allows larvae to be transported from established populations to the south and (3) coastal circulation patterns that keep larvae close to shore, where they can be carried by wind and tidal currents into estuaries to settle. By using a relatively simple stoplight approach of ranking indicators, we were able to explain 69% of the inter-annual variability in green crab year class strength, while a quantitative metric of a combination of indicators explained 64% of the variability. Recruitment in 2018 and 2019 exceeded what was expected from the suite of ocean indicators. We discuss the possible role of additional larval sources, from the north or from local estuaries, that may have contributed to the increased recruitment during these years. If breeding populations of green crabs in Oregon and Washington continue to build, the relationships between ocean conditions and recruitment we have developed based solely on larval sources from the south could be greatly underestimating recruitment in the future.

AB  - The sedimentary and biological material preserved in wetlands in semi-arid regions provide a rich repository of paleoclimate and paleoecological archives. These records reflect an underutilized, but typically ignored paleoenvironmental resource in semi-arid settings. The results presented here demonstrate that groundwater-fed wetlands constitute a valuable record of environmental change that not only complement reconstructions from lacustrine settings, but also contribute unique data and insights into climate and landscape change.
   We use data obtained from sediment cores collected from Loboi wetland, a groundwater-fed wetland located in the Equatorial East African Rift Valley of Kenya, to demonstrate the value of paleoenvironmental datasets extracted from wetland archives. This article relates surficial sedimentary geochemical data (TOC, delta C-13, delta N-15, C:N, and %C3) at Loboi to the extant macrophytic vegetation. The surficial data are used as an analog to interpret the geochemical signature of three sediment cores and a soil pit. The stratigraphic records show significant variation along a north to south transect through the wetland. The geochemistry indicates that papyrus wetland records are distinctly different from Typha dominated wetland sedimentary signatures. The interpretation of the stratigraphic material is further improved by the inclusion of sub-fossil macrophyte and testate amoebae remains. The extraction and identification of seeds of wetland plants from the sedimentary archive provide invaluable genus to species specific details of wetland ecology. Further, the inclusion of testate amoebae as an indicator of surface hydrological conditions has significantly improved interpretation of the hydrological history of Loboi wetland.
   The stratigraphic record from Loboi indicates that between similar to 1100 and 1470 C.E. (Medieval Climatic Anomaly) dry conditions dominated the Loboi region, except for a brief period of wetter conditions between similar to 1275 and 1345 C.E. Seasonally wetter conditions began to persist between -1470 and 1630 C.E. Wetland sediments developed after this time as reflected by the sequestration of carbon in the sedimentary record. Recent historic biological and sedimentary proxies reflect increased agrarian impacts on the landscape surrounding Loboi.

AB  - Improvement in body condition and carcass traits through nutritional intervention was studied in cull ewes. Sixty-eight adult non-productive Malpura ewes (average body weight 26.7 +/- 0.33 kg) were randomly divided into four equal groups: G0 maintained on free grazing for 8 h on protected natural rangeland with ad libitum guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) straw (GS) after grazing; G1, G2 and G3 fed with supplemental concentrate at the rate of 250 g, 2.5% of live weight (LW) and ad libitum, respectively. The experiment was continued for 90 days and daily feed intake, weekly LW and body condition score (BCS) were recorded. Intake and digestibility of nutrients were assessed by indicator method. Rumen fermentation attributes and blood biochemical profile were studied to assess the dietary effects and animals were slaughtered at the end of experiment for evaluation of carcass characteristics. Higher dry matter (DM) intake and improvement in plane of nutrition was observed in G2 and G3 with a higher LW gain (LWG) and improvement in BCS than in G0. The digestibility of DM, organic matter, CP, ADF and cellulose was higher (P < 0.05) in G2 and G3 than in G0. A lower ruminal pH and ammonia N but higher total N and trichloroacetic acid-precipitable N, an increase in holotrichs, spirotrichs and total protozoa population, increase in haemoglobin but decrease in serum total cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acids were observed in high-concentrate-fed groups. Carcass attributes revealed increase (P < 0.05) in empty LW, dressing yield, eye muscle area, subcutaneous and intramuscular fat, decrease in shear force value and higher (P < 0.05) protein content in Longissimus dorsi muscle in test groups than in the control. Above all, the G2 animals had better rumen environment and blood biochemical attributes and consumed more feed with enhanced digestibility that supported higher LWG at better feed conversion efficiency, improvement in BCS and carcass quality. Thus, re-alimentation of cull ewes with challenged feeding of concentrate at 2.5% of LW on a basal roughage diet for a period of 3 months may have promise for better economic return to the farmers with possibly meeting quality mutton for human consumption.

AB  - On the basis of the leapfrog development of cities, the rise of industrial production, the advancement of scientific and technological means, and the increase in the total population have caused great damage to the ecological environment in the city, and the problems in the ecological environment have become increasingly obvious. The urban ecological environment is particularly fragile and sensitive and is greatly affected by human activities. Academic research on such issues is gradually increasing. A reasonable assessment of the sensitivity of the ecological environment in a city can help people better understand it and grasp the main factors that are affected, to provide targeted solutions. Principal component analysis is used to analyze the driving forces that affect the fragility of the ecological environment in Daqing, including natural factors such as climate conditions and vegetation coverage, as well as social factors such as land development and population density. Then, based on the evaluation principle and the actual situation of Daqing, combined with the evaluation basis of principal component analysis, an index evaluation system is constructed. The BP artificial neural network method is used to evaluate the fragility of the ecological environment in Daqing. The research results show that according to the operating principles and rules of the BP neural network, the ecosystem vulnerability measurement framework of Daqing is constructed. After simulation training, the ecological environment vulnerability training results are 0.2045 for level I, 1.0045 for level II, and -0.1802 for level III. There is only an error of 0.0051 between the output value and the expected output value of level II. It is finally determined that the ecological vulnerability of Daqing is moderate. According to the error surface and contour line graph obtained from the research results, the total variance data value of BP neural network training is relatively small, and the result is basically 0, indicating that the network training basically conforms to the expected goal.

AB  - Non-native species introductions affect freshwater communities by changing community compositions, functional roles, trait occurrences and ecological niche spaces. Reconstructing such changes over long periods is difficult due to limited data availability. We collected information spanning 215 years on fish and selected macroinvertebrate groups (Mollusca and Crustacea) in the inner-Florentine stretch of the Arno River (Italy) and associated water grid, to investigate temporal changes. We identified an almost complete turnover from native to non-native fish (1800: 92% native; 2015: 94% non-native species) and macroinvertebrate species (1800: 100% native; 2015: 70% non-native species). Non-native fish species were observed similar to 50 years earlier compared to macroinvertebrate species, indicating phased invasion processes. In contrast, alpha-diversity of both communities increased significantly following a linear pattern. Separate analyses of changes in alpha-diversities for native and non-native species of both fish and macroinvertebrates were nonlinear. Functional richness and divergence of fish and macroinvertebrate communities decreased non-significantly, as the loss of native species was compensated by non-native species. Introductions of non-native fish and macroinvertebrate species occurred outside the niche space of native species. Native and non-native fish species exhibited greater overlap in niche space over time (62%-68%) and non-native species eventually replaced native species. Native and non-native macroinvertebrate niches overlapped to a lesser extent (15%-30%), with non-natives occupying mostly unoccupied niche space. These temporal changes in niche spaces of both biotic groups are a direct response to the observed changes in alpha-diversity and species turnover. These changes are potentially driven by deteriorations in hydromorphology as indicated by alterations in trait modalities. Additionally, we identified that angling played a considerable role for fish introductions. Our results support previous findings that the community turnover from native to non-native species can be facilitated by, for example, deteriorating environmental conditions and that variations in communities are multifaceted requiring more indicators than single metrics.

AB  - A uranium-mineralized sandy aquifer, planned for mining by means of uranium in situ recovery (U ISR), harbors a reservoir of bacterial life that may influence the biogeochemical cycles surrounding uranium roll-front deposits. Since microorganisms play an important role at all stages of U ISR, a better knowledge of the resident bacteria before any ISR actuations is essential to face environmental quality assessment. The focus here was on the characterization of bacteria residing in an aquifer surrounding a uranium roll-front deposit that forms part of an ISR facility project at Zoovch Ovoo (Mongolia). Water samples were collected following the natural redox zonation inherited in the native aquifer, including the mineralized orebody, as well as compartments located both upstream (oxidized waters) and downstream (reduced waters) of this area. An imposed chemical zonation for all sensitive redox elements through the roll-front system was observed. In addition, high-throughput sequencing data showed that the bacterial community structure was shaped by the redox gradient and oxygen availability. Several interesting bacteria were identified, including sulphate-reducing (e.g. Desulfovibrio, Nitrospira), iron-reducing (e.g. Gallionella, Sideroxydans), iron-oxidizing (e.g. Rhodobacter, Albidiferax, Ferribacterium), and nitrate-reducing bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas, Aquabacterium), which may also be involved in metal reduction (e.g. Desulfovibrio, Ferribacterium, Pseudomonas, Albidiferax, Caulobacter, Zooglea). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and co-occurrence patterns confirmed strong correlations among the bacterial genera, suggesting either shared/preferred environmental conditions or the performance of similar/complementary functions. As a whole, the bacterial community residing in each aquifer compartment would appear to define an ecologically functional ecosystem, containing suitable microorganisms (e.g. acidophilic bacteria) prone to promote the remediation of the acidified aquifer by natural attenuation. Assessing the composition and structure of the aquifer's native bacteria is a prerequisite for understanding natural attenuation and predicting the role of bacterial input in improving ISR efficiency.

AB  - Ecological network analysis (ENA) provides numerous ecosystem level indices offering a valuable approach to compare and categorize the ecological structure and function of ecosystems. The inclusion of ENA methods in Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) has insured their continued contribution to ecosystem-based management. In EwE, ENA-derived ecological conclusions are currently based on single values of ENA indices calculated from a unique input flow matrix. Here, we document an easy-to-use routine that allows EwE users to incorporate uncertainty in EwE input data into the calculation of ENA indices. This routine, named ENAtool, is a suite of Matlab functions that performs three main steps: (1) import of an existing Ecopath model and its associated parameter uncertainty values in the form of uncertainty intervals into Matlab; (2) generation of an ensemble of Ecopath models with the same structure as the original, and with parameter values varying based on the prescribed uncertainty limits; and (3) calculation of a set of 13 ENA indices for each ensemble member (one set of flow values) and of summary statistics across the whole ensemble. This novel routine offers the opportunity to calculate ENA indices ranges and confidence intervals, and thus to perform quantitative data analyses. An application of ENAtool on a pre-existing Ecopath model of the Bay of Biscay continental shelf is presented, with a focus on the robustness of previously published ENA-based ecological traits of this ecosystem when the newly introduced uncertainty values are added. We also describe the sensitivity of the ENAtool results to both the number of ensemble members used and to the uncertainty interval set around each input parameter. Ecological conclusions derived from EwE, particularly those regarding the comparison of structural and functional elements for a range of ecosystem types or the assessment of ecosystem properties along gradients of environmental conditions or anthropogenic disturbances, will gain in statistical interpretability.

AB  - 1. This account reviews information on all aspects of the biology of Mercurialis perennis that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation.
   2. Mercurialis perennis is a dioecious, clonal, perennial forb of woodland, hedgerows, limestone pavement, screes and tall-herb communities. It is very tolerant of low light; it can also grow in unshaded conditions, although higher light flux densities result in lower shoot biomass. It is Eurocaucasic, occurring throughout temperate areas of Europe as far east as the Russian border.
   3. Mercurialis perennis occurs on a wide variety of soil types over a pH range from 4.3 to 8.5, although it is most abundant on more base-rich clay or loam soils with a low organic content. It seldom occurs on peat or very sandy soils. It can grow in soils with low availability of macronutrients but it responds positively to nutrient addition from atmospheric or agricultural sources. It is intolerant of waterlogging, mainly because of poor aerenchyma development; its limited capacity to oxygenate the root environment can lead to ferrous ion toxicity. The resulting superficial root development on heavy soils may confer drought susceptibility in summer.
   4. Mercurialis perennis is predominantly wind-pollinated. Ants are the main dispersal agents and the seed bears an elaiosome which offers them a lipid-rich reward. Establishment from seed is uncommon and vegetative propagation is the main means of expansion, often leading to dense clonal stands of aerial shoots.
   5. Mercurialis perennis has been described as a stress-tolerant competitor. The persistence of its clones and slow dispersal have led to it being regarded an as indicator of ancient, semi-natural woodland.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs; <5 mm) released into freshwaters from anthropogenic sources accumulate in sediments, where they may pose an environmental threat to benthic organisms, such as nematodes. Several studies have examined the effects of nano- and microplastics on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas reduced food availability was suggested as a possible explanation for the observed inhibitory effects. Therefore, this study should clarify whether micro-beads of different sizes (1.0 and 6.0 mu m in diameter) and materials (polystyrene PS, silica) are able to interfere with the feeding of C. elegans on its bacterial diet (Escherichia coli), and, by this, lowering its consumption rate within 7 h of exposure. Moreover, it was examined whether an inhibited bacterial consumption was caused by a reduction of the nematode's pumping rate, as a primary indicator of food ingestion. Bacterial consumption by C. elegans was significantly decreased in the presence of 1.0- and 6.0-mu m PS beads (49-67% lower bacterial consumption compared to control), whereas in the presence of 1.0-mu m silica beads feeding was not impeded. Interestingly, the pumping rate was significantly lower in the presence of non-ingestible 6.0-mu m PS beads with 161 mu 16 pumps min(-1), while it was largely unchanged for nematodes exposed to ingestible 1.0-mu m PS beads with 205 mu 12 pumps min(-1), compared to control conditions with 210 mu 18 pumps min(-1), respectively. As reduced bacterial consumption leads to generally lower energy reserves in C. elegans, these results allow to link observed inhibitory effects of MPs on the nematodes to a lower food availability. Such indirect, food-web related, effects of MPs should raise concern of ecological consequences in natural habitats, where temporal food deficiencies can occur. Consequently, disturbances in food availability and feeding efficiency should be regarded as important parameters in environmental risk assessments focusing on MPs. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 1. The main impacts on marine ecosystems are summarised and the potential for their restoration is discussed in relation to their key features. Rocky shores, seagrass beds and disused docks are focused on.
   2. The term restoration is used to describe intervention in the recovery process of a marine ecosystem, with a view to enhancing the process, but not necessarily:forcing the system to recover to its original condition.
   3. Rocky shore systems are subject to shellfish and seaweed exploitation, point source pollution, diffuse impacts such as tributyl tin and acute impacts such as oil spills. The consideration of whether to employ restoration or allow natural recovery is discussed in relation to these systems.
   4. Seagrass systems have suffered serious declines in many parts of the world due to the direct and indirect effects of human impacts. In the North Atlantic a wasting disease first noted in the 1930s caused a serious decline in the subtidal seagrass Zostera marina. The link between this disease and the marine slime mould Labrynthula zosterae is now well established. Human impacts on seagrass systems allow the disease to gain a foothold. Attempts at restoring seagrass beds have met with some success, but it is suggested that the action of conservation of remaining beds and better management of human activities may be the best approach.
   5. Disused docks occur in many parts of Britain and Europe. Active management of the physical environment by mixing and biomanipulation by filter feeding organisms have led to improvements in water quality and ecosystem function. Thus healthy marine ecosystems have been restored to inner city areas, although these artificial marine lakes have few natural equivalents and are different from the original ecosystem at the site.
   6. When compared to freshwater ecosystems, the scope for coastal and marine restoration is limited although the capacity for recovery is greater. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - As the mapping and assessment of ecosystem services (MAES) becomes a widely used tool in environmental governance, there is an increasing need for structure and standardization. In this study we present a systematic review of European MAES studies focussing on two important, but rarely documented aspects of ecosystem service (ES) indicators: (1) their 'position' with respect to the ecosystem service cascade model, and (2) their 'position' in geographical space, i.e. whether the maps are 'anchored' at the locations of their supply or their demand.
   From the 82 papers reviewed we found 427 ES indicators, which represented 33 ES. Among these indicators there were 108 (25%) that were mapped. ES are quite different in terms of their relationship with the main conceptual model of ES assessment studies. Most ES are typically measured at a specific point in the cascade, which is more or less the same across the different studies. While some ES (including most of the regulating ES, e.g. bio-remediation, hydrological cycle maintenance, or soil fertility) can clearly be linked to the 'natural' endpoint of the cascade, some others (including all cultural and some provisioning ES, like cultivated crops, or wild animals) are more frequently measured as actual flows or benefits delivered to humanity. There are few ES that are markedly heterogeneous in their cascade levels (e.g. water provision, pest control) for which apparently different assessment approaches exist.
   Considering spatial anchor, we have found that mapping at the source predominates in ES mapping studies: 91% of the mapped indicators are clearly linked to the source ecosystems. There were relatively few studies that applied a mixed approach, whereas indicators clearly anchored at beneficiaries were extremely rare.
   These two aspects of ES indicators discussed in this paper are critical in the successful operationalization and standardization of MAES assessments, which have been neglected in the MAES literature so far, which might be seen as key components in the future standardization of mapping and assessment approaches.

AB  - Understanding food webs environmental condition is a challenging task since evaluations are limited by data on key ecosystem elements, by the availability of indicators that incorporate relevant guilds and by the difficulty in establishing cause-effect relations between pressures and health status, as multiple overlapping pressures can affect taxonomic elements differently. The present work aims to investigate food webs assessment under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), revealing gaps and future research needs in the North Eastern Atlantic. To understand reporting patterns, information on the criteria employed and the resulting assessment trends of Descriptor 4-Food webs were surveyed from the MSFD reports. A multivariate analysis was applied to food webs assessment status and spatially overlapping anthropogenic pressures to understand if the assessment was detecting pressures, considering fish elements. Results revealed that reporting strategies varied between Member States. High reporting effort was exhibited by the United Kingdom in opposition to Ireland or France. Reporting of other groups other than fish and plankton was limited to the United Kingdom due to the availability of monitoring programs and data. The analysis applied to criteria considering fish elements reinforced that reporting strategies and trends differed between countries, although some similarities were found for the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast and the Celtic Seas. Food webs assessment trends for fish were variable in Spain and were stable or increased in Portugal and the United Kingdom. Anthropogenic drivers significantly influencing food web trends for fish elements were fishing, and climate anomalies in the southern Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast, while eutrophication and chemical contamination had effects on trends in the Celtic Sea and the North Sea. Results allowed to establish a relation between anthropogenic effects and food web patterns, however, these were limited since food webs assessment is incongruent in terms of criteria used and data is still limited at relevant scales. This study reinforced the necessity to increase Member States harmonization and calibration to improve our understanding of food webs environmental status.

AB  - Many studies show the significant impact of direct and indirect human activity on the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, including forests. The increase in the number of invasive species, changes caused by climate change, or eutrophication of habitats resulting from air pollution can irrevocably affect biodiversity, species composition, or species interactions. Many of these effects cannot be seen in commercial forests due to the significant impact of direct human use of the forest and the high degree of transformation of forest ecosystems. In this work, we ask: how have forest communities changed over the past 70 years? What was the reason for these changes? To answer the above questions, we conducted research on repeated observations in the core area of the Bialowie(z) over dota National Park, which is characterized by one of the highest degrees of naturalness in Europe, where ecological processes have occurred without direct human intervention since the last glaciation. Studies have shown directional changes in species composition and biotic homogenization of three forest communities. Directional changes were found to be associated with both eutrophication of habitats as well as with changes in humidity and temperature. However, the observed changes in species composition were opposite to the hypotheses based on the observed global change. In contrast, changes in the species composition of the stand and the ability to shade and buffer the temperature and humidity under the canopy caused changes in the species composition of forest communities. In the mixed deciduous forest, homogenization occurred along with the simultaneous change of species composition of forest communities. This was caused by an increase in fertility caused by increased nitrogen deposition and changes in environmental conditions prevailing under the canopy of trees, which, however, were caused by changes in the species composition of the stand.

AB  - Aim Spatial models of the impacts of climate change generally assume that species are restricted to their realized niche, and will persist only if that niche remains accessible through time. However, species often have physiological limits beyond the range of environmental conditions experienced in their present realized niche, and these limits may also be extended further through evolution in response to the selection pressure provided by climate change. Our aim was to develop a general framework for incorporating key parameters relating to physiological limits and adaptive evolution into models of the impact of climate change.
   Location Global.
   Methods Four types of parameter are defined in our framework: the realized limit, the current physiological limit, the evolutionary physiological limit and the rate of adaptive evolution. These parameters can be estimated or predicted using a variety of information sources, and can be applied to a diverse range of modelling approaches.
   Results We illustrate the utility of this approach by describing how parameters can be measured directly for model species, and by exploring how minimal information on phylogeny and distribution might enable parameter estimation for less well-studied species. We outline a general strategy for deriving these parameters from ongoing research, involving a cascading hierarchy of information ranging from direct observations of traits closely linked to the parameters of interest (e.g. from physiological or evolutionary experimentation) through to more distal indicators (e.g. ecological traits such as niche position or range size).
   Main conclusions The incorporation of adaptive capacity into spatial modelling of biological responses to climate change is now eminently achievable. Significant sources of data are available that can be used as predictors or indicators of physiological limits and the capacity for adaptive evolution innon-model organisms. These data offer a common currency for addressing one of the most important limitations of current efforts to model the impacts of climate change on biological distributions.

AB  - The most important objective within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is to achieve a 'good ecological status' (GES) for all waters, by 2015. Some methodologies have been developed for assessing GES within natural water bodies, in which the ecological status is a perceived or measured deviation from a reference condition. However, the WFD also consider 'Heavily modified water bodies' (HMWB) (a water body resulted from physical alterations by human activity, which substantially change its hydrogeomorphological character, e.g. a harbour). In implementing the WFD, environmental managers are required to assess the status of HMWBs in terms of achieving 'Good Ecological Potential' (GEP). This contribution defines and studies GEP from an ecological point of view, taking into account some ecological restoration principles. Finally, this contribution gives some guidance on how establish GEP, using as example a harbour within the North East Atlantic. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intelligent Rural Tourism Environmental Suitability Evaluation System Based on a Wireless Sensor Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
LA  - English
AB  - After years of vigorous development, the scale of rural tourism industry has gradually expanded throughout the country, and it has become an important means of coordinating urban and rural areas to drive farmers' incomes and get rich. Nowadays, the level of informatization is constantly improving, the construction of smart cities is constantly advancing, the personalized demand of tourists is increasingly strong, especially the rural tourist spots scattered in the vast countryside which have a great spatial breadth, and the traditional management method can no longer meet the needs of the source objects whose main travel mode is self-driving. Therefore, only when rural tourism develops in the direction of intelligence can it successfully realize the transformation and upgrading of rural tourism industry. This paper takes a rural tourism resort in a certain area as the research object and builds an intelligent rural tourism environmental suitability evaluation system with three criterion levels: natural geographic conditions, traffic environmental conditions, and tourism spatial conditions. The weight of each indicator layer is obtained through the analytic hierarchy process, and the reclassified raster data of indicators is weighted and superimposed on the ArcGIS operating platform to obtain the evaluation result of the environmental suitability of smart rural tourism. According to the results of suitability evaluation, the most suitable area is selected as the potential area of the intelligent rural tourism environment in a certain area. According to the natural and cultural tourism resource conditions in the block, the potential block is divided into functions. A comprehensive comparison of the suitability spatial differentiation map of the smart rural tourism environment in a certain area with the suitability spatial differentiation map of each subsystem can more clearly find that the suitability score of the economic development subsystem and the basic support subsystem is a county-level village in a certain area. Among them, the suitability of the rural economic development subsystem is similar to the distribution of the suitability of the smart rural tourism environment in a certain area; that is, it is positively correlated with the suitability of the smart rural tourism environment. Therefore, improving the level of rural economic development and increasing investment in the construction of a smart rural tourism environment play an important role in improving the level of public services and infrastructure coverage.

AB  - Forests contribute to the sequestration of organic carbon (C). A key role in forest C cycling is played by deadwood. While a broad range of literature on deadwood decay (above-ground) exists, the mechanisms occurring in the transition zone from deadwood to the humus are poorly understood. In particular, scarce information is available on the temporal patterns of wood compounds (such as lignin and cellulose) during decay processes.
   Our objective was to provide a deeper understanding on deadwood decay in a Mediterranean montane environment by focussing on semi-natural forests of Fagus sylvatica L. (beech). The decay process was studied in a field experiment (in the Majella mountains, Apennine Mountains, Italy) among an altitudinal transect at different climatic conditions. Beech wood blocks (mass, cellulose, lignin) having all an equal in size (5 cm x 5 cm x 2 cm) were placed in soil mesocosms to investigate over one year changes in the overall mass, cellulose and lignin content. The sites were along an altitudinal gradient, reflecting different climatic conditions. The effect of exposure (north- vs. south-facing slopes) was also considered. Deadwood, cellulose and lignin dynamics were related to soil parameters (pH, grain size, moisture, temperature) and climate data. Deadwood decayed very fast and followed an exponential trend. The decay rate constants of the deadwood mass significantly (positively) correlated with air temperature and soil moisture: the lower the temperature, the lower the evapotranspiration, the higher the moisture availability, and the higher the decay rates. Lignin decayed more slowly than cellulose, resulting in average decay rate constants (k) between 0.368 and 0.382 y(-1). Soil properties and topographic traits (slope and exposure) strongly influenced the decay processes. At south-facing sites (having an altitude < 1300 m a.s.l., above sea level), decay processes were lower owing, most likely, to drier conditions. The climosequence revealed slower beech deadwood decay processes in south- than north-facing sites of these Mediterranean mountains, owing to the drier conditions. In-field mesocosms were useful to define meaningful indicators of warming-induced changes on the linkages between C storage in beech deadwood and decomposition processes as a function of altitude and exposure.

AB  - The tropical island of Sri Lanka, with a land area of 65,610 km(2) and 1340 km of coastline, is highly vulnerable to impacts of climate change, with detrimental effects on agriculture, water resources, human health, coastal zones, infrastructure, industry, and biodiversity. A general increase in temperature and precipitation patterns, rising sea levels, and increase in weather-related natural disasters, such as floods and droughts, have been traced over the years. Bryophytes (liverworts, mosses, hornworts) occupy a pivotal position in the land plant evolution and form a unique part of the vegetation. Many taxa of bryophytes exhibit observable, distinct adaptations in response to changes in environmental conditions quickly. Bryophytes can be used to monitor climate change in two ways; (i) presence or absence in the ecosystem and (ii) changes in morphology and physiology that can be used for monitoring. Sri Lanka has a rich bryophyte flora consisting of 575 species of mosses, 338 species of liverworts, and 07 species of hornworts. It is estimated that 11% of mosses are endemic; there are no endemic thalloid liverworts or hornworts found in Sri Lanka, and the endemicity of leafy liverworts is yet to be investigated. The taxonomic status of endemic taxa and the biogeographic affinities of many taxa remain unexplored. Further, the potential use of bryophytes as indicators of climate change in Sri Lanka has not yet been investigated. This paper compiles the information on morphological and physiological responses of bryophytes to elevated temperature, increase in greenhouse gases, increased ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation, and fluctuations in humidity. In the light of this gathered global knowledge, possible species of bryophytes to be used in assessing and predicting climate change and developing a climate change model in Sri Lanka are proposed. Asian bryophytes, in general, have poorly been represented in climate change literature. We believe that this knowledge will form the foundation for future research focused on climate change mitigation in other tropical and Asian countries.

AB  - Nutrient loading is a major threat to estuaries and coastal environments worldwide, therefore, it is critical that we have good monitoring tools to detect early signs of degradation in these ecologically important and vulnerable ecosystems. Traditionally, bottom-dwelling macroinvertebrates have been used for ecological health assessment but recent advances in environmental genomics mean we can now characterize less visible forms of biodiversity, offering a more holistic view of the ecosystem and potentially providing early warning signals of disturbance. We carried out a manipulative nutrient enrichment experiment (0, 150 and 600 g N fertilizer m-2) in two estuaries in New Zealand to assess the effects of nutrient loading on benthic communities. After seven months of enrichment, environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding was used to examine the response of eukaryotic (18S rRNA), diatom only (rbcL) and bacterial (16S rRNA) communities. Multivariate analyses demonstrated changes in eukaryotic, diatom and bacterial communities in response to nutrient enrichment at both sites, despite differing environmental conditions. These patterns aligned with changes in macrofaunal communities identified using traditional morphological techniques, confirming concordance between disturbance indicators detected by eDNA and current monitoring approaches. Clear shifts in eukaryotic and bacterial indicator taxa were seen in response to nutrient loading while changes in diatom only communities were more subtle. Community changes were discernible between 0 and 150 g N m(-2) treatments, suggesting that estuary health assessment tools could be developed to detect early signs of degradation. Increasing variation in community structure associated with nutrient loading could also be used as an indicator of stress or approaching tipping points. This work represents a first step towards the development of molecular-based estuary monitoring tools, which could provide a more holistic and standardized approach to ecosystem health assessment with faster turn-around times and lower costs.

AB  - Urban impacts on streams are mediated by alteration of land cover and subsurface drainage. Understanding interactions of these 2 effects is critical for urban land and water management. We used boosted regression trees to analyze relationships between environmental predictors, including land-cover measures that indicate urban impacts, and Stream Invertebrate Grade Number Average Level (SIGNAL) or the occurrence of 60 macroinvertebrate families across the Melbourne (Australia) region. SIGNAL and 51 families were negatively correlated with attenuated imperviousness (AI). Twenty-four families exhibited a steep decline in probability of occurrence between 0 and <= 3% AI, consistent across the range of natural discharge (Q). Responses to attenuated forest cover (AF) were more variable among families (39 positive, 15 negative). AF had a less positive influence on SIGNAL at high than at low AI because the many (high SIGNAL-grade) families that were strongly negatively correlated with AI were likely to be absent at high AI. Interactions that suggested a modification of response to AI or AF as a result of the influence of another variable were restricted to 19 families. For 4 families with occurrences that were positively correlated with AF, the negative effect of AI was reduced in streams with high AF. For 14 families, responses of occurrence to AI or AF varied with Q or antecedent discharge in multiple ways. A reduced effect of AI was observed in low-Q streams or after very dry antecedent conditions for 10 families. Despite strong effects of the regional gradient in rainfall and vegetation across our study area, catchment-scale urban stormwater drainage was consistently associated with reduced occurrence of most families. The relative number of families predicted to be lost at low levels of AI underestimated relative loss of genera or species. Urban stormwater runoff probably is a strong driver of species loss in streams, but riparian forest can increase the probability of occurrence of a small number of tolerant families.

AB  - The article shows the essence of environmental protection costs, related to the environmental protection of a number of construction companies, as well as the need to form and implement an effective environmental strategy. The article examines the approaches of management accounting to the value and quantitative assessment of environmental protection costs. A cost management mechanism has been developed in the framework of the "business - process - function" categories, based on the acquisition of certain functions by costs at the intersection of functions and business processes, including the conditions necessary for accounting: accuracy, efficiency and quality of accounting data. The developed methodology for the functional and process accounting of environmental protection costs makes it possible to identify the costs by processes and functional blocks and ensure the creation of high-quality accounting information on the formation of environmental protection costs and their results.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and forest management have been considered to drastically alter the nature of forest ecosystems globally. However, much uncertainty remains regarding the causative mechanisms mediating temperate forest responses, such as forest physical environment and the structure of woody plant assemblages, regardless of the role these forests play for global sustainability. In this paper, we examine how both habitat fragmentation and timber exploitation via silvicultural operations affect these two factors at local and habitat spatial scales in a hyper-fragmented landscape of mixed beech forests spanning more than 1500 km(2)in SW Germany. Variables were recorded across 57 1000 m(2)plots covering four habitats: small forest fragments, forest edges within large control forests, as well as managed and unmanaged forest interior sites. As expected, forest habitats differed in disturbance level, physical conditions and community structure at plot and habitat scale. Briefly, diversity of plant assemblages differed across all forest habitats (highest in edge forests) and correlated with integrative indices of edge, fragmentation and management effects. Surprisingly, managed and unmanaged forests did not differ in terms of species richness at local spatial scale, but managed forests exhibited a clear signal of physical/floristic homogenization as species promoted by silviculture proliferated; i.e. impoverished communities at landscape scale. Moreover, functional composition of plant communities responded to the microclimatic regime within forest fragments, resulting in a higher prevalence of species adapted to these microclimatic conditions. Our results underscore the notion that forest fragmentation and silvicultural management (1) promote changes in microclimatic regimes, (2) alter the balance between light-demanding and shade-adapted species, (3) support diverse floras across forest edges, and (4) alter patterns of beta diversity. Hence, in human-modified landscapes edge-affected habitats can be recognized as biodiversity reservoirs in contrast to impoverished managed interior forests. Furthermore, our results ratify the role of unmanaged forests as a source of environmental variability, species turnover, and distinct woody plant communities.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are under increasing stress from global anthropogenic and natural changes, including climate change, eutrophication, ocean acidification, and pollution. In this critical review, we synthesize research on the microbiota of aquatic vertebrates and discuss the impact of emerging stressors on aquatic microbial communities using two case studies, that of toxic cyanobacteria and microplastics. Most studies to date are focused on host-associated microbiomes of individual organisms, however, few studies take an integrative approach to examine aquatic vertebrate microbiomes by considering both host-associated and free-living microbiota within an ecosystem. We highlight what is known about microbiota in aquatic ecosystems, with a focus on the interface between water, fish, and marine mammals. Though microbiomes in water vary with geography, temperature, depth, and other factors, core microbial functions such as primary production, nitrogen cycling, and nutrient metabolism are often conserved across aquatic environments. We outline knowledge on the composition and function of tissue-specific microbiomes in fish and marine mammals and discuss the environmental factors influencing their structure. The microbiota of aquatic mammals and fish are highly unique to species and a delicate balance between respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal microbiota exists within the host. In aquatic vertebrates, water conditions and ecological niche are driving factors behind microbial composition and function. We also generate a comprehensive catalog of marine mammal and fish microbial genera, revealing commonalities in composition and function among aquatic species, and discuss the potential use of microbiomes as indicators of health and ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. We also discuss the importance of a focus on the functional relevance of microbial communities in relation to organism physiology and their ability to overcome stressors related to global change. Understanding the dynamic relationship between aquatic microbiota and the animals they colonize is critical for monitoring water quality and population health.

AB  - This paper considers the theoretical and methodological aspects of landscape-hydrological analysis in substantiating the possible development of recreational activities within the boundaries of the central ecological zone of the Baikal natural territory (BNT CEZ) in Irkutsk oblast. The hydrological characteristics of the landscapes in terms of their sensitivity and resistance to natural changes and external influences are given. We carried out a landscape-hydrological zoning for the BNT CEZ territory within the boundaries of Irkutsk oblast having regard to the conditions of runoff formation, the characteristic features of its regulation in various landscapes, and to the possibility of preserving the natural water regime and the waterecological state in utilizing the territory. It is determined that the main factors for the landscape differentiation in assessing the advisability of recreational development without damage to the Lake Baikal ecosystem and to the natural waters of BNT CEZ as a whole are the hydrological properties of landscapes and resistance of natural complexes to impacts. It is found that the level of realization of the main hydrological functions of landscapes, i. e. the runoff formation, runoff regulation and water protection functions, characterizes the involvement of the natural complex in the formation of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the local runoff, in the replenishment processes of dynamical reserves of subsurface waters, the regulation of natural floods and freshets, the preservation of the water-ecological potential of the territory. As a result a landscape-hydrological framework zoning of the territory using the landscape planning tools, three zones have been identified: the zone of the preservation of the existing state, the zone of regulated use, and the zone of territorial development. The proposed zones have general recommendations for the preservation of the hydrological and water-ecological indicators of the natural complexes which imply abandoning any activity in areas of particularly high value and highly sensitive to impacts, and the possibility of developing recreational activities in sustainable areas, subject to environmental protection measures.

AB  - In order to assess the extent of existing anthropogenic influence on biota of the vulnerable karst ecosystem of the Krka River, multi-biomarker approach was applied in the intestinal tissue of brown trout Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758. Biomarkers of the general stress (total cytosolic proteins), oxidative stress (malondialdehyde), antioxidant capacity (catalase activity, total glutathione) and of an exposure and effect of contaminants, especially metals (metallothionein) and organophosphorous pesticides and metals (acetylcholine esterase activity) were compared in the intestine of fish from the reference site (river source) and downstream of the technological and municipal wastewater impacted site (town of Knin) in two seasons, October 2015 and May 2016. Biological response was additionally evaluated by metal/metalloid concentrations in intestinal cytosol. Site-specific differences were observed as significantly higher As, Ca, Co, Cu, Se and Sr concentrations in intestinal cytosol of fish from the contaminated compared to the reference site. Significant seasonal differences existed for Ni, Cd, Mo, Cs and Na, with higher levels in autumn, following the trend of most of the dissolved metal levels in the river water. Impact of improperly treated wastewaters was also confirmed by significantly increased levels of glutathione, total proteins and Foulton condition indices, with 1.5, 1.13 and 1.12 times higher average values in fish from that site compared to the river source, respectively. The other biomarkers showed similar trend and pointed to specific biological changes regarding oxidative stress or metal exposure in fish from the anthropogenically impacted site, especially in autumn, but without significant differences. Thus, the anthropogenic impact still seems to be only moderate, although cytosolic metals and most of the biomarkers in fish intestine were confirmed as initial indicators of pollution impact, which pointed to the need of continuous monitoring of the Krka River in order to protect this natural karst world phenomenon.

AB  - Early-warning biomarkers, such as mitochondrial activity, have become a key tool in ecosystem assessment. This study aims to evaluate the response of mitochondrial activity in spores of the autochthonous fern Cyathea costaricensis as a bioassessment tool concurrently with land use and physicochemical evaluation in 11 sites along Bobos River, Veracruz, Mexico, to assess river water quality. Bobos River is located in the Nautla basin, northeastern Veracruz (Mexico); the upper river runs through a protected natural area (Filobobos River and adjacent areas). The study involved three monitoring periods: February, June and September 2014. In each study site, physicochemical water quality parameters were recorded to calculate the Water Quality Index (WQI); also, study sites were characterized in terms of land use. Water samples were collected to perform bioassays where spores of C costaricensis were exposed to samples to assess mitochondrial activity; a positive control exposure test was run under controlled conditions to maximize mitochondrial activity. A Principal Component Analysis was performed to correlate land-use attributes with environmental variables and mitochondrial activity. Three river sections were identified: the upper portion was characterized by the dominance of native vegetation, the highest WQI (in September), and the lowest mitochondrial activity (63.87%-77.47%), related to the geological nature of the basin and high hardness levels. Mitochondrial activity peaked in September (98.32% +/- 9.01), likely resulting from nutrient enrichment in the rainy season, and was lowest in February (74.54% +/- 1.60) (p < 0.05). Mitochondrial activity was found to be a good benchmark for the assessment of water quality, reflecting the effects of physicochemical characteristics. Mitochondrial activity showed changes along the river and between seasons, associated with environmental characteristics such as land use and the geological nature of the basin, as well as with those related to human impacts.

AB  - Growing stock is an ecological indicator of forest ecosystem response to natural and anthropogenic impacts that may result from forest management measures or environmental impacts. Information on growing stock is thus essential to understand dynamics of forest stands, their productive capacity and to manage their use within limits of sustainability. Dynamic changes of forest growing stock, as well as predictions of their future development, are usually estimated from the data gathered by national forest inventories using some mechanistic modelling approach. The resulting models are informative, but include many parameters, some of which are difficult to set or estimate. Due to the demanding parameterisation of mechanistic models, it is hard to achieve stability of their output accuracy, which can lower their predictive power. This paper presents an alternative and complementary approach of constructing models with machine learning and data mining methods. We applied these methods to the Silva-SI database and used the resulting interpretable models in order to find explanations for structural changes in Slovenian forests over the period from year 1970 to 2010. In addition, we developed predictive models for growing sock in the decade from year 2010 to 2020. The structure of the models describing temporal dynamics of growing stock shows that trends of growing stock are increasing for the entire studied period, while accumulation of growing stock is much more intensive after 1990. Forests with a lower growing stock are located either in the areas with non-favorable site conditions for forest growth, or at lower altitudes, where they are more exposed to human exploitation due to their vicinity to more densely populated regions. Predictions of growing stock for the decade 2010-2020 suggest that Slovenian forests will continue to accumulate their growing stock (private owned forests to 327 m(3)/ha and state owned forests to 343 m(3)/ha in 2020). The presented data mining approach that was here applied to the growing stock can also be used for investigating other ecological indicators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The response of organisms to environmental stress is currently used in the assessment of ecosystem health. Morphological changes integrate the multiple effects of one or several stress factors upon the development of the exposed organisms. In a natural environment, many factors determine the patterns of morphological differentiation between individuals. However, few studies have sought to distinguish and measure the independent effect of these factors (genetic diversity and structure, spatial structuring of populations, physical-chemical conditions, etc.).
   Here we investigated the relationship between pesticide levels measured at 11 sites sampled in rivers of the Garonne river basin (SW France) and morphological changes of a freshwater fish species, the gudgeon (Gobio gobio). Each individual sampled was genotyped using 8 microsatellite markers and their phenotype characterized via 17 morphological traits. Our analysis detected a link between population genetic structure (revealed by a Bayesian method) and morphometry (linear discriminant analysis) of the studied populations. We then developed an original method based on general linear models using distance matrices, an extension of the partial Mantel test beyond 3 matrices. This method was used to test the relationship between contamination (toxicity index) and morphometty (P-ST of morphometric traits), taking into account (1) genetic differentiation between populations (F-ST), (2) geographical distances between sites, (3) site catchment area, and (4) various physical-chemical parameters for each sampling site.
   Upon removal of confounding effects, 3 of the 17 morphological traits studied were significantly correlated with pesticide toxicity, suggesting a response of these traits to the anthropogenic stress. These results underline the importance of taking into account the different sources of phenotypic variability between organisms when identifying the stress factors involved. The separation and quantification of the independent effect of such factors provides an interesting outlook regarding the use of these evaluation metrics as indicators of ecosystem health.

AB  - Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) are sensitive to habitat perturbations and are easily studied, making them an ideal taxonomic group with which to evaluate the effects of low-intensity anthropogenic disturbances such as Reduced-Impact Logging. Here we examine the effect of a certified Reduced-Impact Logging operation on dung beetles, and demonstrate their suitability for use in rapid ecological impact studies. We sampled dung beetle assemblages, environmental variables and timber extraction rates across four treatment groups in closed canopy and canopy gaps in logged and unlogged forest in Guyana. Community analysis revealed that logged forest supported a more uniform dung beetle assemblage compared to unlogged forest. Differences in assemblage structure were driven by dissimilarity between closed canopy treatments, as plots in artificial and natural canopy gaps supported comparable assemblages. Indicator analyses were conducted across treatments, using a new approach (CLAM) and two well-established methods (INDVAL, SIMPER). Two species respectively were classified as indicators of logged (Hansreia affinis and Eurysternus caribaeus) and unlogged forest (Canthidium aff. centrale and Deltochilum (Cathyboma) carinatum). BIO-ENV analysis demonstrated that tree extraction intensity, bare ground cover, and ground cover by leaf material were key factors influencing dung beetle assemblages. Despite the relatively low-impact of Reduced-Impact Logging reported by previous studies, we find that dung beetles are sensitive to even small changes in environmental conditions as a result of this form of anthropogenic disturbance. As dung beetles are a highly responsive taxonomic group, we illustrate that they represent a valuable taxon that can be used to critically evaluate best practice forestry operations and other disturbance activities, particularly in time constrained studies (e.g., rapid monitoring and-environmental impact assessments). However, we recommend the use of multiple indicator analyses to monitor potential changes in assemblage composition, due to a lack of congruence between methods. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Achieving sustainable freshwater resource management and conserving biodiversity require accurate and reliable pollution impact assessment. Biomonitoring is an integrative and holistic approach to assessing impact of pollution using biological indicators. In this study, we use the assemblage structure of the freshwater macroinvertebrate family Chironomidae to assess the impact of pollution in a South African river: the Swartkops River. Based on morphological deformities in the mentum of selected genera, we developed a new index, the extended toxic score index (ETSI), to assess the extent of deviation of ecological conditions at the impacted sites from that at the control site. Four sites i.e. Sites 1-4 characterised by different degrees of pollution were selected for chironomids and physico-chemical sampling over a period of three years (August 2009-September 2012). The ETSI was developed by taking into account the severity of deformities, and genera tolerances to pollution. The index was based on the deformities in the mentum of the five most dominant genera: Chironomus, Polypedilum, Tanytarsus, Dicrotendipes and Cricotopus. The values of nutrients, electrical conductivity and turbidity were elevated, and dissolved oxygen depleted at Sites 2, 3 and 4 compared with Site 1. Metal concentrations in the water column were relatively low (<0.3 mg/l). Site 1, i.e. the control site, supported more chironomid species (30 species). Site 2, situated upstream of the Kelvin Jones wastewater effluent discharge point, but influenced by diffuse pollution sources, had more species (22 species) than Sites 3 (10 species) and 4 (18 species). The species assemblage structure clustered largely by sites than by seasons, with the assemblage at Site 1 distinct to those at Sites 2, 3 and 4. The newly developed ETSI was sensitive to pollution, distinguishing between the ecological conditions at the sampling sites. The index placed Site 2 in Category D, indicative of poor ecological condition and Sites 3 and 4 in Category E, indicative of very poor conditions. We found the ETSI to be an appropriate and useful deformity-based tool for biomonitoring, and it can easily be modified and used in other river systems, both locally and internationally.

AB  - The Lo Go-Xa Mat is a national park in the southeastern region of Vietnam, which has a particularly high biodiversity and it includes different wetlands which are unique diverse in species composition. It can be categorized into two types: temporarily-seasonally and permanently flooded wetlands. Ta Not grassy marsh is representative of the seasonally flooded wetland. Whilst the diversity and ecology of plants and mammals are well documented, little or no information of the benthic ecology in the seasonally flooded wetland exist. This study aims to provide a new database of the nematode's structure in the seasonally flooded wetland and its relation with environmental variables as well as detection of the ecological quality, considering nematodes as bioindicators. This work is the first investigation on nematodes communities in associate with some environmental variables in the Ta Not grassy marsh. The results showed that free-living nematodes in the Ta Not seasonally flooded grassy marsh are characterized by the high density (ranged from 235.01 to 898.43 inds.10cm(-2)) but rather low diversity. More specifically, the genus richness (S) ranged from 8.20 to 8.60. The observed Margalef's species richness (d) was ranging from 1.07 to 1.53 and the Shannon-Wiener index (H') was measured from 2.36 to 2.52. In addition, the Pielou's evenness (J') ranged from 0.55 to 0.68 and the Hill indices indicated average values ranging between 5.46-5.84 for N-1, between 4.32-4.60 for N-2, and between 2.64-2.86 for N-inf. Specifically, our results indicated that deep level, pH, and NH4+ showed a significant correlation with the nematode density and bio-indices. The sediment of the Ta Not grassy marsh was assessed as in good conditions in all stations based on the Maturity Index of nematodes. (C) 2020 GJESM. All rights reserved.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are exposed to many stressors, including toxic chemicals and global warming, which can impair, separately or in combination, important processes in organisms and hence higher levels of organization. Investigating combined effects of warming and toxicants has been a topic of little research, but neglecting their combined effects may seriously misguide management efforts. To explore how toxic chemicals and warming, alone and in combination, propagate across levels of biological organization, including a key ecosystem process, we developed an individual-based model (IBM) of a freshwater amphipod detritivore, Gammarus pseudolimnaeus, feeding on leaf litter. In this IBM, life history emerges from the individuals' energy budgets. We quantified, in different warming scenarios (+1-+4 degrees C), the effects of hypothetical toxicants on suborganismal processes, including feeding, somatic and maturity maintenance, growth, and reproduction. Warming reduced mean adult body sizes and population abundance and biomass, but only in the warmest scenarios. Leaf litter processing, a key contributor to ecosystem functioning and service delivery in streams, was consistently enhanced by warming, through strengthened interaction between the detritivorous consumer and its resource. Toxicant effects on feeding and maintenance resulted in initially small adverse effects on consumers, but ultimately led to population extinction and loss of ecosystem process. Warming in combination with toxicants had little effect at the individual and population levels, but ecosystem process was impaired in the warmer scenarios. Our results suggest that exposure to the same amount of toxicants can disproportionately compromise ecosystem processing depending on global warming scenarios; for example, reducing organismal feeding rates by 50% will reduce resource processing by 50% in current temperature conditions, but by up to 200% with warming of 4 degrees C. Our study has implications for assessing and monitoring impacts of chemicals on ecosystems facing global warming. We advise complementing existing monitoring approaches with directly quantifying ecosystem processes and services.

AB  - The distributional ecology of 87 macrolichens is reported from 14 unmanaged mid-seral and old forest stands along a precipitation gradient in south-central British Columbia. We used a combination of univariate and multivariate statistics to investigate the role of forest structure and stand age in the distribution of epiphytic macrolichens in interior cedar-hemlock forests. Old forests support a higher number of species; although mean species richness is not significantly different between the two age classes. Terricolous and epixylic community structure is correlated with stand age and log characteristics, but the epiphtytic community is not. Epiphytic community structure is strongly associated with precipitation in the old stands, but not in the mid-sera( stands. Old forests at the wetter end of the precipitation gradient contained several old-growth associated species, all of which are hygrophytic. Most epiphytic macrolichens associated with old forests are not dependent on specific structural attributes. However, western red cedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don) harbors the greatest number of arboreal macrolichen species by far in these unmanaged stands and should, therefore, be considered a key indicator in managed forests. Our study suggests that most macrolichen species found in old forests can also occur in 70- to 165-year-old forests dating from stand-replacing fires. Old forests, however, clearly provide important habitat for oceanic epiphytes at the edge of their ecological range in the interior of British Columbia. Our findings illustrate that the macrolichen flora in wet toe-slope stands in humid inland British Columbia has a high level of resilience following disturbance under natural succession conditions. It also underlines the point that some species, like Lobaria pulmonaria, are good indicators of old-growth forests in certain regions but not in others, suggesting a careful use of the term old-growth dependence.

AB  - The Resource Management Act 1991 places obligations on local authorities to protect and maintain indigenous biodiversity on land in private tenure. However, how this should be done is not explicitly prescribed. Authorities are guided by a variety of means (e.g. ecological guidance and case law), and implement their responsibilities to varying degrees and with inconsistent success. The protection of indigenous biodiversity on private land is a challenging and contentious issue. This paper reports on two different approaches for the identification and assessment of significant habitats that were recently validated by Court decisions in two regions of contrasting biodiversity loss in New Zealand: Manawatu-Wanganui and the West Coast. The rigorous semi-quantitative desktop methodology used in Horizons Regional Council's resource management plan included a predictive model to compile a schedule of habitat types in the Manawatu-Wanganui Region, coupled with significance criteria to facilitate regulatory protection of significant habitat. This was the first time in New Zealand a region-wide habitat type approach had been undertaken and was subsequently accepted by the Environment Court. The methodology for identifying significant wetland areas in the West Coast Regional Council's Land and Water Plan used a more traditional approach, employing schedules of mapped sites selected through applying a set of significance criteria. The Environment Court also endorsed this approach but recognised the need for more rigorous criteria. A caucus of experts was directed to improve the weak set of criteria initially proposed. The revised significance criteria now sit in the plan and have also been adapted for use by other regions (e.g. Canterbury). In both regions, the Environment Court rejected the use of site condition as a prerequisite for determining significance. This was also supported by the High Court in the West Coast case. These court decisions represent landmark case law, which advance the national debate on the application of significance criteria.

AB  - Understanding how data uncertainty influences ecosystem analysis is critical as we move toward ecosystem-based management. Here, we investigate how 18 Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) indicators that characterize ecosystem growth, development, and condition are affected by uncertainty in an ecosystem model of Lake Sidney Lanier (USA). We applied ENA to 122 plausible parameterizations of the ecosystem developed by Borrett and Osidele (2007, Ecological Modelling 200, 371-387), and then used the coefficient of variation (CV) to compare system indicator variability. We considered Total System Throughput (TST) as a measure of the underlying model uncertainty and tested three hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that non-ratio indicators whose calculation includes the TST would be at least as variable as TST if not more variable. Second, we postulated that indicators calculated as ratios, with TST in the numerator and denominator would tend to be less variable than TST because its influence will cancel. Last, we expected the Average Mutual Information (AMI) to be less variable than TST because it is a bounded function. Our work shows that the 18 indicators grouped into four categories. The first group has significantly larger CVs than the CV for TST. In this group, model uncertainty is amplified rendering these three indicators less useful. The second group of four indicators shows no significant difference in variability with respect to TST. Finally, there are two groups whose CV values are significantly lower than that for TST. The least variable group includes the ratio-based indicators and Average Mutual Information. Due to their low variability, we conclude that these indicators are the most robust to the parameter uncertainty and most useful for ecosystem assessment and comparative ecosystem analysis. In summary, this work suggests that we can be as certain, or more certain, in most of the selected ENA indicators as we are in the parameters of the model analyzed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We developed a conceptual ecological model (CEM) for invasive species to help understand the role invasive exotics have in ecosystem ecology and their impacts on restoration activities. Our model, which can be applied to any invasive species, grew from the eco-regional conceptual models developed for Everglades restoration. These models identify ecological drivers, stressors, effects and attributes; we integrated the unique aspects of exotic species invasions and effects into this conceptual hierarchy. We used the model to help identify important aspects of invasion in the development of an invasive exotic plant ecological indicator, which is described a companion paper in this special issue journal. A key aspect of the CEM is that it is a general ecological model that can be tailored to specific cases and species, as the details of any invasion are unique to that invasive species. Our model encompasses the temporal and spatial changes that characterize invasion, identifying the general conditions that allow a species to become invasive in a de novo environment; it then enumerates the possible effects exotic species may have collectively and individually at varying scales and for different ecosystem properties, once a species becomes invasive. The model provides suites of characteristics and processes, as well as hypothesized causal relationships to consider when thinking about the effects or potential effects of an invasive exotic and how restoration efforts will affect these characteristics and processes. In order to illustrate how to use the model as a blueprint for applying a similar approach to other invasive species and ecosystems, we give two examples of using this conceptual model to evaluate the status of two south Florida invasive exotic plant species (melaleuca and Old World climbing fern) and consider potential impacts of these invasive species on restoration.

AB  - Identifying risks to ecosystems from contaminants needs a diversity of bioindicators, to understand the effects of these contaminants on a range of taxa. Molluscs are an ideal bioindicator because they are one of the largest phyla with extremely high ecological and economic importance. The aim of this study was to evaluate if laboratory bred Potamopyrgus antipodarum has the potential to show the impact of contaminants from various land use activities and degree of pollution on a freshwater ecosystem. We assessed the impact of contaminants arising from runoff and direct discharges in Merri Creek by measuring organism level responses (survival, growth, and reproduction), and sub-organism level responses (glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO) activity and catalase (CAT) activity) in snails after 28-d of deployment at nine sites in Merri Creek and one site in Cardinia Creek. In Merri Creek, the top two sites were reference sites (with low impact from human activities), while the rest were impact sites (impacted by various anthropogenic land uses). Cardinia Creek (an additional reference site) had lower human activity. High concentrations of heavy metals, nutrients, and/or synthetic pyrethroids (bifenthrin) dominated these sites, which are likely to have contributed towards the negative responses observed in the snails. There was little influence from environmental conditions and site location on the endpoints because we found a similar response at an additional reference site compared to the reference sites in Merri Creek. At the organism level, reproduction increased and/or reduced, while CAT was affected at the sub-organism level. Potamopyrgus antipodarum has the potential to be a sensitive bioindicator for Australian conditions because the snails responded to varying concentrations of contaminants across different land use activities and showed similar sensitivity to P. antipodarum found in other regions of the globe and other bioindicators.

AB  - Agroforestry systems, which combine woody plants and agricultural use on the same area, have a long tradition in Switzerland, namely as standard fruit trees (scattered orchards), forest pastures and chestnut orchards. In recent years, the systems have been reactivated in a modern form, i.e. their planting design has been adapted to mechanisation and their management has been optimised. In addition to the diversification of production through additional fruit tree or quality timber production, agriculture also benefits from the selection of shrubs and tree species adapted to the location through increased resilience and contributions to environmental protection and resource conservation.
   The future Swiss agricultural policy (AP22+) has set itself ambitious goals: reduction of the environmental impact, higher added value through stronger market orientation and an increase in operational efficiency. However, like many places in Europe, Switzerland is confronted with increasing environmental pollution (nitrate surplus, loss of biodiversity, etc.) from agricultural activities.
   In connection with this, the present study examines the following questions: in which regions is there increased agricultural environmental pollution? And which agroforestry systems can contribute to improving these negative environmental impacts?
   Based on eleven environmental indicators from the areas of biodiversity, landscape, climate, air, water and soil, individual deficit maps were first drawn up and then spatially overlaid. They showed that around 17.8 % of the area examined is in good condition with regard to the indicators taken into account. On the other hand, three or more deficits are accumulating on 13.3 % of agricultural land. Due to their diverse design and application possibilities, agroforestry systems offer a high solution potential in arable farming, animal husbandry as well as in specialised crops such as fruit and wine growing.
   For land users and decision-makers, the present results offer the opportunity to address local deficits on the one hand and, on the other hand, to combine them with other local and nature conservation conditions and objectives. This makes it possible both to see the big picture and to derive region-specific solutions for sustainable management and structuring of the (rural) economy, among other things.

AB  - Long-term, interdisciplinary studies of relations between climate and ecological conditions on wetland-upland landscapes have been lacking, especially studies integrated across scales meaningful for adaptive resource management. We collected data in situ at individual wetlands, and via satellite for surrounding 4-km(2) landscape blocks, to assess relations between annual weather dynamics, snow duration, phenology, wetland surface-water availability, amphibian presence and calling activity, greenness, and evapotranspiration in four U.S. conservation areas from 2008 to 2012. Amid recent decades of relatively warm growing seasons, 2012 and 2010 were the first and second warmest seasons, respectively, dating back to 1895. Accordingly, we observed the earliest starts of springtime biological activity during those two years. In all years, early-season amphibians first called soon after daily mean air temperatures were >= 0 degrees C and snow had mostly melted. Similarly, satellite-based indicators suggested seasonal leaf-out happened soon after snowmelt and temperature thresholds for plant growth had occurred. Daily fluctuations in weather and water levels were related to amphibian calling activity, including decoupling the timing of the onset of calling at the start of season from the onset of calling events later in the season. Within-season variation in temperature and precipitation also was related to vegetation greenness and evapotranspiration, but more at monthly and seasonal scales. Wetland water levels were moderately to strongly associated with precipitation and early or intermittent wetland drying likely reduced amphibian reproduction success in some years, even though Pseudacris crucifer occupied sites at consistently high levels. Notably, satellite-based indicators of landscape water availability did not suggest such consequential, intra-seasonal variability in wetland surface-water availability. Our cross-disciplinary data show how temperature and precipitation interacted to affect key ecological relations and outcomes on our study landscapes. These results demonstrate the value of multi-year studies and the importance of scale for understanding actual climate-related effects in these areas.

AB  - Intensive aquaculture practices involve rearing fish at high densities. In these conditions, fish may be exposed to suboptimal dissolved O-2 levels with an increased formation of reactive O-2 species (ROS) in tissues. Seaweeds (SW) contain biologically active substances with efficient antioxidant capacities. This study evaluated the effects of dietary supplementation of heat-treated SW (5% Gracilaria vermiculophylla or 5% Ulva lactuca) on stress bioindicators in sea bream subjected to a hypoxic challenge. 168 fish (104.5 g average weight) were distributed in 24 tanks, in which eight tanks were fed one of three experimental diets for 34 days: (i) a control diet without SW supplementation, (ii) a control diet supplemented with Ulva, or (iii) a control diet with Gracilaria. Thereafter, fish from 12 tanks (n=4 tanks/dietary treatment) were subjected to 24 h hypoxia (1.3 mg O-2 l(-1)) and subsequent recovery normoxia (8.6 mg O-2 l(-1)). Hypoxic fish showed an increase in hematocrit values regardless of dietary treatment. Dietary modulation of the O-2-carrying capacity was conspicuous during recovery, as fish fed SW supplemented diets displayed significantly higher haemoglobin concentration than fish fed the control diet. After the challenge, survival rates in both groups of fish fed SW were higher, which was consistent with a decrease in hepatic lipid peroxidation in these groups. Furthermore, the hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities were modulated differently by changes in environmental O-2 condition, particularly in sea bream fed the Gracilaria diet. After being subjected to hypoxia, the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and molecular chaperones in liver and heart were down regulated in sea bream fed SWdiets. This study suggests that the antioxidant properties of heat-treated SW may have a protective role against oxidative stress. The nature of these compounds and possible mechanisms implied are currently being investigated.

AB  - Over the past decades, overall ecological conditions in the Caspian Sea have deteriorated. However, a comprehensive understanding of lake-wide spatial differences in anthropogenic pressures is lacking and the biological consequences of human impacts are poorly understood. This paper therefore aims at assessing the individual and combined effects of critical anthropogenic pressures on the Caspian Sea ecoregions. First, cumulative pressure scores were calculated with a cumulative environmental assessment (CEA) analysis. Then, the individual contribution of anthropogenic pressures was quantified. Finally, ecoregion-specific differences were assessed. The analyses show that both cumulative and individual pressure scores are unevenly distributed across the Caspian Sea. The most important individual pressures are invasive species, chemical pollution and poaching. This uneven distribution of pressure scores across Caspian Sea ecoregions creates new challenges for future conservation strategies, as different ecoregions usually require different conservation measures.

AB  - The pace and scale of environmental change is undermining the conditions for human health. Yet the environment and human health remain poorly integrated within research, policy and practice. The ecosystem services (ES) approach provides a way of promoting integration via the frameworks used to represent relationships between environment and society in simple visual forms. To assess this potential, we undertook a scoping review of ES frameworks and assessed how each represented seven key dimensions, including ecosystem and human health. Of the 84 ES frameworks identified, the majority did not include human health (62%) or include feedback mechanisms between ecosystems and human health (75%). While ecosystem drivers of human health are included in some ES frameworks, more comprehensive frameworks are required to drive forward research and policy on environmental change and human health.

AB  - 1. Biological monitoring is vital to river conservation. Aside from providing census data, regular monitoring may detect population trends that reflect the degradation or remediation of riverine environments. Birds are major candidates for this purpose because of their connections to riverine food webs and river habitat features. However, much information on factors affecting river bird distributions is qualitative.
   2. River bird populations have been surveyed annually in the U.K. since 1974. The value of this monitoring could be increased if links between population trends and changes in riverine landscapes or channel hydromorphology were better understood. We modelled the relationships between bird species' distributions recorded by the British Trust for Ornithology's Waterways Breeding Bird Survey (WBBS) and hydromorphology recorded by the Environment Agency's River Habitat Survey (RHS).
   3. Regression models were built for 20 bird species associated with the river channel and neighbouring floodplains. This provided one of the first illustrations in ecology of generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for extending generalized linear models to instances where individual observations are not statistically independent. GEEs could offer a range of benefits to freshwater biologists, as they are a simple approach to analysing hierarchical, correlated data while maintaining the ease of interpretation with a range of link functions and data types.
   4. Upland, fast water species and reedbed specialists showed the closest links with RHS, followed by lowland, slow water species, where correlations to RHS varied widely in magnitude. The distributions of floodplain wading birds were poorly modelled by RHS, suggesting that floodplain land uses as quantified by RHS were poor predictors of distributions. Marked preferences between upland and lowland channels were evident for most species. Specific features were also important, including hydraulics, bank/channel vegetation, depositional features and anthropogenic structures.
   5. Monitoring the abundance and distribution of a range of bird species, with a diversity of life histories, could be a valuable tool for assessing trends in riverine landscapes and whole river basins. RHS captures useful information about channel hydromorphology and vegetation, but needs supplementing with additional environmental information to describe (i) the wider riverine landscape (e.g. more detailed floodplain variables, proximity of other waterbodies) and (ii) water chemistry. Although further work is required, this study suggests that WBBS and RHS add mutual value in appraising the river environment. We advocate the further development of birds as indicators in riverine landscapes that could convey the importance of the ecological integrity, biological production and conservation value of river systems to a wider audience.

AB  - Pollen material of the two anemophilous plants of known allergic significance Dactylis glomerata (Poaceae) and Betula verrucosa (Betulaceae) was collected at several places (in Sweden and France) and exposed to natural or experimental conditions.  This material was analyzed with Electron Probe X Microanalysis (EPMA) (System ORTEC 5000) attached to a Scanning Electron Microscope (Jeol JMS 35), or with EDAX, a 10 000 X-Ray Analyser.
   Link System, connected to a SEM-microscope (Jeol JSM 820).
   It is clear that the environment has an effect on such a co-inductor or adjuvant of allergenicity as K.  The possible presence of pollutant inorganic (mineral) particles on the pollen grain surface may play a role in the allergenic activity.  Pollen, consequently, may be used as sensitive biological indicators of atmospheric pollution.

AB  - Modern agricultural practices have undeniably increased global food production. On the other hand, agricultural practices not only lead to a degradation of natural ecosystems but also affect the functioning of ecosystems and the related services they provide. Even though impacts of anthropogenic activities vary across ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems are among those affected to a higher degree. In comparison to surface water ecosystems, groundwater ecosystems are less affected by anthropogenic pollutants, as the overlaying soil retains organic and inorganic substances. However, it has become evident that the excessive use of fertilizers has led to the eutrophication of many aquifers. Bacterial communities, which significantly contribute to the cycling of matter due to their metabolic capacities, are prone to environmental perturbations, and structural variation of bacterial communities may consequently affect the functioning of groundwater ecosystems. Our present paper intends to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic activities on environmental conditions as well as on the structural properties of bacterial communities in groundwater. We repeatedly sampled emerging groundwater at five spring sites belonging to different catchments and determined the concentration of abiotic variables as well as the diversity and composition of bacterial communities on a local scale. We hypothesized that anthropogenic activities influence the concentration of abiotic variables, especially of nitrate, as well as the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in groundwater. Our results show that underground spring catchment areas only slightly differ regarding the concentration of abiotic variables as well as the structure of bacterial communities. Furthermore, abiotic variables, presumably influenced by anthropogenic activities, do not correlate with the diversity and composition of bacterial communities. Although supported only by circumstantial evidence, we suggest that upwelling groundwater from the deeper aquifer affects the diversity and composition of bacterial communities, and we argue that bacterial communities act as useful indicators for environmental changes.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration can help reverse biodiversity loss, but whether faunal communities of forests undergoing restoration converge with those of primary forest over time remains contentious. There is a need to develop faunal indicators of restoration success that more comprehensively reflect changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function. Ants are an ecologically dominant faunal group and are widely advocated as ecological indicators. We examine ant species and functional group responses on a chronosequence of rainforest restoration in northern Australia, and develop a novel method for selecting and using indicator species. Four sampling techniques were used to survey ants at 48 sites, from grassland, through various ages (1-24years) of restoration plantings, to mature forest. From principal components analysis of seven vegetation metrics, we derived a Forest Development Index (FDI) of vegetation change along the chronosequence. A novel Ant Forest Indicator Index (AFII), based on the occurrences of ten key indicator species associated with either grassland or mature forest, was used to assess ant community change with forest restoration. Grasslands and mature forests supported compositionally distinct ant communities at both species and functional levels. The AFII was strongly correlated with forest development (FDI). At forest restoration sites older than 5-10years that had a relatively closed canopy, ant communities converged on those of mature rainforest, indicating a promising restoration trajectory for fauna as well as plants. Our findings reinforce the utility of ants as ecological indicators and emphasize the importance of restoration methods that achieve rapid closed-canopy conditions. The novel AFII assessed restoration status from diverse and patchily distributed species, closely tracking ant community succession using comprehensive species-level data. It has wide applicability for assessing forest restoration in a way that is relatively independent of sampling methodology and intensity, and without a need for new comparative data from reference sites.

AB  - Environment is an ecologically important but often ill-defined concept. Environs are an operationalization of environments that let us study their organization and activity. Specifically, environs are the directed (input and output), within-system environments of species (or more generally holons) in ecosystems. Scientists primarily study environs through Network Environ Analysis (NEA). Quantifying general environ properties was an important step in the development of NEA. However, some of the standard NEA whole-system indicator calculations contain a hidden assumption that every system component has a unit input (output). While this can facilitate within system analysis, the even distribution assumption of inputs or outputs is unlikely to be true in many systems. Importantly, it also decouples the environ properties from the influence of the external system environment. We contend that for many applications we should use the observed or realized inputs (outputs) in the NEA calculations rather than the unit vector. We illustrate the effect of the alternative formulations for the ratio of indirect-to-direct flows, network homogenization, and network aggradation in 50 trophically based ecosystem models. Our results reveal that while the unit and realized indicators tend to be well correlated, the qualitative interpretations can be affected. We generalize these specific results by analytically investigating the sensitivity of the ratio of indirect to direct flows (I/D) to variation in the input distribution. We provide sufficient conditions on the direct flow intensity matrix G for which the computed value of I/D is less than unity for arbitrary input, as well as sufficient conditions on G for which the computed value I/D is larger than unity for arbitrary input. These results suggest that different formulations for the environ properties can alter the qualitative assessment of the ecosystem organization. We conclude that the realized formulation reconnects the environ properties to the system environment, producing a more internally consistent and applicable theory of environment.

AB  - Freshwater sensitivity to acidification varies according to geology, soils and land-use, and consequently it remains difficult to quantify the current extent of acidification, or its biological impacts, based on limited spot samples. The problem is particularly acute for river systems, where the transition from acid to circum-neutral conditions can occur within short distances. This paper links an established point-based long-term acidification model (MAGIC) with a landscape-based mixing model (PEARLS) to simulate spatial and temporal variations in acidification for a 256 km(2) catchment in North Wales. Empirical relationships are used to predict changes in the probability of occurrence of an indicator invertebrate species, Baetis rhodani, across the catchment as a function of changing chemical status. Results suggest that, at present, 27% of the river network has a mean acid neutralising capacity (ANC) below a biologically-relevant threshold of 20 mu eq l(-1). At high flows, this proportion increases to 45%. The model suggests that only around 16% of the stream network had a mean ANC < 20 mu eq l(-1) in 1850, but that this increased to 42% at the sulphur deposition peak around 1970. By 2050 recovery is predicted, but with some persistence of acid conditions in the most sensitive, peaty headwaters. Stream chemical suitability for Baetis rhodani is also expected to increase in formerly acidified areas, but for overall abundance to remain below that simulated in 1850. The approach of linking plot-scale process-based models to catchment mixing models provides a potential means of predicting the past and future spatial extent of acidification within large, heterogeneous river networks and regions. Further development of ecological response models to include other chemical predictor variables and the effects of acid episodes would allow more realistic simulation of the temporal and spatial dynamics of ecosystem recovery from acidification.

AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are assumed to act as a bio-preservative in virgin coconut oil (VCO) products, even under stress conditions. Lactobacillus plantarum COY 2906 and Lactobacillus sakei were isolated from VCO. L. plantarum COY 2906 showing greater ability than L. sakei to inhibit indicator bacteria and were selected for further study. Under saline stress conditions, L. plantarum COY 2906 did not inhibit E. coli K12 JM109 and showed greater inhibition of B. subtilis than of S. aureus JCM 20624. High saline content reduced lactic acid production, but the copy number of plnA, plnEF, plnN, plnJ and plnK genes associated with plantaricin, was not significantly changed. L. plantarum COY 2906 had its optimum anti-bacterial effect at pH 4.5 - 7.5, while alkaline conditions increased lactic acid production and reduced the multiplication of plantaricin plasmid genes.
   However, in acidic conditions, the number of plantaricin genes on the plasmid was multiplied. The genes: plnW, plnV, plnU, plnH, plnG, plnE, plnF, plnD, plnC, plnB, plnA, plnR, plnL, plnK, plnJ, plnM, plnN, plnO and plnP were found in the draft genome of L. plantarum COY 2906. This research clearly shows that lactic acid production and multiplication of plantaricin genes are affected by environmental salinity and pH.

AB  - Morphological traits of plants often vary considerably in response to different environmental conditions, which may render them suitable as sensible indicators for conservation purpose.
   To compare the plasticity of morphological traits of species of calcareous grassland under different environmental conditions (stands of different structure with respect to litter and vegetation height), morphometric investigations were carried out on calcareous grasslands differing in grazing regime. Populations of the calcareous grassland species Plantago media and Scabiosa columbaria subject to different grazing regimes showed considerable plasticity.
   There were, e.g. relationships between shoot height, biomass, and fertility of individuals. Shoot height and the number of diaspores per inflorescence increased significantly with increasing cover of litter. Simultaneously there were considerable changes in the reproductive mode, from generative only to a combination of generative and vegetative reproduction.
   The analysis of morphological plasticity showed that different environmental conditions could accurately and easily be monitored through the species-specific growth response.
   Especially shoot height appears to play a central role, since the study species can vary this growth parameter to escape light deficiency of tall stands rich in litter. Due to its large variability, shoot height can be used as an indicator of growth conditions of the studied populations that are closely linked to land use and conservation management.

KW  - neutral corrosion
AB  - Older solid dielectric cables are now approaching the end of their life and failing. Consequently there has been a sustained effort for the development of techniques to assess the remaining life of in-service cables for the purpose of establishing replacement criteria. Because of the generally accepted belief that the failure mode is due to the aging of the insulation, these techniques have mainly focused on measuring changes in the electrical properties of the insulation. However, it has been determined that there are other failure modes associated with loss of the protective function of the jacketing material leading to corrosion and breaks in the metallic shields and poor contact between semicon and metallic shield, causing arcing damage and eventual failure of the cable. This failure mode is more prevalent in cables operated in a harsh chemical environment.
   This paper presents the results of a research program aimed at developing a test protocol that is based on evaluating the condition of all the cable components and not just the insulation. The tests were designed to evaluate the condition of jacket, extent of corrosion of the metallic shield, and degree of degradation of the cable insulation. The results are discussed in terms of correlations between the field measurement parameters and the condition of the cable, and prioritization criteria for cable replacement.

AB  - Different stock-recruitment models were fitted to North Atlantic albacore (Thunnus alalunga) recruitment and spawning stock biomass data. A classical density dependence hypothesis, a recent environmental-dependence hypothesis and a combination of both were considered. For the latter case, four stock-environment-recruitment models were used: Ricker, Beverton-Holt, Deriso's General Model (modified to take into account environmental effects) and conditioned Neural Networks. Cross-validation analysis showed that the modified Deriso model had the best predictive capability. It detected an inverse effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on recruitment, a Ricker-type behaviour with density dependent overcompensation when environmental conditions are unfavourable and a Beverton-Holt-type behaviour towards an asymptotic recruitment carrying capacity with favourable environmental conditions. The Neural Network model also detected that under favourable environmental conditions high spawning stock biomass does not necessarily have a depensatory effect on recruitment. Moreover, they suggest that under extremely favourable environmental conditions, albacore recruitment could increase well above the asymptotic carrying capacity predicted by Beverton-Holt-type models. However, the general decrease in spawning stock biomass in recent years and increasing NAO trends suggest that there is low probability of exceptionally large recruitment in the future and instead there is a danger of recruitment overfishing.

AB  - Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous limestone sediments from Banik Village in the Kurdistan Region, Northern Iraq, were analysed based on a combined investigation of elemental composition and biomarker characterisation. These investigations were used to define the origin, type of organic matters and their relation to the environment conditions during deposition. The bulk geochemical characteristics indicated that the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous limestone sediments were deposited in a marine environment with calcium-rich seawater. Their biomarkers provide evidence for a major contribution by aquatic organic matter with a minor terrigenous organic matter contribution. This is confirmed by normal alkanes, hopanoids, steroids and related compounds of the saturated hydrocarbons. Moreover, the salinity stratification and relatively reducing bottom water conditions are evidenced in the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous limestone sediments, as identified from Sr/Br, V/Ni and Pr/Ph ratios. The occurrence of gammacerane biomarker in the analysed samples is also a strong indicator of reducing and salinity stratification during deposition. Therefore, a stratified water column with salinity and relatively anoxic bottom water conditions contribute to organic matter (OM) preservation.

AB  - Adopting an integrative approach that explicitly includes the different facets of biodiversity is crucial to assess the response of biological communities to changing environments. The identification of the optimal climatic conditions where communities maximize their functional, phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity is useful to compare whether the optima of the different facets of biodiversity match. Using a wide climatic gradient across Europe, we quantified the functional, phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity of epiphytic macrolichen communities, which are valuable early-warning ecological indicators. We ordinated 22 environmental variables and simultaneously illustrated non-parametric regressions of the diversity metrics against the climatic space using the hilltop plot method to detect the climatic conditions in which the different diversity facets peaked and to compare the match between them. Functional diversity predicted at least part of the peaks of phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity, but phylogenetic and taxonomic hotspots did not overlap. Epiphytic macrolichen communities maximized their functional and phylogenetic diversity in the southernmost forests, with the Mediterranean region appearing as a biodiversity hotspot. Regarding the studied traits, photobiont type and growth form showed clearly defined optima while the quantitative physiological traits and families' optima did not show this pattern in response to climate. The different facets of biodiversity were not surrogates of each other highlighting the need for an integrative approach to assess the effect of environmental changes on communities and to establish conservation priorities. As functional traits mediated the response of lichen communities to climate, preserving high functional diversity might indirectly preserve high phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity. Relevant ecological indicators useful to develop rapid assessment methods to evaluate the effects of climatic changes include the photobiont type and growth form. The lack of relation between quantitative traits and climate call for further research to unveil their role as ecological indicators of small-scale variables or as effect traits.

AB  - The growing need of population in having a safe rest of good quality not far from where they live causes demand of space and increasing load on nature, including the natural protected terrritories which due to their status have kept a unique potential and beautiful natural landscapes. Recreational load is a huge non-regulated anthropogenic factor that transforms their ecosystems. Solving the problem of putting recreational flows in order requires limiting recreational load, and there is a need in determining a unit of recreational capacity. The article presents the results of comparative estimation of recreational load for 32 specially protected water reservoirs of the Republic of Tatarstan. For assessing recreational load, the methods by I.P. Shamardina and S.E. Jorgenson of evaluating recreational potential of lakes was used which are based on assessing water surface area and water volumes. According to Jorgenson method the protected water objects of the republic were divided into four groups: with recreational capacity over 2000 people per year, from 10000 to 20000 people per year, from 5000 to 10000 people per year and less than 5000 people per year. It is stated that the maximal recreational capacity (over 20000 people per year) is characteristic for the biggest lakes in the republic: Arkhiyereyskoye Lake, Kovalinskoye Lake, Salamykovskoye Lake, Shchuchye Lake, and Yurtushinskoye Lake. These popular recreational lakes of for all the conditions for developing a wide range of water tourism and recreation without any harm to ecology. The recreational capacity of the most part of protected water basins in Tatarstan is 5000 people per year or less. There it is recommended to organize tourist-recreational activity. It was shown that the volume of actual recreational load on the protected lakes in spring and summer does not exceed over the norm. There is a potential possibility to use these objects for recreation and tourism on condition that any activity within the basisns should be strictly controlled and it should be restricted to certain types of recreational use.

AB  - Indicator species have been used for several decades as measures of ecosystem health. In arid Australian rangelands, which are dominated by commercial grazing enterprises reliant on native pastures, the development of efficacious indicators is particularly important to monitor production and biodiversity values. The high temporal and spatial climatic variability of arid rangelands means that developing broad indicators is difficult and resource intensive. However, pastoralists, who observe their pastures and the species favoured by stock under a range of conditions, can provide information on local indicators. This paper examines pastoralists' knowledge in terms of its value for natural resource management in rangelands, including their use of local indicators and understanding of palatability of selected plant species. A survey was mailed to all 51 occupants of pastoral properties in the Stony Plains region of South Australia. Pastoralists were asked what species they considered indicators of overgrazing, whether they would destock if they noted changes in these indicators, what they knew of the palatability of certain plant species, and the usefulness of cracking-clay areas (a key landscape feature in the region) for grazing. Views of respondents on indicator species and plant palatability mostly concurred with published reports on the preferences of livestock for these species. A wide range of indicators (all perennial plant species and no animal species) was listed by respondents, suggesting that indicators are highly location-specific, plant-focussed, and not viewed consistently among pastoralists. Respondents related specific information about cracking-clay areas on their leases, including the influence of the timing and amount of rainfall on pasture productivity, and the value of these areas for livestock. It can be difficult for natural resource management practitioners, who may not observe the landscape regularly, to evaluate land condition and prescribe appropriate land management strategies. It is argued that the participation of pastoralists in science and policy development is fundamental to achieving sustainable land management, providing opportunities for social learning within an adaptive management framework.

AB  - Differences within a species in rates of growth of nestlings can be used as indicators of the quality of parental care, environmental conditions, and future success of offspring, whereas comparisons among different species may reflect a history of different ecological conditions or life-history strategies. The presesnt study examines the patterns of variation in growth in nestling Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) from across the species' range and compares Tree Swallows to other species. Growth of Tree Swallows was typical of other species in the family Hirundinidae. As a family, the Hirundinidae have slower growth than typical for passerines. Growth rate of species of Hirundinidae was not correlated with adult body mass or average brood size. Contrary to predictions, species that are double-brooded did not have higher growth rates, but swallow species living at higher latitudes did have higher growth rates than tropical species. Substantial variation in growth rates was observed among populations of Tree Swallows, yet the amount of variation observed between breeding colonies only a few kilometers apart, or from the same colony in different years, was as great as that seen in populations separated by hundreds of kilometers. Within a population, differences in growth among years were correlated with temperature and food supply when nestlings were being raised. No correlation between climate and growth was seen when comparing different populations. Differences between populations were not explained by local habitat, nor were large-scale geographic patterns evident. I used both experimental and observational evidence to evaluate the implications of short-term reduction in growth for subsequent growth and survival. Nestlings were slow to recover from even very short periods of delayed growth that occur early in the nestling phase. Return of nestlings with experimentally or naturally induced delayed growth was reduced, which suggests that short interruptions in growth may have long term effects on postfledging survival, even though mass at fledging is not affected.

AB  - Balneario Camboriu (SC - Brazil) is a touristic city where the disordered growth of the urban population and the implementation of coastal works without proper evaluation generated environmental impacts and affected the sanitary quality of water and sediment of Camboriu River and marine adjacent area. One of the most recent and alarming phenomena observed are the blooms of invasive bryozoans (Arboscuspis bellula and Membraniporopsis tubigera) associated with epibenthic diatoms (Amphitetras antediluviana and Biddulphia biddulphiana). Several clues associate these phenomena, started in 2003, with the excess of nutrients and organic matter in the Camboriu cove and large coastal works such as dredging, landfills and construction of jetties, leading to changes in benthic ecological structure. Being an aesthetic and environmental health problem, the concern of the scientific community and government agencies intensified as the occurrences become more frequent and persistent. This research addresses this issue through environmental and experimental studies. Samplings of the benthic material collected by boat and diving, and blooms monitoring were the environmental approach. The laboratory work included the algal isolation and culture, in addition to growth conditions assessment and chemical biomass analysis. Monitoring data showed a seasonal trend in the blooms, with more conspicuous events in warmer months. Diatoms increase in abundance in colder months and bryozoans in the warmer ones. The diatom A. antediluviana, predominant in the blooms, grew satisfactorily in laboratory cultivation, showing better growth in media with higher concentrations of silicate and phosphate. Bryozoans showed slow growth in laboratory conditions. The deposited material collected in the environment showed low concentrations of saturated fatty acids, but the high biomass suggest a possible use for biofuels production. Biomass samples dominated by bryozoans showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae. The explanation for the occurrence of these blooms are still inconclusive, but there is considerable evidence that it is a synergistic effect between the high concentration of bacteria and organic debris in the water related to local pollution and the elimination of natural competitors by coastal works.

AB  - Mismanagement practices, such as unsustainable waste disposal, created many degraded sites. In karst landscapes, old uncontrolled landfills are often located in dolines (sinkholes). Buried waste material in dolines represents degradation of landform, habitats and a potential danger of groundwater pollution. Buried waste provides heterogeneous ecological conditions on the surface, thus plant communities or individual plant species that developed on the surface of landfills can be used as a bioindicators of waste-filled doline sites and therefore indicators of land degradation. We aimed to discover the potential of vegetation to detect unknown locations of old dumpsites in suffusion dolines in Logasko polje (Dinaric Karst, Slovenia), either by plant communities or by plant species. We aimed to ascertain whether vegetation can indicate the dumping period by estimation of community succession stage. Locations and the age of waste-filled dolines (doline-dumps) were preliminary identified by a historical landscape study. Thus, we used time series of aerial photographs and digital photogrammetry tools for 3D modelling of historical terrain. Ecological evaluation was based on sampling the floristic composition of plots (5x5 m). We analysed ecological conditions by Ellenberg bioindicator values, structure by life history traits and naturalness by hemerobic levels of plants. We studied in detail 30 up to 50-years-old waste-filled dolines that are interspersed by dry and mesic grasslands. Ecological evaluation demonstrated that the main driver of ecological diversity at doline-dumps is the time at which the doline was backfilled and succession started. Annual and eutrophic communities dominate the youngest doline-dumps, middle aged doline-dumps are covered by nitrophilous perennial forbs and, finally, communities developed towards mesic grassland. We conclude that plant communities in combination with diagnostic plant species can be used as a bioindicators of doline-dumps in agricultural landscape of Logasko polje and can therefore indicate the sites of potential groundwater pollution sources but not the type of long-time buried waste.

AB  - Range condition score or classification does not tell us, in a general sense, much of what managers and the public want to know about rangelands. Range condition is not a reliable indicator, across all rangelands, of biodiversity, erosion potential, nutrient cycling, value for wildlife species, or productivity. Succession, the basis for the current concept of range condition is not an adequate yardstick for evaluation of rangelands. The Society for Range Management (SRM) established the Task Group on Unity in Concepts and Terminology which has developed new concepts for evaluation of the status of rangelands. These concepts are based on the premise that the most important and basic physical resource on each ecological site is the soil. If sufficient soil is lost from an ecological site, the potential of the site is changed. The Task Group made three recommendations, which were adopted by the SRM: 1) evaluations of rangelands should be made from the basis of the same land unit classification, ecological site; 2) plant communities likely to occur on a site should be evaluated for protection of that site against accelerated erosion (Site Conservation Rating, [SCR]); and 3) selection of a Desired Plant Community (DPC) for an ecological site should be made considering both SCR and management objectives for that site.

AB  - Even in today's modern electric grid infrastructure, the uncertainty in the power supply is more often seen and is mainly due to power outages. The reasons for power outages might be any of the following: extreme weather events, asset failure, natural disasters, power surges, acute accidents, and even operational errors by the workforce. Such uncertain situations are permitting us to think of it as a resilience problem. In most cases, the power outages may last from a few minutes to a few weeks, depending on the nature of the resilience issue and the power supply system (PSS) configuration. Therefore, it is imperative to understand and improve the resilience of a PSS. In this paper, a four-component resilience framework is proposed to study and compare the resilience of three different PSS configurations of residential electricity users (REUs) considering the realistic power outage conditions in the humid subtropical ecosystem. The proposed PSS configurations contain electric grid (EG), natural gas power generator (NGPG), battery energy storage (BES), and photovoltaics (PV) as the assets. The three PSS configurations of a REUs are EG + BES, EG + NGPG + BES, and EG + PV + BES, respectively, and in these, one REU is only the consumer and the other two REUs are prosumers. By using the proposed framework, simulations are performed on the three PSS configuration to understand the increasing load resiliency in the event of a power outage. Also, a comparative techno-economic and life cycle based environmental assessment is performed to select the most resilient PSS configuration among the EG + BES, EG + NGPG + BES, and EG + PV + BES for an REU. From the results, it was established that EG + PV + BES configuration would enhance the power resilience of an REU better than the other two PSS configurations. Besides, it is also observed that the identified resilient PSS configuration is cost-effective and environmentally efficient. Overall, the proposed framework will enable the REUs to opt for the PSS configuration that is resilient and affordable.

AB  - The mycorrhizal fungi are symbiotic organisms able to provide many benefits to crop production by supplying a set of ecosystem functions. A recent ecological approach based on the ability of the fungi community to influence plant-plant interactions by extraradical mycelium development may be applied to diversified, herbaceous agroecosystems. Our hypothesis is that the introduction of a winter cereal cover crop (CC) as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)-host plant in an organic rotation can boosts the AMF colonization of the other plants, influencing crop-weed interference. In a 4-years organic rotation, the effect of two winter cereal CC, rye and spelt, on weed density and AMF colonization was evaluated. The AMF extraradical mycelium on CC and weeds roots was observed by scanning electron microscopy analysis. By joining data of plant density and mycorrhization, we built the mycorrhizal colonization intensity of the Agroecosystem indicator (MA%). Both the CC were colonized by soil AMF, being the mycorrhizal colonization intensity (M%) affected by environmental conditions. Under CC, the weed density was reduced, due to the increase of the reciprocal competition in favor of CC, which benefited from mycorrhizal colonization and promoted the development of AMF extraradical mycelium. Even though non-host plants, some weed species showed an increased mycorrhizal colonization in presence of CC respect to the control. Under intense rainfall, the MA% was less sensitive to the CC introduction. On the opposite, under highly competitive conditions, both the CC boosted significantly the mycorrhization of coexistent plants in the agroecosystem. The proposed indicator measured the agroecological service provided by the considered CCs in promoting or inhibiting the overall AMF colonization of the studied agroecosystems, as affected by weed selection and growth: It informs about agroecosystem resilience and may be profitably applied to indicate the extent of the linkage of specific crop traits to agroecosystem services, contributing to further develop the functional biodiversity theory.

AB  - Diatoms are a compulsory biological quality element in the ecological assessment of rivers according to the Water Framework Directive. The application of current official indices requires the identification of individuals to species or lower rank under a microscope based on the valve morphology. This is a highly time-consuming task, often susceptible of disagreements among analysts. In alternative, the use of DNA metabarcoding combined with High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) has been proposed. The sequences obtained from environmental DNA are clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), which can be assigned to a taxon using reference databases, and from there calculate biotic indices. However, there is still a high percentage of unassigned OTUs to species due to the incompleteness of reference libraries. Alternatively, we tested a new taxonomy-free approach based on diatom community samples to assess rivers. A combination of three machine learning techniques is used to build models that predict diatom OTUs expected in test sites, under reference conditions, from environmental data. The Observed/Expected OTUs ratio indicates the deviation from reference condition and is converted into a quality class. This approach was never used with diatoms neither with OTUs data. To evaluate its efficiency, we built amodel based on OTUs lists (HYDGEN) and another based on taxa lists from morphological identification (HYDMORPH), and also calculated a biotic index (IPS). The models were trained and tested with data from 81 sites (44 reference sites) from central Portugal. Both models were considered accurate (linear regression for Observed and Expected richness: R-2 approximate to 0.7, interception approximate to 0.8) and sensitive to global anthropogenic disturbance (Rs(2) > 0.30 p < 0.006 for global disturbance). Yet, the HYDGEN model based on molecular data was sensitive to more types of pressures (such as, changes in land use and habitat quality), which gives promising insights to its use for bioassessment of rivers.

AB  - The Prestige oil spill resulted in the mortality of several seabird species on the Atlantic NW coast of Spain. Shag casualties were particularly relevant, since populations are resident in the area the whole year round and because of several features which make them highly vulnerable to environmental hazards. Ecological catastrophes give us the opportunity of collecting samples which, otherwise, would be difficult to obtain. We examine the potential of shag corpses as bioindicators of inorganic pollution and the possible factors of variability, such as biological traits (sex, age) or nutrition status. We determined trace elements (Hg, Se, Cr, Pb, Zn and Cu) and isotopic signatures (N-15, C-13) in soft tissues (muscle, liver) and in primary feathers formed at different times (before and after the Prestige) in individuals of known sex and age, collected at the time of the Prestige disaster. These were compared with data from another group of shags trapped accidentally in fishing gear in 2005.
   Our results did not seem to be affected by sex or age on any of the analysed variables. The higher nitrogen isotopic signatures in the soft tissues of the Prestige shags may be related to the nutrition stress caused by a poorer body condition, which is also reflected in increasing levels of some metals in the liver. This isotopic enrichment was also observed in newly forming feathers when compared to the old ones. On the other hand, the lower delta N-15 and Hg values in shag feathers from 2005 point to a shift in feeding resources to prey of lower trophic levels. We found that feather features (being an inert tissue and having a conservative composition), if combined with careful dating and chemical analysis, offer a very useful tool to evaluate temporal and spatial changes in seabird ecology in relation to pollution events.

AB  - Visual traces of iron reduction and oxidation are linked to the redox status of soils and have been used to characterise the quality of agricultural soils. We tested whether this feature could also be used to explain the spatial pattern of the natural vegetation of tidal habitats. If so, an easy assessment of the effect of rising sea level on tidal ecosystems would be possible. Our study was conducted at the salt marshes of the northern lagoon of Venice, which are strongly threatened by erosion and rising sea level and are part of the world heritage "Venice and its lagoon". We analysed the abundance of plant species at 255 sampling points along a land-sea gradient. In addition, we surveyed the redox morphology (presence/absence of red iron oxide mottles in the greyish topsoil horizons) of the soils and the presence of disturbances. We used indicator species analysis, correlation trees and multivariate regression trees to analyse relations between soil properties and plant species distribution. Plant species with known sensitivity to anaerobic conditions (e.g. Halimione portulacoides) were identified as indicators for oxic soils (showing iron oxide mottles within a greyish soil matrix). Plant species that tolerate a low redox potential (e.g. Spartina maritima) were identified as indicators for anoxic soils (greyish matrix without oxide mottles). Correlation trees and multivariate regression trees indicate the dominant role of the redox morphology of the soils in plant species distribution. In addition, the distance from the mainland and the presence of disturbances were identified as tree-splitting variables. The small-scale variation of oxygen availability plays a key role for the biodiversity of salt marsh ecosystems. Our results suggest that the redox morphology of salt marsh soils indicates the plant availability of oxygen. Thus, the consideration of this indicator may enable an understanding of the heterogeneity of biological processes in oxygen-limited systems and may be a sensitive and easy-to-use tool to assess human impacts on salt marsh ecosystems.

AB  - Proper control of temperature and electrolyte circulation flow is mandatory in electrolytic cells to produce dense and high-purity cathodes. The electrochemical kinetics of cells is inherently dependent on these electrolyte variables. Continuous monitoring of electrolyte condition allows enhancing cathode quality, electrodeposition time, better utilization of electrolyte additives, early identification of temperature excursions, and electrolyte flow blockages. Abnormal cell conditions can produce excessive evaporation, higher energy consumption, anode passivation that impair cathode production in copper electrorefining, and safety issues because the production of flammable hydrogen in copper electrowinning. Therefore, the monitoring of changes in temperature and electrolyte flow can give critical indicators of process deviations. With real-time information about electrolyte variables, it is possible to provide early warnings to face the wide variability of cell performance and safety conditions caused by electrolyte condition mismanagement. This paper proposes a noninvasive wireless sensor for monitoring the electrolyte temperature inside cells and estimates the electrolyte circulation flow through each cell simultaneously. The sensor design is suitable to highly corrosive sulfuric acid environments. The condition-monitoring sensor proposed is small in size, lightweight, and meets battery-free operation and nonsparking safety requirements. It uses an inductive link-based system for powering and a radio frequency-link for communicating. The result is a sensor that surpasses the features of standard instrumentation not suitable for electrolytic process monitoring.

AB  - Southern Rockhopper Penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) have a strongly synchronised breeding cycle with a fixed pattern of nest attendance for males and females. We studied leucocyte profiles and the development of granulocyte/lymphocyte (G/L) ratios as an indicator of stress. Variation in G/L ratios were related to sex and breeding stage, but not individual body condition. G/L ratios were similar for males and females during the first part of the incubation period ("shared incubation", when males and females both attend the nest), but in the second part of the incubation ("single incubation", only one adult attends the nest), females had significantly higher G/L ratios and a lower body condition than males. The lowest G/L ratios were recorded during the crSche of the chicks at the end of the breeding season. Our results show that G/L ratios in breeding Southern Rockhopper Penguins on the population-scale reflect the temporally and sexually different timing of fasting and refeeding related to the breeding cycle. However, this measurement was not sensitive enough to reveal an effect of body condition on G/L ratios on an individual scale.

AB  - Calcareous fens represent an endangered type of peatlands, acting as refugia for stress-tolerant species in the currently changing landscapes. The resurveys across many regions have reported their recent disappearance or deterioration despite both the extreme habitat conditions (carbonate richness, presence of calcareous tufa, nutrient limitation, high water level) and conservation management. To test the stability of their biotic communities in different environmental and management configurations, we repeatedly sampled molluscs (terrestrial and aquatic), vascular plants, and bryophytes at 30 calcareous fens in the Inner Western Carpathians (Slovakia, Poland) after 13-17 years of warm summers and land-use changes. We found a small yet statistically significant effect of sampling period (old versus new survey) on the species composition of all three groups of organisms when the effect of various positions of sites along ecological gradients was controlled for. The compositional changes, interpreted with the help of Ellenberg Indicator Values, suggest an incipient succession towards grasslands and shrublands, driven by decreasing soil moisture and increasing nutrient availability. Although the number of habitat specialists did not change, the number of matrix-derived vascular plant and bryophyte species significantly increased, with six ubiquitous species of productive habitats being significantly more represented currently, while the richness of aquatic molluscs significantly decreased. Fens in which potentially strongly competitive plant species were less stressed because of less intense management and lower habitat extremity were more prone to such succession. There was no single factor that could predict the magnitude of composition changes; instead, tested factors were found to act synergistically. Conservation management was predominantly important for bryophytes, while extreme habitat conditions were predominantly important for terrestrial snails. We suggested a way how nature conservancy authorities can prioritise the management needs by applying an abiotic indicator system, with less environmentally extreme fens requiring more intense conservation management.

AB  - The derivation, performance, sensitivity and inherent uncertainty of ecological quality indicators have become major topics in developing tools for the management of marine, transitional and coastal waters. In reviewing the advances in these waters, related to an ecological status assessment, we show the future challenges to be addressed within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Using new analyses carried out under the research project 'Water Bodies in Europe: Integrative Systems to Assess Ecological status and Recovery', we provide a complete set of assessments for the biological quality elements (BQEs) (phytoplankton, macroalgae-seagrasses, macroinvertebrates and fish) to be assessed, as well as the validation of existing indicators and multimetric indices and, in some cases, the development of new assessment indices. We show that these indices respond differently to different human pressures and they each have challenges in defining reference conditions against which future changes are judged. In investigating good ecological potential, as the response to heavily modified water bodies, we show that there are flaws in the Directive, not least in its definitions. Our analyses have also focussed on uncertainty in using the indices and we emphasise the problems of defining ecological class boundaries based on indices which themselves may be combined indices (multimetrics). The analysis shows that some of those multimetrics are redundant and/or are inter-correlated and thus may reduce the sensitivity in defining ecological class boundaries. If this is related to the drivers-pressures-state change-impacts-response approach then there are lessons for management measures aimed at achieving good ecological status and even the potential for legal challenges to decisions based on uncertain indices under the WFD. Hence, we conclude the continued need for advances in assessing pressures and gradients, and defining reference conditions for state change, index development, impact assessment and the validation of indices for each BQE.

AB  - 1. A fundamental question in ecology is which factors determine species richness. Here, we studied the relative importance of regional species pool and local environmental characteristics in determining local species richness (LSR). Typically, this question has been studied using whole communities or a certain taxonomic group, although including species with widely varying biological traits in the same analysis may hinder the detection of ecologically meaningful patterns.
   2. We studied the question above for whole stream macroinvertebrate community and within functional feeding guilds. We defined the local scale as a riffle site and the regional scale (i.e. representing the regional species pool) as a stream. Such intermediate-sized regional scale is rarely studied in this context.
   3. We sampled altogether 100 sites, ten riffles (local scale) in each of ten streams (regional scale). We used the local-regional richness regression plots to study the overall effect of regional species pool on LSR. Variation partitioning was used to determine the relative importance of regional species pool and local environmental conditions for species richness.
   4. The local-regional richness relationship was mainly linear, suggesting strong species pool effects. Only one guild showed some signs of curvilinearity. However, variation partitioning showed that local environmental characteristics accounted for a larger fraction of variance in LSR than regional species pool. Also, the relative importance of the fractions differed between the whole community and guilds, as well as among guilds.
   5. This study indicates that the importance of the local and regional processes may vary depending on feeding guild and trophic level. We conclude that both the size of the regional species pool and local habitat characteristics are important in determining LSR of stream macroinvertebrates. Our results are in agreement with recent large-scale studies conducted in highly different study systems and complement the previous findings by showing that the interplay of regional and local factors is also important at intermediate regional scales.

AB  - Due to resettlements, construction of new infrastructure, and new land reclamation the rapid agricultural changes in the Three Georges Area (TGA) in Central China are expected to force the degradation of the cultivated terraced landscape. Consequently, increased soil erosion can hamper a sustainable land management in the mountainous TGA. This paper presents the model framework TerraCE (Terrace Condition Erosion) for determining the causes for different terrace conditions and terrace degradation based on field surveys and spatial data mining. For a total of 987 bench terrace plots in the Xiangxi catchment we collected data on their state of maintenance and terrace design to account for terrace stability and thus capability of soil conservation. Assessing the driving factors of terrace degradation was done by embedding terrain-based predictors and distance-transforms of remote-sensing data as indicators of environmental and anthropogenic influences. Random forests classification and regression models were applied for data mining. Terrace degradation in the Xiangxi catchment is obvious. The sequence of degradation ranges from 'well maintained' (21%), 'fairly maintained' (44%), and 'partially collapsed' (23%) to 'completely collapsed' (11%) terraces. The cross-validation error of the supervised TerraCE model is below 8%, allowing for reasonable and valid interpretations of the causes of terrace degradation. Data mining reveals indicators for anthropogenic effects such as the distance to settlements or to roads as major drivers for the spatial distribution of terrace conditions. The effect of relief, which can be regarded as the major natural driver for terrace degradation by erosive action is tributary but altered and overlaid by land use dynamics associated with the Three Gorges Dam. An important indicator representing a combined effect of terrain and human activity is the distance to stream channels of different orders. Applying TerraCE we reveal mechanisms of terrace degradation in disturbed environments and present a framework for standardized mapping and analysis of terrace degradation under cultivation. The approach might also be used to develop guidelines for terrace planning in mountainous terraced landscapes of limited carrying capacity, with respect to socio-economic as well as environmental conditions.

AB  - Temperature is an extremely important environmental condition in the application of microbial denitrification for nitrate removal from groundwater. Understanding the nitrate removal efficiency of groundwater and the diversity, composition, and structure of microbial communities under different temperature conditions is of great significance for effective mitigation of groundwater nitrate pollution. This study investigated the effects of temperature on denitrification at 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 45 degrees C. Moreover, the characteristics of microbial community structure and diversity were analyzed by combining high-throughput sequencing and polymerase chain reaction methods in order to fully clarify the denitrification efficiency under different temperature conditions. According to laboratory batch experiments and the findings of previous research, glucose was set as the carbon source and changes in "three nitrogen" indicators of the four temperature systems were mainly tested to clarify the effectiveness of nitrate removal. The maximum removal rates of nitrate nitrogen at 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 45 degrees C were 44.05%, 87.03%, 99.26%, and 92.79%, respectively. Therefore, the most efficient nitrate removal can be achieved at 40celcius. The Chao abundance indexes in the denitrification systems at 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 45 degrees C were 1873, 352, 466, and 640, respectively. Therefore, the highest species richness was observed at 15 degrees C, but there were only a few dominant bacteria species. The composition of the bacterial community and the most dominant phylum varied at different temperatures. Among them, Gammaproteobacteria in Proteobacteria phylum plays an important role in the degradation of nitrate nitrogen. The relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria at 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 45 degrees C were 25.32%, 66.56%, 72.83%, and 3.47%. Tolumonas belongs to Gammaproteobacteria. The relative abundance of Tolumonas at 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 45 degrees C were 9.41%, 65.47%, 62.49%, and 0.03%, respectively. The results of this study show that different temperature conditions affect the diversity, composition, and structure of the microbial community, thereby affecting the efficiency of denitrification for nitrate removal from groundwater.

AB  - While the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (EU CAP) is being redefined, natural habitats, treated as wasteland for many years, are becoming a crucial element in the promotion of environmentally-friendly management of farmland and the protection of biodiversity and the local cultural landscape. The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the uptake of certain environmental CAP funds and to describe the factors behind the spatial differentiation of the uptake of these funds. Both natural and non-natural conditions are taken into account. The analysis is conducted for Poland, a country engaged in reform of the agricultural economy, which has sizeable areas of habitats of high value for nature and which represents a region of Europe in need of special public support for environmental improvement. The research procedure consisted of the following four main stages: (1) spatial delimitation of grasslands (taking into account their territorial rank and quality) and (2) the level of utilisation of funds under specific Agri-Environmental and Climate Schemes (AECSs), (3) determining the relationships - types and (4) identifying the causes of disproportions, taking into account selected nonnatural conditions. Apart from indicator methods, use is made of spatial typology and spatial autocorrelation methods (global and local Moran I coefficients). The results of the analysis show the decisive influence of natural and environmental conditions on the amount of funds expended through AECSs. However, the study has also identified situations where non-natural factors come to the fore. Among the non-natural conditions, a key role is played by historical factors. The study has identified areas with untapped environmental potential and those where environmental farming measures are underutilised given the environmental potential of those areas. The situation described is detrimental to the effectiveness of support, which is contrary to CAP principles. The findings are important in the context of monitoring and evaluating the EU's agricultural policies, which should take more account of the characteristics of the individual countries, including their natural regional and local specificities.

AB  - The Lynch's Crater (NE Australia) deposit is a key information source on Late-Quaternary palaeoenvironmental change, including human-induced deforestation since the arrival of Aboriginals, megaherbivore extinction and southern hemisphere tropical climate dynamics. This study adds to the important dataset available for the site by assessing the molecular composition of organic matter in the record using pyrolysis-GC-MS to elucidate ecological and hydrological conditions since 55 ka BP.
   Pyrolysates were dominated by methylene chain compounds (MCCs) and lignin products (methoxyphenols). Concomitant increases in MCCs and aquatic source indicators (biogenic opaline silica, Si:Al ratio, SEM-visible debris of sponges and diatoms and aquatic pollen taxa), which roughly coincide with abrupt climate events in GISP2 delta O-18 (Heinrich event H3, H1, 8.2 ka and oscillations at 33-36 ka BP), reflect transitions from peat (dominated by lignin from terrestrial plants) to lacustrine (MCCs from aquatic plants) conditions. The evidence points towards wet conditions causing the accumulation of layers rich in inorganic sediment during H events, favouring the hypothesis of a southward ITCZ shift, rather than an ENSO-induced northward shift, as the underlying mechanism. This contradicts previous studies using the "degree of peat humification" index (DPH). We measured DPH and the extracts and residues by PY-GC-MS, to better understand the validity of this surface moisture proxy. Paradoxically, high DPH corresponds to the relatively young (<15 ka) ombrotrophic peat environment, as DPH relies on the proportion of extractable carbohydrates concentrated in this part of the core, while deeper and unarguably more evolved layers are comprised of alkali-inextricable lignin and MCCs. Therefore, DPH does not accurately reflect humidity-controlled degradation/preservation dynamics and its use for studying climate change in complex records, such as Lynch's Crater, is cautioned. Finally, the decoupling of humidity conditions from changes in regional arboreal vegetation supports the hypothesis of an anthropogenic- rather than climate-driven shift towards sclerophyllous vegetation since 45 ka, but the hydroseral complexity of the system demands caution on this matter.

AB  - Success in breeding crops for yield and other quantitative traits depends on the use of methods to evaluate genotypes accurately under field conditions. Although many screening criteria have been suggested to distinguish between genotypes for their salt tolerance under controlled environmental conditions, there is a need to test these criteria in the field. In this study, the salt tolerance, ion concentrations, and accumulation of compatible solutes of genotypes of barley with a range of putative salt tolerance were investigated using three growing conditions (hydroponics, soil in pots, and natural saline field). Initially, 60 genotypes of barley were screened for their salt tolerance and uptake of Na+, Cl-, and K+ at 150 mM NaCl and, based on this, a subset of 15 genotypes was selected for testing in pots and in the field. Expression of salt tolerance in saline solution culture was not a reliable indicator of the differences in salt tolerance between barley plants that were evident in saline soil-based comparisons. Significant correlations were observed in the rankings of genotypes on the basis of their grain yield production at a moderately saline field site and their relative shoot growth in pots at ECe 7.2 [Spearman's rank correlation (rs)=0.79] and ECe 15.3 (rs=0.82) and the crucial parameter of leaf Na+ (rs=0.72) and Cl- (rs=0.82) concentrations at ECe 7.2 dS m(-1). This work has established screening procedures that correlated well with grain yield at sites with moderate levels of soil salinity. This study also showed that both salt exclusion and osmotic tolerance are involved in salt tolerance and that the relative importance of these traits may differ with the severity of the salt stress. In soil, ion exclusion tended to be more important at low to moderate levels of stress but osmotic stress became more important at higher stress levels. Salt exclusion coupled with a synthesis of organic solutes were shown to be important components of salt tolerance in the tolerant genotypes and further field tests of these plants under stress conditions will help to verify their potential utility in crop-improvement programmes.

AB  - As fish stocks have been overexploited and catches have decreased over the last few years, the cephalopod catch has increased globally to the point that they are now among the most important marine resources in the world. Climate change and human activities greatly affect the growth and abundance of cephalopods. Understanding how the individual growth of key species varies and how they respond to environmental changes is essential for an effective fishery management. Loliolus beka and Amphioctopus fangsiao are two dominant species in the cephalopod community of Yellow Sea (YS). Both of them are commercially important and have great ecological values. Herein, we compared the body weights (BW) of these two species from 2011 to 2018 based on an analysis of biological parameters (i.e., mantle length and BW) from trawl surveys in the YS. Considerable temporal variations in the BW of the two species are apparent. Specifically, the BW of L. beka was the lowest in 2011 and the highest in 2017, and the well growth was noted in 2015-2018. The BW of A. fangsiao was the lowest in 2013 and the highest in 2016, while well growth was observed in 2015-2016. Mixed-effect models indicate that the BW of these species correlates significantly with the sea surface temperature (SST) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), suggesting the impact of the regional environment associated with strong ENSO events on BW. In a different response window, growth increases with increased SST and decreases with increased SOI. The consistent patterns of the BW of these cephalopods in response to environmental factors demonstrate they can be employed as indicator species for studying environmental change in the YS. Our results improve the understanding of the responses of cephalopods to environmental changes in the YS, as well as the mechanisms that drive their growth. Such information is critical for the effective management and sustainable development of cephalopod fisheries in this region.

AB  - Five core sandstone and carbonate rock samples from the Cretaceous Harshiyat Formation containing oil stains were collected from two wells in the North Hadramaut High area (eastern Yemen) and geochemically analyzed by their sterane and terpane biomarker and stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) compositions. This paper studied the geochemical characteristics of the oil stains and their relation to probable potential source rocks. The source rock characteristics include the origin of organic matter input; redox depositional conditions, lithology, and degree of thermal maturity were investigated. The saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions of the analyzed oil stain samples have delta C-13 values in the range of - 26.5 parts per thousand - - 28.6 parts per thousand and - 26.3 parts per thousand - - 26.7 parts per thousand, respectively. These delta C-13 values indicate that the oil stain samples originated from a mixed organic matter input in their source rock. The presence of mixed marine and terrestrial organic matter in the source rock is further concluded from biomarker distributions of n-alkane, isoprenoid, terpane, and sterane. These biomarkers and their ratio parameters suggest that the analyzed oil stain samples were sourced from clay-rich rock deposited in marine-reducing environmental conditions and likely contained mixed planktonic/bacterial organic matter and land plant inputs. Both saturated and aromatic maturity biomarkers suggest that the analyzed oil stains were from a mature source rock, equivalent to a moderate to peak-mature oil window. The environmental biomarker indicators of the studied oil stain samples correlated well with the shales in the Late Cretaceous Harshiyat Formation in the onshore Jiza-Qamar Basin (eastern Yemen), indicating that the analyzed oil stains were generated from a mature Harshiyat source rock in the onshore Jiza-Qamar Basin and subsequently migrated into the Cretaceous Harshiyat sandstone and limestone reservoirs in the North Hadramaut High area (eastern Yemen) through normal faults system.

AB  - Multiple ecosystem functions need to be considered simultaneously to manage and protect the several ecosystem services that are essential to people and their environments. Despite this, cost effective, tangible, relatively simple and globally relevant methodologies to monitor in situ soil multifunctionality, that is, the provision of multiple ecosystem functions by soils, have not been tested at the global scale. We combined correlation analysis and structural equation modelling to explore whether we could find easily measured, field-based indicators of soil multifunctionality (measured using functions linked to the cycling and storage of soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus). To do this, we gathered soil data from 120 dryland ecosystems from five continents. Two soil surface attributes measured in situ (litter incorporation and surface aggregate stability) were the most strongly associated with soil multifunctionality, even after accounting for geographic location and other drivers such as climate, woody cover, soil pH and soil electric conductivity. The positive relationships between surface stability and litter incorporation on soil multifunctionality were greater beneath the canopy of perennial vegetation than in adjacent, open areas devoid of vascular plants. The positive associations between surface aggregate stability and soil functions increased with increasing mean annual temperature. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that a reduced suite of easily measured in situ soil surface attributes can be used as potential indicators of soil multifunctionality in drylands world-wide. These attributes, which relate to plant litter (origin, incorporation, cover), and surface stability, are relatively cheap and easy to assess with minimal training, allowing operators to sample many sites across widely varying climatic areas and soil types. The correlations of these variables are comparable to the influence of climate or soil, and would allow cost-effective monitoring of soil multifunctionality under changing land-use and environmental conditions. This would provide important information for evaluating the ecological impacts of land degradation, desertification and climate change in drylands world-wide.

AB  - Environmental quality contributes to the physical and mental well-being of the population. In this way, the green areas (GA) of the cities are essential spaces for coexistence, sports, socialization, and recreation, among others. The objective of this research was to determine the environmental conditions of green areas, using indicators as tool for urban management in two cities of Costa Rica. The study area corresponded to the districts of Heredia and Carmen, Costa Rica. The existing GA were determined using Rapid Eye satellite images, 2012 through spatial analysis and remote sensing. Eleven indicators of urban green areas were applied. the species was identified, the height, the diameter at breast height (DBH) and the number of trees in parks and streets were measured. In addition, surveys were conducted to users of public GA, on issues related to accessibility and use of GA. Five types of GA were identified in Carmen and six in Heredia. The percentage of public and private green areas corresponded to 36 % and 64 % in Carmen and 13 % and 87 % in Heredia respectively. The green area per capita (m(2)/hab) was 24.6 in Carmen and 2.7 in Heredia. Sixty-two species of trees were identified in the Carmen parks and 23 in Heredia. There were 1 105 trees of 61 species in the streets, sidewalks and avenues of Carmen and 278 individuals of 47 species in Heredia. Regarding the existence of riparian vegetation, it was determined that Pirro, Burrio, Torres and Negritos streams maintain 82, 51, 81 and 14 % of margin protection areas in conforming use. Eleven of the public GA's were evaluated, nine presented a high physical accessibility. In both districts, the surveyed citizens indicated the necessity to have more GA, highlighting the recreational, ecological and touristic value of these spaces. It is concluded that the indicators of urban green areas showed that there are differences between the environmental conditions in both of the evaluated cities. In addition, the applicability of the indicators is feasible as an input for the sustainable environmental management of urban ecosystems.

AB  - Besides its primary role in producing food and fiber, agriculture also has relevant effects on several other functions, such as management of renewable natural resources. Climate change (CC) may lead to new trade-offs between agricultural functions or aggravate existing ones, but suitable agricultural management may maintain or even improve the ability of agroecosystems to supply these functions. Hence, it is necessary to identify relevant drivers (e. g., cropping practices, local conditions) and their interactions, and how they affect agricultural functions in a changing climate. The goal of this study was to use a modeling framework to analyze the sensitivity of indicators of three important agricultural functions, namely crop yield (food and fiber production function), soil erosion (soil conservation function), and nutrient leaching (clean water provision function), to a wide range of agricultural practices for current and future climate conditions. In a two-step approach, cropping practices that explain high proportions of variance of the different indicators were first identified by an analysis of variance-based sensitivity analysis. Then, most suitable combinations of practices to achieve best performance with respect to each indicator were extracted, and trade-offs were analyzed. The procedure was applied to a region in western Switzerland, considering two different soil types to test the importance of local environmental constraints. Results show that the sensitivity of crop yield and soil erosion due to management is high, while nutrient leaching mostly depends on soil type. We found that the influence of most agricultural practices does not change significantly with CC; only irrigation becomes more relevant as a consequence of decreasing summer rainfall. Trade-offs were identified when focusing on best performances of each indicator separately, and these were amplified under CC. For adaptation to CC in the selected study region, conservation soil management and the use of cropped grasslands appear to be the most suitable options to avoid tradeoffs.

AB  - The incidence of skeletal anomalies could be used as an indicator of the "quality" of rearing conditions as these anomalies are thought to result from the inability of homeostatic mechanisms to compensate for environmentally-induced stress and/or altered genetic factors. Identification of rearing conditions that lower the rate of anomalies can be an important step toward profitable aquaculture as malformed market-size fish have to be discarded, thus reducing fish farmers' profits. In this study, the occurrence of skeletal anomalies in adult rainbow trout grown under intensive and organic conditions was monitored. As organic aquaculture animal production is in its early stages, organic broodstock is not available in sufficient quantities. Non-organic juveniles could, therefore, be used for on-growing purposes in organic aquaculture production cycle. Thus, the adult fish analysed in this study experienced intensive conditions during juvenile rearing. Significant differences in the pattern of anomalies were detected between organically and intensively-ongrown specimens, although the occurrence of severe, commercially important anomalies, affecting 2-12.5% of individuals, was comparable in the two systems. Thus, organic aquaculture needs to be improved in order to significantly reduce the incidence of severe anomalies in rainbow trout.

AB  - Simple Summary Severe environmental changes, such as drought, can delay growth, the development of plants, and induce injury to their tissues. However, a group of land plant species, called resurrection or desiccation-tolerant plants, is able to lose 95% of their cellular water and still remain viable for long periods, resuming full metabolic activity upon rehydration. Recovery from near-complete water loss is complex and requires the coordination of physical and chemical processes in the resurrection plants. Under stress conditions plants also synthesize and release a wide variety of volatile organic compounds with diverse biological and ecological functions. The rehydration process in resurrection rustyback fern (Asplenium ceterach) resulted in complete plant recovery within 72 h, accompanied by high emission of volatiles, mainly belonging to the group of fatty acid derivatives. These findings could have significant implications from biotechnological and ecological perspectives since the rustyback fern has been recently recognized as a valuable source of bioactive compounds. When exposed to stressful conditions, plants produce numerous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that have different biological and environmental functions. VOCs emitted during the rehydration process by the fronds of desiccation tolerant fern Asplenium ceterach L. were investigated. Headspace GC-MS analysis revealed that the volatiles profile of rustyback fern is mainly composed of fatty acid derivatives: isomeric heptadienals (over 25%) and decadienals (over 20%), other linear aldehydes, alcohols, and related compounds. Aerial parts of the rustyback fern do not contain monoterpene-type, sesquiterpene-type, and diterpene-type hydrocarbons or corresponding terpenoids. Online detection of VOCs using proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) showed a significant increase in emission intensity of dominant volatiles during the first hours of the rehydration process. Twelve hours after re-watering, emission of detected volatiles had returned to the basal levels that corresponded to hydrated plants. During the early phase of rehydration malondialdehyde (MDA) content in fronds, as an indicator of membrane damage, decreased rapidly which implies that lipoxygenase activity is not stimulated during the recovery process of rustyback fern.

AB  - The newly created Kawesqar National Park (KNP) and National Reserve (KNR) in southern Chile consists of diverse terrestrial and marine habitats, which includes the southern terminus of the Andes, the Southern Patagonia Ice Fields, sub-Antarctic rainforests, glaciers, fjords, lakes, wetlands, valleys, channels, and islands. The marine environment is influenced by wide ranging hydrological factors such as glacier melt, large terrigenous inputs, high precipitation, strong currents, and open ocean water masses. Owing to the remoteness, rugged terrain, and harsh environmental conditions, little is known about this vast region, particularly the marine realm. To this end, we conducted an integrated ecological assessment using SCUBA and remote cameras down to 600 m to examine this unique and largely unexplored ecosystem. Kelp forests (primarily Macrocystis pyrifera) dominate the nearshore ecosystem and provide habitat for myriad benthic organisms. In the fjords, salinity was low and both turbidity and nutrients from terrigenous sources were high, with benthic communities dominated by active suspension feeders (e.g., Bivalvia, Ascidiacea, and Bryozoa). Areas closer to the Pacific Ocean showed more oceanic conditions with higher salinity and lower turbidity, with benthic communities experiencing more open benthic physical space in which predators (e.g., Malacostraca and Asteroidea) and herbivorous browsers (e.g., Echinoidea and Gastropoda) were more conspicuous components of the community compared to the inner fjords. Hagfish (Myxine sp.) was the most abundant and frequently occurring fish taxa observed on deep-sea cameras (80% of deployments), along with several taxa of sharks (e.g., Squaliformes, Etmopteridae, Somniosidae, Scyliorhinidae), which collectively were also observed on 80% of deep-sea camera deployments. The kelp forests, deep fjords, and other nearshore habitats of the KNR represent a unique ecosystem with minimal human impacts at present. The KNR is part of the ancestral territory of the indigenous Kawesqar people and their traditional knowledge, including the importance of the land-sea connection in structuring the marine communities of this region, is strongly supported by our scientific findings.

AB  - Contaminant loads to rivers of the Canadian oil sands region are linked to industrial and natural sources. To date, biomonitoring studies have been unable to unequivocally assess potential environmental impacts associated with this development. As part of the Joint Alberta-Canada Oil Sands Monitoring initiative, we aimed to assess cumulative effects of anthropogenic activities and exposure to natural bitumen geology on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in the lower Athabasca River. We examined associations among macroinvertebrates and environmental correlates, such as nutrients, ions, metals, polycyclic aromatic compounds, and total suspended solids. The study design included sites within and outside the mineable bitumen deposits, within and outside of the active mining and extraction area, and above and below municipal sewage effluents. We predicted observing a negative association between ecological condition of the river and exposure to natural bitumen and oil sands activity. However, contaminant concentrations in water and sediment were far below known toxicity thresholds, and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in sites exposed to oil sands mining activities appeared more affected by nutrient enrichment from the MSE than contaminants from mining or natural bitumen. Although sites within the area of intense oil sands activity showed signs of mild environmental stress, assemblage pattern was more strongly associated with MSE nutrient enrichment than to diffuse contamination from either natural bitumen or oil sands mining. Enrichment likely increases food resources available to consumers, thereby potentially masking toxic responses of consumers to contaminants. Current regulations prohibit the direct release of oil sands contaminants to waterways, with diffuse atmospheric deposition of aerial emissions and fugitive dust the main contaminant pathways to freshwaters. As the storage capacity of tailings ponds is reached, this nutrient-contaminant pattern could change if the river receives the proposed direct release of treated oil sands process water. Focused investigation-of-cause studies are required to better assess the consequences of cumulative interactions and ecological effects of nutrients and contaminant exposure in this system.

AB  - Microbial and biochemical indicators of soil health were used to assess the ecological conditions and biological activity of soils contaminated with metals at a lead smelter plant and surrounding area in northeast Brazil. Soil respiration, microbial biomass of C and N. acid phosphatase, asparaginase, and density of ammonifying and ammonium-oxidizing microorganisms were positively correlated with soil organic carbon and/or water content, but showed negative correlations with metal contents in soil. Nitrification rate and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) were positively correlated with metal contamination, suggesting favorable conditions for N loss and microbial stress, respectively. No significant correlations were found between metal concentrations in soil and dehydrogenase activity or ammonification rate, considering water content and soil organic carbon as covariables. Soil respiration, microbial biomasses of C and N, dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, asparaginase activities, and ammonifying microorganisms were positively correlated with percentage vegetation cover, while nitrification and ammonification rates were negatively correlated with this parameter. In general, soil respiration, microbial biomass of C and N, acid phosphatase, asparaginase, density of ammonifying and ammonium oxidizing microorganisms, nitrification rate and qCO(2) indicated high ecological risk for soil functions mediated by microorganisms (concerning to C and nutrient cycling) due to deposition of tailing contaminated with metals, even 17 years after the smelter activities had stopped. Besides direct effect of metal toxicity on microbial biomass and activity, there are indirect effects related to changes in vegetation cover, soil organic carbon, pH, and nutrient availability, and consequently changes in the soil microclimate and physical-chemical properties that may lead to losses of habitat function for soil microorganisms and the key processes they play. However, a multivariate decomposition of variance indicated that vegetation cover explained only 3.1%, whereas metals explained 26.9% of the variation associated to the microbial/biochemical indicators, showing a stronger effect of metals.

AB  - Phenology relates to the study of timing of periodic events in the life cycle of plants or animals as influenced by environmental conditions and climatic forcing. Phenological metrics provide information essential to quantify variations in the life cycle of these organisms. The metrics also allow us to estimate the speed at which living organisms respond to environmental changes. At the surface of the oceans, microscopic plant cells, so-called phytoplankton, grow and sometimes form blooms, with concentrations reaching up to 100 million cells per litre and extending over many square kilometres. These blooms can have a huge collective impact on ocean colour, because they contain chlorophyll and other auxiliary pigments, making them visible from space. Phytoplankton populations have a high turnover rate and can respond within hours to days to environmental perturbations. This makes them ideal indicators to study the first-level biological response to environmental changes. In the Earth's climate system, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dominates large-scale inter-annual variations in environmental conditions. It serves as a natural experiment to study and understand how phytoplankton in the ocean (and hence the organisms at higher trophic levels) respond to climate variability. Here, the ENSO influence on phytoplankton is estimated through variations in chlorophyll concentration, primary production and timings of initiation, peak, termination and duration of the growing period. The phenological variabilities are used to characterise phytoplankton responses to changes in some physical variables: sea surface temperature, sea surface height and wind. It is reported that in oceanic regions experiencing high annual variations in the solar cycle, such as in high latitudes, the influence of ENSO may be readily measured using annual mean anomalies of physical variables. In contrast, in oceanic regions where ENSO modulates a climate system characterised by a seasonal reversal of the wind forcing, such as the monsoon system in the Indian Ocean, phenology-based mean anomalies of physical variables help refine evaluation of the mechanisms driving the biological responses and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the integrated processes.

AB  - Tropical forest ecosystems may be subjected to climate-origin oxidative stress as it is observed in Southeast Brazil. The region is characterized by seasonal climate with well-defined wet and dry periods. Anthropogenic air pollutants are additional oxidative stress sources in these ecosystems. However, the tolerance of Brazilian tree species to oxidative stress is still unknown. Thus, the current field study aims to comparatively establish the range of antioxidant responses of ascorbate-glutathione cycle in Astronium graveolens, Croton floribundus and Piptadenia gonoacantha adult trees exposed to air pollutants and seasonal tropical climate as indicators of their increasing tolerance to oxidative stress. These are the most abundant species in the semideciduous Atlantic Forest, in Southeast Brazil. Variations in biochemical leaf traits (antioxidant defenses: ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, ascorbate and glutathione; pigments: chlorophyll a, b and carotenoid; oxidative damage indicators: hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation indicator) were determined. The native Brazilian tree species revealed distinct biochemical patterns in response to environmental oxidative stress during the wet and dry seasons. Biochemical leaf traits changed mainly in response to photoxidative stress, during the wet season. This variation was stimulated by better climate conditions to photosynthesis and plant growth, such as high light energy, water availability and temperatures. Catalase seemed to be the biochemical leaf tolerance indicator in all species during the wet season. The environmental conditions during the dry season, either of natural or anthropogenic origin, were stressful to the Brazilian tree species. They induced several changes in their biochemical leaf traits. Such changes were indicated by multilinear regression analyses. Oxidative/antioxidative imbalances, such as increased lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione as well as the chlorophyll contents, were the most appropriate oxidative stress indicators during the dry season. C. floribundus was the most efficient species in terms of oxidative stress tolerance and it was followed by A. graveolens and P. gonoacantha. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Non-invasive measurements of glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations, including cortisol and corticosterone, serve as reliable indicators of adrenocortical activities and physiological stress loads in a variety of species. As an alternative to invasive analyses based on plasma, GC concentrations in saliva still represent single-point-of-time measurements, suitable for studying short-term or acute stress responses, whereas fecal GC metabolites (FGMs) reflect overall stress loads and stress responses after a species-specific time frame in the long-term. In our study species, the domestic guinea pig, GC measurements are commonly used to indicate stress responses to different environmental conditions, but the biological relevance of non-invasive measurements is widely unknown. We therefore established an experimental protocol based on the animals' natural stress responses to different environmental conditions and compared GC levels in plasma, saliva, and fecal samples during non-stressful social isolations and stressful two-hour social confrontations with unfamiliar individuals. Plasma and saliva cortisol concentrations were significantly increased directly after the social confrontations, and plasma and saliva cortisol levels were strongly correlated. This demonstrates a high biological relevance of GC measurements in saliva. FGM levels measured 20 h afterwards, representing the reported mean gut passage time based on physiological validations, revealed that the overall stress load was not affected by the confrontations, but also no relations to plasma cortisol levels were detected. We therefore measured FGMs in two-hour intervals for 24 h after another social confrontation and detected significantly increased levels after four to twelve hours, reaching peak concentrations already after six hours. Our findings confirm that non-invasive GC measurements in guinea pigs are highly biologically relevant in indicating physiological stress responses compared to circulating levels in plasma in the short-and long-term. Our approach also underlines the importance of detailed investigations on how to use and interpret non-invasive measurements, including the determination of appropriate time points for sample collections.

AB  - In a world of growing anthropogenic pressures on biodiversity, effective indicators need to be specific and sensitive to the pressures in the ecosystem concerned, yet be simple enough to be interpreted by non-experts and straightforward enough to facilitate routine monitoring. Globally, seabirds are under increasing pressure as a result of anthropogenic activities and environmental variation. Traditionally, seabird indicators have been based on abundance at breeding colonies. However, as many species do not reach sexual maturity for several years, and may not attend the colony over this time period, such indicators may fail to capture the ecological complexity of the system concerned.
   We constructed two indicators of the state of nine seabird species that breed along the UK coast of the North Sea: (i) abundance of seabirds at breeding colonies, and (ii) probability of seabird breeding failure. The indicators were significantly and strongly correlated with each other for eight out of nine species, but the abundance indicator typically lagged the indicator on seabird breeding failure by two to three years. We then considered a third indicator which compared kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) breeding success to the levels expected given the underlying environmental conditions; changes in the abundance indicator also lagged this by three years. We investigate how sensitive each of these indicators was to the impacts of fishing. We found that the species which had seen the greatest increases in breeding failure rate over the study period were those species which were most sensitive to fisheries pressure.
   By focussing on demographic parameters, and correcting for the underlying environmental conditions, we can detect potentially important population level changes at an earlier stage than by focussing on abundance alone. These indicators are able to more accurately capture the complexity of the ecosystem concerned and can be readily interpreted by policy-makers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecological risk assessments (ERAs) of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), as single congeners or in mixtures, present technical challenges that raise concerns about their accuracy and validity for Canadian environments. Of more than 100,000 possible PAC structures, the toxicity of fewer than 1% have been tested as individual compounds, limiting the assessment of complex mixtures. Because of the diversity in modes of PAC action, the additivity of mixtures cannot be assumed, and mixture compositions change rapidly with weathering. In vertebrates, PACs are rapidly oxygenated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, often to metabolites that are more toxic than the parent compound. The ability to predict the ecological fate, distribution and effects of PACs is limited by toxicity data derived from tests of a few responses with a limited array of test species, under optimal laboratory conditions. Although several models are available to predict PAC toxicity and rank species sensitivity, they were developed with data biased by test methods, and the reported toxicities of many PACs exceed their solubility limits. As a result, Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines for a few individual PACs provide little support for ERAs of complex mixtures in emissions and at contaminated sites. These issues are illustrated by reviews of three case studies of PAC-contaminated sites relevant to Canadian ecosystems. Interactions among ecosystem characteristics, the behaviour, fate and distribution of PACs, and non-chemical stresses on PAC-exposed species prevented clear associations between cause and effect. The uncertainties of ERAs can only be reduced by estimating the toxicity of a wider array of PACs to species typical of Canada's diverse geography and environmental conditions. Improvements are needed to models that predict toxicity, and more field studies of contaminated sites in Canada are needed to understand the ecological effects of PAC mixtures. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - We describe the origins, development and characteristics of a major programme of research into soil biodiversity, the NERC Thematic Research Programme 'Biological Diversity and Function in Soils'. The programme was conceived to address a number of questions relating to the role of biodiversity in the ecological functioning of soils. It had six scientific aims, which in outline were: (i) to quantify the taxonomic diversity of key groups of the soil biota in a single ecosystem; (ii) to extend taxonomic understanding of the soil biota, especially to poorly characterised groups; (iii) to characterise the roles played by all major groups of the soil biota in the ecologically important process of the carbon cycle; (iv) to determine the extent to which depauperation of the soil biota may reduce its ability to perform essential ecosystem services; (v) to conduct parallel manipulations of major taxonomic groups of soil biota under controlled conditions; (vi) to determine the extent to which soil biodiversity is an indicator of soil ecosystem resilience.
   The research was focussed on a single, upland grassland site and combined both field studies and experiments in controlled laboratory conditions. We present the rationale for the study, provide information on the field site and the experimental design, and then give results of the background monitoring of both the soil chemistry and the botanical composition during the progress of the research. These changes reflect the results of the major treatments (N and Ca applied singly and in combination) in the experimental design. We briefly review the main achievements of the programme (such as understanding the outstanding diversity of the small soil organisms bacteria, protozoa, mycorrhizal fungi and nematodes - and the speed with which processes in the soil occur) and argue that the research has made substantial advances towards our understanding of both the extent and function of the biological diversity of soil ecosystems.

AB  - Strawberry is one of the most economically important and widely cultivated fruit crops across the world, so that there is a growing need to develop new analytical methodologies for the authentication of variety and origin, as well as the assessment of agricultural and processing practices. In this work, an untargeted metabolomic strategy based on gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS) combined with multivariate statistical techniques was used for the first time to characterize the primary metabolome of different strawberry cultivars and to study metabolite alterations in response to multiple agronomic conditions. For this purpose, we investigated three varieties of strawberries with different sensitivity to environmental stress (Camarosa, Festival and Palomar), cultivated in soilless systems using various electrical conductivities, types of coverage and substrates. Metabolomic analysis revealed significant alterations in primary metabolites between the three strawberry cultivars grown under different crop conditions, including sugars (fructose, glucose), organic acids (malic acid, citric acid) and amino acids (alanine, threonine, aspartic acid), among others. Therefore, it could be concluded that GC MS based metabolomics is a suitable tool to differentiate strawberry cultivars and characterize metabolomic changes associated with environmental and agronomic conditions.

AB  - Flow interruption in intermittent rivers (IRs) generates a mosaic of terrestrial and aquatic habitats across the river network affecting ecosystem processes, as organic matter (OM) decomposition. Water use for farming in arid and semi-arid climates intensifies the dry conditions and affects local river characteristics. In that way, flow intermittence and the distribution of land uses may affect the OM processing along the river. To understand the role of IRs in global OM dynamics and how global change affecting water flow regimes determines these dynamics, it is important to estimate OM-processing rates at a basin scale. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the intensity of flow intermittence on OM processing, and how this effect was modulated by local environmental factors related to land uses across a Mediterranean river basin. To do this, wood decomposition (mass loss and fungal biomass) was selected as a functional indicator. Drying duration and frequency were measured to characterize flow intermittence in different reaches along the river, as well as local environmental factors. Linear models stablished the role of factors on decomposition. The results showed that differences in decomposition rates across the river network were negatively related to the duration of flow interruption. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen associated with agriculture counteracted the negative effect of intermittence on mass loss (increasing by up to three times); but with a higher duration of dry conditions, its effect was insignificant. An increase of 20% of canopy (higher in natural areas) resulted in increases of up to 5% of mass loss. Overall, our study is relevant to understanding the interaction between flow intermittence and land uses on OM processing, especially considering the intensification of flow intermittence and its increased distribution to other regions, which is expected to be a consequence of climate warming and human activities.

AB  - The evaluation of ecosystem health is a hotspot in macro-ecology and ecosystem management. The objective of this paper is to introduce an ecosystem health assessment framework that combines ecosystem service concepts and indicators. We analyzed ecological services on Dongshan Island for regulating heavy rainfall by explicitly addressing the spatial distribution of ecosystem service demand and supply. An index system was then developed for both the areas that provide the ecological service and those that benefit from it. These areas are linked by small watersheds that were extracted using the hydrological analysis function in ArcGIS 10.2. Weights of the indicators were assigned and calculated based on principal component analysis. Finally, at the small watershed scale, the forested area and "other" land area ratios were weighted to assess the overall health of the areas that provide and benefit from this ecological service. The results revealed that the forest health conditions in the northwestern and northern parts of the island were weak, especially in the vicinity of the county seat. The analysis indicated that forested areas in the regions were relatively small, and the functional ecological service related to the redistribution of rainfall provided by these forested areas was minimal. The health states of areas benefiting from this ecological service generally appeared problematic. Areas benefiting from the service were characterized by dense populations, intense urbanization, and high risk of rain-related disaster. Moreover, only small and scattered forests were observed in the urban areas and towns on Dongshan Island. These urbanized areas rarely support large forest patches, and they fail to provide adequate green corridors or significant green space. This forest condition in urban areas cannot provide commendably protective functionality to mitigate heavy rain disasters. Therefore, to improve the ecological health of Dongshan Island, a system of green areas within urban landscapes must be planned and developed.

AB  - The coastal prairie ecoregion is located along the northwestern coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico in North America. Because of agricultural and urban development, less than 1% of the original 3.4 million ha of this ecosystem type remains in native condition, making it one of the most endangered ecosystems in North America. The objective of this study was to characterize the vegetation and environmental relationships in a relatively pristine example of lowland coastal prairie in order to provide information for use in conservation and restoration. The study area was a small, isolated prairie located near the southern boundary of the coastal prairie region. Samples were taken along three parallel transects that spanned the prairie. Parameters measured included species composition, elevation, soil characteristics, indications of recent disturbance, above-ground biomass, and light penetration through the plant canopy. Fifty-four species were found in the 107 0.25-m(2) plots and a total of 96 species were found at the site. Only two non-native species occurred in sample plots, both of which were uncommon. Cluster analysis was used to identify six vegetation groups, which were primarily dominated by members of the Poaceae or Asteraceae. A conspicuous, natural edaphic feature of the prairie was the presence of 'mima' mounds, which are raised areas approximately 0.5 to 1 m high and 5 to 10 m across. Indicator species analysis revealed a significant number of species that were largely restricted to mounds and these were predominately upland and colonizing species. Ordination was performed using nonmetric, multidimensional scaling. The dominant environmental influence on species composition was found to be elevation and a host of correlated factors including those associated with soil organic content. A secondary group of factors, consisting primarily of soil cations, was found to explain additional variance among plots. Overall, this prairie was found to contain plant associations that are now rare in the surrounding landscape. Within the prairie, plant groups were largely separated by a suite of environmental conditions associated with topography. These results suggest that conservation and restoration efforts will need to carefully consider local topographic influences in order to be successful.

AB  - Climate change is driving a rise in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Such events are characterised as thresholds beyond which cereal yields significantly change. We apply a threshold model to district-level data collected in India over 1966-2011 and objectively identify thresholds, measured by the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, before estimating their yield effects, for rice, wheat, maize, millet, sorghum and barley. Heterogeneous, crop-specific thresholds are identified for all crops except wheat. Thresholds are identified at normal climatic conditions but have smaller negative marginal effects than those of thresholds identified at dry conditions. The extent to which agro-ecological conditions and irrigation influence the location of thresholds and the size of their marginal effects varies by crop. Thresholds identified at dry climatic conditions severely reduce yield yet are rarely crossed; those at normal conditions moderately affect yield but are frequently crossed. A threshold's total impact on production is found to be inverse to the severity of its marginal effect. Severe-effect thresholds have been crossed with increasing frequency over time, contributing to growth in the size of total impacts. Our results have welfare implications and have the potential to inform predictions about the impacts of extreme weather events.

AB  - The caddisfly Crunoecia irrorata is a wide-spread species in Europe and inhabits permanent spring areas with pristine or moderately disturbed habitat conditions. However, the pattern of its distribution on the national scale as well as detailed preferences toward water properties are still insufficiently known. To complete this knowledge we analysed at first the distribution of this species in Poland which showed that its extent involves the whole territory, however, with sparse occurrence in most regions and with large areas where the species has not been observed yet. The data compilation also showed that the species' frequency of occurrence is highest in the central-western region of Poland. Furthermore, its frequency of occurrence decreased towards the east and the northeast. Because the highest frequency of occurrence of this species was found in central-western Poland, the spring sites in this region were used as a model area for the analysis of the hydrochemical conditions associated with the species (25 parameters). The results of the study showed that C. irrorata strongly prefers habitats with low nitrate (NO3) and chloride (Cl) concentrations. In detail, a regression model showed that the probability of occurrence of C. irrorata was only 5% at concentrations of 32 mg L-1 NO3 and 35 mg L-1 Cl. In contrast, high concentrations of heavy metals (zinc, lead, cooper, chromium, and cadmium) as well as of total iron and manganese did not significantly influence the presence of this species. In conclusion, environmental assessments relating to human health and landscape health can use C. irrorata as an indicator species for biogenic and salt pollution, but the species is not a potential indicator of heavy metals in spring water. Therefore, information on the presence of C. irrorata can serve to preserve crenic ecosystems and their assemblages and can be used to prevent anthropogenic contamination of these ecosystems.

AB  - Species distribution models are used for a wide range of ecological applications, such as assessment of ecological status. For many such assessments, predictions of entire communities are preferred. When entire community compositions are modelled, two options are available: (1) to model all of the communities' species individually and (2) to incorporate community information into the models. Here, we compared the accuracy of these two modelling approaches for predicting boreal lake phytoplankton assemblages and their ability to detect human impact. The modelling approaches tested were specifically classification-then-modelling (here a RIVPACS-type model, using random forest to predict biological group membership) and species-by-species modelling, using a random forest model for each species.
   The species-by-species models performed better than the RIVPACS model according to the dissimilarity measure BC, the area under curve (AUC) and proportion of true positives. In contrast, the taxonomic completeness index (O/E), commonly used for freshwater assessments, indicated that the RIVPACS model performed better. However, we believe that O/E overestimates model performance, due to the index omitting false negative errors (i.e. errors where species are wrongly predicting as absent).
   No support was found for our hypothesis that rare species would be better modelled by the RIVPACS model. Indeed, the RIVPACS model predicted common species significantly better than the species-by-species models, whilst the species-by-species models predicted rare species better than the RIVPACS model.
   Both modelling methods were able to separate impaired sites (acidified and eutrophic) from reference sites.
   We suggest that classification-then-modelling is evaluated using data-set containing more possible biological interactions, e.g. phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish. We also suggest that AUC is used as a complement to taxonomic completeness when evaluating models for reference condition taxa composition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In near-shore marine ecosystems, organisms inhabit an interface between marine and terrestrial environments where both systems interact in complex ways. These interactions may occur along gradients in biophysical conditions that vary over spatial and temporal scales. These environmental conditions are known to drive many biological processes with resulting influence on a given species life history. In the present study we examined spatial variation in indices of reproductive fitness, namely fecundity, egg volume, and egg biochemistry in the red sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus along a spatial gradient of decreasing wave energy and increasing terrestrial influence in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada. Stable carbon (delta C-13) isotopic analysis was used as a bioindicator of (1) the influence of terrestrially derived carbon in egg production and (2) the concomitant effects of assimilation of terrestrial carbon on egg quality. Stable nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopic analysis was used to assess trophic status among and within locations and relate this back to the strength of the gradients. We found that urchins in the lowest energy wave environment released the most eggs compared to all other locations. Egg volume was similar across all sites in the present study; however, within each site, mean egg volume varied among female urchins. Egg biochemistry (e.g. protein, carbohydrate and lipid levels), a proxy for egg quality, was the same at all sites, although analysis of percent carbon, a proxy for lipids, suggested a trend in increasing levels as distance from high wave energy environments increased. No obvious spatial pattern in delta C-13 was observed, suggesting that input of terrestrial organic material is well diluted in Barkley Sound. With respect to delta N-15, we found little variation in trophic level at which foraging takes place. In contrast there were different delta C-13 and delta N-15 levels when comparing egg to tube foot tissue, suggesting that temporally S. franciscanus was feeding on different food sources or that for these tissue types urchins differentially assimilate carbon and nitrogen isotopes.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are already responding to changing environmental conditions that are driven by increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These developments affect how societies can utilise and benefit from the woodland areas in the future, be it for example climate change mitigation as carbon sinks, lumber for wood industry, or preserved for nature tourism and recreational activities. We assess the effect and the relative magnitude of different uncertainty sources in ecosystem model simulations from the year 1980 to 2100 for two Finnish boreal forest sites. The models used in this study are the land ecosystem model JSBACH and the forest growth model PREBAS. The considered uncertainty sources for both models are model parameters and four prescribed climates with two RCP (representative concentration pathway) scenarios. Usually, model parameter uncertainty is not included in these types of uncertainty studies. PREBAS simulations also include two forest management scenarios. We assess the effect of these sources of variation at four different points in time on several ecosystem indicators, e.g. gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration, soil moisture, recurrence of drought, length of the vegetation active period (VAP), length of the snow melting period and the stand volume. The uncertainty induced by the climate models remains roughly the same throughout the simulations and is overtaken by the RCP scenario impact halfway through the experiment. The management actions are the most dominant uncertainty factors for Hyytiala and as important as RCP scenarios at the end of the simulations, but they contribute only half as much for Sodankyla. The parameter uncertainty is the least influential of the examined uncertainty sources, but it is also the most elusive to estimate due to non-linear and adverse effects on the simulated ecosystem indicators. Our analysis underlines the importance of carefully considering the implementation of forest use when simulating future ecosystem conditions, as human impact is evident and even increasing in boreal forested regions.

AB  - The objective of this study is to make an analysis of the natural characteristics of the mountain territories in Southern Siberia as part of the development of the technique for assessing the ecological potential of geosystems by using the central part of the Oka Plateau as an example. A brief description of the relief and exogenous processes is provided for three geomorphological regions: Okinsko-Sorokskii, Okinsko-Tustukskii and Soroksko-Bel'skii, which are characterized by a predominance of flat-topped interfluves, slopes of moderate steepness and deeply incised river valleys. The main features of the climate and hydrological regime in the study area are emphasized. The first ever bathymetrical survey of Lake Sagan-Nur was made, and its morphometric indicators were calculated. On the basis of the morphology and bottom sediments of the lake basin, the genesis of the lake is treated as glaciotectonic. The chemical composition of the waters and the lake bottom sediments were determined, which may well characterize it as a natural unpolluted reservoir. The natural regionalization scheme for the southeastern part of Eastern Sayan is presented. The large-scale landscape map has been compiled for a portion of the central part of the plateau as well as indicating and the main species of vegetation within its boundaries. The identified features in the natural conditions of the study area (relief, climate, surface waters and landscapes) furnish a means of assessing the ecological potential of geosystems. A combination of the nature- and anthropocentric approaches in assessing the ecological potential of geosystems offers considerable scope for optimal use of natural and human resources of this area which sparsely populated but rich in mineral resources. On the plateau, a detailed study of landscapes and their components is crucial to the assessment of the ecological potential of geosystems, although forecasts of the possible enhancement in the influence of the anthropogenic factor and analysis of the consequences of such an influence on the natural environment are also required.

AB  - Robust approaches to evaluate ecological quality in aquatic ecosystems become demanding concomitantly with the degradation resulting from increasing human-induced pressures. Aiming at a successful management, numerous evaluation tools are currently available and have been widely used for quality status assessment in estuaries mainly through the analysis of macrobenthic communities. The Mondego estuary (Portugal) has been under severe environmental pressure since the early 1990s due to different anthropogenic stresses. To improve the ecological condition and mainly to ameliorate the risk of eutrophication symptoms in an estuarine section (south arm), in 2006, the upstream connection between the north and south estuarine arms was re-established. Data on subtidal macrobenthic communities and environmental variables over a 5-year interval, covering the pre-management (from 2004 to 2006) and post-management (2007 and 2008) periods were used to assess restoration effectiveness. Firstly, temporal differences in the structure and composition of the macrobenthic assemblages between periods were assessed. Secondly, the relative performance of different ecological indicators (Shannon-Wiener, Margalef, Pielou, Simpson, AMBI, taxonomic diversity measures and Eco-exergy based indicators) to capture potential ecological changes between periods was analyzed. Lastly, indicators' performance was compared with the information given by the analysis of macrofauna composition and structure to distinguish their usefulness for addressing specific management objectives.
   In the post-management, water quality did not reflect considerable changes while macrobenthic assemblages responded to restoration variably along the estuarine gradient. Overall, ecological indicators effectively detected the prevailing ecological conditions and behaved consistently with the subtidal community ecological context. Most indicators were able to capture temporal changes in macrobenthic assemblages structure and performed differently for the distinct estuarine zones assessed, not always indicating a quality improvement. Further monitoring and assessment on subtidal macrobenthic communities' structure and functioning is needed to understand better the restoration effects. Recognize the success of such actions in aquatic systems is crucial for their adequate management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To assess the health status of aquatic ecosystems, specialized tools and strategies are needed to study the changes induced in oceanic systems by human activity. The Gulf of Mexico has a tremendous ecological importance because of its biological diversity. The present paper defines baseline levels of blood metabolites and immune components for wild tropical populations of F. duorarum: an important shrimp species of the Gulf of Mexico. Osmotic pressure (OP), osmotic capability (OC), oxy hemocyanin (OxyHc), glucose, digestive gland glycogen, proteins, cholesterol, lactate, acylglycerols (AG) were used as indicators of physiological and nutritional status; phenoloxidase activity, quantification of hemocytes, as well as respiratory burst, were used to assess the immunological status. There were no differences between sexes in either live weight or physiological and nutritional conditions. Only total blood protein, oxy hemocyanin, and digestive gland glycogen showed normally distributed data. All the remaining blood parameters were right- or left-skewed. A median live weight of 9.5 g was registered for the sampled population. Median values of 955 and -91.85 mOsm/kg (OP and OC, respectively) were obtained, indicating that shrimp were slightly hypo-osmotic in relation to sea water. A proportion of 27% of OxyHc of the total protein (OxyHc/Prot) was calculated for the F. duorarum population. ProPO and PO showed no normal distribution and were not different between sexes. A right-skewed distribution was observed. Total hemocytes, hyaline (HC) and granular cells (GC) showed differences between sexes, with higher values in females than males. A similar proportion of HC (69%) and GC (30%) of total cells were observed between sexes. Basal and activated respiratory burst showed differences between sexes with higher values for females than for males. The current results provide indicators of the nutritional and immune status of F. duorarum that can be used to detect changes in trophic relations and health at a population level.

AB  - The key challenge in the fields of conservation and resource management is to track local, regional and global species extinctions and preserve biodiversity through optimization of investment of funds. To fulfil that purpose modelling and mapping habitat suitability of species is becoming essential. The freshwater ecosystem is today one of the most threatened ecosystems and fishes are especially vulnerable for climate change as they have fewer choices for dispersal. The altered thermal regimes, land use and hydrology together cause isolation, fragmentation and changes in distributional patterns of fish. In such landlocked situation, there is utmost need to identify suitable environmental conditions for a species to exist. Indigenous fish is one of the essential components of healthy inland aquatic ecosystems as they fulfil several important ecological functions and form an important part of the aquatic food web. Amblypharyngodon mola is an economically and ecologically important indigenous freshwater fish species of the tropical and subtropical floodplain rivers and wetland habitats of India and Bangladesh. However, lack of knowledge about the key environmental indicators is hindering appropriate management and conservation initiation. Modelling and mapping the distribution of A. mola was done for identifying the key environmental variables and predicting the potential distribution area of the species in current climatic condition. The species occurrence data were accessed from both primary and secondary sources and used after cleaning and removing biasness. Climatic, topographic, landcover and soil variables of 1 km resolution were used as environmental predictors. India and Bangladesh together were used as model background. Ensemble species distribution modelling was done, and the model was validated by area under the curve (AUC) value (> 0.7). The result showed that the Ganges delta of lower reach going through West Bengal and Bangladesh is most suitable for A. mola occurrence. Annual upstream precipitation (hydroclim_12), soil pH in water (soil_average_02) and elevation (ele_01) are the key indicators for predicting the habitats suggesting the importance of hydroclimatic, topographic and soil variables in determining the distribution of the fish.

AB  - The toxic potential of mercury (Hg) in aquatic systems is due to the presence and production of methylmercury (MeHg). Recent studies in tropical floodplain environments showed that periphyton associated with the roots of aquatic macrophytes produce MeHg. Periphyton communities are the first link in the food chain and one of the main MeHg sources in aquatic environments. The aim of this work was to test the hypotheses that the algal community structure affects potential methylation, and ecologically distinct communities with different algal and bacterial densities directly affect the formation of MeHg in the roots of macrophytes. To evaluate these, net MeHg production in the roots of Eichhornia crassipes in relation to the taxonomic structure of associated periphytic algae was evaluated. Macrophyte root samples were collected in the dry and flood season from two floodplain lakes in the Pantanal (Brazil). These lakes have different ecological conditions as a function of their lateral hydrological connectivity with the Paraguay River that is different during times of drought. Results indicated that MeHg production was higher in the flood season than in the dry season. MeHg production rates were higher in the disconnected lake in comparison to the connected lake during the dry season. MeHg production exhibited a strong positive co-variation with cyanobacteria abundance (R-2 = 0.78; p <0.0001 in dry; R-2 = 0.40; p = 0.029 in flood) and with total algal biomass (R-2 = 0.86; p < 0.0001), and a negative co-variation with Zygnemaphyceae (R-2 = 0.50; p = 0.0018) in the lake community in dry season. This indicates that ecological conditions that favour the establishment and development of cyanobacteria are associated with higher rates of methylation in aquatic systems. This suggests that cyanobacteria could be a proxy for sites of MeHg production in some natural aquatic environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change would pose a range of threat to human health both directly and indirectly. The direct adverse effects of climate change to human health include increased frequency of heatwaves, storms, floods, forest fire and drought. The indirect effects usually mediate through impacts on environmental conditions and ecosystems (e.g., air pollution, food insecurity and under-nutrition, and changing patterns of disease), economies, and social structure (e.g., displacement, migration and conflict).
   To map out the impacts that climate change is having on human health, and the health consequences of the global policy response, the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change and the Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change has been initiated, with strong collaboration of world-class expertise from multiple disciplines and leading academic institutions around the world.
   The 2018 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change tracks 41 indicators across five domains: Climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation, planning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; finance and economics; and public and political engagement. The report warns that a lack of progress in reducing emissions and building adaptive capacity threatens both human lives and the viability of the national health systems they depend on, with the potential to disrupt core public health infrastructure and overwhelm health services. Therefore, the nature and scale of the response to climate change will be the determining factor in shaping the health of nations for centuries to come.
   China is the global hotspot in both climate change mitigation and human health protection. Thus, in addition to the annual editions of the Lancet Countdown global report, scholars from Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University who have been involved in the series of global reports, are invited to prepare the China policy brief, to provide a unique national analysis and policy recommendations for health and climate change.
   The 2018 edition of China policy brief, prepared by experts from Tsinghua University and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, reviewed three indicators mostly related to China's national conditions, i.e. change in labour capacity, exposure to ambient air pollution and coverage and strength of carbon pricing, and proposed the following policy recommendations: (1) Pay more attention to the labour capacity loss driven by climate change in the policymaking process. Curb greenhouse gas emissions and take effective adaptation measures to manage heat stress at work and avoided unaffordable heat-related economic loss. (2) Prioritize measures that both decrease greenhouse gas emissions and reduce air pollution and its related health costs, and incorporate analysis of those benefits into the climate and air pollution control policymaking process in order to fully realize short-term health co-benefits and prevent climate-change-related meteorological conditions that will worsen air pollution in the long run. (3) Ensure full operation of the national ETS and implement ambitious carbon pricing policy as soon as possible. Fully consider the health co-benefits of carbon pricing, speed up the capacity building process, apply carbon pricing broadly across China without delay, and enhance ambition gradually.

AB  - Hospitals' indoor conditions affect patients' comfort. Comfort is predicted based on threshold values for indoor environmental quality (IEQ) indicators, but discrepancies with actual (dis)comfort occur. Current prediction methods ignore the role of patients' adaptation or treat it as a 'black box'. Therefore, we investigated how distinguishing between adaptation strategies may help explain discrepancies. We combined sensor measurements of IEQ indicators (sound, light, temperature) at two hospital wards with a questionnaire among 238 patients. After grouping respondents according to their adaptation strategy, we investigated relationships between strategies, respondents' experiences of indoor conditions and measured values of IEQ indicators. Experiences differ when respondents' adaptation strategy differs. Satisfaction votes are higher when sensation votes are more neutral or more as preferred. This occurs when respondents adapt behaviourally (i.e. adapt indoor conditions) or do not wish to adapt indoor conditions (e.g. adapt sensations), rather than when adapting psychologically (i.e. by choice or imposed). Adaptation strategies influence measured values differently, but this cannot explain differences in experiences. Adaptation strategies therefore seem to influence experiences in a psychological way, which current methods cannot predict. Attending to how adaptation influences experiences of indoor conditions and how this differs between adaptation strategies, can thus contribute to reducing discrepancies.

AB  - Vehicles are extremely vulnerable to single-vehicle accidents under some hazardous driving conditions (i.e. strong wind, icy or snowy road surface). An integrated framework is proposed to assess single-vehicle traffic safety performance of stochastic traffic flow under hazardous driving conditions. Different from most existing studies focusing on a single vehicle moving at a constant speed, for the first time, the proposed work evaluates individual vehicle safety performance based on the time-dependent simulation results of stochastic traffic flow, including instantaneous speeds and positions of each vehicle as a part of simulated traffic flow. Simultaneously, complex geometric and other environmental conditions of the highway system are also considered realistically, not only during the safety assessment process, but also in quantifying the wind loads applied on the vehicles. Finally, with the safety information of each individual vehicle, an overall safety performance index of the whole traffic flow on the highway system is further introduced, which serves as a potential traffic safety performance measure and resilience indicator of transportation infrastructure systems under various hazards. This study has potential applications to not only regular vehicles, but also advanced traffic management and control algorithms for connected and autonomous vehicles in hazardous driving environments.

AB  - In the conditions of the strengthened technogenic loading on the environment, one of the priority and actual directions is the research of the maintenance of heavy metals in the soil are the plants are grown in separate biogeocenoses.
   The research aimed to study the migration of mobile forms of heavy metals (Cadmium, Plumbum, Mercury, and Zinc) in the trophic chain system: soil-plant under local human-made load. Also, to explore the peculiarities of their accumulation in the ground, entry into the vegetative part of plants, and develop measures to prevent the migration.
   The experiment was conducted at Zubra LLC. Agricultural lands are directly adjacent to the Mykolayiv Cement and Mining Plant territory, which is a powerful source of emissions of toxic chemical elements, the content of which exceeds the MAL (the maximum allowable level) for all investigated ingredients. In scientific and economic research. We studied heavy metals' migration in the soil-plant (feed) system. Therefore, our research object was soil samples, forage crops, which determined heavy metals' content. In some micro field experiments, soil contamination with heavy metals was modeled, reflecting the range of real loads in the study area. Ameliorants of organic and inorganic nature were applied to the soil contaminated with heavy metals to mitigate pollutants' adverse effects.
   A high level of heavy metals was registered in the soils of Zubra LLC surveyed by us. It should be noted that the content of toxic metals in the studied ground samples decreases with increasing distance from the source of human-made pollution, i.e., the migration of heavy metals following the laws of their distribution in the horizontal direction. The study of acid-base conditions (pH) of soils indicates a violation of acid-base balance. Our research shows that the highest level of mobile forms of heavy metals is registered in conditions of low winds, high humidity, and fog. The decrease in the level of mobile forms of heavy metals in the soil is directly related to the vegetative period of plant development, during which heavy metals migrate intensively into the vegetative part of plants. The coefficient of biological absorption of heavy metals by plants often exceeds one. In micro field experiments, ground contamination with Cadmium, Lead, and Zinc ions at concentrations of 2 and 3 MAL were simulated. It is established that antagonistic and synergistic interactions of toxicants largely determine the accumulation of heavy metals in plants' vegetative part.
   To mitigate the adverse effects of pollutants, we applied ameliorants of inorganic and organic nature. Among the used ameliorants, the most effective was the zeolite of the Sokyrnytsia deposit. The introduction of which into the soil leads to a significant reduction in plants' accumulation of heavy metals. Under the influence of zeolite, the concentration of Lead and Zinc's mobile forms in the green mass of corn was within.
   Promising further research is developing measures for the preliminary transfer of essential metals in the food chain: soil-plant - feed - animal - products - humans, testing, experimental verification of the effectiveness of measures to attract environmentally friendly products produced and grown in local processing facilities.

AB  - Local, regional and global targets have been set to halt marine biodiversity loss. Europe has set its own policy targets to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) of marine ecosystems by implementing the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) across member states. We combined an extensive dataset across five Mediterranean ecoregions including 26 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), their reference unprotected areas, and a no-trawl case study. Our aim was to assess if MPAs reach GES, if their effects are local or can be detected at ecoregion level or up to a Mediterranean scale, and which are the ecosystem components driving GES achievement. This was undertaken by using the analytical tool NEAT (Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool), which allows an integrated assessment of the status of marine systems. We adopted an ecosystem approach by integrating data from several ecosystem components: the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, macroalgae, sea urchins and fish. Thresholds to define the GES were set by dedicated workshops and literature review. In the Western Mediterranean, most MPAs are in good/high status, with P. oceanica and fish driving this result within MPAs. However, GES is achieved only at a local level, and the Mediterranean Sea, as a whole, results in a moderate environmental status. Macroalgal forests are overall in bad condition, confirming their status at risk. The results are significantly affected by the assumption that discrete observations over small spatial scales are representative of the total extension investigated. This calls for large-scale, dedicated assessments to realistically detect environmental status changes under different conditions. Understanding MPAs effectiveness in reaching GES is crucial to assess their role as sentinel observatories of marine systems. MPAs and trawling bans can locally contribute to the attainment of GES and to the fulfillment of the MSFD objectives. Building confidence in setting thresholds between GES and non-GES, investing in long-term monitoring, increasing the spatial extent of sampling areas, rethinking and broadening the scope of complementary tools of protection (e.g., Natura 2000 Sites), are indicated as solutions to ameliorate the status of the basin.

AB  - Lake Idku, northern Egypt, receives large quantities of drainage water from four main discharging drains. Ecological and biological status of Lake Idku has been monitored during (autumn 2012 to summer 2013) to examine the lake water quality and eutrophication level in response to the quality as well as the source of the discharging water. Discrete water samples were collected from the lake body and the drains. Chemical analyses revealed an excessive nutrient load goes into the lake. A range of 1.4-10.6 mg nitrites/L was determined for drain waters, however a sudden increase was observed in lake and drain water samples of up to 84 and 74.5 mg/L, respectively. Reactive silicate ranged between 2.9 and 4.8 mg/L; while inorganic phosphate fluctuated between 0.2 and 0.43 mg/L. Transparency varied from 45 cm to 134 cm with better light conditions at drain sites. Biological results indicated a hyper-eutrophic status for the lake with a range of chlorophyll-a varied from a minimum of 39.9 mu g/L (at Idku Drains) and a maximum of 104.2 mu g/L (at El-Khairy drain). Phytoplankton community structure revealed higher abundance at lake sites compared with the drains. Maximum phytoplankton density was detected during summer with the dominance of Bacilariophyceae (e.g. Cyclotella meneghiniana, Cyclotella comate, Melosira varians) followed by Chlorophycean taxon (e.g. Scenedesmus dimorphus, S. bijuga and Crucigenia tetrapedia). Five indices were applied to evaluate the water quality of the lake. Diversity Index (DI) indicated slight to light pollution along all sites; while Sapropic Index (SI) indicated slight pollution with acceptable oxygen conditions and an availability of sensitive species. Palmer Index (PI) gave a strong evidence of high organic pollution at some sites in the lake, while Generic Diatom Index (GDI) revealed that levels cif pollution varied from average to strong. Trophic Index (TI), suggest that there are an obvious signs of eutrophication in the lake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Remotely sensed data plays a critical role by acquiring data on ecological conditions over broad spatial scales, providing important information for mapping landscape-scale ecosystem characteristics. The goal of our research is to employ a robust clustering algorithm to provide a transparent method of integrating remotely sensed datasets into homogeneous ecosystem units for conservation planning and monitoring ecosystem condition and change. Using a suite of ecosystem characteristics derived from digital elevation and remotely sensed data at 1 km spatial resolution, we classify the 94 million ha within the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, into 16 terrestrial ecosystem regions (and a water category) using a two-step clustering approach. Initially, 10 metrics representing the physical environment (elevation and soil wetness potential), available energy (solar insolation and snow melt) and vegetation production (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation) were considered for ecosystem classification, which were reduced to six after analyzing variable inter-correlations. The results provide ecologically unique terrestrial regions: ten of which describe the Northern Boreal, Coastal Mountains and Southern Interior Mountains, and six the coastal lowlands, Georgia Depression, interior, Boreal Plains and Taiga Plains. Analyzing the spatial interaction between the cluster categories revealed that highly dispersed ecosystem types occur most often in the intermediate elevation zone, moderate dispersion at the highest elevations, and homogeneity in the lowland areas where elevation remains relatively constant. When overlaid with BC's standard biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification zones the newly developed regions represent similar ecosystem ranges in the coastal, Taiga and Boreal Plains. However, overall our delineation exhibits a greater level of diversity in the alpine environment, and greater homogeneity in the central and southern interior. The quantitative regionalization approach we present offers a broad-scale assessment of British Columbia's ecosystem diversity that can be used as a supplement to traditional in situ biodiversity assessments to provide detail in under-sampled regions of BC or areas experiencing landscape change.

AB  - Proposed environmental flow regime changes downstream of a major water supply dam have been assessed in terms of effects on depth, velocity and fish passage across natural, gravel-bed riffles and rapids. This study focussed on passage requirements for Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata (Perciformes, Percichthyidae), a catadromous fish of considerable ecological and recreational fishing importance. Some 23 major riffles and rapids occur between the dam and the tidal limit over a river length of 25 km. Reconnaissance investigations of riffle slope, length, width, depth and morphologic characteristics indicated that wide-shallow, steep-turbulent and bifurcating riffle morphologies were most likely to cause problems for upstream bass passage under low flow conditions. Two approaches were used to investigate riffle depths and velocities over a range of flows. A rapid assessment approach directly measured thalweg depths and velocities under two controlled flow release rates in riffles identified as being potentially problematic to upstream bass passage. Detailed topographic surveys and two dimensional hydraulic modelling with River2D was undertaken for two riffles identified as 'worst case' examples of wide-shallow and steep-turbulent morphologies. Results from both approaches were consistent and complementary. Both approaches identified riffles where minimum depths and maximum velocities were likely to be problematic for upstream passage by Australian bass at a flow rate of 130 MLd(-1) (the current regulated flow release) but were mitigated at flow rates above 300 MLd(-1). Assessment of environmental flow regime transparency and translucency threshold options with regard to a 300 MLd(-1) target flow indicated that options where the transparency threshold was set at the 80th flow duration percentile (flows equalled or exceeded for 80% of time), and varied according to the monthly pattern of natural flows, improved hydraulic conditions for upstream bass migration.

AB  - Future climate conditions (warmer, wetter) are expected to change aboveground plant communities with linked belowground alterations (e.g. porewater chemistry) that can influence carbon dynamics. The aims of this study were 1) to determine if porewater phenolic compound concentrations reflect the changing aboveground plant community and 2) to elucidate if changes in phenolic compounds alter belowground carbon release.
   We monitored the changes in vegetation biomass, porewater phenolic compound concentrations, respired CO2 and phenol oxidase enzyme activity in 84 intact peatland mesocosms exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2, elevated temperature, and decreased water table conditions in a full factorial design.
   Phenolic compound concentrations were indicative of the vascular plant expansion that occurred under warmer and anaerobic conditions, suggesting that phenolic compounds could be a simple indicator of northern plant community dynamics. Ecosystem CO2 respiration increased with rising phenolic compound concentrations, suggesting that phenolic compounds can decrease microbial carbon use efficiency in northern peatlands.
   Using an aboveground-belowground framework we present a previously unrecognized mechanism influencing northern carbon dynamics; wherein, climate change conditions can restructure the plant community composition in turn increasing porewater phenolic concentrations, which results in decreased microbial carbon use efficiency and enhanced carbon release.

AB  - Extreme precipitation events are projected to occur more frequently under a warming climate, posing increasing threats to coastal ecosystems. Hurricane Harvey (2017), the wettest tropical cyclone in the U.S. history causing a 1000-year flood in the Houston metropolitan area, provides an opportunity to study the response of coastal ecosystems to extreme events. As sessile, epibenthic filter-feeding organisms, oysters are inherently sensitive to changes in environmental and water quality conditions, making them a good indicator for ecosystem health. Oyster measurements at 130 sites in Galveston Bay show that the mean oyster mortality drastically increased from 11% before Harvey to 48% after Harvey. Post-Harvey oyster mortality exhibited large spatial variability and was up to 100% at some major reef complexes. For all the oyster sampling sites, brown shells were dominant, while black shells indicating mud burial were rare. Considering the little impact from sediment deposit, we hypothesized the low-salinity exposure as the main cause for the massive oyster kill. The hypothesis is supported by a multidisciplinary (biological-geological-physical) analysis of bay-wide oyster mortality and sediment-core data and results of a previously-validated high-resolution hydrodynamic model. Oyster mortality was found to be significantly and positively correlated with the bottom low-salinity exposure time (duration of bottom salinity continuously less than 5 PSU), while there was no significant relationship with the thickness of storm-induced sediment deposit. The physiological aspects for the impact of low-salinity exposure, the underlying physical mechanisms for the prolonged salinity recovery, and wider implications of oyster kill in Galveston Bay in the context of global oyster reef conditions were discussed. The worldwide reported oyster kills following extreme weather events suggest additional pressure posed by future climate on the native coastal oyster reefs that are already at the brink of functional extinction due to centuries of resource extraction and coastal habitat degradation.

AB  - The Balbina hydropower dam in the Central Amazon basin, established in the Uatuma River in the 1980s, is emblematic for its socio-environmental disaster. Its environmental impacts go far beyond the reservoir and dam, however, affecting the floodplain forests (igapo) in the downstream area (dam shadow), which have been assessed using a transdisciplinary research approach, synthesized in this review.
   Floodplain tree species are adapted to a regular and predictable flood pulse, with high- and low-water periods occurring during the year. This was severely affected by the operation of the Balbina dam, which caused the suppression of both the aquatic phase at higher floodplain elevations and the terrestrial phase at lower floodplain elevations (termed the 'sandwich effect').
   During the period of construction and reservoir fill, large-scale mortality already occurred in the floodplains of the dam shadow as a result of reduced stream flow, in synergy with severe drought conditions induced by El Nino events, causing hydraulic failure and making floodplains vulnerable to wildfires.
   During the operational period of the dam, permanent flooding conditions at low topographical elevations resulted in massive tree mortality. So far, 12% of the igapo forests have died along a downstream river stretch of more than 125 km. As a result of flood suppression at the highest elevations, an encroachment of secondary tree species from upland (terra firme) forests occurred.
   More than 35 years after the implementation of the Balbina dam, the downstream impacts caused massive losses of macrohabitats, ecosystem services, and diversity of flood-adapted tree species, probably cascading down to the entire food web, which must be considered in conservation management.
   These findings are discussed critically, emphasizing the urgent need for the Brazilian environmental regulatory agencies to incorporate downstream impacts in the environmental assessments of several dam projects planned for the Amazon region.

AB  - Adaptation to large-scale spatial heterogeneity in the environment accounts for a major proportion of genetic diversity within species. Theory predicts the erosion of adaptive genetic variation on a within-population level, but considerable genetic diversity is often found locally. Genetic diversity could be expected to be maintained within populations in temporally or spatially variable conditions if genotypic rank orders vary across contrasting microenvironmental settings. Taking advantage of fine-resolution environmental data, we tested the hypothesis that temperature heterogeneity among years could be one factor maintaining quantitative genetic diversity within a natural and genetically diverse plant population. We sampled maternal families of Boechera stricta, an Arabidopsis thaliana relative, at one location in the central Rocky Mountains and grew them in three treatments that, based on records from an adjacent weather station, simulated hourly temperature changes at the native site during three summers with differing mean temperatures. Treatment had a significant effect on all traits, with 2-3-fold increase in above- and belowground biomass and the highest allocation to roots observed in the treatment simulating the warmest summer on record at the site. Treatment affected bivariate associations between traits, with the weakest correlation between above- and belowground biomass in the warmest treatment. The magnitude of quantitative genetic variation for all traits differed across treatments: Genetic variance of biomass was 0 in the warmest treatment, while highly significant diversity was found in average conditions, resulting in broad-sense heritability of 0.31. Significant genotype x environment interactions across all treatments were found only in root-to-shoot ratio. Therefore, temperature variation among summers appears unlikely to account for the observed levels of local genetic variation in size in this perennial species, but may influence family rank order in growth allocation. Our results indicate that natural environmental fluctuations can have a large impact on the magnitude of within-population quantitative genetic variance.

AB  - Leaf-litter assays have advanced understanding of decomposition processes in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Some shortcomings inherent in the technique may be overcome through use of a cotton-strip assay. Key assumptions for using cotton strips as proxies for natural leaves are: 1) decomposition rates of the 2 materials are related, and 2) the materials decay in a similar way when exposed to the same environmental conditions. These assumptions were tested by comparing cotton-strip decomposition (loss of tensile strength and mass) and leaf decomposition (mass loss) across different floodplain habitats of the Tagliamento River (northeastern Italy). Patterns of loss of cotton-strip tensile strength and leaf mass were broadly comparable across river channels, ponds, and terrestrial sites. Differences between river channels and ponds were greater for loss of cotton-strip tensile strength than leaf mass, indicating that, in some situations, loss of cotton-strip tensile strength may be more sensitive to differing environmental conditions than loss of leaf mass. Loss of cotton-strip mass was less sensitive than loss of either tensile strength or leaf mass. Although combined data from all floodplain sites and additional sites in Swiss streams yielded a curvilinear relationship between loss of cotton-strip tensile strength and mass, the slope was extremely steep in the range of 20 to 30% mass loss (corresponding to 0 to 95% loss in tensile strength), indicating that inferring one variable from the other is unreliable. Leaf mass loss was significantly correlated with loss of tensile strength in fine- and coarse-mesh bags in ponds and in coarse-mesh bags in terrestrial sites. However, these correlations were relatively weak (r = 0.50-0.63), suggesting that loss of tensile strength did not accurately reflect leaf mass loss. Thus, the cotton-strip assay should not be used uncritically as a surrogate for leaf-litter assays, but it has potential as a standardized method to measure organic-matter decomposition in fluvial settings and as a functional indicator for stream assessment.

AB  - Uninhabited islands serve as a natural and unique laboratory for the study of soil fertility under varying natural conditions and potential anthropogenic influences, and how the soil fertility spatially varies and which factor determines the spatial variance remain to be studied. In this study, a total of 15 uninhabited islands in Miaodao Archipelago, a typical archipelago in northern China, were selected to demonstrate the study. The soil fertility was represented by seven soil factors and a composite index, namely, soil fertility indicator (SFI). Different environmental factors that covered natural and anthropogenic aspects were identified at island and local scales, and the spatial pattern of soil fertility responding to the environmental factors was analyzed. Then, the influences of different environmental factors on the spatial variances of soil fertility at the dual scales were quantified. Results revealed that the soils in the study area had considerably higher values of total carbon, total nitrogen, organic matter, available phosphorus, and available potassium compared with the soils on other China's islands, the recognized standards, and the national and regional mean values, indicating the extremely high fertility. Great spatial differences in the soil fertility were observed among different islands and sampling sites. At island scale, the island isolation, which was represented by the distance to the inhabited islands and the mainland (DTI), determined the spatial variance of soil fertility. The SFI distinctly increased with the increase in DTI, which could be explained partly by the isolation from human activities and the vegetation condition at island scale, and partly by the cross-scale influence from altitude (Al). At local scale, Shannon-Wiener index (H'), Al, slope (Sl), and distance to the shoreline (DTS) showed clear positive correlations with SFI. The Al and DTS determined the spatial variance of soil fertility under the cross-scale influences from island area and DTI, while H' and Sl didn't involve cross-scale influences.

AB  - Aim While environmental conditions are reported as important determinants of cytotype distribution patterns in some mixed-ploidy plant species, in others they seem to play no role. One reason for such inconsistency might be how and at what spatial scale the ecology of different cytotypes is compared. To address this issue, we adopted several complementary approaches to assess ecological requirements of cytotypes in a single species across wide-range of spatial scales. Location Europe. Taxon Tripleurospermum inodorum (Asteraceae). Methods WorldClim extracted data were used for comparing climatic niches of T. inodorum diploids and tetraploids at continental and subcontinental scales and for predicting climatic suitability of habitats in Europe. Within the contact zone of cytotypes, at the regional scale, ecological preferences of cytotypes were assessed independently in three regions. Habitat types and ecological indicators inferred from species composition of vegetation in both uniform-ploidy and mixed-ploidy populations were used for ecological niche reconstructions. Results The two cytotypes differed in their climatic niches. However, due to considerable niche overlap, diploids and tetraploids were predicted to co-occur in an extensive contact zone in Europe. Within the contact zone, cytotypes had identical ecological preferences but varied in their frequency at particular habitat types. The ecological niches of mixed-ploidy and uniform-ploidy populations were undistinguishable. Main conclusions Cytotype distribution patterns may be shaped by multiple environmental forces, each operating at a different spatial scale. In T. inodorum, climate is an important driver of cytotype distribution patterns at continental scale, however, at finer scales within the contact zone, the founder effect and non-random migration patterns caused by human activities seem to be more important than environmental heterogeneity. The use of independent replicates and/or across-scale comparisons can significantly improve the performance of ecological niche assessments.

AB  - Holocene environmental and climatic changes are reconstructed using analyses of biological proxies in lake sediments from Vuolep Njakajaure, a lake located near the altitudinal treeline in northern Sweden (68 degrees 20' N, 18 degrees 47' E). We analysed biological proxy indicators from both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, including diatoms, pollen and chironomid head capsules, in order to reconstruct regional Holocene climate and the development of the lake and its catchment. During the early Holocene and after 2500 cal B.P., Fragilaria taxa dominated the diatom assemblages, whereas planktonic Cyclotella taxa prevailed during the major part of the Holocene (7800-2300 cal B.P.), indicating the importance of the pelagic habitat for diatom assemblage composition. The planktonic diatoms appeared at the same time as Alnus became established in the catchment, probably altering nutrient availability and catchment stability. The pollen record is dominated by mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa) pollen throughout the Holocene, but high percentage abundances of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) pollen suggest the presence of a mixed pine-birch forest during the mid-Holocene (6800-2300 cal B.P.). Head capsules of Tanytarsini and Psectrocladius dominated the chironomid assemblage composition throughout the Holocene, in combination with Corynocera ambigua after 2300 cal B.P. A quantitative, diatom-based reconstruction of mean July air temperature indicated a relatively cold temperature during the early Holocene (9000-8000 cal B.P.) and after ca. 2300 cal B.P., whereas the mid-Holocene period is characterised by stable and warm temperatures. The overall patterns of Holocene climate and environmental conditions are similarly described by all biological proxy-indicators, suggesting relatively warm conditions during the mid-Holocene (ca. 7800-2300 cal B.P.), with a subsequent colder climate after 2300 cal B.P. However, the onset and magnitude of the inferred changes differ slightly among the proxies, illustrating different responses to lake development phases, land-uplift, and climate forcing (e.g., insolation patterns) during the Holocene in northern Sweden.

Under a warming scenario many permanent inland water bodies in the Mediterranean region have become temporary ones, so the persistence of submerged macrophytes depends on the timely production of drought- resistant propagules. Phenological research measures the timing of ecological processes and allows the consequences of disturbances such as climate change to be evaluated. 2. Among macrophytes, the charophytes are widely distributed benthic macroalgae and are particularly sensitive to environmental variations. The systems in which they live constitute valuable, threatened, and protected habitats ( European Habitats Directive code 3140). 3. This study established a methodological basis for determining which environmental drivers trigger the sexual reproductive phenology of charophytes. For the first time, circular statistics were applied to describe and compare seasonal patterns for submerged macrophytes. 4. Over a period of 2 years, three charophyte species growing in two Mediterranean brackish ponds were monitored. Most of the sexual reproduction occurred during spring and summer, including the production of drought- resistant propagules, before the harshest conditions arrived. Each species showed a distinctive phenological pattern, according to specific breeding systems, life cycles, and environmental tolerances and requirements. Deeper conditions and higher salinities delayed reproduction. Different rainfall intensities in autumn produced distinctions between years, as stronger rainfall reduced the salinity stress and stimulated the reproduction of plants. 5. Interacting factors act as cues for charophyte reproduction and cause antagonistic effects on propagule production. Among them, the heat required for each phenophase peak is essential for understanding the phenology of a population and for predicting its long- term persistence. 6. Charophytes appear to be good candidates for tracking climate change in shallow ecosystems. Further phenological studies should consider more species, populations, and long- term observations in order to predict climate- change effects on water bodies, and to develop effective plans for management and conservation. 7. Circular statistics is a potential tool for analysing phenology in the context of global warming, as well as for many other conservation issues.

AB  - Seabirds are thought to be reliable, real-time indicators of forage fish availability and the climatic and biotic factors affecting pelagic food webs in marine ecosystems. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that temporal trends and interannual variability in seabird indicators reflect simultaneously occurring bottom-up (climatic) and competitor (pink salmon) forcing of food webs. To test this hypothesis, we derived multivariate seabird indicators for the Bering Sea-Aleutian Island (BSAI) ecosystem and related them to physical and biological conditions known to affect pelagic food webs in the ecosystem. We examined covariance in the breeding biology of congeneric pelagic gulls (kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla and R. brevirostris) and auks (murres Uria aalge and U. lomvia), all of which are abundant and well-studied in the BSAI. At the large ecosystem scale, kittiwake and murre breeding success and phenology (hatch dates) covaried among congeners, so data could be combined using multivariate techniques, but patterns of response differed substantially between the genera. While data from all sites (n = 5) in the ecosystem could be combined, the south eastern Bering Sea shelf colonies (St. George, St. Paul, and Cape Peirce) provided the strongest loadings on indicators, and hence had the strongest influence on modes of variability. The kittiwake breeding success mode of variability, dominated by biennial variation, was significantly related to both climatic factors and potential competitor interactions. The murre indicator mode was interannual and only weakly related to the climatic factors measured. The kittiwake phenology indicator mode of variability showed multi-year periods ("stanzas") of late or early breeding, while the murre phenology indicator showed a trend towards earlier timing. Ocean climate relationships with the kittiwake breeding success indicator suggest that early-season (winter-spring) environmental conditions and the abundance of pink salmon affect the pelagic food webs that support these seabirds in the BSAI ecosystem.

AB  - Ammonia-oxidizing organisms play an important role in wetland water purification and nitrogen cycling. We determined soil nitrification rates and investigated the seasonal and spatial distributions of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in three freshwater wetlands by using specific primers targeting the amoA genes of AOA and AOB and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The nitrifying potentials of wetland soils ranged from 1.4 to 4.0 mu g g(-1) day(-1). The specific rates of ammonia oxidation activity by AOA and AOB at the Bee Hollow wetlands were 1.9 fmol NH3 cell(-1) day(-1) and 36.8 fmol NH3 cell(-1) day(-1), respectively. Soil nitrification potential was positively correlated with both archaeal and bacterial amoA abundance. However, the gene copies of AOA amoA were higher than those of AOB amoA by at least an order of magnitude in wetland soils and water in both summer and winter over a three year study period. AOB were more sensitive to low temperature than AOA. The amoA gene copy ratios of AOA to AOB in top soils (0-10 cm) ranged from 19 +/- 4 to 100 +/- 11 among the wetland sites. In contrast, the ratio of the wetland boundary soil was 10 +/- 2, which was significantly lower than that of the wetland soils (P < 0.001). The NH4+-N concentrations in wetland water were lower than 2 mg/L throughout the study. The results suggest that ammonium concentration is a major factor influencing AOA and AOB population in wetlands, although other factors such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and soil organic matter are involved. AOA are more persistent and more abundant than AOB in the nutrient-depleted oligotrophic wetlands. Therefore, ratio of AOA amoA gene copies to AOB amoA gene copies may serve as a new biological indicator for wetland condition assessment and wetland restoration applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Climate change leverages landscape transformations and exerts variable pressure on natural environments and rural systems. Earlier studies outlined how Mediterranean Europe has become a global hotspot of climate warming and land use change. The present work assumes the olive tree, a typical Mediterranean crop, as a candidate bioclimatic indicator, delineating the latent impact of climate aridity on traditional cropping systems at the northern range of the biogeographical distribution of the olive tree. Since the olive tree follows a well-defined latitude gradient with a progressive decline in both frequency and density moving toward the north, we considered Italy as an appropriate case to investigate how climate change may (directly or indirectly) influence the spatial distribution of this crop. By adopting an exploratory approach grounded in the quali-quantitative analysis of official statistics, the present study investigates long-term changes over time in the spatial distribution of the olive tree surface area in Northern Italy, a region traditionally considered outside the ecological range of the species because of unsuitable climate conditions. Olive tree cultivated areas increased in Northern Italy, especially in flat districts and upland areas, while they decreased in Central and Southern Italy under optimal climate conditions, mostly because of land abandonment. The most intense expansion of the olive tree surface area in Italy was observed in the northern region between 1992 and 2000 and corresponded with the intensification of winter droughts during the late 1980s and the early 1990s and local warming since the mid-1980s. Assuming the intrinsic role of farmers in the expansion of the olive tree into the suboptimal land of Northern Italy, the empirical results of our study suggest how climate aridity and local warming may underlie the shift toward the north in the geographical range of the olive tree in the Mediterranean Basin. We finally discussed the implications of the olive range shift as a part of a possible landscape scenario for a more arid future.

AB  - Background The contamination of the aquatic environment of urban rivers with industrial wastewater has affected the abiotic conditions and biological activities of the trophic levels of the ecosystem, particularly sediments. However, most current research about microorganism in urban aquatic environments has focused on indicator bacteria related to feces and organic pollution. Meanwhile, they ignored the interactions among microorganisms. To deeply understand the impact of industrial contamination on microbial community, we study the bacterial community structure and diversity in river sediments under the influence of different types of industrial pollution by Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing technology and conduct a more detailed analysis of microbial community structure through co-occurrence networks. Results The overall community composition and abundance of individual bacterial groups differed between samples. In addition, redundancy analysis indicated that the structure of the bacterial community in river sediments was influenced by a variety of environmental factors. TN, TP, TOC and metals (Cu, Zn and Cd) were the most important driving factors that determined the bacterial community in urban river sediments (P < 0.01). According to PICRUSt analysis, the bacterial communities in different locations had similar overall functional profiles. It is worth noting that the 15 functional genes related to xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were the most abundant in the same location. The non-random assembly patterns of bacterial composition in different types of industrially polluted sediments were determined by a co-occurrence network. Environmental conditions resulting from different industrial pollutants may play an important role in determining their co-occurrence patterns of these bacterial taxa. Among them, the bacterial taxa involved in carbon and nitrogen cycles in module I were relatively abundant, and the bacterial taxa in module II were involved in the repair of metal pollution. Conclusions Our data indicate that long-term potential interactions between different types of industrial pollution and taxa collectively affect the structure of the bacterial community in urban river sediments.

AB  - Future climate change scenarios predict that warming may increase drought stress over northern China, causing ecological deterioration and food insecurity. Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator to understand the response of ecosystem productivity to water availability. At present we lack a clear picture of how ecosystem WUE responds to drought magnitude across a broad range of vegetation types and environments. Here, we applied Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite images and meteorological data to obtain a regional estimation of gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) during the period of 2000-2014. We then investigated the relationships between WUE (GPP/ET) and drought magnitude (based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, SPEI) for different climate zones and biomes. The mean annual WUE decreased with increasing Aridity Index (AI) in arid regions. However, the relationships between WUE and AI followed a logarithmic function across semi-arid and humid regions. In hype-arid, sub-humid and humid regions, a drying trend resulted in increased WUE. Contrasting responses of WUE to drought were found in arid and semi-arid regions. The negative effect of drought that caused decreased WUE was most significant in the transition zone between arid and semi-arid lands. Besides, the relationships between relative changes in WUE and drought magnitude followed a logarithmic function of SPEI. Severe and extreme drought resulted in WUE reductions regardless of different hydroclimatic conditions and biomes. The ecosystem resistant to drought can be evaluated by the magnitude of WUE reductions during drought, together with the WUE-SPEI correlations. Forests were most resistant to drought, followed by croplands, grasslands, and deserts. Differences in the ecosystem resistance to water stress were attributed to diversities in drought survival traits and strategies. Given that hydroclimatic conditions break down ecosystem resistance under severe and extreme drought, we highlight an urgent need to formulate adaptation strategies aimed at reducing drought risk in the eastern and central portions of northern China.

AB  - Metals are usually present as mixtures at low concentrations in aquatic ecosystems. However, the toxicity and sub-lethal effects of metal mixtures on organisms are still poorly addressed in environmental risk assessment. Here we investigated the biochemical and behavioural responses of Ganunarus fossarum to Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb and Zn tested individually or in mixture (M2X) at concentrations twice the levels of environmental quality standards (EQSs) from the European Water Framework Directive. The same metal mixture was also tested with concentrations equivalent to EQSs (M1X), thus in a regulatory context, as EQSs are proposed to protect aquatic biota. For each exposure condition, mortality, locomotion, respiration and enzymatic activities involved in digestive metabolism and moult were monitored over a 120 h exposure period. Multi-metric variations were summarized by the integrated biomarker response index (IBR). Mono-metallic exposures shed light on biological alterations occurring at environmental exposure levels in gammarids and depending on the considered metal and gender. As regards mixtures, biomarkers were altered for both M2X and M1X. However, no additive or synergistic effect of metals was observed comparing to mono-metallic exposures. Indeed, bioaccumulation data highlighted competitive interactions between metals in M2X, decreasing subsequently their internalisation and toxicity. IBR values indicated that the health of gammarids was more impacted by MIX than M2X, because of reduced competitions and enhanced uptakes of metals for the mixture at lower, EQS-like concentrations. Models using bioconcentration data obtained from mono-metallic exposures generated successful predictions of global toxicity both for M1X and M2X. We conclude that sub-lethal effects of mixtures identified by the multi-biomarker approach can lead to disturbances in population dynamics of gammarids. Although IBR-based models offer promising lines of enquiry to predict metal mixture toxicity, further studies are needed to confirm their predictive quality on larger ranges of metallic combinations before their use in field conditions.

AB  - Coastal dunes provide important ecosystem services and are susceptible to human disturbance such as vehicle traffic and human trampling. Notwithstanding, on several Australian beaches dunes serves as camping areas, where camping sites are located on the primary dunes landwards of the foredunes. Because these activities have the potential to impact on the biota of the foredunes directly adjoining the camping zones, sustainable management of dunes for multiple uses requires that putative impacts are identified. Consequently, we quantified: (1) effects of dune camping on the vegetation in the foredunes abutting the camping zones, (2) ghost crab (Ocypode cordimana) abundance, distribution, body size, and body condition as biological indicators of human stressors, and (3) the degree to which habitat attributes are correlated with ghost crab abundance. Two percent of the foredune surface was disturbed by human activity (vehicle tracks, trampling, dog prints, litter). Camping in the primary dunes had some minor effects on the vegetation of the foredunes, but widespread changes in plant assemblages were not detected. Ghost crabs were attracted to camp sites, significantly changing their distribution across the dune field and increasing their body condition near camp sites presumably a trophic subsidy from food scraps. Except for vegetation height which had a positive influence on crab density, there were no other strong and consistent predictors of ghost crab density either in terms of physical habitat attributes (e.g. dune width and height) or vegetation characteristics (e.g. plant cover, diversity). Because coastal managers must increasingly reconcile multiple uses of the environment with its protection, robust data on the type, extent and magnitude of impacts are critical to formulate efficient management strategies for dunes. Monitoring the efficacy of such strategies requires robust indicators, and we show that ghost crabs may be good candidate species for this. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a novel method for diagnosing the gradual deterioration of gears using modulation signal bispectrum (MSB) and vibration measurements. A nonlinear model was derived to understand dynamic forces applied to gears that are excited by quadratic terms, e.g., shaft rotating speeds and gear meshing frequencies. Owing to its sensitivity to those quadratic terms, MSB is powerful in recovering less noisy condition related features from the measured vibration signals, e.g., gear meshing and multiples of shaft rotating speed. This allows a more pronounced representation of gear dynamic forces and makes it more effective for detecting early gear deterioration. The proposed method was verified through a run-to-failure test based on a helical gearbox system. The results show small gears at low-speed stages deteriorate faster and fail at 838 hours. This was because they prone to wear more severe due to poorer lubrication conditions compared with gears at high-speed stages. Moreover, fault detectability of the developed MSB-based method outperforms that of time synchronous averaging (TSA). Compared to TSA, clearer signs of early gear deterioration were captured using MSB, which makes it a more powerful tool for monitoring the condition of gearboxes.

AB  - To gain better understanding of rates of decay of wooden check dams with different structures under different climate conditions, several dams of this type were examined under different environmental conditions over a 3 to 5-year period post-construction. Because a linear relationship was found between the mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma) of pilodyn penetration depth, mean penetration depth was taken as the indicator of deterioration, and relationships with check dam structural features and climate data recorded by AMEDAS were investigated. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that temperature, climate index (CI) computed from rain days, warmth index computed from daily and annual mean air temperature, and altitude were the climate variables with the most effect on the rate of decay. With regard to dam structural features, factors such as specific discharge rate, water through width, dam length, and dam height had the most effect. Accordingly, in an effort to summarize the effects of climatic conditions and structural features, CI, altitude, and dam height were extracted as the most significant explanatory variables, and a formula for prediction of mu was obtained for each factor for up to 5 years post construction. The results showed that by taking into consideration regional conditions and calculating CI values from AMEDAS data, it is possible to predict the extent of decay of wooden check dams.

AB  - The vegetation outlook (VegOut) is a geospatial tool for predicting general vegetation condition patterns across large areas. VegOut predicts a standardized seasonal greenness (SSG) measure, which represents a general indicator of relative vegetation health. VegOut predicts SSG values at multiple time steps (two to six weeks into the future) based on the analysis of "historical patterns" (i.e., patterns at each 1 km grid cell and time of the year) of satellite, climate, and oceanic data over an 18-year period (1989 to 2006). The model underlying VegOut capitalizes on historical climate-vegetation interactions and ocean-climate teleconnections (such as El Nino and the Southern Oscillation, ENSO) expressed over the 18-year data record and also considers several environmental characteristics (e. g., land use/cover type and soils) that influence vegetation's response to weather conditions to produce 1 km maps that depict future general vegetation conditions. VegOut provides regional-level vegetation monitoring capabilities with local-scale information (e. g., county to sub-county level) that can complement more traditional remote sensing-based approaches that monitor "current" vegetation conditions. In this paper, the VegOut approach is discussed and a case study over the central United States for selected periods of the 2008 growing season is presented to demonstrate the potential of this new tool for assessing and predicting vegetation conditions.

AB  - Gross morphological and histological examinations of gonads were used to assess seasonal and age-related reproductive condition of Calomys musculinus captured in cultivated areas of the pampa of central Argentina. All females >5 weeks of age showed evidence of reproductive activity during the spring and summer; 86% of similar-aged males had fully mature gonads during the same period. The male reproductive system appeared to be most sensitive to the unfavorable environmental conditions of autumn and winter, yet a low level of reproduction was observed throughout the winter and was attributable to animals in older age classes that did not undergo gonadal regression. Commonly used external indicators of sexual maturity were relatively poor measures of underlying physiological conditions: 80% of mature, nulliparous females captured throughout the year had closed vaginal orifices and 19% of those with past or present pregnancies were nonperforate; 10% of fully mature males (mostly captured in winter) had nonscrotal testes. Aging by eye-lens weight showed that the large number of individuals of low body mass that were captured during the winter did not represent autumn and winter recruitment, but were older animals that had grown slowly or lost mass in response to unfavorable environmental conditions.

AB  - Human beings may affect the welfare of fish through fisheries, aquaculture and a number of other activities. There is no agreement on just how to weigh the concern for welfare of fish against the human interests involved, but ethical frameworks exist that suggest how this might be approached.
   Different definitions of animal welfare focus on an animal's condition, on its subjective experience of that condition and/or on whether it can lead a natural life. These provide different, legitimate, perspectives, but the approach taken in this paper is to focus on welfare as the absence of suffering.
   An unresolved and controversial issue in discussions about animal welfare is whether non-human animals exposed to adverse experiences such as physical injury or confinement experience what humans would call suffering. The neocortex, which in humans is an important part of the neural mechanism that generates the subjective experience of suffering, is lacking in fish and non-mammalian animals, and it has been argued that its absence in fish indicates that fish cannot suffer. A strong alternative view, however, is that complex animals with sophisticated behaviour, such as fish, probably have the capacity for suffering, though this may be different in degree and kind from the human experience of this state.
   Recent empirical studies support this view and show that painful stimuli are, at least, strongly aversive to fish. Consequently, injury or experience of other harmful conditions is a cause for concern in terms of welfare of individual fish. There is also growing evidence that fish can experience fear-like states and that they avoid situations in which they have experienced adverse conditions.
   Human activities that potentially compromise fish welfare include anthropogenic changes to the environment, commercial fisheries, recreational angling, aquaculture, ornamental fish keeping and scientific research. The resulting harm to fish welfare is a cost that must be minimized and weighed against the benefits of the activity concerned.
   Wild fish naturally experience a variety of adverse conditions, from attack by predators or conspecifics to starvation or exposure to poor environmental conditions. This does not make it acceptable for humans to impose such conditions on fish, but it does suggest that fish will have mechanisms to cope with these conditions and reminds us that pain responses are in some cases adaptive (for example, suppressing feeding when injured).
   In common with all vertebrates, fish respond to environmental challenges with a series of adaptive neuro-endocrine adjustments that are collectively termed the stress response. These in turn induce reversible metabolic and behavioural changes that make the fish better able to overcome or avoid the challenge and are undoubtedly beneficial, in the short-term at least.
   In contrast, prolonged activation of the stress response is damaging and leads to immuno-suppression, reduced growth and reproductive dysfunction. Indicators associated with the response to chronic stress (physiological endpoints, disease status and behaviour) provide a potential source of information on the welfare status of a fish. The most reliable assessment of well-being will be obtained by examining a range of informative measures and statistical techniques are available that enable several such measures to be combined objectively.
   A growing body of evidence tells us that many human activities can harm fish welfare, but that the effects depend on the species and life-history stage concerned and are also context-dependent. For example, in aquaculture, adverse effects related to stocking density may be eliminated if good water quality is maintained. At low densities, bad water quality may be less likely to arise whereas social interactions may cause greater welfare problems.
   A number of key differences between fish and birds and mammals have important implications for their welfare. Fish do not need to fuel a high body temperature, so the effects of food deprivation on welfare are not so marked. For species that live naturally in large shoals, low rather than high densities may be harmful. On the other hand, fish are in intimate contact with their environment through the huge surface area of their gills, so they are vulnerable to poor water quality and water borne pollutants.
   Extrapolation between taxa is dangerous and general frameworks for ensuring welfare in other vertebrate animals need to be modified before they can be usefully applied to fish.
   The scientific study of fish welfare is at an early stage compared with work on other vertebrates and a great deal of what we need to know is yet to be discovered. It is clearly the case that fish, though different from birds and mammals, however, are sophisticated animals, far removed from unfeeling creatures with a 15 s memory of popular misconception. A heightened appreciation of these points in those who exploit fish and in those who seek to protect them would go a long way towards improving fish welfare.

AB  - The paper considers indicators of the dynamics of plant communities with Paeonia tenuifolia before and after fire impact. Studies were conducted in the Khvalynsky National Park (forest-steppe zone of Russia) in 2008-2018. The authors conducted a complex study in burned and unburned plant communities. An assessment of the effects of fire impact and the development of a post-fire action plan were considered in the Protected Area. The plant community Paeonia tenuifolia + Calamagrostis epigejos + Adonis vernalis - Potentilla volgarica burned down in 2009. The plant community Paeonia tenuifolia + Stipa pennata + Adonis vernalis - Anemone sylvestris was unburned. To characterise plant communities with Paeonia tenuifolia and its coenopopulations, we used standard geobotanical description methods. Sixty seven vascular plant species were part of the post-fire phytocoenosis. Of them, 14 species are included in the Red Data Book of the Saratov region. Changes in the post-fire plant community have occurred in the following order: 1) Paeonia tenuifolia + Calamagrostis epigejos + Adonis vernalis - Stipa pennata (in 2008) -> 2) Paeonia tenuifolia + Elymus repens + Stipa pennata + Adonis vernalis + Thalictrum simplex (in 2010) -> 3) Paeonia tenuifolia - Stipa pennata - Calamagrostis epigejos + Festuca valesiaca + Phleum pratense + Poa bulbosa + Prunus tenella (in 2011) -> 4) Paeonia tenuifolia + Adonis vernalis + Stipa pennata (in 2015, 2017, 2018). After the fire influence on a plant community, the following changes took place: 1) annuals and ruderal plant species appeared and increased their abundance; 2) the ratio of dominant species has changed. In 2012-2018, the phytocenotic role of Calamagrostis epigejos decreased, while the coverage and abundance of Stipa pennata increased at the same period. The abundance dynamics of Paeonia tenuifolia decreased in 2010, while in 2015-2018, its value gradually increased. The species richness of the post-pyrogenic plant community varied from 20 species in the first post-fire year to 38 species in the last study year. In the first post-fire year, the families Poaceae (six species), Leguminosae plants (three species), Rosaceae plants (three species) occupied the leading positions. During the post-pyrogenic succession, the dominant position of the listed families was not changing. Species of Compositae, Poaceae, Ranunculaceae families prevailed in the unburned plant community. Steppe plants dominated in the post-fire plant community: Stipa pennata, Adonis vernalis, and Paeonia tenuifolia. The leading ecologic-coenotic groups were steppe plants (70%), meadow plants (16%), forest plants (5%), and ruderal plants (9%). Weed-steppe plants were indicators of habitat disturbance by human activities. Among weed-steppe plants, there were Arenaria serpyllifolia, Viola rupestris, Erysimum canescens, Verbascum lychnitis. Gradient analysis of environmental conditions showed that the highest value of the vitality index (IVC = 1.15) corresponds to the best conditions for the growth and survival of the Paeonia tenuifolia population in the post-fire community. In the control site, the vitality index (IVC = 0.85) corresponded to unfavourable conditions for plant development. We studied the age spectra of the natural Paeonia tenuifolia populations in the burned and unburned communities. We showed that both populations were normal, complete, and young. The fire-damaged populations were younger than the populations in the unburned communities.
   We suggest the need of comprehensive monitoring studies to properly assess the fire effects and subsequent management actions for the vegetation restoration after fire influence.

AB  - To establish the biological characteristics of growth and development of plants and the formation of planting material of miscanthus under conditions of drip irrigation. Methods. Field, laboratory, visual, measuring, weight, mathematical-statistical. Results. Represented the effectiveness of cultivation of planting material of miscanthus under conditions of drip irrigation without the application of Maxi Marin absorbent and when it is added to the period of planting of the rhizome. High survival of miscanthus plants in transplanting them from growing to open ground is established. In the conditions of drip irrigation it was 4.9% (without absorbent) and 3.3% (for making absorbent) more than without irrigation was. Drip irrigation significantly influenced the plant height and the formation of stems, while the introduction of absorbent was observed only a tendency of increase of these indicators. Introducing absorbent in rainfed conditions has resulted in a substantial increase in the content of free water in the leaves of miscanthus. Drip irrigation has contributed to intensive growth of not only land mass, and the mass of roots that provided a significant increase in the yield of planting material - the rhizome. The average for years of research weight uterine rhizome in drip irrigation was greater in control (without absorbent) by 62.8%, or 917,9 g than the absorbent application, respectively, the 61.8% or 912,7 g compared to irrigated conditions. Conclusions. The use of an absorbent as in rainfed conditions without irrigation, and in drip irrigation did not provide the increase of biometric parameters of the plants, weight of roots and, consequently, the output of planting material - the rhizome. The increase of these indicators was significantly affected only drip irrigation. In drip irrigation without any absorbent and when it is added from one of the ovaries rhizomes obtained mass was 15-20 g in 1.5 and weighing 25-30 g in 1.4 times more compared to the cultivation of ovaries without irrigation.

Tropical epiphytes are susceptible to climatic changes, as evidenced by documented population declines, range contractions, and range shifts; however, physiological changes in individual plants may also be indicative of deteriorating climate conditions. Consequently, physiological analyses of tropical epiphytes whose natural habitats are constrained by climatic conditions are warranted to evaluate their responses to potential changes in these conditions, to assess their vulnerability, and to guide conservation actions.
   Methodology. Here we investigate photosynthetic processes in Puerto Rican Lepanthes species, a group of Neotropical epiphytic orchids, as a model system to determine whether altered microclimate conditions elicit adverse physiological responses. We tested for differences in chlorophyll fluorescence, measured as F-v/F-m, as an indication of plant stress under modified temperature, humidity, and air vapor pressure deficit.
   Pivotal results. Mean F-v/F-m was positively correlated with mean relative humidity and negatively correlated with mean temperature and air vapor pressure deficit. Collectively, plants exposed to altered microclimate conditions had significantly lower mean F-v/F-m than plants in unaltered conditions. Plants in altered microclimate conditions were also more likely to exhibit declines in F-v/F-m over time, and they exhibited greater reductions in F-v/F-m over the course of the study.
   Conclusions. Epiphytic plant species such as Lepanthes could exhibit declines in F-v/F-m and experience greater stress in their natural habitats if current warming and drying trends continue as anticipated in Puerto Rico and elsewhere. Declining F-v/F-m is a robust indicator of plant stress, and several studies show that increased stress can promote leaf loss, limit reproduction, and lower survival rates. Thus, analyses of F-v/F-m can be advantageous for monitoring epiphytic orchids and other vulnerable plant species by offering a valuable means for detecting adverse responses to climate change.

AB  - Body condition is an important determinant of ecological fitness but is difficult to measure in field studies of live animals. Live mass and subcutaneous fat are often used as proxies for body condition and related to fitness. We investigated the relationship between blood-chemistry parameters and live mass and back-fat thickness and assessed their usefulness as predictors of ecological fitness in a wild arctic ungulate population, Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus). Female reindeer were sampled in late winter between 1995 and 2002 and concentrations of blood parameters were related to subsequent survival and successful calving. There was marked annual variation in all blood parameters, live mass, and back-fat thickness, reflecting variation in weather and food availability. At the individual level; variation in blood-parameter concentrations was not closely related to variation in live mass or back-fat thickness, instead reflecting shorter term nutritional status. Blood parameters could therefore provide useful additional information, enhancing the predictive power of fitness models based on live mass. The urea:creatinine ratio significantly improved adult survival models, while beta-hydroxybutyric acid and creatinine concentrations were significant predictors of calving success. The applications for blood parameters in ecological investigations look promising and should be tested more widely in other field studies.

AB  - The overall predictability of smoke exposure indicators and the importance of different influencing factors were assessed in a cross-sectional study (n = 144), using multiple linear regression and bivariate correlation analyses. Respiratory CO, and plasma nicotine and cotinine concentrations were measured before and after smoking, for lip or holder smoking, and natural or standardized (30 puffs) puffing. The prediction of smoke exposure measures varied considerably across sampling times, smoking conditions, and dependent variables. The variance of plasma cotinine and nicotine were predictable to a considerable extent (30%; 19-41 %) by cigarette yield, consumption and self-reported inhalation, whereas respiratory CO was less predictable (15-27%). Generally, consumption was the most important predictor, surpassed by nicotine yield for post-smoking plasma nicotine. Smoke exposure from a single smoking period could be predicted to a variable degree (CO, 11-42%; nicotine, 33-54%) by a subset of smoker's sex, cigarette yield, self-reported inhalation and puffing characteristics. The highest prediction was found under standardized smoking conditions (30 puffs through a holder), the lowest under natural smoking conditions. The best subset of predictors, especially with respect to puffing parameters, was found to vary considerably across smoking conditions and dependent variables.

AB  - Real-time monitoring of water reuse systems ensures the production of high quality water to protect human health at the point-of-use. In this study, several online real-time sensors were utilized to monitor effluent from a wastewater fed laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) under natural and simulated failure conditions. These simulated failures included adding reactor mixed liquor to emulate a membrane breach, and spiking MS2 bacteriophage into the reactor to create a high viral load, which might be observed during an outbreak. The CANARY event detection software was used to analyze sensor data and report changes in water quality that might be indicative of poor system behavior. During simulated failure conditions, CANARY reported 20 alarms, accurately detecting each failure. During natural operating conditions, 219 alarms were produced and 189 were attributed to known events (e.g., system and sensor maintenance). The remaining alarms (23) during natural operating conditions were considered to have an unknown cause. However, 13 of those had signal deviations similar to known events, but could not be definitively linked to a source. The results of this study suggest that real-time monitoring in conjunction with CANARY analysis may be useful as an early warning system for monitoring the effluent of water reuse systems, and may help to quickly identify treatment malfunctions or other abnormal conditions.

AB  - A post-occupancy evaluation (POE) of 12 green and 12 conventional office buildings across Canada and the northern United States was conducted. Occupants (N = 2545) completed an online questionnaire related to environmental satisfaction, job satisfaction and organizational commitment, health and well-being, environmental attitudes, and commuting. In each building on-site physical measurements at a sample of workstations (N= 974) were taken, including: thermal conditions, air quality, acoustics, lighting, workstation size, ceiling height, window access and shading, and surface finishes. Green buildings exhibited superior performance compared with similar conventional buildings. Better outcomes included: environmental satisfaction, satisfaction with thermal conditions, satisfaction with the view to the outside, aesthetic appearance, less disturbance from heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) noise, workplace image, night-time sleep quality, mood, physical symptoms, and reduced number of airborne particulates. A variety of physical features led to improved occupant outcomes across all buildings, including: conditions associated with speech privacy, lower background noise levels, higher light levels, greater access to windows, conditions associated with thermal comfort, and fewer airborne particulates. Green building rating systems might benefit from further attention in several areas, including: credits related to acoustic performance, a greater focus on reducing airborne particulates, enhanced support for the interdisciplinary design process and development of POE protocols.

AB  - Infrared thermal imaging technology plays an important role in evaluating the operating condition of electrical equipment. This article focuses on two critical environmental factors, namely, wind speed and ambient temperature. They interfere with infrared detection and fault diagnosis by affecting the actual temperature of the fault area. In this article, we use the principle of heat transfer to explore the affected conditions and the changing laws of diagnostic indicators. We provide a solution for diagnosing the live equipment fault area after compensating for the infrared temperature. Both the simulation and experimental results show that the method can obtain the temperature of the equipment fault area under different environmental conditions for different electrical equipment failures when they meet the temperature compensation conditions. The method can eliminate the influences of wind speed and ambient temperature on the results of infrared temperature measurement and achieve a unified solution to the problem of multiple types of electrical equipment. This breaks through the barriers of infrared temperature measurement applications limited by the on-site environmental conditions. The proposed method can serve to further improve the existing evaluation standards. The results of the article are useful for troubleshooting equipment and improving the accuracy of the infrared diagnosis of live equipment.

AB  - The influence of sexual dimorphism on commercial-biological traits of the most widespread poplar of the world Populus tremula L. in the Central forest-steppe of the European territory of Russia was studied. The analysis was made of the distribution of male and female clones in general, the effects of humidity, the richness of the soil, and surrounding vegetation on their productive capacity as well as core rot damage. The study presents survey results of 620 aspen plots spread out over an area of 823 hectares as well as more detailed data obtained from 3 pairs of test plots in which the indicators of male and female aspen stands were compared under identical or similar conditions. The study showed that the area of male aspen in the studied region is 4.5 times larger than that of females. The former prevail in drier and less fertile conditions while females gravitate towards more favorable growing conditions. The comparison of the productive capacity of male and female clones of the same age class, growing in identical or similar growing conditions showed that the height, diameter, and volume of the trunks were higher in male trees. Female aspen trees were less affected by core rot in the best conditions of growth, and male ones were more resistant at the worse ones.

AB  - The adaptation of green building rating systems (GBRS) as tools for providing a reliable evaluation of specific built environments is becoming increasingly significant, since factors such as regional climatic conditions may hinder the direct application of any GBRS in its non-adapted form. Energy efficiency is one of the central categories for evaluating building performance, although the category is weighted differently by leading GBRS, such as the Building Research Establishment Assessment Method, and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. Moreover, varying climatic conditions in different counties can affect building performance and result in different levels of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This study focuses on the built environment of Saudi Arabia and seeks to improve the accuracy of its newly established GBRS, namely the Saudi Environmental Assessment Method. After reviewing various existing international GBRS, the study finds that they have a deficiency in their building performance ratio and/or matrix that indicates the differences resulting from various climatic conditions. This can engender unfair building assessments when comparing between two buildings in two different climatic zones. Therefore, it is essential to recognize to what degree the climatic conditions can affect a building's energy performance within the Saudi Arabian context. In order to address this issue, which is the research question of the study, a critical analysis is conducted that reviews international assessment methods and, employing the building simulation tool IES-VE, assesses three distinct climatic zones: (a) the hot arid climate of Riyadh, (b) the hot humid climate of Jeddah, and (c) the mild hot mountainous climate of Al-Baha. In total, 30 typical building models, 10 in each zone, are subjected to a sensitivity analysis, and the results reveal that the different climatic conditions in Saudi Arabia have a significant effect on building performance. The study therefore concludes developing a climatic conditions ratio/matrix is imperative for enhancing the accuracy of the building assessment method employed.

AB  - Bathing beaches are monitored for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) to protect swimmers from unsafe conditions. However, FIB assays take similar to 24 h and water quality conditions can change dramatically in that time, so unsafe conditions cannot presently be identified in a timely manner. Statistical, data-driven predictive models use information on environmental conditions (i.e., rainfall, turbidity) to provide nowcasts of FIB concentrations. Their ability to predict real time FIB concentrations can make them more accurate at identifying unsafe conditions than the current method of using day or older FIB measurements. Predictive models are used in the Great Lakes, Hong Kong, and Scotland for beach management, but they are presently not used in California - the location of some of the world's most popular beaches. California beaches are unique as point source pollution has generally been mitigated, the summer bathing season receives little to no rainfall, and in situ measurements of turbidity and salinity are not readily available. These characteristics may make modeling FIB difficult, as many current FIB models rely heavily on rainfall or salinity. The current study investigates the potential for FIB models to predict water quality at a quintessential California Beach: Santa Monica Beach. This study compares the performance of five predictive models, multiple linear regression model, binary logistic regression model, partial least square regression model, artificial neural network, and classification tree, to predict concentrations of summertime fecal coliform and enterococci concentrations. Past measurements of bacterial concentration, storm drain condition, and tide level are found to be critical factors in the predictive models. The models perform better than the current beach management method. The classification tree models perform the best; for example they correctly predict 42% of beach postings due to fecal coliform exceedances during model validation, as compared to 28% by the current method. Artificial neural network is the second best model which minimizes the number of incorrect beach postings. The binary logistic regression model

AB  - Stormwater biofilters are used to attenuate the flow and volume of runoff and reduce pollutant loading to aquatic systems. However, the capacity of biofilters to remove microbial contaminants remains inadequate. While biochar has demonstrated promise as an amendment to improve microbial removal in laboratory-scale biofilters, it is uncertain if the results are generalizable to the field. To assess biochar performance in a simulated field setting, sand and biochar-amended sand biofilters were periodically dosed with natural stormwater over a 61-week conditioning phase. Impact of media saturation was assessed by maintaining biofilters with and without a saturated zone. Biochar-amended biofilters demonstrated improved Escherichia coli removal over sand biofilters during the first 31 weeks of conditioning though media type did not impact E. coli removal during the last 30 weeks of conditioning. Presence of a saturated zone was not a significant factor influencing E. coli removal across the entire conditioning phase. Following conditioning, biofilters underwent challenge tests using stormwater spiked with wastewater to assess their capacity to remove wastewater-derived E. coli, enterococci, and male-specific (F+) coliphage. In challenge tests, biochar-amended biofilters demonstrated enhanced removal of all fecal indicators relative to sand biofilters. Additionally, saturated biofilters demonstrated greater removal of fecal indicators than unsaturated biofilters for both media types. Discrepant conclusions from the conditioning phase and challenge tests may be due to variable influent chemistry, dissimilar transport of E. coli indigenous to stormwater and those indigenous to wastewater, and differences in E. coli removal mechanisms between tests. Mobilization tests conducted following challenge tests showed minimal (<2.5%) observable mobilization of fecal indicators, regardless of media type and presence of a saturated zone. While our results emphasize the challenge of translating biochar's performance from the laboratory to the field, findings of this study inform biofilter design to remove microbial contaminants from urban stormwater.

AB  - This paper reports on monitoredSuaeda salsaspectral response to salt conditions in coastal wetlands, using spectral measurements and remotely sensed algorithms.Suaeda salsaseedlings were collected from the Dafeng Elk National Nature Reserve (DENNR) in Jiangsu Province, China. We treated 21Suaeda salsaseedlings planted in pots with 7 different salt concentrations (n = 3 for each concentration) to assess their response to varying salt conditions. Various plant growth indicators, including chlorophyll content, fresh weight, dry weight, and canopy hyperspectral reflectance, were measured. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc multiple comparisons of least-significant difference (LSD) were used to explore the physiological indicators of sensitivity to salt treatment. Red edge parameters and spectral reflectance indices were used to analyze spectral response to salt conditions and to investigate the potential for remotely sensing physiological parameters which are sensitive to salt conditions. The results indicated that among these physiological indicators, the total chlorophyll content differed significantly with salt conditions, being highest at 50 mmol/L, whereas the differences observed for the morphological parameters were highest at 200 mmol/L. In addition, new vegetation indices were significantly more responsive to salt concentrations than were traditional red edge parameters. The two vegetation indices, D-854/D(792)and (D-792- D-854)/(D-792+ D-854), were the most sensitive to the total chlorophyll content, and these also strongly correlated with salt concentrations. An analysis of the responses of plant growth indicators to salt treatment showed that soil having a salt concentration of 50 similar to 200 mmol/L is most suitable for the growth ofSuaeda salsa. These results suggest the potential for using remote sensing to effectively interpret the causes of salt-induced spectral changes inSuaeda salsa. This methodology also provides a new reference for the inversion model of estimating the total chlorophyll content ofSuaeda salsaunder different salt concentrations in similar coastal wetlands, whether in China or elsewhere.

AB  - Climate change, the increasing variability of weather conditions and more often manifestation of extreme weather phenomena in Ukraine negatively affect the comfort of life, health, working capacity and mortality of the population.
   Evaluation of the population's sensitivity towards the new climatic conditions and the establishment of tendencies in the distribution of comfortable and uncomfortable weather periods during the year were estimated based on the calculation of equivalent-effective temperatures (EET) according to the Missenard's formula by using observation data from meteostations in the Kyiv region.
   A certain shift on a scale was established from a subcomfortable weather conditions in this region towards a more comfortable one for the period 1971-2018. However, the situation is becoming more complicated due to the increase in frequency of extreme temperatures in warm season, especially in summer, and significant variability in cold season (thermal and cold waves).
   Analysis of the periodical observations for meteorological parameters (surface air temperature, air humidity and wind speed) from 9 meteostations for the period 2006-2018 has showen that in cold season, against the general tendency to warming, significant variability of weather conditions appeared with an increase in frequency of frosty periods in winter and early spring. In warm period, the situation in the region is ambiguous, so for gradations (6 divided by 12) and lower, there is a general tendency to decrease repeatability, and for gradations above (12 divided by 16) to increase repeatability, which is associated with the appearing of heat waves.
   A possible scenario of the repeatability occurrence of comfortable and uncomfortable weather situations is also proposed for cold and warm periods of the year in the Kyiv region by the middle of the 21st century in the face of further climate change.
   Thus, biometeorological (bioclimatic) indices are effective indicators of the thermal structure of the environment, which surrounds a person, especially in the face of climate change, and their estimations are necessary to use in different spheres - medicine, balneology, ecology, etc.

AB  - Plants prevent uncontrolled water loss by synthesizing, depositing and maintaining a hydrophobic layer over their primary aerial organs-the plant cuticle. Quercus coccifera L. can plastically respond to environmental conditions at the cuticular level. When exposed to hot summer conditions with high vapour-pressure deficit (VPD) and intense solar radiation (Mediterranean atmospheric conditions; MED), this plant species accumulates leaf cuticular waxes even over the stomata, thereby decreasing transpirational water loss. However, under mild summer conditions with moderate VPD and regular solar radiation (temperate atmospheric conditions; TEM), this effect is sharply reduced. Despite the ecophysiological importance of the cuticular waxes of Q. coccifera, the wax composition and its contribution to avoiding uncontrolled dehydration remain unknown. Thus, we determined several leaf traits for plants exposed to both MED and TEM conditions. Further, we qualitatively and quantitatively investigated the cuticular lipid composition by gas chromatography. Finally, we measured the minimum leaf conductance (g(min)) as an indicator of the efficacy of the cuticular transpiration barrier. The MED leaves were smaller, stiffer and contained a higher load of cuticular lipids than TEM leaves. The amounts of leaf cutin and cuticular waxes of MED plants were 1.4 times and 2.6 times higher than that found for TEM plants, respectively. In detail, MED plants produced higher amounts of all compound classes of cuticular waxes, except for the equivalence of alkanoic acids. Although MED leaves contained higher cutin and cuticular wax loads, the g(min) was not different between the two habitats. Our findings suggest that the qualitative accumulation of equivalent cuticular waxes might compensate for the higher wax amount of MED plants, thereby contributing equally to the efficacy of the cuticular transpirational barrier of Q. coccifera. In conclusion, we showed that atmospheric conditions profoundly affect the cuticular lipid composition of Q. coccifera leaves, but do not alter its transpiration barrier properties.

AB  - The nutritional condition of cultured Sagmariasus verreauxi juveniles over the molt and during starvation was investigated by studying their metabolism, bioenergetics of nutrient reserves, and hemolymph biochemistry. Juveniles were shown to downregulate standard metabolic rate by as much as 52% within 14 d during starvation. Hepatopancreas (HP) lipid was prioritized as a source of energy, but this reserve represented only between 1% and 13% of the total measured energy reserve and was used quickly during starvation, especially in the immediate postmolt period when as much as 60% was depleted within 3 d. Abdominal muscle (AM) protein represented between 74% and 90% of the total measured energy reserve in juvenile lobsters, and as much as 40% of available AM protein energy was used over 28 d of starvation after the molt. Carbohydrate reserves represented less than 2% of the measured total energy reserve in fed intermolt lobsters and provided negligible energy during starvation. Eighteen hemolymph parameters were measured to identify a nondestructive biomarker of condition that would reflect accurately the state of energy reserves of the lobster. Among these, the hemolymph Brix index was the most accurate and practical method to predict HP lipid and the total energy content of both the HP and the AM in juvenile S. verreauxi. The Brix index was strongly correlated with hemolymph proteins, triglyceride, cholesterol, calcium, and phosphorus concentrations, as well as lipase activity; all were useful in predicting condition. Electrolytes such as chloride, magnesium, and potassium and metabolites such as glucose and lactate were poor indicators of nutritional condition. Uric acid and the albumin-to-globulin ratio provided complementary information to the Brix index, which may assist in determining nutritional condition of wild juvenile lobsters of unknown intermolt development. This study will greatly assist future ecological studies examining the nutritional condition of juvenile lobsters in the wild, as well as the development of husbandry protocols and feeds for aquaculture.

AB  - A series of biomarkers were identified in the aliphatic and aromatic fractions of the extracts from Late Permian Dalong and Wujiaping formations in Shangsi Section, Northeast Sichuan, South China, on the basis of the analysis of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MC). The dominance of lower-molecular-weight n-alkanes throughout the profile suggests the dominant contribution of algae and bacteria to the organics preserved in the marine section. Wujiaping Formation is characterized by the elevated contribution from algae as well as other photoautotrophs such as photosynthetic bacteria as shown by the molecular ratios of hopanes to steranes or tricyclic terpanes as well as the ratio of pristane (Pr) and phytane (Ph) to C-17 and C-18 n-alkanes. This is in accord with the data from the microscopic measurement on the calcareous algae. In contrast, Dalong Formation is featured by enhanced contribution from bacteria and probably terrestrial organics indicated by the enhanced C-24 tetracyclic terpanes relative to tricyclic terpanes. The two formations also show a distinct discrimination in sedimentary environmental conditions including redox condition and salinity. The anoxic condition was only found in the middle of the Dalong Formation as shown by the ratios of Pr/Ph and dibenzothiophene to phenanthrene, consistent with the reported data of Mo and U. An enhanced salinity indicated by the homohopane index is observed at the shallow Wujiaping Formation. On the basis of the composition of primary productivity and the redox condition, Dalong Formation is proposed, herein, to be potential hydrocarbon source rocks in the study site. It is notable that the topmost end-Permian is characterized by a-large perturbance in both the redox condition and salinity, with oxic conditions being frequently interrupted by short-term anoxia, likely showing a causal relationship with the episodic biotic crisis across the Permian-Triassic boundary.

AB  - Condition and physiological effects of the feed mixtures with different protein contents (23 to 35 %) in five different lines and breeds of carp fry - generation F1, that come from domestic and imported parental carps, were tested. Experiments were caried out under the comparable experimental conditions without presence of natural food with carp fry of the average individual weight: from 6.21 +/- 0.47 to 18.41 +/- 2.67 g. When the feeding experiment had been finished, the fish was exposed to 60 day starvation. Coefficients of condition, protein and fat contents in muscular tissue, glycogen concentration in haepatopancreas, haematocrit value and concentration of total proteins, total lipids and cholesterol in blood plasma were observed in carp fry lines C 656, C 664 and C 667, tested in 1988, and in the lines C 700 and C 701, tested in 1989. Of the lines, tested in 1988, fry of the C 667 line showed good fitness of organism, the worst parameters were obtained for fish of the C 664 line. In 1989 fish of the C 700 line, in which better ability to deposit fat reserves (to 7,87 %) was found, showed better properties. During the complex evaluation of physiological effects of starvation on the organism relatively the tiniest changes in the indicators, observed in fry of the lines C 667 and C 700, were recorded. A loss of glycogen in haepatopancreas was 45.5 % for the whole set of experimental fish and a loss of fat was 51.5 %. The values of coefficients of condition decreased on average by 15.7 %. By lowering fat content in muscular substance below 1 %, protein content in muscular substance of fry decreased by 37 % in the lines C 656 and C 664. The extreme conditions of starvation had unfavourable effect on the indicators of haemogram, haematocrit value considerably decreased. The results obtained will be used for introduction of prospective lines of carp fry, characterized by high performance and resistance, into the productive cultures.

AB  - Water quality controls help to prevent pollution and to protect public health as well as to maintain and improve the biological integrity of the water bodies, for which, authorities establish water quality standards. Water quality controls involve a large number of variables and observations, often subject to some outliers. An outlier is an observation that is numerically distant from the rest of the data or that appears strongly deviate from other members of the sample in which it occurs. Therefore, identification of atypical observations is an important concern in water quality monitoring and a difficult task because of the multivariate nature of water quality data. Our study provides a new method for detecting outliers in water quality monitoring parameters, using turbidity, conductivity and ammonium as indicator variables. Up to now, methods were based on considering the different parameters as a vector whose components were their concentration values. This innovative approach lies in considering water quality monitoring over time as continuous curves instead of as discrete points, i. e., the dataset studied is considered as a timedependent function instead of as a set of discrete values in different time instants. This new methodology, which is based on the concept of functional depth, was applied to the detection of outliers in water quality monitoring samples in the Mino river basin with success. Results of this study are discussed here in terms of origin, causes, etc. Finally, the conclusions as well as the advantages of the functional method are exposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To study Hg toxicity on soil microbes and their activities, it is necessary to understand its various forms in soils. The objectives of this study were to investigate Hg speciation in four soil types spiked with Hg (300 mg kg(-1) soil) and its effects on soil microbial respiration and enzymes (amidohydrolases and phosphatase) activities. An assessment of the chemical forms, amounts, reactions, and mobility of Hg in soils and sediments is of significant importance to improve and maintain soil and environmental health and sustainability. Mercury speciation analysis was investigated under acidic and alkaline conditions using a modified sequential procedure, which differentiates Hg into the four distinct fractions. Soil microbial respiration and enzymes activities were determined under laboratory settings, by incubating the soils at 25 degrees C for 30 days, and then determining the amount of CO2 evolved. Speciation results revealed that the water soluble form was the least, with < 1% of the total Hg in the soil types investigated irrespective of the pH condition, while the residual fraction was the most abundant (> 80%) in Canisteo, Houston, and Ketona soils under acidic conditions and < 35% in Decatur soil. Under alkaline conditions, the residual fraction was <= 70% in Canisteo, Houston, and ketona and <= 29% in Decatur soil. The exchangeable fraction was the second most abundant fraction in the soils used ranging from 3.7-50.0% under acid conditions and 16.9-52.1% under alkaline conditions indicating that Hg desorption was found to be more favorable under alkaline than acidic conditions. Soil respiration was suppressed by Hg especially at the 100 mg kg(-1) concentration level. Amidohydrolases and phosphatases' response in the presence of Hg was variable. Amidohydrolascs were more sensitive to Hg (18-90%) than phosphatase (0-35%) in all soils. This study demonstrated that the forms in which Hg exist in soils may determine its bioavailability and toxicity. Also microbial respiration and enzyme activities are potential bioindicators of heavy metal contamination of the environment.

AB  - Over-exploitation of wildlife especially bushmeat trade is the second most important threat to animal biodiversity. This also applies to Northern Angola but data on bushmeat and hunting techniques for this region are rare. Therefore, we study the most common hunting techniques, frequently captured species, and their economic value, and discuss the local resource use in relation to Angolan law and urgent global crises like the loss of biodiversity, the food supply in South African countries, and the risk of zoonoses. We recorded bushmeat hunting in 27 localities in the province of Uige, accompanied hunters along their snare lines and interviewed additional 20 locals. Seven main types of snares and traps and their characteristics were defined. Hunters own on average 92 +/- 128.7 snares and traps and capture about 25.3 +/- 23.6 animals monthly. In total, respondents recognized 28 species of mammals of which one is considered as extinct and two as very rare. The majority of recorded species are hunted regularly. Rodents are most commonly caught followed by primates and duikers. Harvesting rates decrease with species' body size, leading to high economic value of and achievable prices for rare, large animals. Overall, our results document the hunting pressure on mammals and the persisting popularity of bushmeat in Northern Angola which poses an imminent threat to remaining mammal populations. Moreover, it endangers ecosystem integrity, rural livelihoods, and human health through the risk of new zoonoses. Our findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable solutions. The Angolan government should play a more active role in enforcing existing hunting legislation to reduce illegal bushmeat trade.

AB  - Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) at an environmentally relevant concentration (1 mu g/L) has previously been shown to affect bone development in a transgenerational manner in F3 medaka (Oryzias latipes) larvae (17 dph). Here, we provide novel histomorphometric data demonstrating that the impaired bone formation at an early life stage is not recoverable and can result in a persistent transgenerational impairment of bone metabolism in F3 adult fish. A decrease in bone thickness and the occurrence of microcracks in ancestrally BaP-treated adult male fish (F3) were revealed by MicroCt measurement and histopathological analysis. The expression of twenty conserved bone miRNAs were screened in medaka and their relative expression (in the F3 ancestral BaP treatment vs the F3 control fish) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Attempt was made to link bone miRNA expression with the potential target bone mRNA expression in medaka. Five functional pairs of mRNA/miRNA were identified (Osx/miR-214, Col2a1b/miR-29b, Runx2/miR-204, Sox9b/miR-199a-3p, APC/miR-27b). Unique knowledge of bone-related miRNA expression in medaka in response to ancestral BaP-exposure in the F3 generation is presented. From the ecological risk assessment perspective, BaP needs to be regarded as a transgenerational skeletal toxicant which exerts a far-reaching impact on fish survival and fitness. Given that the underlying mechanisms of cartilage/bone formation are conserved between medaka and mammals, the results may also shed light on the potential transgenerational effect of BaP on skeletal disorders in mammals/humans.

AB  - The use of pyrrhotite-containing aggregate in concrete has led to the premature deterioration of building foundations in Connecticut (U.S.A.). Pyrrhotite is a highly reactive iron-sulfide mineral that can initiate internal sulfate attack in concrete structures, because it serves as a source of sulfate ions for secondary minerals. Associated increases in mineral volume can lead to spalling, cracking and a loss of structural integrity. Since pyrrhotite is a strongly ferrimagnetic mineral with a Curie-temperature of 325 degrees C and several diagnostic phase transitions, we measured the variation of magnetic susceptibility between room-temperature and 700 degrees C. Such a thermomagnetic measurement serves as a rapid and sensitive semi-quantitative indicator of pyrrhotite in aggregate or concrete samples. In combination with measurements of total sulfur concentrations, pyrrhotite concentrations as low as 0.1% can be detected. The analysis can aid in the quantification of risk of internal sulfur attack due to the presence of pyrrhotite.

AB  - This study describes the correlation between emission of gaseous pollutants to the atmosphere and the combustion parameters of a coal-fired 25 MW heating capacity water boiler with mechanical grate (boiler type WR-25) in unstable working conditions: start-up, shutdown and loads below the technical minimum. Whereas measurements were made for a specific type and size of coal-fired water boiler with mechanical grate, the measurements and calculations are applicable to WR boilers with a different heating power as well as OR type steam boilers, which have a practically identical design. In sum, there are more than 1,000 coal-fired water and steam boilers of these types in Poland. In addition, the analysis reported in this paper highlights the important role played by boilers operating in unstable conditions in terms of emission of gaseous pollutants to the atmosphere. The conclusions are relevant for other boilers fired with gas, oil or biomass operating under conditions such as start-up, shutdown and loads below the technical minimum. This article fills a gap in air protection engineering practice and the literature with regard to indicators and emission standards, drawing on measurements of pollutant concentrations in the exhaust gases from unstable WR boiler working conditions. The measurements can be used to assess the emission of pollutants to the atmosphere in such boiler working conditions and their impact on air quality. The analyses presented were based on the authors' own measurements in WR-25 boiler technical installations using portable gas analyser GASMET DX-4000, which uses the FT-IR measurement method for compounds such as SO2, NOx, HCl, HF, NH3, CH4, and CO. Concentrations of CO, NOx and SO2 in exhaust gases were determined with multiple regression with the STATISTICA statistical software and with linear regression complemented by the "smart" package in the MATLAB environment. The study provides computational models to identify pollutant concentrations in the exhaust gases in any working conditions of WR-25 boilers.

AB  - The optimal environmental conditions for rearing the balsam woolly adelgid, Adelges piceae (Ratzeburg) (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), on its natural host, Fraser fir, Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir, was determined by varying temperature, photoperiod, and humidity as well as by evaluating texture and geotaxic preferences. Five locations with a set temperature and relative humidity (RH) were chosen to test for optimal environmental conditions: three environmental chambers maintained at 17, 20, and 25 degrees C with 75% RH; an insectary maintained at 21.1 degrees C and 72% RH; and a greenhouse with varying temperature and RH levels. Overall, 20 degrees C appeared to be the optimal temperature for development, and 25 degrees C was the least favorable of the temperatures tested. Comparing Fraser fir cuttings to seedlings, seedlings (15.51/cm) were five times more infested than cuttings (3.02/cm), and the percentage of adult survival was higher on seedlings (67%) than on cuttings (17%). The highest percentage of adelgids reaching full development occurred in adelgids that inserted around the buds. Although the numbers were very low, full development was reached on logs in all five environments. Texture of the bark plays a role in A. piceae preference, with twice the number of crawlers inserting into medium-textured bark compared to rough-textured bark. Adelges piceae showed positive geotaxis preference, with the most favorable insertion sites on the bottom sides of vertical bark discs. Future rearing of adelgids in the laboratory should be on logs or seedlings in an area of sufficient size to permit adequate airflow at 20 degrees C and 75% RH.

AB  - The ground beetle Merizodus soledadinus was introduced a century ago to the Kerguelen Islands. It has since become invasive and has colonized most coastlines east of this archipelago. In invaded intertidal zones, M. soledadinus has to deal with substrates that can reach high salinity levels. In addition to saline stress, the rapid spread of this invasive insect on the Kerguelen Islands may result in starving during dispersal, especially during winter periods. In order to gain a further understanding of the factors that have contributed to the success of this insect in invading the Kerguelen Islands, we assessed the variability in the expression of heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) in M. soledadinus. HSC70 are constitutively expressed by insects, and we examined if the expression of HSC70 could picture the health degree of the ground beetles exposed at a range of environmental conditions, for example, varying temperatures (0, 4, 8, 12, and 20 A degrees C), trophic status (fed and food-deprived individuals), and saline conditions (salinities of 0, 35, and 70). We found that HSC70 expression decreased with increasing salinity. HSC70 expression was not modified in response to non-extreme thermal variations or short-term food deprivation, which did not appear to be stressful conditions for M. soledadinus given the survival results. We concluded that HSC70 expression may serve as a molecular indicator of the levels of well-being of this ground beetle when exposed to a range of environmental perturbations.

AB  - The mismatch between the conceptual understanding of the Ecosystem Services (ES) in science, and their practical application, remains. Among the many issues under discussion is the link between knowledge and implementation. Base knowledge built over cases studies exist, but their usefulness for site-specific management purposes is limited. The goal of this work is to illustrate how gap analysis at the local level may contribute to the development of ES research and knowledge transfer. A review of coastal ES was performed, based on peer-reviewed journals, grey literature and other sources, allocating the information per European Nature Information System aquatic habitat coupled with the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services. Then, a multicriteria decision-making approach was applied to find ES research hotspots, i.e., habitats for which ES research should be prioritized. Three criteria were used: abundance of ES, evidence for the supply of ES, and strength of evidence. The criteria were considered suitable for coastal areas where profound gaps in ES research exist. The Atlantic coastal region adjacent to the Mondego River was used as case study. 231 current and potential ES were listed and mapped for 21 coastal habitats. Cultural services arose as the dominant category. Saltworks emerged as the most recommended habitat for ES research. Results are in accordance with local decision-makers trends of management; we consider the approach to be appropriate as a first step towards the operationalization of the ES concept and flexible enough to be readapted to focus on critical questions that characterize ES research.

These ecosystems support society through the provision of goods (timber, fuelwood, etc.) and an array of ecological services (carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, etc.). However, unplanned developmental activities have been affecting the ecological integrity evident from the fragmentation of forests, barren hilltops, conversion of perennial streams to intermittent or seasonal streams, etc. During the past three decades, forests have undergone major transitions with the breaking of contiguous native forests into small parcels of land, restricting the movement of species thereby limiting the potential of species for dispersal and colonization. This paper analyzes the landscape dynamics and spatial patterns of forests fragmentation of Shimoga District, Central Western Ghats and prioritizes ecologically fragile or Ecologically Sensitive regions (ESR) at village levels based on bio-geo-climatic-social variables with the land use dynamics considering temporal remote sensing data. Results revealed that there was a net loss of 10% in forest cover from 43.83% (1973) to 34.02% (2018), primarily caused by the expansion of agriculture, horticulture, and forest plantations. Forest fragmentation has increased, evident from the decline of the interior forest to an extent of 11% from 26% (1973-2018). ESR prioritization at village level in the Shimoga district considering the ecological, geo-climatic and social variables indicate that 11% villages are ESR 1 (highest sensitivity), 30% are in ESR 2 (higher sensitivity), 36% are in ESR 3 (high sensitivity) and the remaining 23% are in ESR 4 or moderate sensitivity category. The analysis illustrates the importance of understanding spatiotemporal patterns of landscape structure for sustainable management of tropical forests.

AB  - The present study describes the developed filter layer method for the consistent determination and identification of the natural occurrence of Pyrenochaeta terrestris in maize roots. The field experiment was set up to establish the applicability, accuracy and efficiency of this method for the pathogen isolation from roots of maize grown under different agroecological conditions. According to this method, the 10- to 15-mm long tissue sections, mainly cut at the margin of lesions developed in roots, were placed on two layers of moisten filter paper in Petri dishes and incubated for 6-7 days under laboratory conditions, 25 +/- 2 degrees C and daylight. The unique reddish-purple (beet-red) pigmentation was used as an indicator of the fungal incidence in infected roots, which facilitated a succeeding confirmation of the pathogen on PDA at 25 degrees C in the dark and on CLA in the alternating 12 h light (fluorescent and near-ultraviolet light)/12 h dark conditions. Obtained results showed that the filter layer method was very effective for the P. terrestris detection and that it could be applied for a rapid assessment of response of maize genotypes, environmental and seasonal effects on the fungal growth on roots and the fungal distribution. Advantages of this method for the detection and quantification of P. terrestris in relation to the methods described in the literature include: a) low investments, because many root samples can be tested immediately at the same time; b) results can be obtained rapidly (6-7 days after sampling); and c) minimal interference by other fungi or bacteria.

AB  - In this study, we present a fused multi-scale approach to model habitat suitability index (HSI) maps for three different locust species. The presented methodology was applied for the Italian locust (Calliptamus italicus, CIT) in Pavlodar oblast, Northern Kazakhstan, for the Moroccan locust (Dociostaurus maroccanus, DMA) in Turkistan oblast, South Kazakhstan and for the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) in Awash river basin, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia. The main novelty is based on implementing results from ecological niche modelling (ENM) with timeseries analyses of high spatial resolution remote sensing data (Sentinel-2) and further auxiliary datasets in a fused HSI model. Within the ENM important climatic variables (e.g. temperature, rainfall) and edaphic variables (e.g. sand and moisture contents) are included at a coarse spatial resolution. The analyses of Sentinel-2 time-series data enables mapping locust breeding habitats based on recent remotely sensed land observation at high spatial resolution and mirror the actual vegetation state, land use, land cover and in this way identify areas with favorable conditions for egg survival and breeding. The fused HSI results for year 2019 were validated based on ground field observation and reach area under curve (AUC) performance of 0.747% for CIT, 0.850% for DMA and 0.801% for desert locust. The innovation of this study is a multi-scale approach which accounts not only for climatic and environmental conditions but also for current vegetation and land management situation. This kind of up-to-date spatial detailed information on breeding suitability could enable area prioritization for risk assessment, monitoring and early intervention of locust pests.

AB  - Purpose - The paper aims to present the core part of the research work done within the FP7 OPEN HOUSE project, aiming to merge existing methodologies for sustainability assessment of buildings towards a common view, applicable as an open access assessment method across European Union (EU). One of the principle tasks was to evaluate the applicability of proposed indicators in EU countries with different legal frameworks, climate conditions, status and condition of the building stock and construction tradition.
   Design/methodology/approach - To reach the goal, it had to be established first whether the pre-selected indicators suit the purpose in countries different from each other regarding various influential factors. A questionnaire survey based on close-ended quantitative thematic questions was performed to evaluate the acceptability and relevance of each indicator in national contexts, thus defining the path for the final protocol of selection criteria for the OPEN HOUSE method.
   Findings - The responses enabled and justified necessary minor corrections and regrouping to define the full (56 indicators) and core (30 indicators) indicator sets, demonstrating that the system is applicable in EU countries. This task made ground for finalisation of the OPEN HOUSE method: definition of evaluation procedures and sustainability performance levels and testing of the approach on demo cases.
   Originality/value - This paper shows how the research team tackled the problem of limited use of building sustainability assessment methods due to specific boundary conditions by determining a widely applicable set of categories and related indicators based upon an extensive analysis of existing assessment methods, standardisation development, formal guidelines and strategic (inter) national frameworks.

AB  - Biomarkers require sensitivity and rapid turnover for health assessment of individuals and populations. Blood glucose in fish shows sensitive and measurable changes in response to environmental, physiological or nutritional stressors. Argyrosomus japonicus is currently the only commercially produced marine aquaculture finfish species in South Africa, yet knowledge about its responses to biological and environmental stressors is limited. Herein we confirm the utility of the Accu-Chek (R) Active diabetic glucometer under field conditions to provide accurate blood glucose data for A. japonicus, in comparison with laboratory-based enzymatic analyses using plasma, whole blood and dried blood spots (DBS). Glucometer, whole blood and DBS glucose was correlated with plasma glucose (R-2 = 0.973, R-2 = 0.955, R-2 = 0.898 respectively). Whole blood glucose was consistently and significantly lower than plasma glucose, thus indicating that more complex sample preparation than storage on ice and freezing at -80 degrees C are required to inhibit glycolysis in whole blood samples and generate accurate results. Diabetic glucometers offer a means to measure on-farm blood glucose with sufficient accuracy and rapidity. We include an analysis of a subsequent sampling from the farm, and demonstrate that through routine glucose measurements we were able to identify hypoglycaemia at the farm level, and that this corresponds to decreased condition of fish. The ease of DBS storage and stability of metabolites offer the opportunity of expanding fish health and condition monitoring by measuring multiple indicators in DBS. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Electrical Transmission System Operators (TSO) are trusted with ensuring the safety and reliability of transmission infrastructure which can span thousands of kilometers. Maintenance of such a geographically expansive system is naturally a matter of concern and companies invest heavily in tracking infrastructure state which still relies predominantly on visual inspection. This paper presents an automated condition assessment methodology for concrete poles supporting overhead conductors based on deep learning object detection networks. Nine defect conditions ranging from incipient to severe are automatically detected from infrastructure photographs and mapped onto established Health Indices used by maintenance personnel. Three different deep learning networks are tested and new metrics, specific to this problem, are defined to evaluate their performance based on asset Health Index (HI) values. Results indicate that deep learning object detection networks hold promise for significantly reducing manual labour associated with visual inspection, especially when combining with automatic asset identification based on image geotag. This paper shows acceptable performance on more severe defect types.

AB  - Expansion and heterogeneous clustering of commercial horticulture within the central highlands of Kenya after the mid-1990s impact watersheds and the sustainable resource management. This is distressing since climate conditions for world horticultural regions are projected to change, making such farming extremely difficult and costly to the environment. To understand the scope of impact on vegetation, the study evaluated (1) interannual variability in averaged normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); (2) trends in average annual NDVI before and after 1990 - the presumed onset of rapid horticulture; and (3) relationship between the average annual NDVI and large-scale commercial farms, population density, and mean annual rainfall in subwatersheds. Time-series analysis of long-term Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies NDVI data were analyzed as indicator of vegetation condition. NDVI trends before 1990s (1982-1989) and after 1990s (1990-2006) were evaluated to determine the slope (sign), and the Spearman's correlation coefficient (strength). Overall, results show considerable variations in vegetation condition due largely to mixed factors including intensive farming activities, drought, and rainfall variation. Statistical analysis shows significant differences in slopes before 1990 and after 1990 (p<0.05 and p<0.1 respectively). Negative (decline) trends were common after 1990, linked to increased commercial horticulture and related anthropogenic disturbances on land cover. There was decline in vegetation over densely populated subwatersheds, though low NDVI values in 1984 and 2000 were the effect of severe droughts. Understanding the linkage between vegetation responses to the effects of human-induced pressure at the subwatershed scale can help natural resource managers approach conservation measures more effectively.

AB  - Chlorophyll-a and its derivatives in the recent sediments of nineteen sites from the southern coast of the Baltic, an eutrophic sea, were examined and compared to those of other regions of the world. This included the Venice Lagoon in Italy, Ardmucknish and Dunstaffnage Bays of Scotland and the southern coast of Florida (USA). High photoautotrophic production and high sedimentation rates were found to aid the development of hypoxic/anoxic conditions in sediments. Additionally, when physical mixing in water and/or sediments was slow or absent, anoxia resulted and enhanced the preservation of chloropigments-a. Alternately, low productivity, low sedimentation rates, and the turnover of water and/or mixing of sediments resulted in the maintenance of oxic conditions, and increased degradation of chloropigments-a and decomposition to colorless products. In this work, specific chlorophyll-a derivatives are becoming better identified as indicators for certain combinations of environmental processes, such as grazing by zooplankton and benthic biota, input of fresh microalgal material, oxygenation, anaerobic microbial activity and others. The distribution both of the sum of chloropigments-a (Sigma Chlns-a, in nmoles/g-sediment, dry wt.) and the percentages specific derivatives in recent sediments are concluded as excellent, spatiotemporal averaged indicators of productivity and the physicochemical state/trends of various depositional environments. Conclusions drawn on the basis of past studies of Baltic Sea sediments, as well as those reported herein, appear extendable to other coastal areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Peatlands are peculiar ecosystems in which well-adapted communities grow and develop, recording the variation in climate and hydrological conditions inland. In addition necromass is well preserved and therefore peatlands can be used as palaeo-archives for environmental variation. In this work a peat core of depth 60 cm dated at the bottom of the peat deposit as ca. 250 cal AD from Huelga de Bayas (Asturias, Northern Spain) was studied to a resolution of 2-4 cm to investigate the evolution of the environmental conditions in the area. Samples were extracted with a dichloromethane/methanol ratio of 3:1 and studied by means of gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in order to identify possible biomarkers of climatic variation during the period of peat formation. Lipid biomarker study allows the identification of periods in which Sphagnum or higher plants preferentially contributed to the peat profile. The absolute dating of the profile combined with the n-alkane record displayed five episodes of wetter conditions around ca. 250 cal AD (Roman Warm Period), 1080 and 1270 cal AD (Medieval Warm Period), 1460 cal AD (Little Ice Age) and 1920 cal AD (Recent warming), which are consistent with climate evolution in the region. Pentacyclic triterpenoids with hopane skeleton derived from microorganisms and with oleanane skeleton derived from higher plants were identified. The presence of their ketone and acetyl-derivatives, along with the presence of unstable hopane configurations indicates a low maturity of the peat profile. A tendency for the functionalised triterpenoids to decrease with depth was observed in the profile. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - REGEN was developed by the National Forestry Database Program to report on forest regeneration activities and conditions on harvested lands. The underlying conceptual model clearly identifies the linkage between treatments (harvesting and silvicultural activities) and regeneration status, and characterizes the transitional nature of regeneration The approach allows for the incorporation of updated information on the status of regenerating conditions as it becomes available from re-inventories and periodic assessments. Regeneration condition is described in terms of nine status classes which relate to the levels of stocking of commercial species and the degree of competition. These classes were designed to accommodate the variation in standards which occurs among jurisdictions. Five simplified regeneration classes are used for public reporting purposes.

AB  - Aspergillus flavus is the main xerophylic species colonising stored peanuts resulting in contamination with aflatoxins (AFs) and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). This study evaluated the relationship between storage of shelled peanuts under interacting abiotic conditions on (a) temporal respiration (R) and cumulative CO2 production, (b) dry matter losses (DMLs) and (c) aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) and CPA accumulation. Both naturally contaminated peanuts and those inoculated with A. flavus were stored for 7-days under different water activities (a(w); 0.77-0.95) and temperatures (20-35 degrees C). There was an increase in the temporal CO2 production rates in wetter and warmer conditions, with the highest respiration at 0.95 a(w) + A. flavus inoculum at 30 degrees C (2474 mg CO(2)kg(-1) h(-1)). The DMLs were modelled to produce contour maps of the environmental conditions resulting in maximum/minimum losses. Maximum mycotoxin contamination was always at 0.95 a(w) although optimal temperatures were 25-30 degrees C for AFs and 30-35 degrees C for CPA. These results showed a correlation between CO2 production and mycotoxin accumulation. They also provide valuable information for the creation of a database focused on the development of a post-harvest decision support system to determine the relative risks of contamination with these mycotoxins in stored shelled peanuts.

AB  - With the aim to assess the effect of short- term thermal stress on physiological traits of ewes an experiment was designed. Fourteen hair sheep ewes were selected during early reproductive management and randomly segregated in two groups. Control group (CG) with indoor conditions, and an experimental group (EG) under continuous outdoor conditions without shadow accessing during 14 days (d). Respiratory frequency (RF), rectal temperature (RT) and infrared image temperatures were estimated. Traits were measured for 8 d twice a d (9:00 am and 15:00 pm). Environmental temperature and humidity were monitored, and temperature and humidity index was estimated. All physiological and environmental traits showed significantly variation by group and time of measurement (P < 0.001). RT and RF were significantly higher for EG and during pm measurements. Environmental conditions indicated thermal stress conditions for outdoor EG during the afternoon was related ultimately with respiratory mechanism as the main indicator of continuous thermal stress. Head infrared image temperature was a good predictor of body temperature.

AB  - The content of rural territories development as a socio-economic-ecological system has been determined. It has been also proved that the study of rural development is of crucial importance because of the necessity to solve some socio-economic problems such as preservation of local customs, historical and ethnic characteristics. We have identified the decenfralization as one of the vital components of democratic reformation, contributing to the transparency of the authorities' activity. The impact of decenfralization processes on the indicators of sustainable rural development in Ukraine has been revealed. It manifests itself in the growth of employment and income of rural population, provision of medical and educational institutions, enhancements of road transport infrastructure, creation of conditions for business development and further diversification of economic activity in rural areas, environmental protection. The analysis of sustainable development of rural territories in the conditions of decentralization based on the application of the proposed methodology has been done. Integral indices of sustainable development of rural territories of Ukraine have been calculated using the determination of partial indices of social sphere development, economic and ecological situation. The results of modelling rural territories sustainable development in the context of decentralization can be used to make management decisions for the development and implementation of economic instruments with the aim of achieving such strategic prospects as reformation of local self-governments and territorial organization of central government in Ukraine. To analyze the impact of decenfralization on achieving sustainable rural development prospects, the benefits and risks of this process have been identified.

AB  - Urban environments consistent with children's nature would have a major share in their social and personal maturity. Child Friendly City (CFC) is a city, in which children have clean water and sanitary facilities beside possibility to express their opinions. In such a city, children can participate in the urban plans. This study seeks to compare and contrast different areas of Quchan including Yaghoub Abad, the Farhangian and Davoodi. These areas are going to be analyzed based on the desirable indicators of a child-friendly city comprising: public spaces urban furniture, transportation and traffic, social-cultural parameters. The present descriptive-analytical study is based on library research, surveys and interviews, using SPSS software. A decision model (TOPSIS), was also used for evaluating and ranking studied regions. On the aspect of urban furniture, the results showed that between the studied areas, Yaghoub Abad district had a more favorable condition with a degree of 2.98 in comparison with the Farhangian which received a degree of 2.92 and Davoodi that had a 2.85 degree.. On the aspect of urban traffic, the Farhangiyan area with a 3.15 degree had better situation than Davoodi with a degree of 2.88, which showed the lowest level of the three studied areas. Yaghoub Abad also had a degree of 2.99 which occupied a moderate position among these three areas.. By using TOPSIS model, it was determined that the current situation of child-friendly city in Davoodi had unfavorable conditions with priority coefficient (0  pound 0.271  pound 1), and Yacobabadwith a coefficient of (0  pound 0.375  pound 1) is somewhat favorable and the Farhangiyan had relatively more favorable conditions with coefficient priority of (0  pound 0.668  pound 1).

AB  - Micromorphological investigations of archaeological bones make it possible to study decay processes and the associated depositional environment in one go. A selection of micromorphological thin sections from soil samples from three wetland sites in Switzerland, The Netherlands and Norway that contained bone fragments were studied. The goal was to investigate the type and the timing of decay processes to better understand the taphonomy of bones in such sites. Using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), a range of biological decay processes and chemical/mineralogical transformations were observed. In two of the sites - Zug-Riedmatt in Switzerland and Hazendonk in The Netherlands - a relatively short exposure to adverse conditions must have occurred: Some of the bones from Zug-Riedmatt show localized collagen decay related to exposure to fresh ashes; others show cyanobacterial tunnelling related to submersion in shallow, clear water. In Hazendonk, bone fragments and fish scales apparently have first been exposed to bacterial decay related to putrefaction. Subsequently, alternations between wet and dry conditions resulted in the dissolution of some of the bone mineral and the formation of Ca, Fe(III) phosphates, probably mitridatite. Fungal decay caused extensive tunnelling of bone and fish scales as well as the secondary phosphates. These processes apparently ended when the bone-rich layer became permanently waterlogged and anoxic. In Stavanger, bone mineral is transformed into mitridatite and possibly other Ca Fe(III) phosphates. Indications that the redox conditions are variable at present suggest that these processes are still active. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study was undertaken to assess the marine environmental effects from feed and waste associated with aquaculture activities. Metal compositions of sediment, lobster, and feed were used to evaluate the extent of detectable effects at 0 m (under the cage) and 50 in distance. Sediments that were collected under the cages and were characterised as hypoxic or anoxic, showed elevated levels of Cu, Zn, organic carbon, and % <63 mu m particles, and low Mn and Fe. At 50 in there was a major reduction in waste chemical impact. Using lobster, a bioindicator species, as a tool for detecting near-field impacts, showed accumulations of high Cu associated with active aquaculture sites. Chemical compositions and metal ratios normalised with organic carbon, were used to assess the sediment conditions associated with environmental monitoring program ratings (EMP-normal, hypoxic, and anoxic). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to explore chemical data at all sites for differentiating normal, hypoxic and anoxic sediment conditions. Selected variables (Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, organic carbon, and particles <63 mum) were sufficient for the PCA approach with >90% explainable variance of first two components. The groupings based on PCA and cluster analysis were similar to EMP classifications with some exceptions of mis-identification by EMP. The sediment chemistry components were valid indicators for evaluating marine environmental conditions and for assessing aquaculture operating sites. The developed techniques, using chemical variables in combination with EMP and the statistical approach should be useful to predict the effects of aquaculture practices and the suitability of aquaculture operations.

AB  - Old Woman Creek wetland is composed of a stream and freshwater estuary and may act as a sink or transformer of nutrients entering Lake Erie. Primary productivity and respiration are indicators of ecosystem level trophic conditions and may be linked to the estuary's effectiveness as a nutrient sink or transformer. Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve has been collecting water chemistry data at 15 minute intervals using data loggers since 1995. Both diel and seasonal trends in water temperature, dissolved oxygen and water depth at selected sites in the creek and estuary were related to physical and biological processes. Daily primary productivity and respiration were estimated from diurnal changes in dissolved oxygen under both high and low water conditions. Mean water depth was higher in 1997 and 1998 (0.94-1.2 m) than in 2003 and 2004 (0.5-0.66 m). Water temperature was generally 1-2 degrees C higher in the open lower estuary and mouth than in the creek and upper estuary which is more shaded. Typical diurnal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen ranged from less than 20% to greater than 150% saturation. Primary productivity rates in the creek and upper estuary were lower (0.5-3-5 gO(2)/m(2)/day) than in the lower estuary sites (2.0-10.1 gO(2)/m(2)/day). Through both periods of high water and low water, the GPP/R ratio was less than one, thus negating our hypothesis that the ratio would be greater than 1 during high water years when the estuary was primarily an open water system.

AB  - Widespread wastewater pollution is one of the greatest challenges threatening the sustainable management of rivers globally. Understanding microbial responses to gradients in environmental stressors, such as wastewater pollution, is crucial to identify thresholds of community change and to develop management strategies that protect ecosystem integrity. This study used multiple lines of empirical evidence, including a novel combination of microbial ecotoxicology methods in the laboratory and field to link pressure-stressor-response relationships. Specifically, community-based whole effluent toxicity (WET) testing and environmental genomics were integrated to determine real-world community interactions, shifts and functional change in response to wastewater pollution. Here we show that wastewater effluents above moderate ( > 10%) concentrations caused consistent significant shifts in bacterial community structure and function. These thresholds of community shifts were also linked to changes in the trophic state of receiving waters in terms of nutrient concentrations. Differences in the community responses along the effluent concentration gradient were primarily driven by two globally relevant bacterial indicator taxa, namely Malikia spp. (Burkholderiales) and hgcI_clade (Frankiales). Species replacement occurred above moderate effluent concentrations with abundances of Malikia spp. increasing, while abundances of hgcI_clade decreased. The responses of Malikia spp. and hgcI_clade matched gene patterns associated with globally important nitrogen cycling pathways, such as denitrification and nitrogen fixation, which linked the core individual taxa to putative function and ecosystem processes, rarely achieved in previous studies. This study has identified potential indicators of change in trophic status and the functional consequences of wastewater pollution. These findings have immediate implications for both the management of environmental stressors and protection of aquatic ecosystems. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using localized studies to understand how ecosystems recover can create uncertainty in recovery predictions across landscapes. Large archives of remote sensing data offer opportunities for quantifying the spatial and temporal factors influencing recovery at broad scales and predicting recovery. For example, energy production is a widespread and expanding land use among many semi-arid ecosystems of the Western United States dominated by sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), a keystone species providing a variety of ecological services. With remotely-sensed (Landsat) estimates of vegetation cover collected every 2-5 years from southwestern Wyoming, USA, over nearly three decades (1985-2015), we modeled changes in sagebrush cover on 375 former oil and gas well pads in response to weather and site-level conditions. We then used modeled relationships to predict recovery time across the landscape as an indicator of resilience for vegetation after well pad disturbances, where faster recovery indicates a greater capacity to recover when similarly disturbed. We found the rate of change in sagebrush cover generally increased with moisture and temperature, particularly at higher elevations. Rate of change in sagebrush cover also increased and decreased with greater percent sand and larger well pads, respectively. We predicted 21% of the landscape would recover to pre-disturbance conditions within 60 years, whereas other areas may require > 100 years for recovery. These predictions and maps could inform future restoration efforts as they reflect resilience. This approach also is applicable to other disturbance types (e.g., fires and vegetation removal treatments) across landscapes, which can further improve conservation efforts by characterizing past conditions and monitoring trends in subsequent years.

AB  - AimKnowledge about suitable ecological conditions for tree species remains largely incomplete. We aim to quantify and compare suitable environmental conditions for some of the most common tree species in Europe using a modelling approach and a large array of predictors that describe the different dimensions of the environmental niche.
   LocationFrance.
   MethodsUsing a large database of 46768 plots distributed across France (550000km(2)), we compared the performance of 61 physiologically relevant predictors that describe temperature, soil nutrient supply, soil water availability and aeration at fine spatial resolution to model the distribution of 32 tree species. To allow some comparisons between species along the same gradients, the most efficient predictors were determined and used to characterize the species requirements.
   ResultsMean annual temperature, soil water deficit, soil pH, C/N and temporary and permanent waterlogging gave the best performances. The efficiency of species distribution models based on these six variables was comparable to models calibrated with 61 variables. For the first time, those models provide a unique quantitative framework of homogeneous information concerning the requirements for a large number of tree species.
   ConclusionsOur results highlight the importance of soil descriptors to shape plant distribution and allow each species to delineate areas inside the climate envelope with favourable nutritional and moisture conditions. These results emphasize a gap between existing studies on species distribution, mainly based on large-scale climatic predictors, and empirical knowledge or existing practices where soil is recognized as a main driver.

AB  - Water quality agencies and scientists are increasingly adopting standardized sampling methodologies because of the challenges associated with interpreting data derived from dissimilar protocols. Here, we compare 13 protocols for monitoring streams from different regions and countries around the globe. Despite the spatially diverse range of countries assessed, many aspects of bioassessment structure and protocols were similar, thereby providing evidence of key characteristics that might be incorporated in a global sampling methodology. Similarities were found regarding sampler type, mesh size, sampling period, subsampling methods, and taxonomic resolution. Consistent field and laboratory methods are essential for merging data sets collected by multiple institutions to enable large-scale comparisons. We discuss the similarities and differences among protocols and present current trends and future recommendations for monitoring programs, especially for regions where large-scale protocols do not yet exist. We summarize the current state in one of these regions, Latin America, and comment on the possible development path for these techniques in this region. We conclude that several aspects of stream biomonitoring need additional performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, discriminatory power, relative costs), particularly when comparing targeted habitat (only the commonest habitat type) versus site-wide sampling (multiple habitat types), appropriate levels of sampling and processing effort, and standardized indicators to resolve dissimilarities among biomonitoring methods. Global issues such as climate change are creating an environment where there is an increasing need to have universally consistent data collection, processing and storage to enable large-scale trend analysis. Biomonitoring programs following standardized methods could aid international data sharing and interpretation.

AB  - In China, many rural communities depend upon forests to provide wood, fuel, fertilizer, animal bedding, and valuable non-timber forest products (NTFP). However, the degree to which forest resource extraction is compatible with new conservation aims is unclear because there is little information on the specific ecological effects of traditional forest collecting practices. Therefore, we compared the structure and floristics of Pinus densata forests exposed to three levels of resource extraction by Tibetan villages in northwest Yunnan: (1) a forest site protected from wood and timber removal, (2) moderately utilized forest sites exposed to traditional collecting practices, and (3) patches of highly utilized forest from which timber extraction is high in response to recent development pressures. The results show that understorey and cryptogamic species are reduced in all the utilized forest sites by comparison with the protected forest. However, the moderately utilized pine forests still provide good NTFP habitats by maintaining relatively high canopy covers, litter covers, and understorey structural complexity; this suggests that traditional forest resource use, while simplifying the forest, does not pose an increasing threat to pine forest integrity. By comparison, the highly utilized forests are transformed into open, herb-rich environments in which canopy covers and understorey complexity are depleted, and NTFP habitats are degraded. In the future it may be practical to enhance biodiversity by proscribing forest resource collection, but the immediate priority is to monitor the sustainability of forest utilization using indicators such as understorey development, litter cover, and cryptogamic richness.

AB  - Environmental enrichment techniques for captive primates are aimed at improving their psychological well-being. While behavioral variables are used to measure changes in psychological well-being, physiologic measures (e.g., heart rate, cortisol response) are sometimes gathered in addition to the behavioral evidence. Some of these physiologic indices measure acute changes in the animals' well-being, limiting their usefulness. Body weight, however, is a measure of physical well-being that may have meaning as a long-term indicator of psychological well-being. We therefore collected body weight data from two groups of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta group 1: n = 34, group 2: n = 30) every 8 weeks beginning at the age of 1 year, as they passed through various housing conditions as part of a program to develop a specific pathogen-free breeding colony. One-half of the subjects in each group received a variety of environmental enhancements during all housing conditions; the other half received no enrichment and served as controls. At the beginning of the study (age 1 year), control and enriched subjects did not differ in body weight. Among group-1 subjects, enriched animals weighed significantly more than controls after 4 months of enrichment, and the weight difference was maintained 24 months later. Enriched animals in group 2 never differed in weight from their controls. The order in which different types of enrichment were presented and the extra-cage environment of the two groups differed, which may account for this discrepancy. Group-1 enriched subjects were the only animals that weighed as much as free-ranging rhesus monkeys, and rates of weight gain among all groups of subjects were similar to several populations maintained under more naturalistic conditions.

AB  - Currently, trade enables regions to have a higher provisioning ecosystem services (ES) demand than that provided by ecosystems in the same region. This practice leads to a supply and demand provisioning ES scale mismatch, which may affect the provision of other ES. To address such an issue from the sub-national scale, an ES approach implementation step to provide realistic, context-specific pathways toward sustainability is necessary. This paper provides a detailed quantitative assessment of ecosystem services over time in Biscay, Basque Country, Spain. The aim is to identify ways of balancing the local provisioning ecosystem service supply and demand and to enhance sustainable land use. We studied the ecological footprint evolution of the province for 11 years and its relation to ecosystem services. We determined that the replacement of the current forest plantations' monocultures to a multifunctional landscape reinforces food security and enhances biodiversity and essential ES. This place-based ecosystem services assessment, which integrates ecological footprint calculations into an ecosystem service framework, demonstrated that provisioning ES-scale mismatches may be confronted locally by implementing sustainable landscape management strategies, including actions focusing on the supply and demand of ES. The current globalised economy promotes a global reduction in ecosystem integrity and ecosystem services. Reducing the ecological footprint at the local scale would contribute to the reduction of provisioning ecosystem services' demand at the global scale. Thus, maximising a mosaic approach to land use locally would help improve the provision of ecosystem services and therefore also contribute to the global footprint reduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soil moisture is important in the triggering of many types of landslides. However, in situ soil moisture data are rarely available in hazardous zones. The advanced remote sensing technology could provide useful soil moisture information. In this study, an assessment has been carried out between the latest version of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative soil moisture product and the landslide events in a northern Italian region in the 14-year period 2002-2015. A clear correlation has been found between the satellite soil moisture and the landslide events, as over four-fifths of events had soil wetness conditions above the 50% regional soil moisture line. Attempts have also been made to explore the soil moisture thresholds for landslide occurrences under different environmental conditions (land cover, soil type, and slope). The results showed slope distribution could provide a rather distinct separation of the soil moisture thresholds, with thresholds becoming smaller for steeper areas, indicating dryer soil condition could trigger landslides at hilly areas than in plain areas. The thresholds validation procedure is then carried out. Forty five rainfall events between 2014 and 2015 are used as test cases. Contingency tables, statistical indicators, and receiver operating characteristic analysis for thresholds under different exceedance probabilities (1%-50%) are explored. The results have shown that the thresholds using 30% exceedance probability provide the best performance with the hitting rate at 0.92 and the false alarm at 0.50. We expect this study can provide useful information for adopting the remotely sensed soil moisture in the landslide early warnings.

AB  - The earth is warming at an alarming rate, especially in the Arctic, where a marked decline in sea ice cover may have far-ranging consequences for endemic species. Little auks, endemic Arctic seabirds, are key bioindicators as they forage in the marginal ice zone and feed preferentially on lipid-rich Arctic copepods and ice-associated amphipods sensitive to the consequences of global warming. We tested how little auks cope with an ice-free foraging environment during the breeding season. To this end, we took advantage of natural variation in sea ice concentration along the east coast of Greenland. We compared foraging and diving behaviour, chick diet and growth and adult body condition between two years, in the presence versus nearby absence of sea ice in the vicinity of their breeding site. Moreover, we sampled zooplankton at sea when sea ice was absent to evaluate prey location and little auk dietary preferences. Little auks foraged in the same areas both years, irrespective of sea ice presence/concentration, and targeted the shelf break and the continental shelf. We confirmed that breeding little auks showed a clear preference for larger copepod species to feed their chick, but caught smaller copepods and nearly no ice-associated amphipod when sea ice was absent. Nevertheless, these dietary changes had no impact on chick growth and adult body condition. Our findings demonstrate the importance of bathymetry for profitable little auk foraging, whatever the sea-ice conditions. Our investigations, along with recent studies, also confirm more flexibility than previously predicted for this key species in a warming Arctic.

AB  - Assessment in 37 healthy volunteers (aged 23 to 53 years) provided evidence that in a hyperbaric environment (0.4 MPa) a significant decline of expiratory and inspiratory dynamic indicators of pulmonary ventilation occurs, as compared with normobaric conditions (0.1 MPa). This phenomenon has a physical basis and it should be a contraindication for subjects with bronchopulmonary obstruction to dwell in a hyperbaric environment.

AB  - Salinity is a limiting factor for many invertebrates, especially for Odonata which are typically associated with freshwater ecosystems. In Europe, 15 Odonata species inhabit brackish wetlands and only few detailed data on their tolerance towards salinity are available. We investigated Odonata fauna in 11 sampling stations situated in three estuarine areas (northern Adriatic coastline) which differed in salinity conditions (freshwater- polyhaline habitats) in order to assess affinity of Odonata species to brackish habitats and to describe their distribution pattern in coastal wetlands. Adults, exuviae (the remains of the exoskeleton after the last larval instar), and the main chemical and physical water parameters were sampled every 2 weeks for 1 year in each station. In total, 25 species were detected and 56% of them were able to complete their life cycle in brackish water environments. Our results showed that freshwater and oligohaline ponds were the most favorable for dragonflies, with an overall higher species richness. There was a high species turnover along the salinity gradient, with a strong differentiation among the communities along the gradient. Considering the exuviae, we observed a high specificity with respect to the habitat conditions (seven species exclusive of freshwater sites and six of oligohaline ones, respectively). Among the adults, four species were found exclusively in freshwater habitats and no species seemed to be strictly connected with oligohaline habitats. Coastal wetlands are composed by a mosaic of different habitats especially when freshwater and seawater are close together, supporting many Odonata species with different tolerance toward salinity conditions. They also provide useful insights for conservation and management actions.

AB  - Semiarid climate conditions hamper natural re-vegetation, leaving the soil vulnerable to erosion after the cessation of agriculture. Therefore, soil and landscape protective measures, especially afforestations, have been implemented in the Mediterranean region since the early 20th century. This study aims to determine the long term impact of afforestation on soil functioning, in comparison with natural re-vegetation (secondary succession) on abandoned fields and semi-natural vegetation.
   A comparison of secondary succession and afforestation with the present traditional rain fed cereal fields and semi-natural (open) forest, including natural resource islands, was made as well. Composite soil samples were taken to study the physical (i.e. texture, aggregate stability) and chemical (i.e. carbon content, nutrient availability) soil characteristics after 20 and 40 years of afforestation and secondary natural succession. To take into account the resource island effect, the spatial heterogeneity induced by differences in plant cover, samples were taken both below and in between the tree canopy of the semi-natural and afforested Pinus halepensis trees.
   Our results indicate that under secondary succession on abandoned fields, soil quality improves non-linearly and only marginally over a time of 40 years. The afforestation showed a much more pronounced linear increase for most soil quality indicators, resulting in soil conditions comparable to what can be found under the semi-natural forest vegetation. Site preparation might have been a crucial factor for the success of ecosystem restoration in the studied dry land area as it improved water availability for the afforestation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A seasonal survey of living benthic foraminifera was performed in 2013 in the Gulf of Trieste (N Adriatic Sea) to compare two marine coastal sites with different degrees of anthropogenic influence. An assessment of ecological quality statuses showed that the station located near the end of an urban pipeline (Ser station), has worse ecological conditions than the site located in a protected marine area (Res station) all year around. Stressed conditions at Ser station were mainly related to high contents of total organic carbon (TOC) and Zn in the bioavailable fraction, which were a limiting factor for the studied foraminiferal communities. Ammonia tepida, Bolivina spp., and Bulimina spp., which characterised this station, were the most tolerant taxa of the studied assemblage. Conversely, Elphidium spp., Haynesina depressula, Nonionella irides, Quiqueloculina spp., Reophax nana and Textularia spp., could be considered less tolerant species as they benefitted from the less stressful conditions recorded at Res station, despite slightly higher concentrations of some potentially toxic elements (PTEs), especially Pb, being recorded in this station in comparison to Ser station. Furthermore, foraminiferal assemblages were found to be quite resilient over an annual cycle, being able to recover from a seasonal unbalanced state to a mature one. The beginning of spring and latest summer would be the best period to assess the ecological quality status to avoid any under- or overestimation of the health of the environment.

AB  - From December 2003 to September 2004, benthic macroinvertebrates (BM), fishes, water and sediment were collected quarterly at six stations in two streams of the upper Sao Francisco River basin, south-eastern Brazil. We evaluated the ecological conditions, habitat diversity, water quality, composition and structure of BM communities, as well as the food habits of the local fish fauna. By applying a protocol for rapid characterization of ecological conditions and habitat diversity, three of the sampled localities were classified as "pristine" while the others stations were considered "altered". A well oxygenated water with near neutral pH and low electric conductivity (< 0.01 mS/cm) and nutrient concentrations (< 0.08 mg/l total P and < 0.90 mg/l total N) was found for both streams. Sediment analysis revealed the dominance of medium, fine and very fine sand fractions in all sampled areas. The organic matter content in the sediment was higher in the lotic and well preserved area. We found 45 BM taxa, and Chironomidae (68%), Oligochaeta (10%) and Elmidae (8.5%) showed the highest abundances. From the stomach contents analysis of 13 fish species, 26 BM taxa were found, including four that were not collected in the sediment samples, being Chironomidae the dominant group (> 60%). Our results show that human activities such as forest clearing, agriculture and cattle rising have altered the habitat diversity in freshwater ecosystems in a process that affects the aquatic biota and thus the food availability to the fish fauna. The results also highlight the importance of the fish stomach contents analysis as a complementary tool in BM inventories.

AB  - Coal, by its nature, is unstable and weathers when exposed to moisture and oxygen. Weathering can result in a general decline on the commercial value and technological properties of coal. Coals of similar chemical properties have been shown to combust differently, and the differences can be attributed to petrographic composition variations, poor combustion environments, and weathered particles. Stockpiled and dumped discard coals have been targeted for use by a lower power utility, and a novel technique was developed to quantify and qualify the degree of weathering in these coals. The petrographic based Abnormal Condition Analysis (previously referred to as the Weathering Index Analysis) considers features not typically characterized during routine petrographic analyses, but which may have an impact on the technological properties of coals. Discard coals ranging in age from 5 to 40 years where characterized to determine the extent of secondary weathering. Eight secondary weathering features, clearly different from inherent weathering, were qualified and quantified. Margin effect appears to be an early microscopic indicator of weathering, followed by discoloration. Alteration minerals have only been observed in stockpiled and dumped coals and hence could be a useful feature to benchmark when considering whether or not a coal has been stored. Long-term stored coals have microcrack and fissure patterns clearly different from fresh coals. The length of exposure to weathering processes was determined to be proportional to the extent of weathering as determined petrographically. The Abnormal Condition Analysis should be used as a supplement to routine coal petrography as it can assist with the determination of anomalous behavior of coals. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - TRADITIONAL medicinal plants are an important economic source of raw materials for the drug industry. Nowadays, searching for new sources of drug raw materials is an important issue to meet the ever increasing demands. Therefore, quantitative and qualitative phytochemical screening of the dominated xerophytes inhabiting Wadi Sudr, South Sinai, including Retama raetam, Reaumaria hirtella, Tamarix nilotica and Zygophyllum dumosum, was performed. The accumulation levels of some natural bioactive products including phenols, flavonoids and saponins were determined during spring and summer. The investigated species exhibited significant increases in total free amino acids during spring, while they tend to accumulate total soluble sugars, sucrose and secondary metabolites including phenols, tannins and saponins during the dry summer season. Such increments in these metabolites were concomitant with the greatly reducing power capacity. Moreover, the antimicrobial activities of extracts from these shrubs were evaluated against four pathogenic microorganisms (2 bacterial species; Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and 2 fungal species; Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus). Of the tested alternatives, methanolic extract was the most active fraction, while Tamarix nilotica was the most active plant species against the four tested microorganisms, especially Candida albicans. Furthermore, The MIC of the methanolic fraction of Tamarix nilotica and its effect on ergosterol and leakage of intracellular components of cells of Candida albicans showed that this shrub displays its fungicidal effects by targeting the ergosterol biosynthesis in Candida albicans and disrupting the membrane integrity. In conclusion, these shrubs are promising new sources for potent antioxidants and useful antimicrobial agents.

AB  - Assessing the status of soil nutrients with their corresponding microbial communities provides important information about degraded soils during the restoration of coastal wet pine forests. Net nitrogen mineralization, nitrogen-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), and soil microbial biomass were compared with patch-derived volume along a 110-year longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) chronosequence for identifying a trajectory and ecological benchmark during forest restoration. Net nitrogen mineralization rates decreased significantly in the maturing-aged, pine patches, driven by a larger drop in net nitrification. Net nitrification and abundance of NOB were higher in young pine patches compared to soils from the maturing (86-110 years) pine patches. Gross nitrate fluxes followed the nonfungal portion of the soil microbial biomass along the chronosequence, declining in 64-year-old pine patches. Microbial biomass peaked in patches 17-34 years of age, but significantly declined in the older patches. Fungal biomass leveled off without decline. Ammonium was the major source of nitrogen within the maturing pine patches as well as the wetland patches, indicating that ammonium maintains longleaf pine during growth-limiting conditions. Nitrate dominated during rapid tree growth, optimally in mesic conditions. The relative amounts of available ammonium to nitrate can be used to model nitrogen cycling in facultative-wetland pine forests of the coastal United States as soils alternate between wet and mesic conditions. A key restoration benchmark occurred after 86 years of pine development when pine patch growth rates slowed, with lower numbers of NOB, when the nonfungal biomass leveled off, and net nitrification rates are at a minimum, during pine maturation.

AB  - This comparative study investigates the socio-legal and institutional conditions of the settlement and residence of Jews in several Mediterranean port cities during the Early modern period. Focusing first on the Tuscan port of Livorno, it analyses the nature and content of the privileges granted at the end of the 16th century to Jewish merchants and former crypto-Jews at the end of the 16th century. Throughout the history of their negotiation, it retraces the political and economic justifications, based on the reason of State and the assertion of the Prince's sovereignty, which legitimize the acceptance of Sephardim in Livorno. Second, the Tuscan edicts of the 1590s are related to the "philosemitic mercantilism" of the 16h century, and to the competition of the Mediterranean port cities, from Nice/Villefranche to Ancona and from Venice to Livorno. The uncertainty of the rules favouring Jews is highlighted here, as well as the presupposed link between the economic growth and the invitation of Jews to settle and trade in port cities. However, indecisive policies in this regard become a good indicator of the unstable institutional environment of these places. Finally, a third part is devoted to the competition of "free ports' by comparing the fluctuating conditions of settlement of Jews in Nice/Villefranche, Genoa and Marseille in the 17" century. This comparison shows that the Jewish presence, subject to numerous political changes, is less a vital ingredient of the "free port" than an effective revealer of its institutional environment, more or less favourable and open to foreign traders.

AB  - An increase in temperature and water deficits caused by the ongoing climate change might lead to a decline growth rates and threaten the persistence of tree species in drought-prone areas within the Mediterranean Basin. Developmental instability (the error in development caused by stress) may provide an index of the adaptability of woody plants to withstand climatic stressors such as water shortage. This study evaluated the effects of drought stress on growth variables in three stands of a Mediterranean oak (Quercus faginea) exposed to differing climatic conditions (xeric, mesic and cooler) along an altitudinal gradient in northeastern Spain, in two climatically contrasting years (wet and dry years). Two indices of developmental instability, fluctuating and translational asymmetries, which reflect environmental stress, were measured in leaves and current-year shoots, respectively. We also measured branch biomass and fractal complexity of branches as indicators of the species' performance. After a period of drought the individuals' at the most xeric site presented lower developmental instability and less branch biomass than did the individuals from the mesic and cooler sites. We interpret that difference as an adaptive response to drought which reflects a trade-off between maintenance of homeostasis and growth when water is scarce. The study demonstrated that developmental instability constitutes a useful index to assess the degree of adaptation to stressful environmental conditions. The assessment of developmental instability in sites and years with contrasting climatic conditions provides a means of quantifying the capacity of plants to develop plastic adaptive responses to climatic stress.

AB  - Hypoxic events affecting aquatic environments have been reported worldwide and the hypoxia caused by eutrophication is considered one of the serious threats to coastal marine ecosystems. To investigate the molecular-level responses of marine organisms exposed to oxygen depletion stress and to explore the differentially expressed genes induced or repressed by hypoxia, differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) was used with mRNAs from the marine mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, under oxygen depletion and normal oxygen conditions. In total, 107 cDNA clones were differentially expressed under hypoxic conditions relative to the control mussel group. The differentially expressed genes were analyzed to determine the effects of hypoxia. They were classified into five functional categories: information storage and processing, cellular processes and signaling, metabolism, predicted general function only, and function unknown. The differentially expressed genes were predominantly associated with cellular processing and signaling, and they were particularly related to the signal transduction mechanism, posttranslational modification, and chaperone functions. The observed differences in the DD-PCR of 10 genes (encoding elongation factor 1 alpha, heat shock protein 90, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, GTPase-activating protein, 18S ribosomal RNA, cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, ATP synthase, chitinase, phosphoglycerate/bisphosphoglycerate mutase family protein, and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and their transcriptional changes in the mussels exposed to hypoxic conditions for 24-72 h were investigated. These results identify biomarker genes for hypoxic stress and provide molecular-level information about the effects of oxygen depletion on marine bivalves. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to affect the phasing and amplitude of upwelling in eastern boundary current marine ecosystems, Effects may be strongest during the spring or summer 'upwelling season,' but may also be influential during winter before the spring transition. We tested the hypothesis that wintertime environmental forcing 'pre-conditions' the ecosystem and affects the timing and success of breeding in 2 species of seabird, Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus and common murre Uria aalge, reproducing in the central California Current. Time series of the mean and variance of egg-laying dates were correlated with regional winds and sea surface temperature, which were used as proxies for the forcing and oceanic response of coastal upwelling, respectively. Winter proxies of upwelling were the most significant determinants of seabird reproductive phenology, with anomalously strong upwelling in January to March leading to earlier dates of egg-laying in both species. We hypothesized that anomalous (early) winter upwelling, even of weak magnitude or short duration, could seed the region with sufficient nutrients to enhance productivity and prey availability, leading to a healthier adult breeding population and an earlier start to the breeding season. The magnitude of the previous year's November winds were also positively correlated with the variance of egg-laying dates for the common murre, with upwelling-favorable winds leading to greater synchrony in egg-laying. We conclude that winter environmental conditions are important determinants of ecosystem dynamics in the California Current, and that seabird phenology is a particularly useful ecosystem indicator.

AB  - West African cotton production has increased rapidly in recent years. Cotton is being cropped under new ecological conditions by new cotton-producing farmers, but the cropping techniques recommended by developers have essentially remained the same. Methodologies are needed to generate a broad scope of recommendations on cropping techniques to deal with the increasing diversity concerning farmers and cropping conditions.
   A conceptual model of a cotton field was developed that approaches a crop field as a biophysical system under the influence of a "technical system" (i.e. the combination of farmers' practices implemented in the field). The system outputs were restricted to yield and the main yield components. A theoretical model was first designed on the basis of published data and expert knowledge on cotton physiology, local soil-climate conditions and farmers' practices. It was based on five specific hypotheses on links between technical and biophysical systems. The hypotheses were tested in a local farmers' network. Thirty "cropping situations" (soil-crop-technique combinations) were selected in farmers' fields around Katogo village (Mali), a village that had been previously selected for a cotton crop management prototyping program. Homogeneous groups of situations were drawn up on the basis of the dynamics of crop aerial biomass accumulation. They were compared for their management and environment features. The initial conceptual model was then simplified, while taking the measured variability in its components and the sensitivity of the outputs to these components into account. This conceptual model is being evaluated in other villages, where we have partnerships with farmers, in order to develop a version adapted to a broad range of situations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Developing strategies that foster sustainable land management in the hillsides of Central America poses a particular challenge. This research provides empirical and qualitative evidence regarding the impact of local farmers' land management decisions on the sustainability of land use, in conjunction with the specific environmental context. A set of indicators suitable for evaluating impacts in a mixed land use, steeply-sloped catchment in a rural setting in Central Honduras was selected. In the first phase of the study, measured attributes indicating the leakiness of, or tendency for water and sediment to be redistributed within or away from a given site were used to assess the impact of movement of sediment, water and nutrients among patches within the landscape. At any given site, one or two factors contributed to overall leakiness, but with no consistent pattern. Patterns of land use are not strictly related to particular landforms in the catchment. The frequency, intensity and location of transfer processes responsible for the movement of sediment and water were evaluated in the second phase, and the most influential processes identified. Both natural and anthropogenic factors of the study influenced the movement of sediment and water, which varied throughout the catchment. At the broadest scale, surface water flow, landslides and slope failure, and land use change affect overall catchment integrity, threatening sustainability in some cases. Overall, the study successfully linked management produces to landscape features and transfer processes, established patterns of degradation, and identified, cases where the combination of anthropogenic and natural factors has resulted in unsustainable land use. In all cases, the scale of observation determined the dominant factors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Everyday environments often contain distracting competing talkers and background noise, requiring listeners to focus their attention on one acoustic source and reject others. During this auditory attention task, listeners may naturally interrupt their sustained attention and switch attended sources. The effort required to perform this attention switch has not been well studied in the context of competing continuous speech. In this work, we developed two variants of endogenous attention switching and a sustained attention control. We characterized these three experimental conditions under the context of decoding auditory attention, while simultaneously evaluating listening effort and neural markers of spatial-audio cues. A least-squares, electroencephalography (EEG)-based, attention decoding algorithm was implemented across all conditions. It achieved an accuracy of 69.4% and 64.0% when computed over nonoverlapping 10 and 5-s correlation windows, respectively. Both decoders illustrated smooth transitions in the attended talker prediction through switches at approximately half of the analysis window size (e.g., the mean lag taken across the two switch conditions was 2.2 s when the 5-s correlation window was used). Expended listening effort, as measured by simultaneous EEG and pupillometry, was also a strong indicator of whether the listeners sustained attention or performed an endogenous attention switch (peak pupil diameter measure [p=0.034] and minimum parietal alpha power measure [p=0.016]). We additionally found evidence of talker spatial cues in the form of centrotemporal alpha power lateralization (p=0.0428). These results suggest that listener effort and spatial cues may be promising features to pursue in a decoding context, in addition to speech-based features.

AB  - Monitoring of various naturally present substances or physical properties of the water, commonly called environmental tracers, can provide valuable insight in characteristics of groundwater flow systems and intrinsic processes. Analysis of individual tracer data most often gives an ambiguous interpretation, but employment of multiple diverse tracers can greatly increase interpretation reliability. We monitored multiple natural tracers including spring water electrical conductivity, temperature, loads of major anions and cations, stable isotopes of water, and total organic carbon together with discharge dynamics on Krbavica springs located in the Croatian part of Dinaric Karst region. We also monitored dissolved oxygen concentration as an indicator of "excess air" dynamics in the spring water, which is a very rarely recognized and not properly understood phenomenon in the karst groundwater studies. Analysis of the monitoring data revealed main characteristics of the karst system, among which following can be emphasized: (1) oxygen concentration together with conductivity and temperature (parameters monitored with high temporal resolution) were strongly related to discharge dynamics, while seasonal patterns were absent; (2) supersaturation with oxygen confirmed presence of "excess air", most pronounced in high water conditions following the hydrograph peaks, indicating prevalence of closed flow conditions within the system; (3) electrical conductivity showed "anomalous" gradual decrease during the hydrograph recessions, attributed both to CO(2)dynamics and mobilization of water from tiny fissures during high recharge conditions; and (4) stable isotope measurements confirmed good mixing of water within the system with mean residence time of a few years. Simultaneous monitoring of diverse tracer dynamics enabled detailed characterization of the karst system without excessive ambiguity.

AB  - Many recent studies have demonstrated that the health of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) can serve as an important indicator of hazards in the marine environment. A convenient and accurate way to get a "snapshot" of a dolphin's health is to compare biological and physiological measurements to known reference intervals (Ris), which are ranges of values often considered normal or healthy. Measurements that fall above or below RI thresholds are usually considered abnormal and may indicate a health concern. Biological and physiological parameters of individuals sampled during field health assessments are often compared to RIs, but this is usually conducted post fieldwork, following veterinary evaluation and biological sampling, which limits the ability to quickly diagnose problems and immediately perform more telling tests. The objective of this study was to develop a mobile application (app) that allowed instantaneous comparison of bottlenose dolphin morphometrics (i.e., length, mass, and girth) to previously published body condition RIs in situ. Furthermore, for bottlenose dolphins with mass and girth within normal ranges, the mobile app was programmed to compare field measurements to newly derived percentiles (25th, 50th, and 75th). The app was developed using MIT App Inventor 2 (c) software. Functions were validated using historical and simulated data arid were field tested during a bottlenose dolphin capture-release health assessment to evaluate feasibility for field use and to gain information for feature enhancements. An app that can rapidly evaluate body condition will significantly enhance veterinary evaluations of bottlenose dolphins (in the wild and under human care), as well as enhance epidemiologic studies of population health as coastal environments become increasingly stressed from pollution and other anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - The climate is often evoked to explain broad-scale clines of body size, yet its involvement in the processes that generate size inequality in the two sexes (sexual size dimorphism) remains elusive. Here, we analyse climatic clines of sexual size dimorphism along a wide elevation gradient (i) among grasshopper species in a phylogenetically controlled scenario and (ii) within species differing in distribution and cold tolerance, to highlight patterns generated at different time scales, mainly evolutionary (among species or higher taxa) and ontogenetic or microevolutionary (within species). At the interspecific level, grasshoppers were slightly smaller and less dimorphic at high elevations. These clines were associated with gradients of precipitation and sun exposure, which are likely indicators of other factors that directly exert selective pressures, such as resource availability and conditions for effective thermoregulation. Within species, we found a positive effect of temperature and a negative effect of elevation on body size, especially on condition-dependent measures of body size (total body length rather than hind femur length) and in species inhabiting the highest elevations. In spite of a certain degree of species-specific variation, females tended to adjust their body size more often than males, suggesting that body size in females can evolve faster among species and can be more plastic or dependent on nutritional conditions within species living in adverse climates. Natural selection on female body size may therefore prevail over sexual selection on male body size in alpine environments, and abiotic factors may trigger consistent phenotypic patterns across taxonomic scales.

AB  - In regions of the world with poor provision of wastewater treatment, raw sewage is often discharged directly into surface waters. This paper describes an experimental evaluation of the fate of two organic chemicals under these conditions using an artificial channel cascade fed with a mix of settled sewage and river water at its upstream end and operated under continuous steady-state conditions. The experiments underpin an environmental risk assessment methodology based on the idea of an "impact zone" (IZ) - the zone downstream of wastewater emission in which water quality is severely impaired by high concentrations of unionised ammonia, nitrite and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Radiolabelled dodecane-6-benzene sulphonate (DOBS) and aniline hydrochloride were used as the model chemical and reference compound respectively. Rapid changes in C-14 counts were observed with flow-time for both these materials. These changes were most likely to be due to complete mineralisation. A dissipation half-life of approximately 7.1 h was observed for the 14C label with DOBS. The end of the IZ was defined as the point at which the concentration of both unionised ammonia and nitrite fell below their respective predicted no-effect concentrations for salmonids. At these points in the cascade, approximately 83 and 90% of the initial concentration of C-14 had been removed from the water column, respectively. A simple model of mineral nitrogen transformations based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics was fitted to observed concentrations of NH4, NO2 and NO3. The cascade is intended to provide a confirmatory methodology for assessing the ecological risks of chemicals under direct discharge conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ellenberg bioindicators values for European weeds were compared in two prairie managements with cattle and sheep on a volcanic soil of South-Central Chile. It was found that sheep grazing degrades the soil and vegetation cover much more that cattle grazing. These results corresponds to vegetation and soil differences found earlier in a plant sociological study, which found that the differences between both types of grazing established two different plant associations: Hyperico-Agrostietum capillariae (cattle grazing) and Airo-Agrostietum capillariae (sheep grazing). It was confirmed that with different kinds of management is very important the soil physical degradation, specially compactnees, that alters the quantity, size, distribution and orientation of the pores, changing the hydraulic conductivity and the air-water-soil ratio, determining the rooting of grasses. In both prairie is possible to distinguish different level of degradation, which ultimately allow the settlement of secondary shrub associations.. such as Aristotelio-Rubetum constrictae (zarzamora scrub) in the cattle pasture. The degradation of the sheep prairie concluded in a not studied Hips Rose bush. The values of biological indicators plant species, show that those microclimate conditions (light and temperature) tend to focus more on small sections of the scale, while those edaphic (reaction, nitrogen and soil moisture) are dispersed throughout the spectrum of indicators values. The indifferent species to the bioindicators increased with favourable conditions but decreased in extreme conditions. Finally it confirms the usefulness of applying the values of Ellenberg bioindicators in the anthropogenic Chilean prairies, plant Communities dominated by weeds of European origin, which can capture even small differences in handling, without requiring large investment of time and money.

AB  - There is currently very little information on the survival of discards of unwanted and unregulated catches of invertebrates after the stresses caused by capture. A great number of the unregulated invertebrate species form the basis of essential fish habitats for important fisheries resources such as hake, red mullet and cuttlefish. Thus, data on their survival after discarding may help to interpret the role of these species within the benthic ecosystems. Furthermore, descriptor 6 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (EU Directive 2008/56/E) foresees maintaining sea floor integrity at a level that ensures that the structure and functions of the ecosystems are safeguarded, and Article 7(d) of the Common Fisheries Policy (EU Reg. 1380/2013) foresees the implementation of management measures for fishing with low impact on the marine ecosystem and fishery resources. Survival measurements by direct recovery of tagged discarded species are not effective in bottom trawl fisheries, for which alternative studies such as semi-quantitative measures obtained on board prior to discarding can be considered as appropriate for mortality estimation. The present work assessed the survival of unwanted species using a semi-quantitative assessment on the deck of trawlers and at the laboratory for a period of 96 hours in two Mediterranean areas (the Catalan coast and the Ligurian and Northern Tyrrhenian seas). A high number of discarded invertebrates showed a high percentage of survival (>70%) in both assessments. The results can be used to provide information that can help to achieve higher survival levels of discarded specimens and enhance the productivity of fishing grounds by increasing the health of benthic ecosystems.

AB  - Area-delineated multiple-pass depletion electrofishing (ADEF) can be resource-intensive. It may not capture fish community state when resource limitations mean that the number of sites sampled in a system is insufficient to account for ecological heterogeneity. Rapid assessment techniques such as single-pass timed electrofishing could be more efficient and support increased sample size, but it is important to understand how resulting catches will relate to existing ADEF data/time series. Paired ADEF (3-pass) and single-pass timed (10-min) electrofishing (TEF) samples were collected for sites in the River Barrow catchment (Ireland) in 2015. Paired samples were used to derive species-specific size-based conversion factors (CF) for extrapolating TEF catch up to a predicted ADEF Pass 1 catch. Applying these CF to a set of independent 'validation' TEF samples (2008-2013) produced fish catch estimates similar to observed ADEF Pass 1 catches (2008-2015). Species size-distributions in extrapolated TEF data were also similar to those in paired ADEF Pass 1 samples. Pass 2 and Pass 3 catches by species were then predicted from extrapolated validation TEF catches using a regression model. Cumulative catch curves fitted to these predicted catches were similar to those fitted to observed ADEF catch data for most species. TEF samples provide estimates of fish species catch and size-distribution that can be extrapolated following a simple protocol and compared with ADEF data for small streams measuring up to 10 m in width.

AB  - Arctic and alpine ecosystems are strongly affected by rapidly changing environmental conditions, resulting in profound vegetation shifts, which are highly heterogeneous and hard to predict, yet have strong global impacts. Shrubs have been identified as a key driver of these shifts. In this study, we aim to improve the understanding of how such broad-scale vegetation changes are locally impacted by inter- and intraspecific plasticity and topographically driven heterogeneity in microsite conditions. We assessed continuous stem diameter variation of three dominant tundra shrub species at daily resolution during 5 years, using high-precision dendrometers, thus bridging the gap between classical dendroecology and plant physiology. From this data, we identified distinct growth patterns which we linked to microsite environmental drivers. The observed patterns appeared highly variable depending on site and species, strongly influenced by characteristics of the individual plant. As the main driver of this variability, we identified fine-scale topographic complexity, causing the sampled specimens to adjust locally by developing distinct growth strategies. We found these strategies strongly related to snow-cover variation and associated freezing and thawing. Predicted changes in winter conditions and associated snow regimes will therefore have strong effects on shrub growth and community structure, yet, these effects are highly complex and not uniform in direction. Synthesis. The ability to adapt in a heterogeneous environment appeared highly differentiated between species and closely connected to intraspecific plasticity. Here, we identified spatial variability related to local topography as a main indicator for potential future redistribution and niche shifts in response to environmental change.

AB  - The floristic observations presented below were carried out in 2011, on 5-acre plots delineated on an area of degraded soil. The soil-reclamation experiment, which began in June 2004, was set up on devastated soilless formation affected by the Jeziorko Sulfur Mine. In the experiment, the impact of different (200, 400, 800 m(3) ha(-1) doses of mineral wool and sewage sludge on characteristcis of the soilless formation was analyzed. The strongly acidic soilless formation (weak loamy sand) was reclaimed using flotation sludge in a dose of 100 t ha(-1) for de-acidification, and various combinations of mineral wool and sewage sludge. The sward sown on plots pretreated as above consisted of a clover reclamation mixture with the following composition: Festuca pratensis - 41.2%, Festuca rubra - 19.2%, Lolium perenne - 14.7%, Lolium multiflorum - 12.4%, Dactylis glomerata - 6.5%, Trifolium pratense - 6%. A phytoindication method was employed to assess the impact of different reclamation methods of soilless formation on shaping the habitat conditions. This assessment took into account the following indicators: soil moisture, trophism, pH, organic matter content, resistance to salinity and to an increased content of heavy metals. The method for soilless formation reclamation was found to produce an effect on the analyzed ecological factors. The most favorable habitat conditions were recorded in soil reclaimed with mineral wool; they were worse in soil reclaimed with mineral wool and treated with NPK, but the worst parameters occurred in soil with the addition of sewage sludge and mineral wool.

AB  - To provide insights into the long-term evolution of aquatic ecosystems without human interference, we here evaluate a decadal- to centennial-scale-resolution diatom record spanning about 12 ka of the Holsteinian interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage 11c). Using a partially varved sediment core from the Dethlingen palaeolake (northern Germany), which has previously been studied for palynological and microfacies signals, we document the co-evolution of the aquatic and surrounding terrestrial environment. The diatom record is dominated by the genera Stephanodiscus, Aulacoseira, Ulnaria and Fragilaria. Based on the diatom assemblages and physical sediment properties, the evolution of the Dethlingen palaeolake can be subdivided into three major phases. During the oldest phase (lasting approximate to 1900 varve years), the lake was approximate to 10-15m deep and characterized by anoxic bottom-water conditions and a high nutrient content. The following approximate to 5600 years exhibited water depths >20m, maximum diatom and Pediastrum productivity, and a peak in allochtonous nutrient input. During this phase, water-column mixing became more vigorous, resulting in a breakdown of anoxia. The youngest lake phase (approximate to 4000-5000 years) was characterized by decreasing water depth, turbulent water conditions and decreased nutrient loading. Based on our palaeolimnological data, we conclude that the evolution of the Dethlingen palaeolake during the Holsteinian interglacial responded closely to (i) changes within the catchment area (as documented by vegetation and sedimentation) related to the transition from closed forests growing on nutrient-rich soils (mesocratic forest phase) to open forests developing on poor soils (oligocratic forest phase), and (ii) short-term climate variability as reflected in centennial-scale climate perturbations.

AB  - The Purbeck-type section (Durlston Bay, Dorset, UK) exhibits littoral lagoonal to lacustrine facies. It shows a gradual climatic/environmental change from semi-arid conditions associated with evaporites at the Jurassic-Cretaceous transition, to a more humid climate at the end of the Berriasian. Though generally organic-poor (total organic carbon, TOC, <1.3%), the Durlston Bay section shows an orgarlic-rich episode (TOC up to 8.5%) located at the transition from evaporitic to more humid facies. A biomarker study was performed in order to determine the origin of the organic matter (OM) in the section and see if changes in organic sources accompanied the general environmental change.
   The distribution of alkanes, hopanes and steranes indicates that the origin of the OM is mainly algal/bacterial and only changed moderately with the climatic evolution. The saline and anoxic bottom water conditions indicated for most of the samples point to the recurrence of salinity stratification within the basin. A high contribution of odd numbered C-23-C-31 n-alkanes from algaenan-containing freshwater algae, in particular Botryococcus, is noted for all the samples, despite the low abundance of these organisms in the corresponding palynofacies. This prominence probably results from the high resistance to degradation and the selective preservation of Botryococcus-related lipids. The subtle balance of aridity and freshwater inputs favoured both an abundance of Botryococcus and the development of anoxia, leading to the enhanced preservation of OM during the intermediate climatic episode, while the conditions were less favourable during the semi-arid and more humid episodes.

AB  - Macrophage aggregates (MAs) occur in various organs of fishes, especially the kidney, liver and spleen, and contain melanin, ceroid/lipofuscin and hemosiderin pigments. They have been used as indicators of a number of natural and anthropogenic stressors. Macrophage aggregates occur in salmonids but are poorly organized, irregularly shaped, and are generally smaller than those in derived teleosts. These features complicate quantification, and thus these fishes have seldom been used in studies correlating MAs with environmental stressors. To alleviate these complications, we developed color filtering algorithms for use with the software package ImagePro Plus((R)) (Media Cybernetics) that select and quantify pigmented area (i.e. colors ranging from gold to brown to black) in tissue sections. Image analysis results compared well with subjective scoring when tested on brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss captured from high-elevation lakes or hatcheries. Macrophage aggregate pigments correlated positively with age and negatively with condition factor. Within individual fish, pigmentation correlated positively among organs, suggesting that the kidney, liver or spleen are suitable indicator organs. In age-matched fishes, MA pigments were not different between hatcheries and lakes in the organs examined. Between lakes, differences in pigments were observed in the kidney and spleen, but were not explained by age, condition factor, sex or maturation state. Our results indicate that quantification of the area occupied by MA pigments is an efficient and accurate means of evaluating MAs in salmonid organs and that organ pigmentation correlates with age and condition factor, as seen in studies with more derived fishes.

AB  - We studied the influence of environmental heterogeneity and dispersal processes on mesoscale distribution patterns of understorey plants in a 330 ha ancient, managed temperate forest area. Similarity matrix regression analysis showed that overall species similarity was affected by site (the two disjunct halves of the forest area), spatial autocorrelation at the 100 m scale, edaphic conditions, stand type and stand structure, and the occurrence of open areas, but not by stand age or topography. Using autologistic regression we analysed the influence of clumping, site, edaphic conditions, stand composition, open areas, and stand structure on the individual distribution patterns of the 60 most abundant species. Only five species had distributions that were not significantly related to any of the explanatory variables. A large number of species showed significant, and often differing, relationships to at least one of the environmental parameters. At least 20 species exhibited clumping at the 100 m scale that was independent of the environmental parameters. Principal coordinate analysis and an analysis using the Ellenberg ecological indicator values suggested that no important gradients had been overlooked. Dispersal ability (estimated from dispersal mode) and clumping independent of environmental heterogeneity were related. Poor dispersers exhibited stronger clumping at the 100 m scale than good dispersers. Our results support the joint importance of environmental heterogeneity and dispersal processes in shaping the mesoscale distribution patterns of forest herbs. We conclude that the distribution of plant species, and species coexistence and species composition in plant communities, cannot be explained without simultaneously considering environmental heterogeneity and dispersal.

AB  - In this study, we investigate and compare the response patterns of small mammal communities to increasing land use intensity in two study areas: private farmland at the southern boundary of Etosha National Park and smallholder farmland in Tsumeb agricultural area. Species richness, community composition and a standardized capture index (RCI) are compared between sites of (a) increasing grazing pressure of ungulates (Etosha) and (b) increasing conversion of bushland to arable land (Tsumeb). Within each study area, we found clear response patterns towards increasing land use intensity. However, patterns differ significantly between the two areas. Within the less-transformed area (Etosha), high land use intensity results in a decrease in the RCI but not species richness. Small mammal communities remain relatively stable, but ecosystem functions (e.g., bioturbation, seed dispersal) are weakened. Within the more-transformed area (Tsumeb), high land use intensity leads to a decrease in species richness and increasing RCIs of two common pest species. The disappearance of a balanced community and the dramatic increase in a few pest species has the potential to threaten human livelihoods (e.g., crop damage, disease vectors). Our comparative approach clearly indicates that Gerbilliscus leucogaster is a possible candidate for an ecological indicator of ecosystem integrity. Mastomys natalensis has the potential to become an important pest species when bushland is transformed into irrigated arable land. Our results support the importance of area-specific conservation and management measures in savanna ecosystems.

AB  - Matching habitat typology and ecological assemblages can be useful in environmental management. We examined whether a priori defined riverine sections correspond with distinct fish assemblage types along the >2000km long course of the Danube River, Europe. We also tested whether different sampling methods (i.e. day and night inshore electric fishing and offshore benthic trawling) provide consistent typological results. Analysis of assemblage similarities, indicator species analysis, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and k-means analyses indicated that fish assemblages of the a priori defined Upper-, Middle and Lower-Danubian sections differed slightly, but within class variability was high. Although indicator species analysis showed that the Upper-Danube belongs to the barbel (Barbus barbus) zone and the Middle- and Lower Danube belong to the bream (Abramis spp) zone, indicator values of the character species were generally low. The NMDS analyses suggested a weak gradient in assemblage structure along the course of the river with relatively high variability between neighbouring sites. K-means analyses revealed that many sampling sites were in a different class than the a priori defined sections, and classifications at other group numbers did not lead to better classification outcome. Overall, the results do not suggest clearly distinguishable assemblage types with distinct boundaries in the potamal section of a great river. Nevertheless, the division of the potamon to smaller sections may explain some variability in fish assemblage structure, and could be used for bioassessment purposes. The study also shows the importance of multihabitat and multigear surveys in the typological assessment of great rivers. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Charophytes (stoneworts) form a group of macrophytes that are considered sensitive to eutrophication. The high indicator value of charophytes toward eutrophication results in their wide use in the bioassessment systems. I explored the variability of stonewort communities' requirements for trophic conditions in lowland temperate lakes and attempted to determine the role of individual syntaxa in assessing the ecological status of lakes in Poland. The position of charophyte communities' niches along the trophic gradient was analysed using the Outlying Mean Index approach. A few stonewort communities, i.e., Nitelletum opacae, N. mucronatae, N. flexilis and Charetum filiformis appeared to be specialised concerning water quality and may be considered indicators of habitats less eutrophic than the "mean" trophic conditions in the study domain. Most stonewort communities were relatively common in European waters. Four of them, i.e., Charetum tomentosae, C. asperae, C. contrariae and Nitellopsidetum obtusae, can be classified as 'generalists' with low marginality and broad ecological tolerance. Most stonewort communities appeared in a broad range of ecological status classes. In the case of 15 communities, 6 to 25% of occurrences were observed in lakes representing a less than good status, and they cannot be considered indicative of good ecological conditions. However, the high taxonomic diversity and extensive phytolittoral zone were most likely to occur when the phytocoenoses of stoneworts were present. In lowland naturally eutrophic lakes inhabited by eurytopic species, the extraordinary role of charophytes in the assessment of the ecological status can be interpreted through their significant contribution to the development of the littoral.

AB  - The aim of this study aimed to investigate the effect of salinity levels on physiological and biochemical properties and tuberization yield of potato, cultivar Agria, in MS culture medium. After preparation and cultivation of tuber, the lateral aerial buds were removed after a few months and cultured in MS medium. After that, healthy samples were prepared and induced at the above-mentioned salinity stress level and transferred to the culture medium. Two weeks later, an air sample was taken, and the physiological and biochemical properties studied in this study (photosynthetic pigments, proline, soluble sugars, anthocyanins, phenolic compounds, and the activity of some antioxidant enzymes) were measured. Finally, salinity stress assessment was evaluated and studied in a fluid environment. The effects of stress on different stages of seedling growth in vitro conditions and the activity of photosynthetic and enzymatic pigments were investigated using spectrophotometric measurements and in accordance with their protocols. Data analysis of variance showed that salinity reduces photosynthetic pigments and salinity to a concentration of 50 mM, it is resistant to the addition of compounds such as soluble sugars, proline and antioxidant activity but at higher concentrations (75 and 100 mM), the plant is likely to be severely damaged due to excessive growth in active oxygen species. Therefore, due to the increase in antioxidant activity, it indicates an increase in the removal of active oxygen species, this feature is often used as an indicator to increase salinity tolerance. Research on the different ecological conditions in Iran, research is needed on other potato cultivars and molecular studies.

AB  - The community structure of pelagic zooplankton and micronekton may be a sensitive indicator of changes in environmental conditions within the California Current ecosystem. Substantial oceanographic changes in 2015 and 2016, due to the anomalously warm ocean conditions associated with a large-scale marine heatwave perturbation, resulted in onshore and northward advection of warmer and more stratified surface waters resulting in reduced upwelling. Here we quantify changes in the macrozooplankton and micronekton community composition and structure based on five highly contrasting ocean conditions. Data from fine-mesh pelagic trawl surveys conducted off Oregon and Washington during early summer of 2011 and 2013-2016 were examined for interannual changes in spatial distribution and abundance of fish and invertebrate taxa. Overall species diversity was highest in 2015 and lowest in 2011, but 2016 was similar to the other years, although the evenness was somewhat lower. The community of taxa in both 2015 and 2016 was significantly different from the previously sampled years. Crustacean plankton densities (especially Euphausiidae) were extremely low in both of these years, and the invertebrate composition became dominated mostly by gelatinous zooplankton. Fishes and cephalopods showed mixed trends overall, but some species such as age-0 Pacific hake were found in relatively high abundances mainly along the shelf break in 2015 and 2016. These results suggest dramatically different pelagic communities were present during the recent warm years with a greater contribution from offshore taxa, especially gelatinous taxa, during 2015 and 2016. The substantial reorganization of the pelagic community has the potential to lead to major alterations in trophic functioning in this normally productive ecosystem.

AB  - Aim. The aim of the research is to study the influence of various environmental factors (abiotic and biotic) on some fish-biological indicators in the cultivation of sturgeons with the use of a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). Methods. A complete biological analysis was carried out according to the generally accepted ichthyological methods. Monitoring of the hydrochemical regime in the RAS was carried out throughout the study period. The temperature and pH of water were measured daily and the concentration of oxygen in the basins was measured three times a day. Results. Taking into account that the fish specimens studied did not show any pathology and also taking into consideration their genetic homogeneity and absolutely identical conditions in the RAS, the findings obtained can be explained by the different degree of oxygen supply under artificial growth conditions. The results of the biochemical analysis show that the blood of fish grown in the RAS with an elevated oxygen content (experimental group) by the end of the experiment (4 weeks) contains an increased amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) which could lead to the observed difference in the dynamics of growth parameters of the young of the year. Conclusions. When the oxygen content of the water is below 70% the growth rate slows down, as food consumption is almost halved, while the saturation of O-2 by 40% is considered critical. When sterlet is grown to produce a high mass, it is necessary to set the temperature of the water in the pools in the interval of 21-220 degrees C in the ultrasonic complexes. For industrial cultivation of sterlet, we recommend using a planting density of 60 kg/m(3) .

AB  - Recently, two approaches to account for ecological differences in community composition have been developed: one based on trait differences (functional diversity) and another based on evolutionary history (phylogenetic diversity). Combining them allows an integrated view of processes structuring communities. The North Adriatic Karst is covered by species-rich grasslands, but land abandonment has resulted in replacement by woodlands. This creates a successional gradient along which environmental conditions may change, and different community assembly rules may apply. We sampled 56 plant communities in the Karst and used functional-phylogenetic distances to assess assembly along a successional gradient, from grasslands to shrublands and woodlands. We found 146 species, for which we measured functional traits and built a phylogenetic tree. The three successional stages were floristically different, with grasslands having species that are typical of harsher soil conditions and woodlands with species preferring milder soil conditions. All communities had higher functional than phylogenetic distances, implying that closely related species tended to be phenotypically dissimilar. When more importance was given to functional distances, most grasslands and some shrublands were underdispersed; when more importance was given to phylogenetic distances, only one grassland was underdispersed and one woodland was overdispersed. Combining functional and phylogenetic distances provided us with better estimates of ecological differences in a successional gradient, where environmental filters seem to be the dominant force in early stages and competitive exclusion becomes more important in later stages. Taking into account that sucessional stages are assembled by different rules is essential to predicting their behaviour under future environmental scenarios.

AB  - Droughts and changing rainfall patterns due to natural climate variability and climate change, threaten the livelihoods of Malawi's smallholder farmers, who constitute 80% of the population. Provision of seasonal climate forecasts (SCFs) is one means to potentially increase the resilience of rainfed farming to drought by informing farmers in their agricultural decisions. Local knowledge can play an important role in improving the value of SCFs, by making the forecast better-suited to the local environment and decision-making. This study explores whether the contextual relevance of the information provided in SCFs can be improved through the integration of farmers' local knowledge in three districts in central and southern Malawi. A forecast threshold model is established that uses meteorological indicators before the rainy season as predictors of dry conditions during that season. Local knowledge informs our selection of the meteorological indicators as potential predictors. Verification of forecasts made with this model shows that meteorological indicators based on local knowledge have a predictive value for forecasting dry conditions in the rainy season. The forecast skill differs per location, with increased skill in the Southern Highlands climate zone. In addition, the local knowledge indicators show increased predictive value in forecasting locally relevant dry conditions, in comparison to the currently-used El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indicators. We argue that the inclusion of local knowledge in the current drought information system of Malawi may improve the SCFs for farmers. We show that it is possible to capture local knowledge using observed station and climate reanalysis data. Our approach could benefit National Meteorological and Hydrological Services in the development of relevant climate services and support drought-risk reduction by humanitarian actors.

AB  - Soundscapes are promising indicators of marine habitat condition, yet this approach remains untested in many ecosystems, and soundscape-ecological relationships remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed soundscapes in kelp forest habitats off the coast of California, USA, in Channel Islands National Park. We investigated if (1) soundscape features correlated with ecological variables and (2) these features differed inside and outside of marine protected areas (MPAs). We recorded 1 min every 15 min at 5 sites from 12 May to 23 June 2018. Three sites were in MPAs with high kelp cover and low urchin density, while 2 were in adjacent, unprotected habitats with low kelp cover and high urchin density. To analyze the data, we calculated soundscape features using detection algorithms and acoustic indices, which we then correlated with annual ecological data from 2016 to 2018. We found that drivers of regime shifts in kelp forests, i.e. sea urchin density, kelp cover, and fish diversity, were significantly related to soundscape features. Sea urchin density was positively correlated and kelp cover negatively correlated with the rate of shrimp snaps. Fish species richness and abundance were positively correlated with the intensity and diel dynamics in the low-frequency bands that contained most fish vocalizations. This study demonstrates that marine soundscapes indicate the condition of kelp forests, which are vulnerable to destruction from urchin overgrazing. If marine soundscapes can reliably indicate the status of ecological drivers, then this approach could be a valuable complement to diver surveys in fully assessing marine ecosystem health.

AB  - Water quality is a central component of ecological assessments but less well characterized in wetlands than other waterbody types. The 2011 National Wetland Condition Assessment, spanning freshwater and brackish wetlands across the conterminous USA, provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine water quality patterns across broad wetland types and geographic scales. Surface water samples were obtained from 634 (56%) of sites visited. Total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), planktonic chlorophyll (CHLA), and specific conductance (SPCOND) ranged 4 orders of magnitude across sites and were inter-correlated. Woody versus herbaceous vegetation type was an important classifier, with herbaceous sites having standing water more often and generally higher pH, nutrients, and CHLA. Nutrient ratios spanned a range from P-limited to N-limited in most biogeographic regions, and increasing TP was associated with decreasing TN:TP ratios. Compared to national-scale data for other waterbody types (lakes, streams, marine nearshore), wetlands had generally higher TN and TP but not higher CHLA. Differences among biogeographic regions in water quality were concordant between inland wetlands and lakes, and between marine-coast wetlands and the marine nearshore. Associations of TN, TP, and CHLA to percent agriculture or natural land were stronger for the watershed scale than for smaller concentric buffer scales, suggesting that wetlands are influenced by landuse some distance away. SPCOND was related to landuse in inland wetlands but reflected seawater influence in marine-coast wetlands. Water quality exhibits the same general patterns and responses across wetlands as across other waterbody types and thus can provide a basis for ecological classification and condition assessment.

AB  - European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is the most abundant tree species in Serbia and is highly interesting for economic and ecological reasons. Today, forests are subject to various environmental stresses that lead to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species in plants. Existing beech forests in Serbia are exposed to stressful environmental conditions since they are living under ecological conditions barely within the limit of their requirements, and with the predicted climate change it will become endangered. The present study was designed to define and compare antioxidant capacity of beech populations from three localities (Kopaonik, Tara and Stara Planina) in order to assess their adaptability to oxidative stress caused by specific ecological conditions during investigated period. Total phenols, tannins, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins contents, proline, total protein, soluble protein, and pigment content were analyzed. Lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation intensity were also determined as indicators for oxidative damages. The antioxidant activity was investigated by using ferric reducing power, permanganate reducing antioxidant capacity and .OH, .NO, O-2.; and DPPH. scavenger activity. The extract from Kopaonik contained the highest amount of phenols, flavonoids, tannins and proanthocyanidins and had lowest malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl accumulation. The highest accumulation of proline and high accumulation of MDA were observed in the extract from Tara, the locality with the highest temperature. In the present study, extract from Kopaonik exhibited the highest reducing ability and DPPH. scavenger activity. The relatively high antioxidant capacity may be a determinant for beech acclimation processes, what could be an important tool for the improvement of breeding strategies and reforestation programmes for European beech.

AB  - The International Standards on Auditing (ISA) consider the understanding of the control environment as a basic phase of an auditor's assessment of internal control. This comprehension influences the nature, timing, extent and, ultimately, the quality of the procedures managed by auditors. Several studies have investigated the determinants and implications of control environment assessment, internal control evaluation, and audit quality. However, very few studies have adopted a human capital perspective and matched the number and type of the control environment elements considered during control environment evaluation with auditors' human capital attributes. Starting from these considerations, the paper examines the relationship between auditors' human capital attributes and the assessment of the control environment. Based on a survey of 100 Italian external auditors, this study reveals that auditors perceive "Communication and enforcement of integrity and ethical values" as a relevant element in undertaking control environment assessments. Moreover, the findings indicate that the type of audit firm (Big Four), the regional context (Northern Italy), and the auditor's degree specialization (accounting, finance and auditing) influence the control environment assessment. This study contributes to the literature by consolidating the use of human capital theory in the auditing domain and presenting new results that help clarify the relationship between human capital attributes and control environment evaluation. We have identified the human capital attributes of auditors that match a control environment evaluation based on all seven elements indicated by ISA 315.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the diversity of meadow ecosystems and the chemical composition of the meadow flora in a Natura 2000 site called the Pasleka River Valley, depending on the habitat conditions and management. Physical and chemical properties of the selected habitat components were studied and compared with the calculated bioindicators. Taking into account the dynamics of mursh formation in the organic soil's topmost layer and the habitat conditions in which such soils occur, grassland growing in areas with different land use was selected for the study. One meadow, lying about 50 m from the Pasleka River, was cut occassionaly. Another meadow, approx. 150 m from the river bank, was cut once, and yet another sampling site situated at a distance of ca 300 m from the river consisted of a meadow used intensively for hay-growing and as a pasture. The poorest floral composition was found on the wettest soil, i.e. on the occasionally cut meadow located in the nearest vicinity to the river. The available phosphorus content in soil, same as total nitrogen, decreased as the distance from the river increased. At a larger distance from the river, the available phosphorus content of the groundwater decreased and the available potassium content increased. The N-NO3 content in water drawn from the river was more than 2- to 4-fold higher than its content in the groundwater collected under the meadows. The highest content of macro and micronutrients was determined in the plant material from the meadow nearest to the river. The results prove that the developed bioindicators for plants do not always reflect the properties of a habitat.

AB  - Multigenerational studies have become of great interest in ecotoxicology since the consequence of parental exposure to contaminants on offspring generations was established in situ or in laboratory conditions. The present study mainly examined the chronic effects of external Cs-137 gamma irradiation exposure at 4 dose rates (control, 0.5, 5, and 50 mGy h(-1)) on adult zebrafish (F0) exposed for 10 d and their progeny (F1) exposed or unexposed for 4 to 5 d. The main endpoints investigated included parental reproductive performance, embryo-larval survival, DNA alterations, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in F0 and F1. No effects on reproductive success, fecundity, or egg fertilization rate were observed. However, drastic effects were observed on F1 exposed to 50 mGy h(-1), resulting in a mortality rate of 100%. The drastic effects were also observed when the progeny was not irradiated. It was demonstrated that the sensitivity of the embryos was mainly attributable to parental irradiation. Moreover, these drastic effects induced by adult irradiation disappeared over time when 10 d-irradiated adults were placed in a nonirradiated condition. Alterations in larval DNA were observed for the 3 dose rates, and an increase of ROS production was also shown for the 2 lowest dose rates. The present study improves our understanding of the consequences of parental exposure conditions to the progeny. Furthermore, it provides an incentive to take transmitted generational effects into account in ecological risk assessments. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB  - Environmental pollution and habitat loss are described as underlying causes for population declines in reptiles and especially affect species in agricultural landscapes. Studies dealing with effects of pesticide exposure on reptiles are limited, mainly addressing the orders Testudines and Crocodylia, but largely neglecting the most diverse reptile order Squamata (lizards and snakes). As a consequence, information regarding effects on their organisms, as well as exposure probability and pesticide uptake in the Reptilia has to be considered rather uncharted. We here ask how pesticide applications affect a widely distributed, synanthropic squamate species in Europe. We studied the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) with regard to enzymatic biomarkers of pesticide exposure (Glutathione-S-Transferase, Glutathione Reductase, Acetylcholinesterase) and body condition. Lizards were sampled from wild populations, along an exposure gradient (three exposed sites with differing land use intensity and one reference site). Our results suggest both dermal and oral uptake of pesticide formulations, with the former being especially relevant during the first two days after a pesticide application. Enzymatic activity slightly differed between exposure gradients, while showing overall similar patterns. Body condition of lizards decreased with increasing pesticide exposure. Furthermore, gender distribution was particularly skewed in favor to males within exposed sample sites. Although reptiles are not target organisms of pesticide applications, many species do come into contact with them, and most probably suffer from dermal and oral uptake. Thus, we believe it is indispensable for reptiles to be integrated in risk assessments in order to improve conservation practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diatom assemblages were selected as indicators of lake condition and to assess historical lake water quality changes in 257 lakes in the northeastern United States. The "top" (surface sediments, present-day) and "bottom" (generally from >30 cm deep, representing historical conditions) samples from sediment cores collected from lakes and reservoirs were analyzed for diatom assemblages. The distribution of diatom species was closely related to several environmental variables, primarily lake water pH, total phosphorus, and chloride. Using weighted-averaging calibration and regression approaches, we constructed predictive models to infer these variables from the diatom assemblages. The diatom-based inference models were then used to assess the current status of lake water quality and to assess historical changes in lake water conditions in natural lakes over the past 150 years. Changes were also assessed in reservoirs. Population estimates of historical changes in limnological variables were made for all lakes of the northeast United States and also for lakes in the Adirondacks, New England Uplands, and Coastal Lowlands/Plateau ecoregions. The extent of cultural impact has been quite variable among the ecoregions, with marked water quality deterioration occurring in hundreds of lakes. Chloride and phosphorus levels have increased, especially in lakes that currently have high concentrations. Low-pH lakes have become more common in all three ecoregions. The maximum abundance of low-pH lakes was recorded in the Adirondacks, an area receiving the highest acidic precipitation in the northeast. In the Coastal Lowlands/Plateau, there has been a clear increase in eutrophic lakes, as inferred by total phosphorus. This was accompanied by a marked increase in the number of lakes with high chloride levels.

AB  - The paper considers the results of geoecological and geophysical studies conducted in the Khojahasan Lake basin in the Western part of Baku. The main purpose of the work was to study the anthropogenic impact on geoecological conditions of the lake. To assess the development of exogenous geological processes in the coastal zone of the lake and their impact on the environment, geophysical studies were carried out by the vertical electric sounding (VES). From 1990 to 2014, the physical and chemical characteristics of water and sediments were studied in a representative section of the lake. Metal concentrations, including such toxic elements as Cu, Zn, Cd, Sr, Ba, Pb, Cr, and Ni, were determined in the trace element composition of bottom sediments. It was revealed that since the mid-XIX century and especially since the second half of the XX century the high rate of population growth and urbanization in the territory of the Absheron Peninsula (in the Republic of Azerbaijan the name Apsheron was changed to Absheron) led to intensive use of natural resources and increased anthropogenic load on the environment. Technogenesis actively violates the natural cycle of matter and energy in lakes (limnogenesis), along with other natural media, as lake basins are located in lowlands and often accumulate industrial, municipal, agricultural, and other discharges. Pollutants accumulated in the lake basin affect hydrobiochemical conditions, transform quantitative and qualitative indicators of the aquatic environment and bottom sediments. Factors affecting the lake landscape are genetically different, unequal in the degree and nature of the impact, as well as in duration.

AB  - Water is of paramount importance to all people who live in Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, Australia, but to the Arabana people, one of the Indigenous peoples of the region, it also holds immense cultural significance. Having lived in the region for thousands of years, Arabana people have developed their own methods to assess the ecological condition of their water sites. This paper presents the results of a collaborative project designed to develop a suite of cultural indicators for water sites in the Kati Thanda region. Based on field trips and a comprehensive desktop review, this paper presents the indicators or 'signs' used by the Arabana to assess condition. Key results show that although water has multiple values for the Arabana, water itself is understood as a series of sites within one country rather than as a series of ecosystems or types of water body. Further, the cultural indicators or the 'signs' by which Arabana people assess conditions are potentially synergistic with scientific indicators and include fauna, flora, quality, soil, and climatic dimensions. However, Arabana people also assess a site according to its history and the level of cultural knowledge about the site. The paper concludes with a reflection on whether or not these indicators can be used in more generic ways across the region to assist in broader river assessment processes. A cultural indicator schemata is suggested as a starting mechanism for identifying cultural indicators in other parts of Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, but the paper concludes by arguing that any effective implementation of such a schemata must involve Indigenous peoples at every level.

AB  - The bivalve's aquaculture industry is an important component of the economy in Eastern Canada. Seed collection is an initial and critical activity in most bivalve aquaculture industries including mussel farming in Prince Edward Island, production is entirely dependent on natural spat collection. Although seed supply is not a concern from a quantitative standpoint, there are growing concerns about the quality of natural seed. The general objective of this study was to identify and assess mussel seed quality criteria on the basis of physiological and biochemical status under laboratory and field conditions. The performance, as estimated by metabolic measurements, lipid class composition, multi-locus heterozygosity (MLH) and survival to stressful environment of seed from 6 different stocks sources was first compared under laboratory conditions at 12 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Results showed that MLH varied among the six sources of mussels in a way which is consistent with the physiological and biochemical indicators of seed quality. Mussels from Shippagan (New Brunswick) and Tracadie (Prince Edward Island) were found to have the highest quality scores and the best adaptive capacity to extreme water temperature under laboratory conditions. The results of the stock-site reciprocal field studies are in general agreement with those of the laboratory experiments with higher survival of mussels from Shippagan, Tracadie and St. Peters Bays in the various study sites. Our results suggest that the measure of MLH and survival curves at stressful temperature could be a good criteria combination to identify the improved survival potential of mussels stocks.

AB  - I present a three-dimensional disturbance severity model and illustrate the potential usefulness of the model for characterizing disturbance conditions caused by forest harvesting. Disturbance is most often described in terms of disturbance type, size and frequency, with less emphasis on severity. In addition, studies of disturbance impacts have emphasized the dominant tree and woody understory layers, overlooking the species-rich herbaceous layer. For a wide range of harvesting treatments (clearcutting to selection systems with and without site preparation), I characterized disturbance severity based on hypothesized patterns of canopy removal, understory vegetation removal and forest floor and soil modification. To illustrate the application of the model, I plotted the data from three studies in North American coniferous and mixed coniferous-deciduous forests in the three-dimensional diagram of disturbance severity, using actual measures of the degree of disturbance on each axis or estimates inferred from other related variables. The plotted points showed general agreement with the hypothesized ranges of disturbance severity for the treatments represented in these studies. The three axes of disturbance severity can be affected differently depending on disturbance type, emphasizing the importance of characterizing the degree of disturbance on each of these three axes. Short-term responses of the herbaceous layer are strongly influenced by disturbance severity on each of these three axes. Disturbance conditions must be quantified before vegetation indicators of these conditions can be identified. The conceptual model provides a framework for comparing forest harvesting treatments to natural disturbance events. These comparisons are critical to designing ecologically sustainable forest management strategies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study focused on assessing whether the effects of muscle fatigue on joint position sense are dependent upon the unilateral or bilateral nature of proprioceptive inputs. To this aim, a group of young adults performed an active contralateral concurrent ankle matching task in two conditions of support of the reference limb (active vs. passive) and two conditions of fatigue of the indicator limb (no fatigue vs. fatigue). In the absence of muscle fatigue, results failed to evidence significant difference of matching errors between the active and passive conditions of support. However, in the context of muscle fatigue, increased matching errors were observed in active but not passive condition of support. The deleterious effects of muscle fatigue on joint position sense were therefore dependent upon the laterality of the proprioceptive inputs related to muscle contraction. These results suggested that sensory weighting for proprioception gives priority to inputs available bilaterally over the ones available in a single limb only. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - 2016 marked the 25th anniversary of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. Terrestrial ice-free areas constitute approximately 0.18% of Antarctica, but represent the most biologically active, historically rich, and environmentally sensitive sites. Antarctic soils are easily disturbed and environmental legacies of human activities are scattered across the continent; many are remnants of the 1950s-1980s when environmental protection was less comprehensive than today. Adoption of the Environmental Protocol in 1991 represented an important and proactive shift in Antarctic governance, securing environmental protection as a fundamental tenet of the Treaty System. Twenty five years on standards of environmental management have greatly improved, yet environmental pressures are compounding. Shortcomings in the implementation of the Environmental Protocol exist due to disparities in cultural values, operational realities, and inconsistent environmental impact assessments among governments and National Antarctic Programs. Non-native species management remains underdeveloped; and there is inadequate representation of all biogeographic regions within the Protected Area system; therefore jeopardizing conservation of Antarctic biodiversity and the integrity of the soil environment. Fundamental improvements are required to address the current shortcomings and ensure effective environmental protection for the next 25 years, including: (1) increased multinational and multidisciplinary collaboration to answer targeted research questions addressing contemporary management challenges, (2) effective communication of science to policy makers and environmental managers to inform decision making, and (3) making the mandate of long-term monitoring of the terrestrial environment a high priority for all governments signatory to the Antarctic Treaty.

AB  - Stream conductivity reflects both landscape and anthropogenic interactions, although increasing chloride inputs from road salt in eastern North America is also important. Employing a spatially extensive database derived from the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS), we examined relationships of stream conductivity to landscape attributes and determined relationships between stream MBSS fish metrics, abundance, and biomass as well as fish assemblages by means of conductivity (as a chloride surrogate) to estimate potential effects. Background stream conductivity for the MBSS strata and Maryland L3 ecoregions ranged from 51 to 150 mu S/cm, with the Piedmont having the highest background conductivity (145-160 mu S/cm). For MBSS sites there were strong relationships of stream conductivity and chloride with both impervious surface and road density, and 0.26% of the MBSS sites exceeded the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's acute chloride criterion and 1.5% the chronic chloride criterion. For the Maryland Piedmont species assemblage, observed conductivity values between 230 and 540 mu S/cm caused important alterations in the biotic community as measured by the series of fish metrics, and thus affected fish species assemblages associated with chloride concentrations between 33 and 108 mg/L. Maryland coastal, coldwater, and highland species assemblages displayed variable responses of conductivity to fish metrics, abundance, and biomass. If regional conductivity and chloride levels continue to increase or remain high from road deicing owing to an increase in urbanization in a watershed or climatic changes, differences in stream fish assemblages and therefore fish diversity may become more apparent. Because of the linkage between salt usage and impervious road surfaces resulting from urbanization, it is important to manage effectively the use of road salt to protect biotic resources.

AB  - Synoptic surveys of fish assemblages captured using fyke nets typically use a soak time of one night. We questioned whether enough information was gained from maintaining the nets for a second night to justify both the additional effort and the resulting reduction in sites sampled per field season. We compared fyke net catches from one-night and two-night sets at Great Lakes coastal margin ecosystems. Re-setting nets for a second night increased species richness by an average ( SE) of 12 0.06%. This translated to an average of 2.5 +/- 0.25 additional species captured. Ordinations of the assemblage data revealed that one-night and two-night catches from the same site (catch pairs) were much more similar to each other than were catches from different sites: the Kendall's kappa concordance values between one-night catches and their two-night pairs measured along the first three ordination axes were 80%, 88%, and 87%, respectively. Catch pairs plotted more closely, Sorensen's distances were smaller, and assemblages were much more concordant than were pairs of catches randomly selected from different sites. Bootstrap analyses of catch species richness indicated that there was little difference between adding effort by increasing soak time versus adding effort by increasing the number of nets. Our data indicate that one- and two-night sets generally produce comparable assemblage data. For synoptic studies, the increase in statistical power gained by increasing the number of sites sampled will typically be more important than the moderate amount of additional information acquired by fishing sites for a second night.

AB  - Context. Understanding what constitutes high-quality habitat for threatened species is critical for conservation management planning. The endangered northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) has experienced an uneven range contraction among habitat types. Once common across multiple habitats of northern mainland Australia, declining populations have now contracted to rocky escarpments.
   Aim. The island refuge of Groote Eylandt, Northern Territory, Australia, has not experienced the declines as seen on mainland Australia. Here, northern quolls persist in both rocky escarpment and savanna woodland, which provides a rare opportunity to investigate the habitat quality of rocky escarpments and savanna woodland for the northern quoll.
   Methods. Northern quolls (n = 111) were trapped in both rocky escarpment (n = 61) and savanna woodland (n = 50) habitats before the breeding season (May). We conducted body condition assessment, scat analysis, and measured trophic niche breadth of individuals occupying each habitat type.
   Key results. Female quolls occupying rocky escarpments exhibited a lower body condition than did quolls occupying savanna woodland. Quolls from rocky escarpments consumed a significantly higher proportion of mammals and fed within a narrower dietary niche than did those occupying savanna woodland.
   Conclusions. Quolls had adapted to the dietary resources available within each habitat type, suggesting that the lack of quolls in savanna woodland on the mainland is due to factors other than availability of dietary resources.
   Implications. Groote Eylandt is of critical conservation significance, where high numbers of northern quolls exist in both rocky escarpment and savanna woodland habitats. For population viability on the mainland, managing threats such as feral predators and inappropriate fire regimes in savanna woodland, particularly those surrounding rocky escarpment, should be prioritised.

AB  - Parasite species have been widely used as fish host migration tag or as indicators of local pollution. In this paper our approach is to consider the entire parasite community as a biological indicator of the fish environmental conditions. Seven fish species belonging to the Apogonidae, Apogon bandanensis, A. cookii, A. doderleini, A. norfolkensis, A. trimaculatus, Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus and Fowleria variegata, were sampled on six stations in two bays (Grand-Rade and Sainte-Marie) around Noumea (New-Caledonia). The two bays are submitted to urban wastewater inputs alone or combined with additional industrial inputs which influences decrease from the inner part to the entrance of each bay. A total of 592 fish were dissected for macro parasite examination. Parasites were grouped according to their taxonomical rank and development stage for the analysis. We found an inconsistent effect of the confinement between the two bays, revealing that the parasite community is not the same in the two bays. Moreover, the encysted metacercariae found in the pericardic cavity were found to be significant indicators of the specific anthropogenically impacted environmental conditions prevailing in the inner parts of the two bays. Other parasite taxa were found to be significant indicators of specific environmental conditions in one or two stations among the six sampled. Results on parasite specificity and biological life cycle of the parasite taxa found in sampled Apogonid were further compared with environmental parameters. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The role of stress relieving enzymes during bud sprouting in grapevines has already been established in different varieties. However, data on 'Red Globe' variety under tropical conditions are not reported. The present study was conducted to generate data on stress relieving enzymatic activities during bud sprout in 'Red Globe' on different rootstocks under arid conditions of India. Influence of different rootstocks on stress relieving enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, ascorbic acid oxidase and polyphenol oxidase) involved in bud sprouting under tropical conditions with double pruning and single cropping pattern was evidenced. Positive interactions were observed between enzymatic activities of stress relieving enzymes, increased bud break (64.25 %) and reduction in days taken to bud sprout (8.43 days). Among the rootstocks under study, vines on 110R and own rooted vines have strong impact on stress relieving enzymes that resulted into early and increased bud sprouting. Also, the dynamics of enzymatic activity can be used as biological indicators for forecasting the end of bud dormancy and recommencement of growth.

AB  - Estuaries are dynamic transition zones linking freshwater and oceanic habitats. These productive ecosystems are threatened by a variety of stressors including human modification of coastal watersheds. In this study, we examined potential linkages between estuarine condition and the watershed using multimodel inference. We examined attributes at the watershed scale as well as those associated with riparian areas but found that they were highly correlated. We also examined whether attributes closer to the estuary were more strongly related to benthic invertebrate condition and found that this was not generally true. In contrast, variability within the estuary strongly impacted model results and suggests that future modeling should incorporate estuarine variability or focus on the individual stations within the estuary. Modeling estuarine condition indicated that inherent landscape structure (e.g., estuarine area, watershed area, watershed:estuary ratio) is important to predicting benthic invertebrate condition and needs to be considered in the context of watershed/ estuary planning and restoration.

AB  - The former tidal inlet Lake Veere was turned into a stagnant brackish lake in 1961. Ever since, the system has shown a continuous degradation. The current study shows the monitoring results for the macrozoobenthic communities and the abiotic conditions for the period 1990-2008. This includes the first step to remediation, the restoration of the exchange between the tidal marine Eastern Scheldt and Lake Veere in 2004. A continuous decline in water clearance co-occurring with decreasing macrofauna densities and richness was observed till 2004. Water quality (e.g., secchi depth, nutrient levels, and oxygen conditions) improved significantly after the measure at a higher salinity level with less variation. But the macrofauna densities, biomass, and diversity did not improve yet. First indications of changes in the benthic communities by arrival of new and returning species are however observed and show that restoration at macrofauna level follows the improved abiotic conditions with a delay of several years.

AB  - Socio-environmental indicators are important mechanisms for the communication of summary information or for the provision of solid bases on the quality of life of human beings. Therefore, in this study was elaborated a Household Quality Indicator (HQI), that integrated socio-environmental information from the Una River Watershed, using in your calculation demographic census data and geoprocessing techniques. This indicator ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents the most undesirable condition while 1 represents the desirable condition. All the census tracts present in the rural area in the study area had HQI values lower than 0.5 and were classified as inadequate, while almost all the census tracts present in the urban area presented values higher than 0.5 and, therefore, were classified as excellent. The areas classified as inadequate represent 76,4% of the study area. These lower than expected values are justified by the poor sanitation conditions present in the study area. The urban area compared to the rural area showed the best HQI values, justified by the population access to the best conditions of basic sanitation.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates' response to hydromorphological alterations and regulated flows along lowland rivers is still poorly known despite ecohydrology's fundamental role in river science. Along the Oglio River (Northern Italy), several water abstractions and dams break it into segments with varying hydraulic and morphological properties. Three types of a priori different environments were identified (dammed, downstream and free flowing sections), and macroinvertebrate communities were sampled from each zone. This study aimed (i) to investigate patterns of macroinvertebrate communities along a regulated lowland river by testing the a priori zones; (ii) to find macroinvertebrate taxa that served as indicators of the various hydrological conditions and (iii) to verify hydromorphological control over ecological macroinvertebrate traits resulting in different trait values in each identified zone. Macroinvertebrate community was characterized in a total of 63 stations by means of two quantitative approaches, each exploring a surface of 0.5m(2). The lowest richness values were found in dammed sites that tended toward lentic conditions. Ecnomidae (dammed zones), Limoniidae (downstream zones) and Heptageniidae (free flowing section) were identified as the best indicators of varying hydrological conditions. As suggested by the results of 4th Corner Method, environmental constraints define communities with different ecological traits. These results highlight hydromorphological control over macroinvertebrate community structure and reflect how regulated flows affect the Oglio River in terms of biodiversity, indicator taxa and ecological traits. The authors wish to stress the importance of considering the ecological effects of dams and impoundments on river systems in upstream areas as well as downstream.

AB  - Optical and geochemical techniques were applied to sedimentary organic matter from the profundal area of the Eocene Lake Prinz von Hessen, which formed in a pull-apart basin on the Sprendlinger Horst, near Darmstadt, Germany. Variations in total sulphur content ( S tot) and total organic carbon content (TOC), hydrogen index (HI), oxygen index (OI) and delta(13)C values of the organic matter were used to reconstruct the lake's filling history. Following an initial rapid deepening phase, open lake conditions developed with HI reaching more than 500 mg HC/g TOC and TOC values up to 40%. The productivity of the lake was probably high and organic matter preservation was enhanced by a stratified water column. As the lake began to fill with sediment and became shallower, TOC and HI values declined, as the lake water was better oxygenated and preservation conditions declined. delta(13)C values between -31 and -27parts per thousand are controlled by the mixing of aquatic ( algae and microbial mats) and terrigenous organic matter ( wood, spores, pollen and cuticles). Following a rapid drop in lake level, shallow lake conditions alternated with swamp deposits (lignites) in the basin center. The organic matter preserved during this stage is strictly terrigenous in nature and experienced oxic degradation (HI similar to 100 mg HC/g TOC). delta(13)C values between -26 and -24parts per thousand are typical for Eocene terrigenous matter. The inferred lake level fluctuations are interpreted to have been controlled by tectonic as well as climatic processes.

AB  - The Neogene strata of the onshore West Baram Province of NW Borneo contain organic rich rock formations particularly within the Sarawak basin. This basin is a proven prolific oil and gas province, thus has been a subject of great interest to characterise the nature of the organic source input and depositional environment conditions as well as thermal maturation. This study is performed on outcrop samples of Lambir, Miri and Tukau formations, which are of stratigraphic equivalence to the petroleum bearing cycles of the offshore West Baram delta province in Sarawak. The investigated mudstone samples are organic rich with a total organic carbon (TOC) content of more than 1.0 wt.%. The integration of elemental and molecular analyses indicates that there is no significant variation in the source input between these formations. The investigated biomarkers parameters achieved from acyclic isoprenoids, terpanes and steranes biomarkers of a saturated hydrocarbon biomarkers revealed that these sediments contain high contribution of land plants with minor marine organic matter input that was deposited and preserved under relatively oxic to suboxic conditions. This is further supported by low total sulphur (TS), high TOC/TN ratios, source and redox sensitive trace elements (V, Ni, Cr, Co and Mo) concentrations and their ratios, which suggest terrigenous source input deposited under oxic to suboxic conditions. Based on the analysed biomarker thermal maturity indicators, it may be deduced that the studied sediments are yet to enter the maturity stage for hydrocarbon generation, which is also supported by measured vitrinite reflectance values of 0.39-0.48% R-o.

AB  - The Grain for Green Project (GGP) is the largest land retirement/afforestation program in China: it was primarily initiated to reduce the soil erosion and improve the ecological conditions in the Loess Plateau in 1999. If effective, this massive regional effort will induce significant improvement in the vegetation conditions. At this time, the effectiveness of the GGP has not been well documented. Using Ansai County as a case study, we characterized the impact of the GGP on the land covers and landscape characteristics of this area by using multi-temporal Landsat MSS, TM and ETM+ images of 1978, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010. The results indicate that the land cover patterns and landscape characteristics in the county were greatly altered in a considerably short period. The implementation of the GGP increased the newly forested land substantially to 21.4% of the study area by 2010 at the cost of both cropland and shrub-grassland, which decreased by 46.3% and 18.8%, respectively, from 1995 to 2010. Consequently, the coverage of forested land (both older forest and newly forested land) increased from 12.4% in 1995 to 37.7% in 2010. Moreover, the GGP increased landscape fragmentation as indicated by a decreasing mean patch size and changes in class-level landscape indicators varied with land cover categories.

AB  - Prior to anthropogenic modifications, the historic Missouri River provided ecological conditions suitable for reproduction, growth, and survival of pallid sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus. However, little information is available to discern whether altered conditions in the contemporary Missouri River are suitable for feeding, growth and survival of endangered pallid sturgeon during the early life stages. In 2004 and 2007, nearly 600 000 pallid sturgeon free embryos and larvae were released in the upper Missouri River and survivors from these releases were collected during 20042010 to quantify natural growth rates and diet composition. Based on genetic analysis and known-age at release (117 days post-hatch, dph), age at capture (dph, years) could be determined for each survivor. Totals of 23 and 28 survivors from the 2004 and 2007 releases, respectively, were sampled. Growth of pallid sturgeon was rapid (1.91 mm day-1) during the initial 1348 dph, then slowed as fish approached maximum length (120140 mm) towards the end of the first growing season. The diet of young-of-year pallid sturgeon was comprised of Diptera larvae, Diptera pupae, and Ephemeroptera nymphs. Growth of pallid sturgeon from ages 16 years was about 48.0 mm year-1. This study provides the first assessment of natural growth and diet of young pallid sturgeon in the wild. Results depict pallid sturgeon growth trajectories that may be expected for naturally produced wild stocks under contemporary habitat conditions in the Missouri River and Yellowstone River.

AB  - There are disagreements on the use of standard biodiversity monitoring methods to promote community participation. This study combined three methods to investigate questions why monitor biodiversity, what biodiversity to monitor and how participatory biodiversity monitoring can be promoted in central Uganda in East Africa. The question of why biodiversity should be monitored concerns the justification for monitoring, while the question of what to monitor concerns the choice of biodiversity variables, and the question of how to monitor biodiversity concerns the links between the data generated from monitoring and problems associated particularly with regard to community participation. The study selected landscape and sampling scales (i.e. plots) for participatory monitoring of biodiversity. Herders identified main landscape patches and plant species. Herder value-weighted indicators, such as invasive species and range condition scores (i.e. composite indicators representing species palatability, composition, cover, density and richness) were used for measuring biodiversity in their grazing lands. To understand what biodiversity to monitor, we interpreted the correlation between biodiversity indicators and herder value-weighted range conditions. Herders defined biodiversity from a utilitarian perspective. which is inconsistent with the conventional scientific goals of biodiversity conservation which focus on preservation of the total species pool. To address the question of how to monitor biodiversity, evidence from the folk taxonomy of sampled plant species and other proxy biodiversity indicators, including herder value-weighted range condition scores, were compared to understand scale dependence. We inferred that the landscape scale monitoring was more sensitive to measuring biodiversity than the conventional scales of plots. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Five healthy volunteers consumed similar amounts of identical foods for 5 consecutive days. The concentration of pyrene and of benzo(a)pyrene was determined in each of the 15 meals by a short analytical method that included sample saponification, solvent extraction, and HPLC analysis. ne volunteers also provided three daily total volume 8-h urine samples for the duration of the study for the assessment of 1-hydroxypyrene, a biomarker of pyrene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure. Mean recoveries were 83 and 75%, respectively, for pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene in food. Daily dietary pyrene doses varied from 0.7 to 3 mug. Excluding two outliers consisting of meals containing charbroiled pork and beef, pyrene content in the meals estimated from the published literature data was correlated to the measured pyrene, but overestimated the actual concentration by ca. 70%. Despite the identical ingested doses of pyrene, there was a 50-76% (coefficient of variation) interindividual variability in the daily-excreted amount of 1-hydroxypyrene. Urinary excretion of this metabolite was not correlated with ingested dose of pyrene under the normal feeding conditions used in this study. Bioavailability, enzymatic polymorphism, and differences in enterohepatic cycling of the metabolite may contribute to the observed variability. It Was calculated that dietary pyrene intake accounts for between 87.5 and 99.8% of the sum of dietary and inhalation intake. From the presented data, unless the above-mentioned factors are taken into account, I-hydroxypyrene might not be a reliable bioindicator of ingested pyrene (PAHs) under normal feeding conditions.

AB  - The tropical forage grass Brachiaria humidicola (Bh) controls soil microbial nitrification via biological nitrification inhibition (BNI). The aim of our study was to verify if nitrate reductase activity (NRA) in Bh roots or leaves reflects in vivo performance of BNI in soils. NRA was measured in roots and leaves of contrasting accessions and apomictic hybrids of Bh grown under controlled greenhouse and natural field conditions. Nitrate (NO3-) contents were measured in soil solution and in Rh stem sap to validate NRA data. Potential soil nitrification rates (NRs) and leaf delta N-15 values were used to verify in vivo BNI by the NRA assay in the field study, NRA was detected in Bh leaves rather than roots, regardless of NO3- availability. NRA correlated with NO3- contents in soils and stem sap of contrasting Bh genotypes substantiating its reflectance of in vivo BM performance. Additionally, leaf NRA data from the field study significantly correlated with simultaneously collected NRs and leaf delta N-15 data. The leaf NRA assay facilitated a rapid screening of contrasting Bh genotypes for their differences in In vivo performance of BNI under field and greenhouse conditions, but inconsistency of the BNI potential by Bh germplasm was observed. Among Bh genotypes tested, leaf NRA was closely linked with nitrification activity, and consequently with actual BNI performance. It was concluded that NRA in leaves of Bh can serve as an indicator of in vivo BNI activity when complemented with established BNI methodologies (delta N-15, NRs) under greenhouse and field conditions.

AB  - The aim of the study was to describe epibenthic macroinvertebrates and demersal fish and to identify links between spatial patterns and habitat characteristics (sediment, salinity, oxygen and temperature). The research was performed in the Parila lagoon in Croatia; an important nursery ground where conditions in epibenthic community can have significant direct and indirect impact on fisheries. Diversity (30 species) and abundance (from 0 to 7 ind m(-2)) of epibenthic assemblages was low on all stations and showed remarkable seasonal changes. Such patchiness could support the estuarine quality paradox idea, i.e. the most abundant species are well adapted to changing conditions in a variable environment. The ecological analysis showed that total phosphorus concentration (TP), temperature (T) and salinity (S) were the main environmental parameters affecting community structure of the Parila lagoon. Six species listed as frequent (Nerophis ophidion, Zosterisessor ophiocephalus, Syngnathus typhle, Cerastoderma glaucum, Palaemon adspersus and Carcinus aestuarii) have a potential to be used as indicators of habitat quality. In terms of trophic diversity, community was dominated by carnivores and omnivores. Fish trophic index (above 2.7) indicated upward shift of the local food chain and towards mostly carnivorous species, while the absence of herbivorous species pointed to low environmental quality. The present study gives an insight into the current ecological conditions in the Parila lagoon. Further research about the sensitivity of these potential indicators to different types of pressure is necessary in order to select robust early-warning indicators framework.

AB  - The effect of iron (Fe) fertilization on biological productivity and community structure in the equatorial Pacific, a region with high nutrient and low chlorophyll concentrations, has been debated for many years. Here we present lipid biomarker and geochemical proxy records in a sediment core from the central equatorial Pacific spanning from 1100 to 600 ka to investigate the response of marine phytoplankton communities to eolian Fe supply and to assess links to environmental fluctuations during the Pleistocene. We found a strong link between change in eolian Fe input and phytoplankton community structure. Our data demonstrate that an increase in eolian Fe supply across the 800 ka boundary resulted in a shift in the major primary producer from coccolithophores (alkenones) to diatoms (epibrassicasterol) and dinoflagellates (dinosterol) at the study site. This strong link between changes in eolian Fe supply and the community structure of plankton during 800-600 ka may have been associated with a change in atmospheric and ocean conditions due to southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The lipid biomarker results show that such a high supply of eolian Fe might have led to a change in the dominant phytoplankton group. However, the opal record, which is often used as a primary productivity indicator, was not consistent with the biomarker results. Therefore, the results indicate that multi-proxy approaches should be used in paleoenvironmental studies because different proxies can reveal different aspects of environmental conditions, thus contributing to a better understanding of paleoceanographic conditions.

AB  - The influence of different land tenure and rangeland management systems on rangeland condition and livestock grazing capacity in African rangelands is not well documented. A rangeland condition assessment was carried out at 15 sites located in the communal grazing system, small-scale commercial grazing system and the large-scale commercial grazing system in Zimbabwe. Rangeland indicators assessed were: floristic composition, herbaceous biomass yield, shrub stem density and grazing capacity. Grass species composition and forage value were analysed using PROC FREQ procedure of SAS 9.3. Fisher's exact test was performed to test for independence of the grass variables between grazing systems. A one-way ANOVA was used to test for significant differences (P<0.05) in floristic composition, shrub stem density, herbaceous biomass yield and grazing capacity among the three grazing systems. It was observed that communal rangelands had significantly high levels of woody species, unpalatable wiry grass species, low biomass yield and were dominated by the invading shrub Helichyrsum kraussii compared with the other rangeland management systems. These results suggest that if control measures are not put in place, livestock production may not be feasible in communal rangelands in the near future because of high levels of rangeland deterioration when compared with the commercially managed rangelands. Furthermore, the observed high stem density of unpalatable woody species and the low grazing capacity of communal rangelands affect livestock production, a primary source of livelihood. This warrants a change in rangeland management system in favour of the rest-rotation grazing system, which is beneficial to both livestock and the range.

AB  - Detrimental effects of introduced fishes on native amphibian populations have prompted removal of introduced cutthroat (Oncorhynchus clarki), rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from naturally fishless lakes at Mt. Rainier National Park Washington (U.S.A.). Using paleolimnological indicators (diatoms, invertebrates, and sediment characteristics) in eight 480-year-old sediment cores from eight lakes we (1) derived estimates of baseline environmental conditions and natural variation, (2) assessed the effects of stocking naturally fishless lakes and (3) determined whether lakes returned to predisturbance conditions after fish removal (restoration). Diatom floras were relatively stable between 315 and 90 years before present in an lakes; we used this time period to define lake;specific "baseline" conditions. Dissimilarity analyses of diatoms revealed sustained, dramatic changes in diatom floras that occurred approximately, 80 years ago (when fish were introduced) in four of five stocked lakes whereas the diatom floras in two unstocked lakes had nor changed significantly in the last 315 years Diatoms were not preserved in an eighth lake. State changes also occurred in two lakes over 200 years before European settlement of the Pacific Northwest Preserved invertebrate densities fluctuated dramatically over time in all cores, providing a Pool reference for assessing the effects of fishes. Nevertheless, fish-invertebrate interactions have been demonstrated in other paleolimnological studies and may be useful for lower-elevation or more productive lakes Because diatom communities have not returned to predisturbance assemblages in restored lakes even 20-30 years after fish removal, we conclude that Mt Rainier lakes were not successfully restored by the removal of fishes.

AB  - In wetland ecosystems, macrophytes are sensitive to water level fluctuations. However, studies specific to the effects of water level fluctuations on distribution and composition of macrophytes are limited in sub-tropical floodplain wetlands of Nepal. This study aimed to examine the association between macrophytes and water levels in the floodplain wetlands of Koshi Tappu, in south-eastern Nepal. Sixty-four samples of macrophyte, along with twelve water quality parameters, five soil parameters and weekly water level information were collected from four shallow wetlands during summer, autumn, winter and spring over 2018 and 2019. Altogether, 52 macrophyte species belonging to 25 families were documented. Of them, 15, 6, 5 and 26 were emergent, submerged, floating and amphibian species, respectively. 10 species (5 emergent, 2 submerged, 2 floating and 1 amphibian species) were common across seasons. Regression analysis showed the decreasing trend in diversity, richness and evenness with increased water levels while at the same time overall macrophyte biomass increased. During summer, high water level supported the growth of floating invasive macrophytes, while medium and low water level during autumn and winter, respectively, supported submerged macrophytes. However, low-water level during spring supported emergent and amphibian macrophyte species. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that water depth and physico-chemical parameters such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, nitrate-nitrogen, and phosphate were highly correlated with macrophyte assemblages across the wetlands. The study elucidated that management of water levels can ensure ecological integrity of wetlands and hence maintain biodiversity, and provide key indicators of water quality change.

AB  - There is increasing international interest by water resource management agencies worldwide in developing the capacity for quantitative bioassessments of boatable rivers. This interest stems from legal mandates requiring assessments, plus growing recognition of the threats to such systems from multiple and co-varying stressors (e. g. chemical pollutants, physical habitat alterations, altered flow regimes, channel modifications and alien species). The elevated cost and inefficiencies of jurisdictionally- and taxonomically-segregated assessments is widely recognized, as is the desire to obtain comparable data that can be easily shared among political jurisdictions and ecological regions. The objectives, sampling methods, indicators, site-scale sampling designs and geographic extent of the resources being sampled differ among programmes, thereby limiting such data exchanges. Our objective in this paper is to review major biological assessment design alternatives for boatable rivers, with special attention given to the sample site length from which data are collected. We suggest that sufficient site length determinations should be based on the survey objectives, the relative heterogeneity of the habitat template, and the quality of data necessary for meeting programmatic data quality objectives. Future sampling effort studies should be designed to allow separate samples of several short sub-sites at many diverse sites to generate multiple data points for each site. Data from those multiple sub-sites should be analysed using randomization-based data evaluation methods. We hope that our recommendations will be useful to the maximum number of institutions, including those with limited funds and a purely local focus, as well as those responsible for sampling at continental geographic extents.

AB  - Environmental impacts of genetically modified crops are mandatorily assessed during their premarket phase. One of the areas of concern is the possible impact on nontarget organisms. Crops expressing Cry toxins might affect Lepidoptera larvae living outside cultivated fields, through pollen deposition on wild plants, which constitute their food source. While pollen toxicity varies among different events, possible exposure of nontarget species depends on the agro-environmental conditions. This study was conducted in two protected areas in Italy, characterized by different climatic conditions, where many Lepidoptera species thrive in proximity to maize cultivations. To estimate the possible exposure in absence of the actual stressor (e.g., Cry1-expressing maize plants), we conducted a two-year field survey of butterflies and weeds. Indicator species were selectedAglais (Inachis) io in the Northern site and Vanessa cardui in the Southern siteand their phenology was investigated. Pollen dispersal from maize fields was measured by collection in Petri dishes. Duration and frequency of exposure was defined by the overlap between pollen emission and presence of larvae on host plants. Different risk scenarios are expected in the two regions: highest exposure is foreseen for A. io in the Northern site, while minimal exposure is estimated for V. cardui in the Southern site. In the latter case, locally grown maize cultivars flower in mid-summer in coincidence with an aestivation period for several butterfly species due to hot and dry conditions. Moreover, host plants of V. cardui are at the end of their life cycle thus limiting food availability.

AB  - Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a diazotrophic and potentially toxic cyanobacterium that was initially thought to be confined to tropical freshwaters. Recently it appears to have expanded its range to more temperate regions of the globe. There are contrasting hypotheses to explain this spread including; dispersal of highly adapted strains or localised spread from warm refuges as climatic or environmental conditions change. C raciborskii was first detected in the isolated island nation of New Zealand in 2003, providing a unique opportunity to explore whether this recent identification is due to a new incursion or resultant from climatic or environmental change. Phylogenetic analysis (nifH, ITS1-L, ITS1-S, and rpoC1) of six strains isolated from two New Zealand lakes showed they were most closely related to those from South America, and suggest that the recent detection of this species was not due to a new incursion. Ten years of environmental data from three lakes (Waaki, Waikare and Whangape) experiencing blooms were analysed to identify potential reasons for recent C raciborskii blooms. This analysis showed that the relatively recent (within the last 20-30 years) collapses of extensive macrophyte stands in lakes Waaki, Waikare and Whangape have resulted in increased turbidity', low water column dissolved reactive phosphorus and seasonal shifts in the dissolved inorganic nitrogen availability, all conditions known to facilitate C raciborskii dominance. Collectively these data indicate that C. raciborskii has always been present in New Zealand, and that recent changes in environmental conditions in these lakes are now facilitating bloom events.

AB  - Driftwood that originates in the Siberian and North American boreal forest is the major source of wood to people in the treeless Arctic. It archives various kinds of data about climate, river flow, ocean and ice circulation, and other critical environmental and cultural characteristics in the north. Unlike wood in most other regions, it is often well preserved in arctic archaeological sites. The existence and renewal of driftwood are closely linked to specific climatic and ecological conditions that have changed through time (e.g., floods, river banks, storms, prevailing currents and winds, sea-ice circulation, etc.). These conditions differently affect the fall, circulation and delivery of driftwood to the coast, resulting in changes in abundance, distribution and intrinsic properties of the wood.
   Based on a review of existing literature supplemented by new data from Alaska, this paper details factors underlying the "dynamic of driftwood production" in terms of driftwood abundance and quality, and indigenous people's use of the resource. Oral history interviews in coastal and river communities of Alaska recorded knowledge on driftwood use and ecology. Driftwood samples were collected from accumulations along the northwest coast of Alaska and the south of the Chukotka Peninsula. Results show that the timing of treefall and river transport are crucial to the subsequent ocean circulation and may determine the size and quality of the wood. Ultimately, it conditions what coastal people could build or manufacture. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - [ 1] Integrating stakeholder values into the process of quantifying impairment of ecosystem functions is an important aspect of watershed assessment and planning. This study develops a classification and prioritization model to assess potential impairment in watersheds. A systematic evaluation of a broad set of abiotic, biotic, and human indicators of watershed structure and function was used to identify the level of degradation at a subbasin scale. Agencies and communities can use the method to effectively target and allocate resources to areas of greatest restoration need. The watershed performance measure ( WPM) developed in this study is composed of three major components: ( 1) hydrologic processes ( water quantity and quality), ( 2) biodiversity at a species scale ( core and priority habitat for rare and endangered species and species richness) and landscape scale ( impacts of fragmentation), and ( 3) urban impacts as assessed in the built environment ( effective impervious area) and population effects ( densities and density of toxic waste sites). Simulation modeling using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ( SWAT), monitoring information, and spatial analysis with GIS were used to assess each criterion in developing this model. Weights for attributes of potential impairment were determined through the use of the attribute prioritization procedure with a panel of expert stakeholders. This procedure uses preselected attributes and corresponding stakeholder values and is data intensive. The model was applied to all subbasins of the Chicopee River Watershed of western Massachusetts, an area with a mixture of rural, heavily forested lands, suburban, and urbanized areas. Highly impaired subbasins in one community were identified using this methodology and evaluated for principal forms of degradation and potential restoration policies and BMPs. This attribute-based prioritization method could be used in identifying baselines, prioritization policies, and adaptive community planning.

AB  - Individuals, communities, and societies ascribe a diverse array of values to landscapes. These values are shaped by the aesthetic, cultural, and recreational benefits and services provided by those landscapes. However, across the globe, processes such as urbanization, agricultural intensification, and abandonment are threatening landscape integrity, altering the personally meaningful connections people have toward specific places. Existing methods used to study landscape values, such as social surveys, are poorly suited to capture dynamic landscape-scale processes across large geographic extents. Social media data, by comparison, can be used to indirectly measure and identify valuable features of landscapes at a regional, continental, and perhaps even worldwide scale. We evaluate the usefulness of different social media platforms-Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram-and quantify landscape values at a continental scale. We find Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram data can be used to quantify landscape values, with features of Instagram being especially suitable due to its relatively large population of users and its functional ability of allowing users to attach personally meaningful comments and hashtags to their uploaded images. Although Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram have different user profiles, our analysis revealed similar patterns of landscape values across Europe across the three platforms. We also found variables describing accessibility, population density, income, mountainous terrain, or proximity towater explained a significant portion of observed variation across data from the different platforms. Social media data can be used to extend our understanding of how and where individuals ascribe value to landscapes across diverse social, political, and ecological boundaries.

AB  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates are considered effective bioindicators of ecosystem health due to their different sensitivities to habitat alteration and pollution. Macroinvertebrate community structures can be assessed using commonly used diversity-based approaches, however, functional trait-based approaches are increasingly introduced into bioassessments. The Hex River is subjected to intensive mining activities, while urban and industrial effluents, as well as treated and untreated sewage also contributes to pollution in the river. The present study aimed to assess macroinvertebrate responses to different stressors (nutrient and chemical, especially metal pollutants), determine whether diversity-based or trait-based approaches provide a better indication of responses and, to evaluate the relationship between metal bioaccumulation and macroinvertebrate responses to this multistressor environment. The mining impacts, in combination with urban, industrial and sewage effluent, altered the macroinvertebrate community structure of the Hex River. The species richness significantly decreased from reference conditions (39 species) to impacted conditions (24 species), while the total number of individuals in tolerant species gradually increased. The diversity-based approach indicated a clear difference between reference and impacted conditions but did not clearly differentiate between different stressors, while the trait-based approach distinguished the urban, industrial and sewage effluent sites from mining impacted sites. The use of both approaches is, therefore, recommended as both complement each other. From the present study, it is evident that macroinvertebrates can be considered as both reliable accumulation-, and response bioindicators to pollution from mining, as well as urban and industrial activities.

AB  - In this paper we summarized the published data on distribution, migration and accumulation of chemical forms of germanium in natural environment. Despite the germanium is found in lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere it is one of the least studied elements. It belongs to rare scattered elements with a relatively high migration capacity in the earth's crust and on its surface. Depending on the physical and chemical conditions, germanium possesses different properties, which determines the variety of ways of its migration. The nature and form of migration of germanium is not determined only by its chemical properties but also by interaction with various underground water addendums, the granulometric and chemical-mineralogical composition of soil-forming rocks and soils, biogenic and technogenic processes. The content of germanium in natural waters, soils and plants can vary widely and depends on many factors. In particular, its concentration in groundwater and surface water depends on the natural geological environment, pressure, temperature, meteorological and anthropogenic factors; soil by their type, region, features of soil-forming processes, chemical composition of the parent rocks, climatic conditions and amounts of organic substances; in plants by their species and varietal facilities, the growth stage of the plants, the availability of soils by this element, the forms of germanium compounds in the soil (inorganic or organic), the ability of soil to retain labile form of germanium and climatic conditions. We also underlined the insufficient level of germanium in human body due to low concentrations in the food and water. However, we suggested that any products with a high content of germanium may pose a risk to human health through its toxic effects.

AB  - Effective study and management of crops and forests would benefit greatly from useful plant-based indicators of the biological controls on evapotranspiration, and particularly stomatal conductance (g(s)). Given the strong influence of g(s) on bulk leaf water potential and turgor pressure (P), in vivo measurement of P may provide useful information about diurnal or seasonal dynamics of g(s). Moderate plant water stress affects the diurnal dynamics of P as leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (D) varies, and these dynamics correlate to g(s). Here, we explored relative changes in P in response to changes in D under mild drought conditions, and how these changes are linked to stomatal behaviour, and specifically to diurnal maximum g(s) (g(s,max)), one of the best indicators of plant water stress. We monitored ecophysiological and environmental variables, as well as a relative proxy for P, during three consecutive seasons in a hedgerow olive orchard where trees were supplied with different irrigation treatments to create well-watered and moderately water-stressed conditions. Our results demonstrated that the sensitivity of P to D correlated well with g(s,max) reached by the trees within a range in which variations in g(s) are the main diffusional limitation to photosynthesis. We further showed that this correlation held under a wide range of meteorological conditions and soil water availability. This turgor proxy measurement, which is much easier to measure than g(s), can facilitate the use of g(s,max) as an indicator of plant water stress and evapotranspiration in agriculture and plant science research.

AB  - This paper aims to discuss the applicability of the updated version of the Methodology for hydromorphological assessment of Romanian rivers developed in line with the Water Framework Directive in a special case (lowland rivers with small catchments and special characteristics due to the location close to Back Sea). The 11th hydro-morphological indicators that describe the deviation from the natural conditions of the hydrological regime, river continuity and morphological conditions have been calculated for five atypical lowland water bodies, based on the data sets generated by the Romanian National Hydrological and Hydrogeological Database. Subsequently, the values (scores) of uni-criteria indicators were used to calculate multi-criteria indicators in order to establish the final status of some elements (e.g. hydrological regime element). Most of the hydro-morphological indicators classify the analyzed water bodies mainly in quality classes I and II except some indicators in class III and IV (moderate and poor status) for example the riparian zone indicator. We used the "one out, all out" principle (the worst status of the elements used in the assessment) to classify the final hydro morphological status (in case of four out of five waterbodies the riparian zone indicator gave the final hydro-morphological status). The correct classification is important for taking measures to improve water quality. The results stress the necessity for an in-depth analysis of the link between hydro-morphological, physico-chemical and biological status as well as to further refine the hydro-morphological classification schemes at least for some river types. The final classification should be consistent across all 3 assessments required by Water Framework Directive (using hydro-morphological, physico-chemical and biological elements).

AB  - A number of developing countries have implemented forest tenure reforms, including community forestry, to achieve social justice. While many studies have assessed the impact of community forestry, few have examined how interventions of local forest institutions influence the conditions of forests and forest dwellers. This study addresses this gap by examining the impacts of forest management policies implemented by the Federation of Vista Hills, Kalongkong and Kakilingan Upland Farmers, Inc. (Federation) in Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. Specifically, the study aimed to: (1) examine these interventions in relation to livelihood, income, forest condition, and equity (LIFE) indicators; (2) measure the impacts of these interventions on LIFE indicators; (3) analyze relations between the interventions and LIFE indicators; and (4) identify policy implications to promote sustainable and equitable benefits from local forest governance. Data were compiled from a household-level survey, interviews, satellite image analysis, and a secondary data review. Correlation analysis was performed on the survey results. The Federation's interventions were found to have improved forest condition and equity. However, they had limited impact on livelihoods and no significant effect on household incomes. Hence, the Federation needs to undertake household-level initiatives to improve the financial capital of forest-dependent populations. Moreover, policy-makers should devolve the issuance of resource use permits to local Department of Environment and Natural Resources offices. Central forest policies, particularly those on forest resource utilization, require adaptation to local situations as incentives for forest-dependent populations to sustainably manage forest resources.

AB  - The highly migratory nature of bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix makes comprehensive study of their populations and their potential responses to factors such as competition, habitat degradation, and climate change difficult. Body composition is an important ecological reference point for fish; however, estimating body composition in fish has been limited by analytical and logistical costs. We applied bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to estimate one body composition component (percent dry weight) as a proxy of condition in bluefish. We used a tetra polar Quantum II BIA analyzer and measured electrical properties in the muscles of bluefish at two locations per fish (dorsal and ventral). In total, 96 bluefish ranging from 193 to 875 mm total length were used in model development and testing. On 59 of these fish BIA measures were taken at both 15 degrees C and 27 degrees C. Temperature had a significant negative effect on resistance and reactance. A subsample of these fish was then analyzed for dry weight as a percentage of their whole body weight (PDW), which is a good indicator of condition because it is highly correlated with fat content in fish. The BIA models predicting PDW inclusive of all lengths of bluefish were highly predictive for 15 degrees C (stepwise regression) and 27 degrees C. Regression (R(pred)(2)) values that estimate future predictive power suggest that both models were robust. Strong relationships between PDW and other body composition components, coupled with the BIA models presented here, provide the tools needed to quantitatively assess bluefish body composition across spatial and temporal scales for which assessment was previously impossible.

AB  - The avocado red mite Oligonychus yothersi (McGregor) is the major leaf pest in Chile's avocado orchards. It affects leaf physiology and makes it necessary to seek new natural enemies to interact with low population densities of O. yothersi. The potentiality of three predator mites: Cydnodromus picanus Ragusa, Amblyseius graminis Chant, and Galendromus occidentalis (Nesbitt) was evaluated under laboratory conditions (27 +/- 1.93 C, 87 +/- 3.61% H. R. and 16: 8 (L: D) photoperiod) on avocado leaf disks Persea americana Mill. var. Hass (empty set = 5 cm) by separately feeding eggs, immature, and adult females of O. yothersi, and registering postembryonic development, consumption, as well as life table parameters. The postembryonic development of C. picanus was significantly lower (5.46 days) compared to both A. graminis (7.33 days) and G. occidentalis (8.69 days) which were fed with immature O. yothersi. The life table parameters of C. picanus were net reproductive rate R-0 = 25.41, finite rate of increase lambda = 1.29, and mean generation time T = 12.46. The net intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was significantly higher for C. picanus (r(m) = 0.25) in contrast with G. occidentalis (r(m) = 0.19), while A. graminis showed r(m) = -0.06 indicating that its population didn't have descendants. Under laboratory conditions, rm registered by C. picanus is an indicator of its predatory potential to control O. yothersi. It can be assumed that the pest population reduction pattern could be maintained under field conditions.

AB  - Adaptive management (AM) is widely used as an approach for learning to improve resource management, but successful AM projects remain relatively uncommon, with few documented examples applied by natural resource management agencies. We used AM to provide insights into actions that would be most beneficial for the management of native tallgrass prairie plant communities in western Minnesota and eastern North and South Dakota, USA. After 9 yr of data collection and learning, we report on whether the condition of the prairie improved with management and which actions and frequency of action allowed improvement. Our approach to AM employed Bayesian inference to generate annual management recommendations at site- and state-dependent scales. We also used a logistic regression approach to complement the output from the AM model and evaluate the more general conditions that led to attaining management goals. Overall, the cover of native plants increased for low-quality sites, and among the management practices considered, we found that burning most effectively enhanced the native prairie plant community and increased the dominance of native indicator species. Contrary to expectations, the results also indicate that grazing on sites that started in a poor condition was less likely to show improvements in the native plant community. Complementing AM with more traditional statistical analyses can help inform the iterative double-loop learning phase of the AM framework. Adaptive management has many challenges, but we demonstrate that multi-agency AM can be successful. Keys to success include starting the project with an in-person, in-depth workshop; standardized protocols and a centralized database; a core project team with multi-disciplinary backgrounds; stability in project leadership; and regular communication to meet annual deadlines.

AB  - The 20th century was characterized by substantial change on a global scale. There were multiple wars and unrest, social and political transitions, technological innovation and widespread development that impacted every corner of the earth. In order to assess the sustainability implications of these changes, we conducted a study of three advanced nations particularly affected during this time: France, Germany and the United States (USA). All three nation states withstood these changes and yet continued to thrive, which speaks to their resilience. However, we were interested in determining whether any of these countries underwent a regime shift during this period and if they did, whether there was advanced warning that transition was imminent. This study seeks to evaluate systemic trends in each country by exploring key variables that describe its condition over time. We use Fisher Information to assess changing conditions in the nation states based on trends in social, economic and environmental variables and employ Bayes Theorem as an objective means of determining whether declines in Fisher information provide early warning signals of critical transitions. Results indicate that while the United States was relatively stable and France experienced a great deal of change during this period, only Germany appeared to undergo a regime shift. Further, each country exhibited decreasing Fisher information when approaching significant events (e.g., World Wars, Great Depression), and reflected unique mechanisms linked to dynamic changes in each nation state. This study highlights the potential of using trends in Fisher information as a sentinel for evaluating dynamic change and assessing resilience in coupled human and natural systems.

AB  - Many streams in the Mediterranean Basin have temporary flow regimes. While timing for seasonal drought is predictable, they undergo strong inter-annual variability in flow intensity. This high hydrological variability and associated ecological responses challenge the ecological status assessment of temporary streams, particularly when setting reference conditions. This study examined the effects of flow connectivity in aquatic macroinvertebrates from seven reference temporary streams across the Mediterranean Basin where hydrological variability and flow conditions are well studied. We tested for the effect of flow cessation on two streamflow indices and on community composition, and, by performing random forest and classification tree analyses we identified important biological predictors for classifying the aquatic state either as flowing or disconnected pools. Flow cessation was critical for one of the streamflow indices studied and for community composition. Macroinvertebrate families found to be important for classifying the aquatic state were Hydrophilidae, Simuliidae, Hydropsychidae, Planorbiidae, Heptageniidae and Gerridae. For biological traits, trait categories associated to feeding habits, food, locomotion and substrate relation were the most important and provided more accurate predictions compared to taxonomy. A combination of selected metrics and associated thresholds based on the most important biological predictors (i.e. Bio-AS Tool) were proposed in order to assess the aquatic state in reference temporary streams, especially in the absence of hydrological data. Although further development is needed, the tool can be of particular interest for monitoring, restoration, and conservation purposes, representing an important step towards an adequate management of temporary rivers not only in the Mediterranean Basin but also in other regions vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

AB  - Water column metabolism is a major component in the functioning of wetland ecosystems and can be used as an indicator of ecosystem health. The effect of hydrologic pulsing on water column metabolism was studied with 2 year's field data and a validated model for two 1-ha created riparian wetlands in Columbus, OH, USA. Aquatic gross primary productivity (GPP) was measured during hydrologic pulses the first week of April, May and June of 2004 and compared to GPP during steady flow-conditions in April, May and June 2005. Pulses reduced diurnal variation of water temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen, and negatively affected GPP rates. Mean GPP measured during hydrologic flood pulses was 5.4 +/- 2.6 kcal m(-2) day(-1), significantly lower than that measured for comparable months with steady-flow hydrology (10.8 +/- 3.3 kcal m(-2) day(-1)). Solar-normalized productivity values of 0.08 +/- 0.01% of solar energy during pulses and 0.2 +/- 0.02% for steady-flow conditions were also significantly different. Different hyperbolic curves of optimum productivity with water temperature were seen for pulsing and steady-flow conditions. A simulation model with hydrology, metabolism, and dissolved oxygen sub models was calibrated with 2005 steady-flow year data and validated with 2004 pulse year data. Results from both the field study and model simulations suggest that there was a threshold hydraulic inflow rate between 30 and 50 cm day(-1) where aquatic metabolism became negatively affected by flow.

AB  - Psidium guajava L., Psidium cattleyanum Sabine and Mangifera indica L. were tested under field conditions as possible tropical bioindicators of industrial air pollution, The study was performed around the industrial complex of Cubatao, SE Brazil, which comprises 23 industries, including fertilizer, cement, chemical, petrochemical, and steel plants, with 110 production units and 260 emission sources of pollutants. Saplings were exposed to environmental conditions during four periods of 16 weeks each (September 1994-September 1995), at four different sites in the coastal mountains near the industrial complex: the Valley of Piloes River (VP), the reference area; the Valley of Mogi River (VM), with high contamination of particulate matter, fluorides (F), sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) compounds; Caminho do Mar (CM1, CM2), mainly affected by organic pollutants, S and N compounds, and secondary pollutants; and Paranapiacaba (PP), affected by secondary pollutants, such as ozone. M. indica did not adapt to the climatic conditions at the exposure sites. In the two Psidium species, the presence of visible symptoms, root/shoot ratio, foliar contents of F, S and N, amounts of ascorbate (AA) and water-soluble thiols (-SH), as well as peroxidase activity (POD) were determined. P guajava showed higher foliar accumulation of F, S and N, more pronounced alterations of biochemical indicators, and less visible leaf injury than P. cattleyanum. P guajava may be used as an accumulative indicator in tropical climates, while further studies will be needed before P. cattleyanum might be applied as a sensitive species in biomonitoring programs.

AB  - Standardized methods for estimating the toxicity of anthropogenic compounds to aquatic organisms frequently fail to consider key elements of the lest organisms' environment. Aquatic organisms exist in a fluid environment, and fluid dynamics may have an important influence on the response to toxicants. Rotifers are one of the three major groups of zooplankton and have been increasingly utilized in standardized toxicity testing. However, like other toxicity tests, assays with the species Brachionus calyciflorus are performed under static conditions in the absence of fluid motion. We investigated how fluid motion modifies pentachlorophenol (PCP) toxicity to B. calyciflorus using 24 h acute and 48 h reproductive toxicity tests. Estimates of PCP LC50s and reproduction EC50s in static conditions decreased from 738 and 1082 mug l(-1), respectively, to as low as 262 and 136 mug l(-1), respectively, in fluid motion. Flow analysis indicated that increased toxicant sensitivity can occur at ecologically relevant levels of fluid motion. Mechanistic studies indicated that fluid motion/toxicant interactions may result from the ability of fluid motion to cause shear stress, alter toxicant uptake, and/or alter the bioavailability of food. As fluid motion may have an important effect on the life histories of a wide variety of aquatic organisms, fluid motion/toxicant interactions may be an important consideration in other standard test organisms. These results raise questions about the accuracy of ecological risk assessments based on toxicity data from static conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Companies that implement Integrated Management Systems (IMS) require approaches that optimize resources and results. In the case of IMS of a new or emerging nature, the use of dynamics risk analysis approaches and the integration of real-time monitoring data in the risk assessment process offers news perspectives. The objective of this work is to identify and classify leading indicators that facilitate the dynamic analyses of emerging risks in an IMS for quality, environment, and safety. For it, such indicator analysis has been based on a bibliographic analysis. Regarding results, firstly, a structure of indicators emerges configured of three categories organized in two levels. At the first level, it is established by the indicators of the IMS which can be integrated. The second level is configured of two categories of interrelated indicators, that is, process integrity indicators and occupational risks indicators. In turn, each of these three categories has two dimensions. The first dimension represents the direction of the indicator, leading or lagging indicator. The second dimension represents the risk nature, emerging or traditional risk. Secondly, a classification of the leading indicators is derived according to the categories of the indicators and the risk nature. This classification shows the direction of the leading indicators as well as qualitative graduation of the potential associated consequences. Said theoretical framework has been applied to a case study configured by a manufacturing process. Thus, a conceptual scheme has been developed that represents the first step towards a more in-depth and detailed development that allows the identification and definition of specific leading indicators within an IMS from a dynamic and emerging risk perspective.

AB  - Many fish multimetric indices have been proposed worldwide during the last two decades to assess ecological quality of estuaries. Methods and monitoring plans consist often in the application of a sampling protocol and calculation of these indices, and are usually performed without a marked intervention of experts. Also, these surveys are resource demanding and its cost-effectiveness is generally not discussed. In this study, we analyzed the assessments made by experts of the ecological quality of estuaries based on fish data and we compared these evaluations with those given by the Estuarine Fish Assessment Index (EFAI) developed to estimate the quality of Portuguese estuaries. Twenty-four virtual data sets, simulated based on real fish data collected in Portuguese estuaries, were used in the analyses. Seventeen Portuguese experts were requested to determine their ecological quality and the EFAI was also calculated for each data set. For most of the systems, the assessments made by the experts were relatively close between them, and the levels of agreement between the experts and ecological quality status (EQS) obtained from the EFAI were high. The number and type of criteria used by experts differed, although some communalities were found. A positive relationship between the number of criteria used and the level of agreement was also noticed. The utilization of fish-based indices presents several advantages, namely the standardization of criteria used and critical boundaries assigning EQS of the systems, but expert judgments can indeed be of major relevance in assessments.

AB  - After the launching of the health reform in the sphere of primary medical aid and a comparatively successful 20-years' accomplishment, a need has arisen for an update of the medical standards ratifying the activity of the general medical practice (2011). The study of the work of the general practitioner in an ergonomic aspect requires the construction of a reliable complex of methodological studies providing a realistic assessment of the organization of the working process and of basic psycho- physical functions in the daily and weekly dynamics, carried out on the background of a dominant attachment of the physician to the chosen area of expertise.
   The basic approaches for determination of the structure and expenses of the working time, or the efficiency coefficient ( EC) respectively and intensity of labour involve the photochronometric- and the method of linear timing (also tracing the synchronization of the activity of the medical team); the spatial timing measuring the working trajectories, evidencing the degree of provision of functional working equipment and the objective conditions of labour. Sociological studies provide data on the style of communication with the patient and the occurrence of dilemmas of bioethical nature, as well as the strategies for their overcoming; sanitary and hygienic conditions of the working environment and their observation in accordance with the required criteria and indicators.
   The methodologies enable objective assessment of the workload and structure of the physician's working time and the resulting fatigue. Preconditions are created for the implementation of optimal organizational and technological operations in the provision of medical services, aiming to increase in the efficiency of the working process, and establishment of a physiological regime of labour in the general medical practice within the framework of the effective legislation.

AB  - Yushenfu mining area is located in the transitional zone between the Mu Us Desert and the hilly and gully region of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The earth's surface of this area is covered by thick and unconsolidated sand and soil along with arid weather and sparse vegetation throughout the year. The coal seam in this mining area is characterized by shallow burial, large mining thickness and thin bedrock which often leads to a series of ecological environmental damages when coal mining. By analyzing mining subsidence, groundwater damage and formation mechanism of ecological environmental damage in Yushenfu mining area, it is believed that mining subsidence is the most important and fundamental damage which is formed by joint influence and interaction of coal occurrence conditions and coal mining design conditions. Groundwater damage and ecological environmental damage are the chain reaction and derivative damage of mining subsidence. The impact indexes of mining subsidence are screened, and five indicators are selected to represent the mining subsidence subsystem, including perturbation coefficient, width/depth ratio, synthetical Protodyakonov coefficient of overlying rocks, sinking coefficient and depth/thickness ratio. Based on the single factor and comprehensive evaluation of the ecological environmental damage of 12 evaluation sample mines in Yushenfu mining area, it is considered that the mining subsidence damage in this area is serious as a whole with spatial distribution patterns, and the quality grade of ecological environment conditions is by and large between good and general. Effective control and treatment of mining subsidence damage will play a decisive role in the control and reduction of ecological environmental damage in the whole Yushenfu mining area.

AB  - Understanding the role of interspecific interactions in shaping ecological communities is one of the central goals in community ecology. In fungal communities, measuring interspecific interactions directly is challenging because these communities are composed of large numbers of species, many of which are unculturable. An indirect way of assessing the role of interspecific interactions in determining community structure is to identify the species co-occurrences that are not constrained by environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated co-occurrences among root-associated fungi, asking whether fungi co-occur more or less strongly than expected based on the environmental conditions and the host plant species examined. We generated molecular data on root-associated fungi of five plant species evenly sampled along an elevational gradient at a high arctic site. We analysed the data using a joint species distribution modelling approach that allowed us to identify those co-occurrences that could be explained by the environmental conditions and the host plant species, as well as those co-occurrences that remained unexplained and thus more probably reflect interactive associations. Our results indicate that not only negative but also positive interactions play an important role in shaping microbial communities in arctic plant roots. In particular, we found that mycorrhizal fungi are especially prone to positively co-occur with other fungal species. Our results bring new understanding to the structure of arctic interaction networks by suggesting that interactions among root-associated fungi are predominantly positive.

AB  - Sexual selection based on signaling requires that signals used by females in mate choice are reliable indicators of a male's heritable total fitness. A signal and the preference for it are expected to be heritable, resulting in the maintenance of genetic covariance between these two traits. However, a recent article has proposed that signals may quickly become unreliable in the presence of both environmental variation and genotype-by-environment interaction (G x E) with crossing reaction norms, potentially compromising the mechanisms of sexual selection. Here we examine the heritability and plasticity of a male dominance advertisement in the bank vole, Clethrionomys glareolus, in stable and changing rearing environments from father to son. The bank vole is naturally exposed to considerable sources of spatial and temporal environmental variation and male reproductive success is determined by both intra- (male-male competition) and inter- (females prefer to mate with dominant males) sexual selection. Significant G x E for male dominance was found with crossing reaction norms. Plasma testosterone level (T), rather than condition, determined a male's dominance and T also showed a significant G x E. Dominance showed a considerable plasticity across environments, but was only heritable under stable conditions. We document a negative between-environments correlation of male dominance, suggesting that when the environment changes between father and son, the dominance signal is unreliable to females and sexual selection may be compromised. We discuss how G x E and environmental variation interacting with other mechanisms may preserve the reliability of signals and thus the mechanism of sexual selection itself.

AB  - Baseline and historical environmental data are sparse in high-altitude regions. Diatom assemblages preserved in lake sediment records can, however, provide proxy data of past environmental and biological conditions. Sediment cores were retrieved from 209 high altitude lakes from 11 countries in Europe. Diatoms were extracted and counted from surface-sediment samples and sediments representing pre-industrial conditions. Regional changes in diatom assemblages covering at least the last c. 150 years are discussed and quantified using ordination techniques and dissimilarity indices. Distinct changes in diatom composition are identified and regional patterns highlighted, with two lake regions showing particularly large changes in diatom composition (Central Swiss Alps and the Pyrenees). Several driving mechanisms that might have caused the changes in the diatom community are discussed. Pre-industrial and present-day lake-water pH are inferred from the diatom assemblages and their prediction accuracy compared to contemporary water-chemistry measurements for each lake. Regional pH changes are minimal with no lake region exceeding 0.27 pH units of change in the period covering the last c. 150 years. The majority of lakes studied show an increase in planktonic diatom species over the period covering the past c. 150 years. We hypothesise that changes in the ratio of planktonic to non-planktonic diatoms within the study lake-regions are related to changes in climate and to associated changes in nutrients, ice-cover and erosion caused by climate warming.

AB  - Natural cycles in the seawater partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Gulf of Maine, which vary in surface waters from similar to 250 to 550 mu atm seasonally, provide an opportunity to observe how the life cycle and phenology of the shelled pteropod Limacina retroversa responds to changing food, temperature and carbonate chemistry conditions. Distributional, hydrographic, and physiological sampling suggest that pteropod populations are located in the upper portion of the water column (0-150 m) with a maximum abundance above 50 m. Gene expression and shell condition measurements show that the population already experiences biomineralization stress in the winter months when measured aragonite saturation state was at a seasonal low (though slightly oversaturated), reinforcing the usefulness of this organism as a bio-indicator for pelagic ecosystem response to ocean acidification. There appear to be two reproductive events per year with one pulse timed to coincide with the spring bloom, the period with highest respiration rate, fluorescence, and pH, and a second more extended pulse in the late summer and fall when saturation states remain high and fluorescence begins to decline. During the fall there is transcriptomic evidence of lipid storage for overwintering, allowing the second generation to survive the period of low food and aragonite saturation state. Based on these observations we predict that in the future pteropods will likely be most vulnerable to changing CO2 regionally during the fall reproductive event when CO2 concentration already naturally rises and when there is the added stress of generating lipid stores.

AB  - The search for early indicators of stress (biomarkers) with low cost of determination (both economic and logistic) is a prominent issue in environmental studies. Consequently, an experimental study was conducted with the aim of validating the leaf shape variations as an early biomarker in plants growing in contaminated soils. We manipulated the Pb (0, 45 and 90 mu M) and salt (0 and 598 mM NaCl) concentrations to evaluate their accumulation pattern, and their effect in biomass, leaf shape, photosynthetic pigments, phenolic contents, antioxidant enzyme activities, and lipid peroxidation in Limonium brasiliense. Results showed that growth and chlorophylls pigments synthesis in L. brasiliense are mainly impacted by Pb rise. Furthermore, the activities of the antioxidant enzymes and the lipid peroxidation both were increased by the Pb and salt addition; whereas phenolic content appeared to be more sensitive to salinity rise. On the other hand, changes in leaf shape were induced with Pb principally, and salt rise. The plants growing under stress conditions (Pb and salt treatments) showed expanded petioles and lanceolate limbos. Pb concentrations were always higher in roots than in aerial structures, suggesting that L. brasiliense could be a good candidate to the phytostabilization of Pb in polluted soils. The agreement in the changes of the several response variables measured as a product of the manipulated stressful factors suggests that L. brasiliense is a suitable bioindicator and their phenotypic plasticity is an early biomarker of stress by contamination. Leaf shape resulted to be a useful, practical and low-cost biomarker of stress on plants growing on polluted environmental conditions.

AB  - Context The effects of global climate change are threatening biodiversity, with particular concern for amphibians, whose survival often depends on specific abiotic conditions. To predict how future climate change will affect amphibian populations, it is first necessary to understand how patterns of abundance are shaped by multiple environmental conditions at both local and regional scales.
   Objectives Plethodontid salamander are a group of lungless ectotherms that require cool and moist habitats to survive. While the broad elevational distribution and abundance patterns are well-understood, other important abiotic gradients exist within montane systems that are contributing to fine-scale spatial abundance patterns. We aim to assess the fine-scale spatial abundance of a plethodontid salamander across two key environmental gradients: temperature and moisture.
   Methods We conducted area-constrained repeated point-count surveys at plots situated across temperature and moisture gradients in western North Carolina. Each plot was surveyed on 4 occasions, and site and survey-level covariates were measured.
   Results We found heterogeneous abundance patterns across these two gradients whereby warmer low elevations contain the greatest abundance near stream sides, where conditions are cooler and wetter than the regional landscape. At cooler, higher elevations, salamanders are distributed more uniformly across the broader landscape, likely as a result of the suitable regional climate.
   Conclusions Fine-scale habitat associations of plethodontids are driven by temperature and moisture, and the spatial patterns of suitable microhabitats drive regional scale patterns. Incorporating multiple environmental gradients provides a more biologically relevant prediction of abundance patterns, which will help inform conservation and management strategies especially in the context of climate change.

AB  - in tropical central Viet Nam, as part of a forest allocation program, forest condition should be monitored by local stakeholders. If local ecological knowledge can be integrated into the development of indicator species, then improvements in both the rigor of the indicator list and the involvement of local people in the monitoring process may occur. We used a dual methodology to derive two forest condition indicator species lists using trees, based on local ecological knowledge and quantitative forest surveys. Combining these lists allowed us to produce a final list of thirteen 'probable' and eight 'possible' indicator tree species for forest condition monitoring. Despite some possible limitations to the methodology, we encourage the use of multiple data sets when working with rural communities that are involved in the monitoring process. Local people can propose timely and appropriate measures of forest conservation and improvement, and can definitely integrate indicator species into monitoring community forests.

AB  - The relevance of the research corresponds to modern trends in the development of science and technology and is determined by social tasks in the meeting human needs in providing a comfortable environment within the common lands of specific localities. Man is a part of nature itself and his whole life is inextricably linked with nature. Man, and his work become an active principle that transforms nature. It is necessary to pay attention to the changes in the landscape, the violation of the integrity of natural complexes, and the environmental pollution. In addition, prevent the deterioration of the environmental situation, predetermined by the intensification of anthropogenic pressure on the environment. The article describes the approaches to the study of patterns of the social-geographical parameters of regional environmental management. The variant of the author's methodology for the study of social-geographical aspects of public nature management and assessment of aesthetic and consumer parameters of the environment is proposed and tested. The case study was conducted in the rural village Streletskoe, Krasnogvardeisky district of Belgorod region. Based on the results of the study, we obtained significant results of social-geographical parameters of regional environmental management. In conclusion the population of the Streletskoye rural settlement is definitely characterized by its own specific socio-geographical parameters of natural resource management. Thus, the results obtained can be used in the territorial scheme of nature protection, in the General plan of settlements, during the environmental assessment, and also in the future can serve as a basis for the implementation of landscape planning. Research materials can be used as local history material.

AB  - Context Modifications to land surface thermal regime by climate change and land cover/land-use change may influence ecosystem structure and function in arid landscapes, but relevant studies are scarce. Large changes in the land surface thermal regime can disturb the hydro-ecological integrity of these landscapes. Thus, it is important to assess landscape change and ecological risk to promote arid landscape sustainability. Objectives This study predicted the landscape change and quantified the Bayanbulak ecological risk evolution through a susceptibility-hazard assessment system. Methods CA-Markov model was used to simulate the landscape change, while ERA model that builds the susceptibility-hazard indices rapport was applied to evaluate the Bayanbulak wetland ecological risk using 30 m remotely sensed data. Results Findings unveiled that modifications in water, meadow, and marshes are predicted to decline at a rate of 39.3, 6.32, 23.98% in 2069 respectively. As wetland hazard, the LST average increased from 20 to 22 degrees C with a maximum value of 35.2 degrees C from 1994 to 2019. Likewise, wetland susceptibility mean value increased from 1.10 to 1.20, a growth rate of 9.09%. Though the decline in high-risk zones, moderate risk zones drastically augmented at the extent of 70.5% while low risk and no risk zones declined with a reduction rate of 18.9 and 95.8% respectively. Overall observations exhibited that Bayanbulak ecological risk is slightly evolving. Conclusion Bayanbulak is a pool of ecosystem services. By highlighting its ecological risk evolution, we call upon the focus on factors driving LST increment and adopt climatic adaptation measures of aqua-terrestrial ecosystems for Bayanbulak management.

AB  - Aims: Wetlands in East Africa are important ecosystems providing valuable services to people living around them. Among various uses, agricultural production (cultivation and grazing) is the most frequent activity affecting the ecotone between dry land and wetland. A classification of aquatic and semi-aquatic vegetation focussing on less disturbed plant phytocoenoses may be a useful tool for further assessments of integrity of ecological functioning of wetlands. Study area: Southern slopes of Mt. Kenya, Kenya, and western slopes of the West Usambara Mts., Tanzania. Methods: Spontaneous vegetation at the two wetland sites was surveyed using 86 sampling plots. Vegetation units resulting from a supervised classification were defined as phytosociological associations and placed in a syntaxonomic scheme after a thorough review of previous studies on the African continent and in the tropics and subtropics worldwide. Results: Identified associations of aquatic vegetation were classified to the classes Lemnetea and Potametea, while associations of semi-aquatic vegetation belong to the classes Phragmito-Magno-Caricetea and Oryzetea sativae. Five associations (Ipomoeo aquaticae-Typhetum domingensis, Leersio hexandrae-Cyperetum exaltati, Pycreo polystachyos-Panicetum subalbidum, Ammannio prieurianae-Ethulietum conyzoides and Centrostachyo aquaticae-Persicarietum senegalensis) are described as new for East Africa. Conclusions: The classification of aquatic and semi-aquatic vegetation in the two study sites complements and improves previous classifications in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere in Africa. The compilation of available information in a vegetation-plot database may help to consolidate the syntaxonomical classification in the African continent and across the tropics.

AB  - Identifying and evaluating the factors that might impact on the long-term integrity of a deep Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) and its surrounding geological and surface environment is central to developing a safety case for underground disposal of radioactive waste. The geological environment should be relatively stable and its behaviour adequately predictable so that scientifically sound evaluations of the long-term radiological safety of a GDF can be made. In considering this, it is necessary to take into account natural processes that could affect a GDF or modify its geological environment up to 1 million years into the future. Key processes considered in this paper include those which result from plate tectonics, such as seismicity and volcanism, as well as climate-related processes, such as erosion, uplift and the effects of glaciation. Understanding the inherent variability of process rates, critical thresholds and likely potential influence of unpredictable perturbations represent significant challenges to predicting the natural environment From a plate-tectonic perspective, a one million year time frame represents a very short segment of geological time and is largely below the current resolution of observation of past processes. Similarly, predicting climate system evolution on such time-scales, particularly beyond 200 ka AP is highly uncertain, relying on estimating the extremes within which climate and related processes may vary with reasonable confidence. The paper highlights some of the challenges facing a deep geological disposal program in the UK to review understanding of the natural changes that may affect siting and design of a GDF.

AB  - Based on regional heterogeneity of environmental characteristics and factors influencing those characteristics, environmental units may be classified into homogeneous zones. Then, essential strategies and mitigation measures in each zone may be developed and environmental quality may be holistically improved using a system of environmental management regionalization (EMRZ). Here, an EMRZ scheme for China was devised by outlining regional management using integrated qualitative and quantitative methods. First, the land was subdivided into four environmental management domains using China's three physical geographic domains. Second, using a regionalization indicator system, the environmental characteristics of neighboring provinces in four domains was quantified using the one-dimensional Euclidean distance method; regions with high similarity were merged into one environmental management region (EMR) and the preliminary draft of EMRs was obtained. Based on the preliminary scheme, eight EMRs using prefecture-level administrative regions were obtained through boundary adjustment based on important natural geographical boundaries and existing regional plans. These include the Northeastern China Region, the North China Plain Region, the Loess Plateau Region, Southeast Coast Region, the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, the Southwestern China Region, the Northwestern China Region, and the Tibetan Plateau Region. Priority environmental problems of each EMR were discussed. The main contribution of this study is that it develops a novel methodological framework for EMRZ integrating qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and considers the spatial contiguity of each EMR and the spatial integrity of each administrative unit. Future research will focus on priority goals and establishment of suitable environmental management policies for each EMR based on known local environmental problems.

AB  - An important goal for community ecology is the characterization and prediction of changes in community patterns along environmental gradients. We aimed to identify the major environmental correlates of diatom distribution patterns in boreal running waters. We classified 197 stream sites based on their diatom flora. Direct ordination methods were then used to identify the key environmental determinants of this diatom-based stream typology. Finally, we tested whether a regional classification scheme based on terrestrial landscapes (ecoregions) provides a reasonable framework for a regional grouping of streams based on their diatom flora. Two-way indicator species analysis produced 13 site groups, which were primarily separated by chemical variables, mainly conductivity, total P and water colour. In partial CCA, the environmental and spatial factors accounted for 38% and 24%, respectively, of explained variation in community composition. A high proportion (almost 40%) of variation explained by the combined effect (spatially-structured environmental) indicated that diatom communities of boreal streams incorporate a strong spatial component. At the level of subecoregions, classification strength was almost equally strong for all sites as for near-pristine reference sites only. Procrustes analysis indicated that spatial factors and patterns in diatom community structure were strongly concordant. Our data support the argument that diatom communities are strongly spatially structured, with distinctly different communities in different parts of the country. Because of the strong spatial patterns of community composition, bioassessment programs utilising lotic diatoms would clearly benefit from regional stratification. A combination of regional stratification and the prediction of assemblage structure from local environmental features might provide the most robust framework for diatom-based assessment of the biological integrity of boreal streams.

AB  - A multimetric index for the evaluation of environmental quality (the ecofunctional quality index, EQI) has been developed using biotic data from three Italian coastal lagoons. Sampling programs were conducted between 1998 and 2000, on a yearly basis, with seasonal frequency at diverse sites in each lagoon. The rationale of the index is that certain attributes, selected on the basis of established principles of benthic ecology, are fundamental for lagoon ecosystem function. The chosen attributes were primary productivity, expressed as phytoplankton, seaweed and seagrass biomasses; structure and productivity of the benthic community, expressed as numerical abundance, biomass density, number of species, and taxonomic diversity of macrozoobenthos; and finally, trophic complexity, expressed as macrozoobenthic functional diversity. The EQI is constituted by the sum of weights given to these eight attributes, each transformed onto a dimensionless 0-100 quality scale. In this way, the use of EQI can derive a series of values yielding a 'functional classification' of sites within a lagoon or between different lagoons. The proposed index is a low cost, flexible and robust routine indicator of lagoon ecosystem impairment and could be of particular benefit to environmental managers and policymakers who require tools capable of expressing the degree of degradation or environmental quality of different lagoon habitats. The process of developing and the initial testing of EQI reported in this paper is intended as preliminary, and until validation of this index is accomplished by incorporating data from a wider range of lagoon environments, we caution the use of this index in anything other than an exploratory manner.

AB  - Polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is an important prey species in the Arctic ecosystem, yet its habitat is changing rapidly: climate change, through rising seawater temperatures and CO2 concentrations, is projected to be most pronounced in Arctic waters. This study aimed to investigate the influence of ocean acidification and warming on maximum performance parameters of B. saida as indicators for the species' acclimation capacities under environmental conditions projected for the end of this century. After 4 months at four acclimation temperatures (0, 3, 6, 8 degrees C) each combined with two P-CO2 levels (390 and 1170 mu atm), aerobic capacities and swimming performance of B. saida were recorded following a U-crit protocol. At both CO2 levels, standard metabolic rate (SMR) was elevated at the highest acclimation temperature indicating thermal limitations. Maximum metabolic rate (MMR) increased continuously with temperature, suggesting an optimum temperature for aerobic scope for exercise (AS(ex)) at 6 degrees C. Aerobic swimming performance (U-gait) increased with acclimation temperature irrespective of CO2 levels, while critical swimming speed (U-crit) did not reveal any clear trend with temperature. Hypercapnia evoked an increase in MMR (and thereby AS(ex)). However, swimming performance (both U-gait and U-crit) was impaired under elevated nearfuture P-CO2 conditions, indicating reduced efficiencies of oxygen turnover. The contribution of anaerobic metabolism to swimming performance was very low overall, and further reduced under hypercapnia. Our results revealed high sensitivities of maximum performance parameters (MMR, U-gait, U-crit) of B. saida to ocean acidification. Impaired swimming capacity under ocean acidification may reflect reduced future competitive strength of B. saida.

AB  - When plants are exposed to airborne particles, they can accumulate metals in their edible portions through root or foliar transfer. There is a lack of knowledge on the influence of plant exposure conditions on human bioaccessibility of metals, which is of particular concern with the increase in urban gardening activities. Lettuce, radish, and parsley were exposed to metal-rich ultrafine particles from a recycling factory via field atmospheric fallouts or polluted soil. Total lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) concentrations in of the edible plant parts and their human bioaccessibility were measured, and Pb translocation through the plants was studied using Pb isotopic analysis. The Pb and Cd bioaccessibility measured for consumed parts of the different polluted plants was significantly higher for root exposure (70% for Pb and 89% for Cd in lettuce) in comparison to foliar exposure (40% for Pb and 69% for Cd in lettuce). The difference in metal bioaccessibility could be linked to the metal compartmentalization and speciation changes in relation to exposure conditions. Metal nature strongly influences the measured bioaccessibility: Cd presents higher bioaccessibility in comparison to Pb. In the case of foliar exposure, a significant translocation of Pb from leaves toward the roots was observed. To conclude, the type of pollutant and the method of exposure significantly influences the phytoavailability and human bioaccessibility of metals, especially in relation to the contrasting phenomena involved in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere. The conditions of plant exposure must therefore be taken into account for environmental and health risk assessment.

AB  - To investigate the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in surface sediment, field study was performed in Lake Qingnian and Wetland Qilihai from February to December in 2010. Meanwhile, simulation experiments were carried out to better understand the degradation of DON. The pollution of Lake Qingnian was more serious than that of Wetland Qilihai. Total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA-N), accounting for about 40% of DON, was the dominant nitrogen species in the sediment. Bacterial residues were the most important source of organic nitrogen in the sediment of Wetland Qilihai, where DON more highly degraded than Lake Qingnian. Degradative Index (DI) was successfully applied to examine the degradation status of sedimentary organic matter in different seasons. That DI decreased in spring and summer whereas increased in autumn and winter, illustrated that more degraded organic matter in summer and autumn than spring and winter in the cores. By principal component analysis, that a higher loading of Leu, Glu, Ile, Gly, Ser and Thr in the first principal component reflect the degradability of sedimentary organic nitrogen. As to natural shallow anoxic sediments, the decomposition rate of organic nitrogen in anoxic condition was slightly higher than that of aerobic condition, whereas aerobic condition conducive to the degradation of amino sugar (HA-N). The degradation of DON was major in terms of THAA-N which accounting for about 45% of the DON degradation in control. In the degradation of the THAA-N by microbe, THAA-N were absorbed and utilized in terms of polypeptide before decomposed into free amino acids.

AB  - Carbon-length relationships can be used to indicate the condition of daphnids in natural situations. We examined the Daphnia galeata population of an alpine lake (Oberer, Arosasee, Switzerland), where most individuals display diel vertical migration behaviour (DVM). Normally, migrating daphnids face a trade-off between 'predator safe areas' in the hypolimnion and 'food rich areas' with high predation risk. However, in alpine lakes, with chlorophyll a and POC maxima typically in deeper layers and weak temperature gradients, migrating species are confronted less with this trade-off. We investigated the seasonal changes in carbon content of D. galeata in different depth strata in relation to environmental parameters of the lake. The carbon content of D. galeata was high in spring, but declined considerably in summer and increased slightly in autumn. The low values indicate that D. galeata are food limited for much of the year. The slopes of the regression lines between carbon content and body length varied seasonally, but were not significantly different among depths on a given date. In summer, D. galeata individuals residing in the deep layers during the day had a significantly higher carbon content than individuals in the surface layers. During the rest of the year, the carbon content of individuals was similar among all depth strata. We conclude that migrating D. galeata and individuals remaining in deep layer had better body conditions compared to non-migrating D. galeata in this alpine lake during summer, when migration amplitudes were highest.

AB  - Production of corn (Zea mays L.) requires significant N availability to reach maximum yield potential. Nitrogen fertilizer recommendations generally have ignored site-specific conditions and have focused more on total N demand for representative soils across a region. Recent evidence suggested that site-specific conditions of the biologically active component (0-10-cm depth) could inform the magnitude of yield response to applied N fertilizer. This approach was tested further on 111 fields in Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Blue Ridge regions (states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia). Plant-available N (sum of residual inorganic N and net N mineralization during a 24-d aerobic incubation) was inversely proportional to economically optimum N rate scaled to grain production level (r(2) = .47, p < .001). Soil-test biological activity as a simple, rapid, and reliable indicator of net N mineralization was also predictive of economically optimum N rate (r(2) = .46, p < .001) and validated an earlier assessment. Greater soil-test biological activity was obtained from private farms than from research stations (259 vs. 172 mg C kg(-1) 3 d(-1), respectively; p < .001), as well as from fields with minimum tillage, multi-species cover cropping, and amendment with animal manures. Results imply that some farmers are making choices to improve soil health condition and these choices can lead to lower requirement for N fertilizer inputs. A shift towards site-specific N management should focus on soil biological activity and its association with N mineralization as indicators of soil health to increase profit and reduce environmental impacts.

AB  - Since the turn of the millennium various scientific publications have been discussing a re-greening of the Sahel after the 1980s drought mainly based on coarse-resolution satellite data. However, the author's own field studies suggest that the situation is far more complex and that both paradigms, the "encroaching Sahara" and the "re-greening Sahel", need to be questioned.
   This paper discusses the concepts of desertification, resilience, and re-greening by addressing four main aspects: (i) the relevance of edaphic factors for a vegetation re-greening, (ii-iii) the importance of the selected observation period in the debate on Sahel greening or browning, and (iv) modifications in the vegetation pattern as possible indicators of ecosystem changes (shift from originally diffuse to contracted vegetation patterns).
   The data referred to in this paper cover a time period of more than 150 years and include the author's own research results from the early 1980s until today. A special emphasis, apart from fieldwork data and remote sensing data, is laid on the historical documents.
   The key findings summarised at the end show the following: (i) vegetation recovery predominantly depends on soil types; (ii) when discussing Sahel greening vs. Sahel browning, the majority of research papers only focus on post-drought conditions. Taking pre-drought conditions (before the 1980s) into account, however, is essential to fully understand the situation. Botanical investigations and remote-sensing-based time series clearly show a substantial decline in woody species diversity and cover density compared to pre-drought conditions; iii) the self-organised patchiness of vegetation is considered to be an important indicator of ecosystem changes.

AB  - The transfer of plant-produced insecticidal Cry-proteins in the arthropod food web can be affected by a number of environmental and ecological factors. Despite this fact, most studies documenting multitrophic Cry-protein acquisition patterns in arthropods are conducted under controlled conditions whereas the number of field studies is limited. Such field studies, however, are valuable to understand multitrophic allocation dynamics of Cry-proteins under ecologically realistic conditions and are therefore important for the interpretation and design of laboratory hazard studies on genetically engineered (GE) crops. We thus sampled arthropods and plant structures in a field planted with GE dual-gene cotton plants producing the Cry-proteins CrylAc and Cry2Ab from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner over the growing season. Cry-protein concentrations in field-collected plants, herbivores, and predators were quantified and compared with arthropods subjected to tri-trophic laboratory feeding assays. Both, field studies and laboratory assays showed that Cry-protein concentrations strongly decreased with increasing trophic level to values mostly below the detection limit in predators. Under field conditions, in-planta Cry-protein concentrations varied between plant structures and over the season. Concentrations in" arthropods were mainly associated with feeding mode, feeding location on the plant, and to a lesser degree seasonality. Compared to plants, arthropods showed lower Cry2Ab:CrylAc ratios indicating that Cry2Ab might be less stable than CrylAc. Of all predators collected in the field study, we measured highest Cry-protein levels in jumping and crab spiders, predatory flies and some predatory hemipterans. This emphasizes the relevance of these groups for the risk assessment of GE cotton.

AB  - In this study, we examined the ability of horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) to capture heavy metals, and whether its capacity to absorb metals from soil is associated with surrounding ecological characteristics and sources of pollution. We studied the seasonal accumulation of B, Cu, Sr and Zn in leaves and bark, and the chlorophyll content in the common deciduous tree Aesculus hippocastanum L. in four urban parks in Pancevo, Smederevo, Obrenovac and Belgrade (Serbia) affected by different anthropogenic activities. The research included plants from a control site located within the zone of a former oak forest. Our findings suggest that there are potential ecological risks around Smederevo, Belgrade and Obrenovac due to elevated concentrations of B and Zn relative to the average concentrations described for worldwide soils, as well as national regulations. Substantial and toxic foliar accumulation of B was observed in Smederevo and Belgrade, and of Sr in both plant tissues at all sites. However, the Cu and Zn contents in leaves were not enough to meet the physiological needs of plants. Chlorophyll a and the total carotenoid content peaked in August under the most unfavorable conditions of the year, which may be considered as an adaptive mechanism. The obtained results showed the remarkable complexity of environmental conditions and the difficulties A. hippocastanum, as a species, has to overcome. Under conditions of different types of urban and industrial pollution, A. hippocastanum showed great element accumulation potential and could be regarded as both an accumulator and a response indicator, since its leaves are quite susceptible to damage.

AB  - The efficiency of phytoremediation might be highly affected by plant-associated microorganisms, and understanding of the underlying mechanisms is still a great challenge. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency parameters for Cd2+ accumulation in the biomass of willow (Salix viminalis) as well as to define the biochemical response of the host plant when it is inoculated with selected bacterial strains (Massilia sp. and Pseudomonas sp.) or saprophytic fungus (Clitocybe sp.) under controlled in vitro conditions. Inoculation of plants with bacterial strains affected the efficiency of phytoremediation process and was expressed as the quantity of accumulated Cd (Q), the bioaccumulation factor (BCF) and the translocation index (Ti); however, the effect was strain and plant organ specific. The level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is both an indicator of plant response to biological and/or abiotic environmental stress and a molecule involved in plant-microbial interactions, decreased under the influence of Cd2+ in uninoculated plants (plant growth was inhibited by Cd2+) and increased in the inoculated variants of plants growing in the presence of Cd2+ (microbiologically stimulated biomass). The saprophytic fungus Clitocybe sp. generally stimulated biomass and increased the level of H2O2 synthesis in all the investigated plant organs and variants of the experiment. We suggest that determination of phytoremediation efficiency, and biochemical response (H2O2) of the host plant under in vitro conditions can help in predicting the final effect of plant-microbial systems in further field trials.

AB  - We review literature concerning the impacts of climate change on the migration of marine species, with an emphasis on the adaptation of migration phenology through genetic tracking and phenotypic plasticity. We then develop an individual-based modeling framework characterizing the effects of climate change on phenology and population dynamics. In the framework, an animal's ability to match its environmental preferences, its bioclimate envelope, to the environmental conditions by adjusting its migration timing between foraging and breeding habitats determines its condition, survival, and fecundity. Climate-induced changes in the envelope produce timing mismatches that result in a population adapting its phenology through both genetic and plastic processes. Model results suggest: (1) the temporal size of the bioclimate envelope is an important determinant of a population's sensitivity to climate change and susceptibility to extinction, (2) population extinction can occur if the rate of change in the timing of the envelope exceeds the rate its phenology changes or if the variability in the envelope exceeds the population's inherent capacity for variability, (3) a population with migration timing cued by photoperiod is expected to exhibit weaker phenotypic plasticity than one cued by temperature, and (4) population extinction in response to climate change follows a threshold pattern such that population size may not be a reliable indicator of extinction threat, although variability in average individual condition across years may be an extinction threat indicator. Finally, while the model is intentionally simplistic, we discuss how it can be extended to cover more complex interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The size of reptile hatchlings can be phenotypically plastic in response to incubation temperature, and size is a trait likely to influence fitness-i.e. hatchling size is proposed as an indicator of quality. The parental and incubation temperature effects on the size of one of New Zealand's most biologically significant reptile species, the tuatara Sphenodon punctatus are investigated. Artificial incubation at constant temperatures is used to produce founders for new captive and wild populations of tuatara and to augment existing rare populations. We compare size of hatchling tuatara from artificial and natural incubation treatments. The relationship of hatchling size with incubation temperature and sex is examined, and we investigate whether our results support differential fitness models for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in tuatara. Initial egg mass is the most important factor affecting size of hatchling tuatara and is still an important influence at 10 months of age. Incubation temperature does not greatly influence size of hatchlings, but significantly influences size by 10 months of age. Constant artificial incubation conditions result in larger, but possibly less aggressive, juveniles than those from more variable natural incubation conditions by 10 months of age. Evidence from size patterns of tuatara incubated in natural nests supports differential fitness models for the adaptive significance of temperature-dependent sex determination. Thermal variation has little effect on size of male hatchlings, but female embryos that develop in more stable thermal conditions, in more reliable sites for hatching, are bigger and have longer jaws.

CP  - 16th International Meeting for Specialists in Air Pollution Effects on Forest Ecosystems - Air Pollution and Multiple Stresses
AB  - The condition of white birches within 30 km of the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, have been monitored by the Canadian Forest Service since 1981, when an apparent deterioration in their condition and foliar browning was noticed. The apparent lack of associated insects or diseases that could have caused this change led to an investigation of possible environmental causes. Suspected variables were fog chemistry and frequency, rain chemistry, and ozone exposure. Significant (p = 0.05-0.01) spatial and temporal correlations of foliar browning with the fog frequency and fog chemistry variables have been detected, and their possible cause-effect relationship evaluated using both conventional on the ground sampling and remote sensing techniques. The use of remote sensing techniques, though not conclusive over the time it was carried out, did show the potential for future investigation of this type. In this study the deterioration of the two principal taxa, paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and mountain paper birch (Betula cordifolia Regel), were examined in terms of crown dieback and compared. These two taxa occur as separate stands or as a mixture in the birch plots. Comparisons of mortality responses of the two birch taxa together with results of leaf browning on transplanted young clones of the two taxa indicated a significantly (p < 0.001) greater sensitivity of B. cordifolia, whereas no significant differences between the taxa exist for percentage of trees with dieback. The potential role of sensitive indicators, such as B. cordifolia, as biomonitors of atmospheric change in an ecotonal situation like the Fundy coast is important, as these may give us the first indications of vegetation response to a changing chemical and physical environment.

AB  - Large efforts are on-going within the EU to prepare the Marine Strategy Framework Directive's (MSFD) assessment of the environmental status of the European seas. This assessment will only be as good as the indicators chosen to monitor the 11 descriptors of good environmental status (GEnS). An objective and transparent framework to determine whether chosen indicators actually support the aims of this policy is, however, not yet in place. Such frameworks are needed to ensure that the limited resources available to this assessment optimize the likelihood of achieving GEnS within collaborating states. Here, we developed a hypothesis-based protocol to evaluate whether candidate indicators meet quality criteria explicit to the MSFD, which the assessment community aspires to. Eight quality criteria are distilled from existing initiatives, and a testing and scoring protocol for each of them is presented. We exemplify its application in three worked examples, covering indicators for three GEnS descriptors (1, 5, and 6), various habitat components (seaweeds, seagrasses, benthic macrofauna, and plankton), and assessment regions (Danish, Lithuanian, and UK waters). We argue that this framework provides a necessary, transparent and standardized structure to support the comparison of candidate indicators, and the decision-making process leading to indicator selection. Its application could help identify potential limitations in currently available candidate metrics and, in such cases, help focus the development of more adequate indicators. Use of such standardized approaches will facilitate the sharing of knowledge gained across the MSFD parties despite context-specificity across assessment regions, and support the evidence-based management of European seas.

AB  - Transcriptomic responses combined with apical adverse ecologically relevant outcomes have proven to be useful to unravel and anchor molecular mechanisms of action to adverse outcomes. This is the case for feeding inhibition responses in the model ecotoxicological species Daphnia magna. The aim of the present study was to assess the transcriptomic responses in guts dissected from D. magna individuals exposed to concentrations of selected compounds that inhibit feeding and compare them with the responses associated to 2 levels of food restriction (low food and starvation). Chemical treatments included cadmium, copper, fluoranthene, lambda-cyhalothrin, and the cyanotoxin anatoxin-a. Although the initial hypothesis was that exposure to chemical feeding inhibitors should elicit similar molecular responses as food limitation, the corresponding gut transcriptomic responses differed significantly. In moderate food limitation conditions, D. magna individuals increased protein and carbohydrate catabolism, likely to be used as energetic sources, whereas under severe starving conditions most metabolism-related pathways appeared down-regulated. Treatment with chemical feeding inhibitors promoted cell turnover-related signaling pathways in the gut, probably to renew tissue damage caused by the reported oxidative stress effects of these compounds, and inhibited the transcription of gut digestive gene enzymes and energetic metabolic pathways. We conclude that chemical feeding inhibitors, rather than mimicking the physiological response to low- or no-food conditions, cause specific toxic effects, preventing Daphnia both from feeding and from adjusting its metabolism to the resulting low energy intake.

AB  - The development and improvement of methods for predicting the service life of structural steels in a particular sea area are an urgent task for selection of appropriate measures to protect metal structures from corrosion and fouling. This paper shows the possibilities of using mathematical models to describe kinetics of corrosion process of AH-36 steel, which is widely used in shipbuilding in Vietnam, based on test data in seawater. Before exposure of samples, electrochemical studies of AH-36 steel were carried out. It is shown that over time there is a sharp shift in free corrosion potential (Ecorr) to a more negative region, which indicates a decrease in the corrosion resistance of steel. In seawater, stabilization of Ecorr observed for 60 min. In the course of studying polarization curves, it was found that corrosion potentials and currents of samples decrease with time and tend to constant values. After exposure of samples in seawater under natural and laboratory conditions in various modes, the indicators of corrosion process were calculated. The regression analysis of the obtained data showed that an adequate model for specific mass loss is a power-type model M(t) = At-k. The accuracy of models is characterized by a high multiple correlation coefficient. According to calculations in full-scale conditions at different depths of the stationary mode, the specific corrosion losses change little. It should also be noted that the corrosion of samples protected from macro fouling by a fine-mesh cover does not occur uniformly: at first slowly, then accelerates after reaching a certain value. Compared to the stationary mode, corrosion processes in the dynamic mode proceed faster with high values of A, k both in laboratory and in natural conditions.

AB  - Algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs can be considered regime shifts from a clear-water to algae-dominated state that often occurs abruptly. Under experimental conditions, these regime shifts have been predicted from rises in variance and autocorrelation (generic resilience indicators) of state variables monitored at a high frequency. The goal of this study was to evaluate the behavior of resilience indicators prior to a critical transition in lakes that naturally experience algal blooms. Ambient lake conditions provide several potential hurdles that could inhibit the detection of meaningful changes in resilience indicators prior to a critical transition such as stochastic nutrient loading, spatial complexity, and decreased resilience due to higher baseline nutrient concentrations. We compiled five lake-years of high-frequency monitoring of chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, dissolved oxygen, and pH from four hypereutrophic lakes. Despite the factors that might hinder detecting statistical indicators of changing resilience in hypereutrophic ecosystems, we found that a rise in resilience indicators did occur prior to a critical transition in three out of four possible lake-years, with rise beginning between 5 and 33 d prior. In one lake-year, a critical transition occurred soon after the monitoring began, preventing detection of rising variance or autocorrelation signals which are calculated using a 21-d rolling window. These results add to the growing body of evidence that rises in resilience indicators can be detected in ecosystems prior to a regime shift if monitoring programs are properly designed to capture the dynamics; however, continued research is needed to better understand the conditions under which resilience indicators may be useful as an early warning detection tool for lake management.

AB  - The study of soil nematode communities is a powerful tool that has been widely used as an indicator of soil health. This study explored whether soil nematode composition of different land use types could be used as a baseline to indicate the soil health of both natural and anthropogenic ecosystems. The soil nematode community compositions were documented for five land use types in tropical China: bare land, secondary forest, old forest, eucalyptus plantation and litchi orchards. The first three land use types are natural ecosystems and considered as a vegetation succession, whereas the other two are anthropogenically managed ecosystems. The vegetation succession from bare land to secondary and old forests increased soil nematode abundance, diversity, diversity-weighted abundance and complexity of community structure. During the wet season, the abundances of the total nematodes, bacterivores. fungivores and herbivores were significantly lower in eucalyptus plantation and litchi orchards than in secondary and old forests. but higher than in bare land. During the dry season. the abundances of the total nematodes and each trophic group were greatest in orchards. The pattern of the diversity-weighted abundance of each nematode trophic group was similar to that of nematode trophic group abundance. The results indicate that soil nematode communities of different land use types could be used for comparison of soil health conditions in natural and managed ecosystems. Particularly, the soil health conditions as indicated through nematode communities of the two managed ecosystems were not as good as those of secondary and old forests, whereas litchi orchards might have better soil health conditions than eucalyptus plantations in tropical China.

AB  - Diatom metrics can be used to identify the ecological status of water bodies due to their good responses to anthropogenic disturbances. Our study is aimed to use diatom metrics developed from different ecoregions for assessing the ecological status of 11 surface waters in the south-east of the Gaziantep catchment (Turkey). Ecological characterizations of the sampling stations were introduced by Trophic Index Turkey (TIT), Trophic Index (TI), and Eutrophication and/or Pollution Index-Diatom (EPI-D). According to TIT and TI, Karkamis Reservoir had a good ecological condition while it had high ecological status based on EPI-D. This good ecological condition was approved by the presence of pollution sensitive species (e.g., Cymbella affinis, Encyonema minutum, E. silesiacum, Cymbopleura amphicephala, and Navicula radiosa) and relatively low nutrients. Kayacik (TIT ranging 3.15-3.23) and Hancagiz (TIT = 3.35) reservoirs had poor and bad ecological conditions, respectively. High nutrient, conductivity, and pollution-tolerant species (e.g., Nitzschia amphibia, N. palea, N. umbonata, N. linearis, N. phyllepta, Tryblionella calida, and Pinnularia brebissonii) supported the ecological statuses of the Hancagiz and Kayacik reservoirs. The first two axes of canonical correspondence analysis explained 0.943 of relationships between diatom species and explanatory variables. Explanatory variables, e.g., calcium, conductivity, orthophosphate, nitrate, nitrite, sodium, pH, and sulfur, had strong impacts on the distribution of diatom assemblages among the sampling stations. TIT and TI separated ecological statuses of sampling stations in the south-east of the Gaziantep catchment, which correlated well with the evidence of water chemistry and response of diatom assemblages.

AB  - The researches in the field of the system view on the life highlight that the economy is a living system created by the human being, organic part of the human society and, altogether, of the ecology of our world.
   Like any living natural or created system, the economy can be healthy, in harmony with the requirements of the "health of the entire common living", or unhealthy, in disharmony with the law of living, with the people's aspirations to a decent, flourishing life.
   The systemic perspective on the economic life helps us to describe and understand the economic processes and phenomena, the economic activities producing material goods and services with the help of the systemic concepts.
   For the interpretation of the health condition of an economy as a social body, it is vital to make use of a system of macroeconomic, macrosocial and ecological indicators expressing the equilibriums of the interactions generated by the economic life, like: the human GDP; the productivity of the national work; the ecolonomic costs of the GDP; the people's happiness, as achieved aspirations, etc.
   From this perspective, a healthy economy does not mean a fast or slow economic growth, but an evolution of the indicators characterizing the status and the dynamics of the interdependences, expression and condition of the harmonization of the social life flexibility with the ecolonomic life flexibility and the flexibility of the living world ecology. The relative stability of the conditions of the systemic flexibility the economic life is organic part of, determines us to analyze the economic, social and ecological indicators based on the harmonization of the quality criteria with the structural and quantity criteria.

AB  - Question: How consistent are relationships of forest lichen community composition with environmental variables across geographic scales within region and across regions?
   Location: Northwestern continental USA and east central continental USA.
   Method: Four macrolichen data sets were compiled using identical plot sample protocol: species abundance estimated in 0.4-ha permanent plots on a systematic grid, as part of government (USDA-FS) forest inventory programs. One data set in each region represented a large area; the other represented part of the large area. We used global NMS ordination of plots based on species abundance to extract major axes of variation in community composition. Correlations of species, guilds, and environmental variables with ordination axes were compared between geographic scales for the two regions.
   Results: Primary axes of community variation at larger scales were correlated with climate variables and related geographic variables such as latitude and elevation, and with pollution. Forest vegetation variables such as stand age and tree species composition became more important at small scales. Community variation unexplained by macro-environment variables also became more important at small scales. Of several hundred species tested, ten lichen species showed consistent behaviour between scales within region (one also across regions) and are thus potential general indicators of ecological conditions in forests. Of six lichen guilds tested, several show strong patterns not consistently related to environmental conditions
   Conclusions: Interpretation of lichen species and community composition as indicating particular environmental conditions is context-dependent in most cases. Observed relationships should not be generalized beyond the geographic and ecological scale of observation.

AB  - Environmental stressors, both natural and humanly induced, could cause changes in cellular function which alter the physiology of organ systems in fish. The need to comprehend and predict the condition which stress metals will pose on fish, and extrapolate the effect of pollutants from laboratory to population levels, have forced scientists to search for physiological and biochemical indicators of health and sublethal toxicant effects. Hematological evaluation of fish blood provides valuable facts concerning the physiological response of fish to changes in the external environment. Furthermore, hematological Variables are well known for their clinical value in prognosis and diagnosis. Sublethal responses after exposure to toxicants can be determined by commonly applied techniques. Measurements for a number of hematological and carbohydrate metabolic variables were recorded at winter and summer temperatures after fish, acclimated for 3 months to experimental conditions, were exposed to sublethal concentrations of copper for 96 hr in a continuous-flow experimental system. Controls were run at the same time to establish essential baseline hematological values. Fish were exposed to the mean copper concentration as was found in the Olifants River, Kruger National Park, during summer(0.05 +/- 0.032 mg liter(-1)) and winter (0.085 +/- 0.032 mg liter(-1)) to establish the effect thereof on the variables mentioned. The results proved that the concentration of copper in the river exerts a physiological effect on Clarias gariepinus at 21 +/- 1 and 28 +/- 1 degrees C which manifests in changed blood chemistry. Pathological conditions, such as erythrocytopenia, leucocytosis, hyperglycemia, and hyperprotonemia, are evident. The fish physiologically adapted to the environmental change, which does not necessarily reflect a State of normality. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - The concern for the fate of forest ecosystems under climate change demands the development of a prompt and effective system for detecting the impacts of pressure factors, such as rising temperatures, drought conditions, and extreme climatic events. In ongoing European monitoring programs, the health condition of trees is only assessed visually as a matter of course and there is limited evidence that enhanced crown defoliation implies physiological disturbance and reduced tree growth. The progress of the research makes it possible to apply methods developed in experimental conditions in forests for the fast and reliable assessment of impacts and of stress conditions. In this review, we analyze the most promising indicators of tree and forest health (at individual plant and ecosystem levels) for their potential application in forest ecosystems and their ability to support and integrate the traditional visual assessment, provide information on influential factors, and improve the prediction of stand dynamics and forest productivity.

AB  - Products coal tar-based are largely used as concrete structures as protective coatings but some questions about leaching and potential toxic effects remain unclear. A laboratory experiment exposing oysters to miniaturized concrete pillars painted with Lackpoxi N1761 over time was performed and trace elements and 17 PAH were monitored in seawater exposure media, and oyster tissues. The original paint composition was also analyzed, and high concentrations of trace elements and PAH were detected. Sharp increases in PAH concentrations were observed after 6?96 h in exposure media and oyster tissues, suggesting that these compounds were leached from the painted structures. In parallel, the integrity of the hemocytes lysosomal membranes of exposed organisms has been damaged. Based on the response of this biomarker, the use of Lackpoxi N1761 is potentially harmful to the environment and it is required that coal tar-based paints be evaluated according to the environmental risk assessment protocols.

AB  - Fragmentation is a major threat to the integrity of stream ecosystems and maintaining connectivity is a primary goal for conservation to promote natural system functioning. In human dominated systems with extensive anthropogenic fragmentation, resource managers are faced with prioritizing restoration actions to provide the most cost-effective conservation strategies. Road crossings, particularly poorly designed culverts, limit fish passage and thus population connectivity and access to seasonally important resources. Culvert assessment protocols, such as the one developed by the North Atlantic Aquatic Connectivity Collaborative (NAACC), are useful tools for managers to evaluate culvert passability and prioritize restoration actions across broad spatial extents, however the justification of such protocols requires empirical field based investigations. In this study we collected Brook Trout genetic samples from 28 headwater streams, of which 17 were separated by a culverted road crossing and 11 were included as a comparison to natural genetic structuring. The objectives of this research were to 1) determine what effect culverts had on the genetics of Brook Trout populations, 2) evaluate the ability of the NAACC culvert assessment protocol to predict genetic patterns and 3) identify the culvert characteristics that best explained genetic variability. We found significant increases in genetic differentiation at sites with culverts compared to those without, but no differences in genetic diversity metrics. Although the NAACC classifications did not predict the extent of genetic differentiation, the openness ratio of culverts (cross sectional area/length) was significantly correlated, suggesting it may need to receive a higher weighting in assessment protocols. Our results highlight the necessity to match appropriate prioritization strategies with desired management objectives in order to design the most effective conservation actions.

AB  - Fluvial systems have been considered from a holistic perspective as one of the most important ecosystems given their capacity to provide ecosystem services that directly affect human well-being. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous national studies that link the complex ecological and social components of fluvial systems, and that analyze their current capacity to supply services, the direct and indirect causes that affect their integrity, and the policy response options taken. We used the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to explore the complex interlinkages between fluvial ecosystems and social systems in Spain. We selected 58 national-scale indicators that provide long-term information and allowed us to explore the trends and associations among DPSIR components. The trend analysis showed progressive aquatic biodiversity loss and deterioration of regulating services, and an increasing linear trend of direct pressures and indirect drivers, and of institutional responses, to correct negative impacts. Although we were unable to establish the causalities among the DPSIR components with the correlations analysis, we show that most are strongly related; e.g., biodiversity loss and regulating services are negatively associated with the supply of provisioning services and institutional responses, respectively. This indicates that current water management policies do not deal with the underlying causes of ecosystems deterioration. These results suggest that the second Water Framework Directive (WFD) phase could include the ecosystem service concept in its reporting system to better assess aquatic biodiversity conservation and the supply of services delivered by fluvial ecosystems to human well-being.

AB  - We assessed plant interspaces in July 2007 using continuous line intercepts in twice-replicated pastures of northern mixed-grass prairie with contrasting grazing treatments: 1) long-term (25 yr) heavily grazed, dominated by the bunchgrass blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), and 2) ungrazed, dominated by the rhizomatous grass western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii). The number of plant interspaces was 26% higher in pastures heavily grazed, but the amount of soil surface occupied by plant interspaces was 27% greater without grazing. Plant interspaces were larger without grazing (14.8+/-1.2 cm, mean +/- I SE) than heavily grazed (8.9 +/- 0.4 cm). Plant interspaces represented 87% and 68% of the total soil surface in the ungrazed and heavily grazed communities, respectively. The percentage of soil surface covered by plant interspaces < 20 cm was higher for the heavily grazed (94%) compared to the ungrazed (79%). Litter cover in the plant interspaces was higher without grazing (80 +/- 1%) compared to the heavily grazed (57 +/- 3%). Grazing-induced structural changes from a rhizomatous- to a bunchgrass-dominated vegetation community were manifest in the size and distribution of plant interspaces. Ecological consequences for erosion from raindrop impacts in larger plant interspaces in the ungrazed community are likely offset by greater litter cover in these communities; conversely, lower litter cover in heavily grazed pastures may increase erosion potential despite occurrence of smaller plant interspaces and less proportion of the soil surface covered by interspaces. Management practices that increase the cover of litter in plant interspaces should reduce the potential of erosion from water and wind in this semiarid rangeland.

AB  - A survey was conducted on five slopes of differing slope integrity along the North-South Expressway, Malaysia, to study the effects of vegetation on slope stability. Results showed significant effects of vegetation cover on slope stability in two extreme slopes, type A and type E, which represented stable and failed slopes, respectively. The highest root length density (RLD) was observed in type A slope due to the high density of vegetation cover, which eventually resulted in a lower soil water content (SWC). In contrast, the low biomass density of type E slope possessed a low RLD but high SWC, characteristics of a failed slope. Some correlations were also observed: RLD is positively related to shear strength and SWC is negatively related to both soil shear strength and soil penetrability. Thus, the study suggests that SWC and RLD could be used as indicators of slope stability and has the potential to predict slope failure in the future. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several detailed cross-country datasets measuring specific policy indicators relevant to business regulation and government integrity have been developed in recent years. The promise of these indicators is that they can be used to identify specific reforms that policymakers and aid donors can target in their efforts to improve the regulatory and institutional environment. Doing so, however, requires evidence on the partial effects of the many specific policy choices reflected in such datasets. In this paper we use Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to document the cross-country partial correlations between detailed policy indicators and several measures of regulatory and institutional outcomes. We find major instability in the set of policy indicators identified by BMA as important partial correlates of similar outcomes: specific policy indicators that matter for one outcome are, on average, not important correlates of other closely-related outcomes. This finding illustrates the difficulties in using highly-specific policy indicators to identify reform priorities using cross-country data.

AB  - Blood cells quickly react to different physiological and pathological processes in the hnology;organisms of pigs. Functional condition of erythrocytes is the most successful biological model for studying the dynamics of changes happening in the organisms of pigs. There has been carried out the analysis of hematological condition which showed that during the experiment in the animals under the condition of diinvasion Balantidium coli-Candida spp. there was a cyclic change of morphometric indexes of erythrocytes of peripheral blood. In the first 20 days there was marked an increase in the number, size, volume of the erythrocytes and the hematoglobulin inside of them, which is obviously connected with the compensatory reactions resulting in the intensification of hematopoiesis. On the 30th day and up to the end of the experiment there was marked a reduction of these parameters connected with the change of biochemical processes in the membranes of the erythrocytes and with the reduction of their resistance.

AB  - Coefficients of Conservatism (C-values) are used in Floristic Quality Assessment to evaluate the level of anthropogenic disturbance of a given natural area and exist for much of the United States; however, there is a gap in the southwestern United States. We aim to close this gap by establishing C-values for the flora of the Middle Rio Grande floodplain in New Mexico. We compiled a list of species found in the floodplain (n = 621), and two regional botanists assigned C-values on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 reserved for nonnative taxa and the least conservative native taxa, and 10 being the most conservative). We used correlation analysis to examine the relationship of C-values assigned between botanists as well as shared species between Colorado and New Mexico. There was a significant, but weak, positive correlation between C-values for the two states, highlighting ecoregional similarities and providing a basis of comparison for our C-values. Descriptive statistics indicate the range of C-values assigned are consistent with the disturbance history of the region.

AB  - Relationships between in-stream dissolved solute concentrations (C) and discharge (Q) are useful indicators of catchment-scale processes. We combine a synthesis of observational records with a parsimonious stochastic modeling approach to test how C-Q relationships arise from spatial heterogeneity in catchment solute sources coupled with different timescales of reactions. Our model indicates that the dominant driver of emergent archetypical dilution, enrichment, and constant C-Q patterns was structured heterogeneity of solute sources implemented as correlation of source concentration to travel time. Regardless of the C-Q pattern, with weak correlation between solute-source concentration and travel time, we consistently find lower variability in C than in Q, such that the predominant solute export regime is chemostatic. Consequently, the variance in exported loads is determined primarily by variance of Q. Efforts to improve stream water quality and ecological integrity in intensely managed catchments should lead away from landscape homogenization by introducing structured source heterogeneity.

AB  - Many processes in modern biotechnology, particularly biotransformations and environmental bioremediation, are hindered by the toxic effects of organic solvents on whole cells. These compounds dissolve in the cell membrane, disturbing its integrity and effecting specific permeabilization. The hydrophobicity of a compound, expressed as its log P value, is a good indicator of toxicity. Substances with a log P value in the range 1-5 are, in general, toxic to whole cells. However, in recent years, there have been several reports of bacteria exhibiting resistance to toxic solvents. The main adaptative reactions are alterations in the composition of the membrane, particularly changes in fatty-acid composition, phospholipid headgroups, and in the protein content. One of the key processes in the adaptation of some Pseudomonas strains, enabling them to tolerate organic solvents appears to be the isomerization of cis- into trans-unsaturated fatty acids. A greater understanding of these adaptations should eventually allow biotransformation reactions to be carried out in inhospitable two-phase systems incorporating an organic phase.

AB  - Two evaluation methods are introduced for expression of the quality of the thermal conditions in the animal-occupied zone (AOZ) in rooms for weaned piglets. One method uses only the AOZ temperature, while the other uses the kata-value (KV), which combines air velocity and temperature and indicates the heat loss to the environment. AOZ thermal conditions should be within the thermo-neutral zone (TNZ) of the piglets. The methods use two new numerical indicators, based on the duration and the magnitude of excess of A OZ thermal conditions outside the TNZ: one referring to the number of degree-hours (degrees Ch), and the other to the number of kata-value-hours (KVh) during a batch. The objective was to evaluate the two methods in a door-ventilated room for weaned piglets. In the experiment, temperature was measured in all ten pens of a room and air velocity in three pens during eight successive batches, together lasting about one year. Pens closer to the air inlet had higher temperatures and lower KV than pens in the back of the room. Momentary temperature difference between pens reached up to 7 degrees C. During the first days of most batches, pen conditions in the back of the room were "too cold." At the end of most batches, pen conditions in the middle of the room were "too warm." The value of the two indicators varied per pen and per batch from 0 to 319 degrees Ch (0 to 219 KVh) "too cold" and from 0 to 602 degrees Ch (0 to 793 KVh) "too warm." For "too warm" conditions, there was a significant (P < 0.001) and strong correlation between the two indicators (R-2 > 0.96), but not for "too cold" conditions (R-2 > 0.48). Therefore, measuring air velocity in addition to temperature in the AOZ for recognition of "too cold" conditions had surplus value. Excluding outliers from one extremely warm batch, the maximum value of the indicator for "too warm" was 65 degrees Ch. This indicator significantly affected the feed conversion ratio, which increased with 0.0024 kg/kg per degrees Ch, and daily growth and daily feed intake, which decreased with 0.0022 kg/animal and 0.0030 kg/animal, respectively, per degrees Ch. The methods presented are useful tools in the technical evaluation of climate systems and for a more optimal climate control in the AOZ.

AB  - During the Triassic the Transdanubian Range was a segment of the western Neotethys margin where the climate was mostly determined by a strong global monsoonal system. As a consequence of the global climatic conditions and its geographic setting, warm to hot temperature prevailed in this area. However, there were significant changes in the precipitation pattern from dry to wet conditions in connection with the intensity of the monsoon system and the actual setting of this area within the monsoon system. The aim of our research was to interpret the palaeoclimatic conditions and their changes for the Triassic succession of the Transdanubian Range on the base of geochemical, mineralogical, sedimentological and palaeontological data, with special regard to the climate indicator facies (e.g. different types of dolomites; clay mineral assemblages). Nine evolutionary stages were distinguished. During the Early Triassic mixed siliciclastic-carbonate ramp sedimentation took place under arid climate that was interrupted by a humid pulse (Campil Pluvial Event). In the early Anisian a shallow carbonate ramp was developed under arid to semi-arid climate. The predominatly dry conditions prolonged during the middle Anisian,. The latest Anisian and the Ladinian carbonate platforms were developed under mostly semi-arid climate. The semi-humid climate of the earliest Carnian was followed by a definitely wet interval (Camian Pluvial Event) that was characterised by an intense terrigenous input into the Julian intraplatform basins. Arid and humid conditions alternated during the final stage of basin upfilling from the latest Julian to early Tuvalian. Then a marked climatic change took place in the latest Camian when the humid climate was changed to semi-arid conditions. From the middle to late Norian a gradual increase of humidity may have taken place that resulted in a decreasing intensity of the early dolomitisation of the carbonate sediments of the broad internal platform. At the very end of the Norian there was a marked climate change leading to enhanced humidity but with a definite seasonality. Humid climatic conditions prevailed during the Rhaetian (Krissen Event).
   Evaluation of the similarities and differences of the palaeoclimatic conditions for the Transdanubian Range and some selected areas in the western Neotethys (Dolomites, Northern Calcareous Alps. Mecsek), and the Peri-Tethyan Germanic Basin is also presented. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indicators of ecological health are problematic for wetlands in dry regions because distinctive communities are associated with dry and wet phases of indefinite duration. The propagule bank. including the resting stages of aquatic animals and plants, maintains the community's capacity to recover from drought or disturbance. This paper records observations of invertebrates, protists and algae emerging in laboratory microcosms following the inundation of dry sediments from two temporary lakes on the River Murray floodplain in South Australia. A simple experiment carried out on the sediment from one lake showed that increased salinity was associated with lower diversity (richness) but higher abundance of emergent organisms. The effect on diversity was evident at salinities above 11-17 mS cm(-1), and the effect on abundances was evident above 6-11 mS cm(-1) (salinity here is indicated by electrical conductivity at 25 degreesC), These data suggest that propagule banks may be useful as complementary indicators of wetland health.

AB  - This paper examines the EIA process and its effectiveness in addressing the impacts of a 190 km long national highway project along the Karnataka coast. We analyse the quality and relevance of the environmental clearance conditions established by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and discusses their potential implications. The findings underline that most of the conditions that pertained to the prevention of pollution, restoration of mangroves, and protection of biodiversity lacked a scientific basis and specific information required for effective implementation. The MoEF&CC also overlooked the social impact of the project and underplayed its own role in ensuring fair compensation to project affected communities for the loss of their land and other livelihoods. The paper concludes by promulgating a long list of irrelevant and ineffective environmental conditions that represent greenwashing because it could misguide affected communities and other stakeholders by creating the impression the state is exercising due diligence in protecting the environment.

AB  - Aquatic invertebrates are excellent indicators of ecosystem quality; however, choosing a sampling method can be difficult. Each method and associated protocol has advantages and disadvantages, and finding the approach that minimizes biases yet fulfills management objectives is crucial. To test the effects of both sampling methods and sample handling-i.e., to composite samples or leave them as replicates-we collected aquatic invertebrates from the Niobrara River at Agate Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska, using three methods and two sample handling protocols. We compared aquatic invertebrate assemblages collected with a Hester-Dendy multi-plate sampler, Hess sampler, and a D-frame dipnet. We calculated six common bioassessment metrics from composite (combined) and replicate (separate) samples. Hess samples contained the highest taxonomic richness (capturing 77% of all taxa observed) and dipnet samples the least (47%). Hester-Dendy samples had the greatest proportion of Ephemeroptera, and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT). Dipnet samples had the lowest evenness values. In terms of sample handling, composite samples had inflated richness, diversity, and evenness compared with replicate samples, but bioassessment metrics calculated from proportions or averages (i.e., Hilsenhoff's Biotic Index and the proportion of EPT taxa) did not differ between them. The proportion of invertebrate groups from composite samples were not statistically different among sampling methods, but several groups differed between replicate samples collected by different methods. Ultimately, we recommend collecting replicate samples with a Hess sampler when the goal of the study is to detect ecosystem change, among locations or differences in variables of interest.

AB  - We propose and test a new Phytoplankton Community Index (PhyCol) for monitoring the ecological status of lakes and reservoirs. The design of our PhyCol is based on the fact that phytoplankton biomass and community structure respond to changes in water quality (mainly eutrophication) and by themselves also influence water quality. In order to accommodate this double role of phytoplankton as indicator and impact, PhyCol is based on phytoplankton community properties at different hierarchical levels combining both specific metrics (total biomass, taxonomic group biomass, cyanobacteria contribution, taxonomic group species richness) and new or modified sub-indices. It is calculated from the scores of the different metrics/sub-indices resulting in a final index value in the range from 0 to 5, to assess water quality on the basis of five ecological classes according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The test of PhyCoI was based on Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSISD) based on water transparency (Secchi depth) in 26 Greek lakes and reservoirs covering the entire spectrum from oligotrophic to hypertrophic. A highly significant relationship at p < 0.001 between the two variables was found, with the values of the PhyCoI declining with increasing TSISD. Furthermore, a significant relationship between the PhyCoI and land use types at the watershed of the studied freshwaters was found identifying permanent crops, pastures and shrubs and herbaceous vegetation associations as significant predictors of PhyCoI values. Because of the amount of labor involved in obtaining the PhyCoI we suggest to combine low frequency PhyCol determinations with a high frequency Secchi depth measurements for practical monitoring purposes.

AB  - Field excursions and trainings are considered a key component of education programs in soil and environmental sciences. They allow mastering students' practical skills in sampling and onsite assessments and improve understanding of ecosystem integrity and complexity. Urbanization has a substantial impact on soil properties and functions; however, field courses focused on urban soils are rare. We present a didactic prototype and the outcomes of the "Monitoring, Modeling, and Management of Urban Green Infrastructure and Soils (3MUGIS)" summer school-the first educational tour observing anthropogenic soils and landscapes along the bioclimatic gradient in European Russia, from tundra to dry steppes. Didactic learning was based on a studying-by-doing approach; students were involved in environmental assessment in multiple regions varying in climatic and socioeconomic features. Considering the high spatial heterogeneity of urban ecosystems, we used express techniques (portable X-ray fluorescence, infrared gas analyzers) for onsite soil analysis at multiple replicas. The data collected were discussed with local and international experts from Russia, Germany, the United States, and France in the context of regional environmental problems (e.g., pollution, soil degradation, and urban expansion). Students discovered zonal changes in vegetation (e.g., increasing tree height and diversity from north taiga to forest steppes) and soil properties (e.g., a gradual increase in pH and changes in soil organic C), as well as urban-specific processes and features (e.g., urban heat island effect or soil artifacts). The overall student feedback was very positive (50.8% excellent, 36% good); some specific organizational issues will be addressed for future 3MUGIS summer schools.

AB  - Transitional water ecosystems can be exposed to high levels of anthropic pressure. The main aim of this study was to present the 'Capo Peloro' lakes (southern Italy) case study, which highlights the advantageous use of ecotoxicological biomarkers in key copepod species, to reveal potential contamination in transitional water ecosystems. The focus was on changes that occur after the summer season, as during the summer, the surrounding human population increases significantly, with the consequent enhancement of anthropic pressures. Biomarkers were defined to monitor the zooplankton copepods Paracartia latisetosa, Acartia tonsa and Oithona brevicornis. Acetylcholinesterase, lipid peroxidation, and benzo(a) pyrene-monooxygenase activities were determined. P. latisetosa, A. tonsa and O. brevicornis show linear increases in their acetylcholinesterase activities with increasing concentrations in sample homogenates, which defines their high metabolic rates, and thus the suitability of these species as bioindicators. Biochemical alterations in these species induce changes in their biological attributes that can also lead to their disappearance, with a cascade of consequences for the higher trophic levels in the food chain. These data indicate that for the two lakes of Capo Peloro there is contamination by pesticides, carbamates and polycyclic and polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. This occurs mainly at the end of the summer season, and only affects the species of the low trophic levels. This case study shows the benefits provided by this biomarker approach as applied to zooplankton species, to monitor transitional water ecosystems and to estimate their toxicological risk, and thus to provide an early warning signal for loss of ecosystem integrity.

AB  - Integrated, quantitative expressions of anthropogenic stress over large geographic regions can be valuable tools in environmental research and management. Despite the fundamental appeal of a regional approach, development of regional stress measures remains one of the most important current challenges in environmental science. Using publicly available, pre-existing spatial datasets, we developed a geographic information system database of 86 variables related to five classes of anthropogenic stress in the U.S. Great Lakes basin: agriculture, atmospheric deposition, human population, land cover, and point source pollution. The original variables were quantified by a variety of data types over a broad range of spatial and classification resolutions. We summarized the original data for 762 watershed-based units that comprise the U.S. portion of the basin and then used principal components analysis to develop overall stress measures within each stress category. We developed a cumulative stress index by combining the first principal component from each of the five stress categories. Maps of the stress measures illustrate strong spatial patterns across the basin, with the greatest amount of stress occurring on the western shore of Lake Michigan, southwest Lake Erie, and southeastern Lake Ontario. We found strong relationships between the stress measures and characteristics of bird communities, fish communities, and water chemistry measurements from the coastal region. The stress measures are taken to represent the major threats to coastal ecosystems in the U.S. Great Lakes. Such regional-scale efforts are critical for understanding relationships between human disturbance and ecosystem response, and can be used to guide environmental decision-making at both regional and local scales.

AB  - In cities located in a subtropical climate, air-cooled chillers are commonly used to provide cooling to the indoor environment. This accounts for the increasing electricity demand of buildings over the decades. This paper investigates how the condensing temperature serves to accurately determine the energy efficiency, or coefficient of performance (COP), of air-cooled chillers under part load conditions. An experiment on an air-cooled reciprocating chiller showed that for any given operating condition, the COP of the chiller varies, depending on how the condensing temperature is controlled. A sensitivity analysis is implemented to investigate to what extent COP is responding to changes in operating variables and confirms that the condensing temperature is an adequate variable to gauge COP under various operating conditions. The specifications of the upper limit for the condensing temperature in order to improve the energy efficiency of air-cooled chillers are discussed. The results of this work will give designers and researchers a good idea about how to model chiller energy performance curves in the thermal and energy computation exercises. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this work was to develop and apply water balance indicators to be scaled up in the wine grape (Vitis vinifera) growing regions of the municipalities of Petrolina and Juazeiro, in the states of Pernambuco and Bahia, respectively, Brazil, simulating different pruning dates along the year. Previous energy balance measurements were used to relate the crop coefficient (Kc) with the accumulated degree-days (DDac). This model was applied to scale up the water balance indicators during the growing seasons. When irrigation water was available, the best pruning periods were from May to July, due to the better natural thermal and hidrological conditions. More care should be taken for pruning done in other periods of the year, regarding the effect of increasing thermal conditions of wine quality. The water balance indicators, both successfully developed and applied, allow large-scale analyses of the thermohydrological conditions for wine grape production under the semiarid conditions of the Brazilian Northeast.

AB  - This study reveals the complex nature of the connection between Eurasian snow and the following summer season's monsoon rainfall by using four different indicators of snow conditions and correlating each of them to summer monsoon rainfall. Using 46 years of historical records of mean winter snow depth, maximum snow depth, and snow starting dates, and 27 years of snow area coverage from remote sensing observations over Eurasia, the authors found diverse correlation patterns between snow conditions and the following warm season's rainfall over South and Southeast Asia. Some of the results contradict the well-known inverse relationships between snow and the summer monsoon. This study provides an easy comparison of results in that it shows the connections between Eurasian snow and monsoon rainfall by using different Eurasian snow indicators based on the best available historical records without discrimination of regional variations in snow conditions.

AB  - The effectiveness of protected areas in maintaining biodiversity is increasingly under debate. Specifically, the responses of animal populations in freshwater ecosystems to disturbances outside protected areas are not well understood. Fish assemblages can serve as an indicator of such responses. We used dry season oxbow lake fish occurrence data implemented within a Measurement of Biodiversity framework to examine the influence of extractive activities on the richness, structure and abundance of fish assemblages. We compared oxbow lakes in protected areas with lakes subject to artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) and other human activities. The main components of fish biodiversity maintained by lake protection were abundance and biomass. The strongest predictors of community structure were fishing intensity and water transparency. As variation in these factors are likely a consequence of ASGM, our results may indicate indirect impacts of ASGM on freshwater ecosystems. Our analysis of fish trophic guilds also suggested that carnivores dominated fish assemblages in protected lakes, whereas in disturbed lakes detritivores were more frequent, suggesting a trophic downgrading of freshwater ecosystems subject to ASGM. Taken together, our results indicate responses of fish assemblages to human activity associated with ASGM. In the western Amazon, protected and isolated areas appear to be successful at maintaining the integrity of fish assemblages. Given the vulnerability of freshwater habitats and their high value for ecosystem services, we recommend local community engagement and resource allocation to prevent the degradation of oxbow lake habitats and the depletion of local aquatic biodiversity in unprotected areas.

AB  - In this paper, we evaluate relationships between in-stream habitat, water chemistry, spatial distribution within a predominantly agricultural Midwestern watershed and geomorphic features and fish assemblage attributes and abundances. Our specific objectives were to: (1) identify and quantify key environmental variables at reach and system wide (watershed) scales; and (2) evaluate the relative influence of those environmental factors in structuring and explaining fish assemblage attributes at reach scales to help prioritize stream monitoring efforts and better incorporate all factors that influence aquatic biology in watershed management programs. The original combined data set consisted of 31 variables measured at 32 sites, which was reduced to 9 variables through correlation and linear regression analysis: stream order, percent wooded riparian zone, drainage area, in-stream cover quality, substrate quality, gradient, cross-sectional area, width of the flood prone area, and average substrate size. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and variance partitioning were used to relate environmental variables to fish species abundance and assemblage attributes. Fish assemblages and abundances were explained best by stream size, gradient, substrate size and quality, and percent wooded riparian zone. Further data are needed to investigate why water chemistry variables had insignificant relationships with IBI scores. Results suggest that more quantifiable variables and consideration of spatial location of a stream reach within a watershed system should be standard data incorporated into stream monitoring programs to identify impairments that, while biologically limiting, are not fully captured or elucidated using current bioassessment methods.

AB  - Determining trophic condition of a wetland is an important step in scientific assessment of the aquatic ecosystem. High levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, is mainly the result of human activities in agriculture, industry, etc. Increasing levels of nutrients result in eutrophication of water ecosystems. Regarding the importance of Anzali international wetland, the present study conducted several models of Carlsons on trophic status of the wetland through 1985, 2007, 2014 and 2017. The evaluated stations include, Bandar Anzali under bridge, Sorkhankal, PirBazar, Siadarvishan, Nokhaleh, east of wetlands, Hendkhaleh, and west of wetland. The results of Analysis of Variance indicated significant difference (p<0.05) among values of the indicators listed in stations and different seasons. Assessment of trophy index (TSI) on total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) in order to reveal wetland condition determined oligotrophic and mesotrophic conditions in 1985 to acute hypertrophy in recent years. The results showed increase in the amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen during 1985 to 2017.

AB  - Investigating sources of microbial contamination in urban streams, especially when there are no contributions from combined sewer overflows or sewage effluent discharges, can be challenging. The objectives of this study were to identify the sources of microbes in an urban stream and quantify their relative contributions to the microbial community in the stream under dry and wet weather conditions. A microbial source tracking method relying on the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate the microbial communities in water samples of an urban stream (i.e., from 11 dry and 6 wet weather events), as well as in streambed sediment, soils, street sweepings, sanitary sewage, an upstream lake, and feces of animals and birds collected between 2013 and 2015. The results showed that the Escherichia coli levels in the stream were significantly higher in wet weather flow than in dry weather flow. The upstream lake contributed approximately 93% of the microbes in dry weather flows. Water discharged from storm drain outfalls was the biggest source of microbes in wet weather flows, with a median contribution of approximately 90% in the rising limb and peak flow and about 75% in the declining limb of storms. Furthermore, about 70 to 75% of the microbes in the storm drain outfall water came from materials washed off from the street surfaces in the watershed. Fecal samples did not appear to contribute substantially to the microbes in environmental samples. The results highlight the significance of street surfaces in contributing microbial loads to urban streams under wet weather conditions.
   IMPORTANCE Identifying the sources of microbial contamination is important for developing best management practices to protect the water quality of urban streams for recreational uses. This study collected a large number of water samples from an urban stream under both dry and wet weather conditions and provided quantitative information on the relative contributions of various environmental compartments to the overall microbial contamination in the stream under the two weather conditions. The watershed in this study represents urban watersheds where no dominant fecal sources are consistently present. The findings highlight the importance of reducing the direct contribution of microbes from street surfaces in the watershed to urban streams under wet weather conditions. The methods and findings from this study are expected to be useful to stormwater managers and regulatory agencies.

AB  - Environmental effects of enlargement works in Puerto Calero (Lanzarote, Canary Islands) were analysed in the sediments using abiotic variables (total hydrocarbons, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, organic matter and granulometry) and three biotic indexes (AMBI, M-AMBI and BENTIX). A before-after/control-impact (BACI) design was developed with four sampling campaigns, before (November 2004), during (March and July 2005) and after (July 2006) works. Inner stations were characterised by high concentrations of pollutants (total hydrocarbons and polyaromatic hydrocarbons). A temporal trend (2004-2006) was observed in macrofaunal assemblage structure, and thus in AMBI, M-AMBI and BENTIX indexes. Macrobenthic assemblages also mirrored the pollution gradient, with bioindicator species in inner stations (the polychaete Pseudopolydora paucibranchiata and the mollusc Abra alba), sensitive species (the sipunculid Aspidosiphon muelleri, the crustacean Pariambus typicus and the polychaete Aponuphis bilineata) in outer stations and ubiquitous species (the polychaetes Aricidea assimilis and Armandia polyophthalma) in both stations (inner and outer).

AB  - The antiviral function of carbon dots (CDots) with visible light exposure was evaluated, for which the model bacteriophages MS2 as a surrogate of small RNA viruses were used. The results show clearly that the visible light-activated CDots are highly effective in diminishing the infectivity of MS2 in both low and high titer samples to the hostE. colicells, and the antiviral effects are dot concentration- and treatment time-dependent. The action of CDots apparently causes no significant damage to the structural integrity and morphology of the MS2 phage or the breakdown of the capsid proteins, but does result in the protein carbonylation (a commonly used indicator for protein oxidation) and the degradation of viral genomic RNA. Mechanistically the results may be understood in the framework of photodynamic effects that are associated with the unique excited state properties and processes of CDots. Opportunities for potentially broad applications of CDots coupled with visible/natural light in the prevention and control of viral transmission and spread are highlighted and discussed.

AB  - 'Stone-lines' are widespread Quaternary features that appear in tropical and subtropical regions. They have a diverse nature and genesis, and are frequently associated with archaeological assemblages. However, archaeological deposition and 'stone-line' configuration may be unrelated geological events separated by thousands of years. The energetics involved in 'stone-line' formation, coarse and fine material translocation across space and in depth, and overall assemblage integrity vary from one site to another. This paper presents quantitative and spatial geoarchaeological data from the site of Mosumu, in the tropical rain forest of continental Equatorial Guinea. Mosumu yielded Middle and Later Stone Age assemblages dated to at least the last 30,000 years in a 'stone-line' context. Special attention to the study of vertical and horizontal variations of artifacts, sedimentary features, and taphonomic indicators allows analysis of the nature, meaning, and archeological resolution at this site. The results are placed in the wider debate over the meaning of 'stone-lines' in the African Quaternary record. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite advances in neurology, drug delivery to the brain remains a substantial challenge. This is mainly due to the insurmountable and selective nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we show that the thermal energy generated by magnetic heating (hyperthermia) of commercially available magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in the brain capillaries of rats can transiently increase barrier permeability. Here, the fluorescent Evans Blue (EB) dye was used to verify the BBB integrity. Results indicate a substantial but reversible opening of the BBB where hyperthermia is applied. Also, in this investigation, analysis of CD68 immunoreactivity, an indicator of inflammation, implies that this technique is not associated with any inflammation. We have previously investigated theranostic (therapeutic and diagnostic) capabilities of the MNPs, therefore, the findings presented in this investigation are particularly encouraging for a novel targeted drug delivery system to the brain.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery for the identification and determination of forest patches of particular interest, with respect to ecosystem integrity and biodiversity and to produce a relevant biodiversity map, based on Simpson's diversity index in Taxiarchis university research forest, Chalkidiki, North Greece. The research is based on OBIA being developed on to bi-temporal summer and winter Sentinel-2 imagery. Fuzzy rules, which are based on topographic factors, such as terrain elevation and slope for the distribution of each tree species, derived from expert knowledge and field observations, were used to improve the accuracy of tree species classification. Finally, Simpson's diversity index for forest tree species, was calculated and mapped, constituting a relative indicator for biodiversity for forest ecosystem organisms (fungi, insects, birds, reptiles, mammals) and carrying implications for the identification of patches prone to disturbance or that should be prioritized for conservation.

AB  - In order to find the ways of improving the methods of personal integration, we conducted a comparative analysis of how participants perceive trance practices in standard format and in the format containing additional integrative lexicon. The role of verbal communication is indicated as helpful to clients in their personality integration. On the basis of previous studies, the criteria for an integrated personality are determined. According to these criteria, the subjects in the state of personal integration come into contact with their deep essence; their personality structure changes towards personification; the ability for transpersonal communication, internal motivation, and special resource states of consciousness develop. The article presents a review of the associative vocabulary of the keywords which are in a statistically significant connection with the image of an integrated personality, and which reflect the process and the result of its harmonization. The most common keywords refer to the following categories: "Action" (it includes verbs that are used at the stage of clarifying the client's problems, interacting with the problematic parts of client's self including inner self), "Definition" (is reflects qualitative and quantitative characteristics of personality integration), and "State" (it describes integrative experiences as indicators to identify the inner self, to stabilize and develop the process of integration). With the help of the psycho-semantic method of subjective scaling, we identified significant differences in the dynamics of the recipients' states in trance methods without a built-in lexicon and methods containing additional integrative lexicon.
   The results of participating in trance methods without built-in lexicon show an increase in the self-realization aspect in the activities of the subjects. There is a wider range of changes in the state of the participants after their participation in trans methods which include integrative lexicon. The specific nature of these changes consists of: a greater acceptance of oneself, broadening the boundaries of self-perception, awareness and integrity. The scope of practical application of the results is: the psychological support in the process of formation and development of a personality in the context of psychological counseling. The verbal messages of a psychologist, which are built in accordance with integrative lexicon, provide a basic construct and give a starting point, that helps the client to perform his journey to integrity, gradually coming to acceptance of the world and of oneself, and to fulfill one's potential.

AB  - Water quality in Tolo Harbour and Channel (Tolo) has been improved since 1998 after the diversion of sewage effluent. However, it remains poorly understood how nutrient loading reduction has impacted the phytoplankton community. To evaluate this, we applied a Phytoplankton Community Index PI(mp) to the 23-year data (1991-2013) at inner (TM4) and outer (TM8) sites in Tolo, with the former being more eutrophic than the latter. The results show that 1) the phytoplankton community changed with time after sewage diversion; 2) "diatoms and dinoflagellates" were better indicators of nutrient impact than "autotrophic/mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates"; 3) the rate of recovery differed between the two stations, but both reached a similar state at a similar time; 4) seasonality of the phytoplankton community showed greater disturbance in spring than in other seasons. Our findings indicate that the nutrient reduction in the Tolo resulted in a positive change in the phytoplankton community.

AB  - Epigenetic mechanisms regulating expression of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) promoter may influence behavioral and biological aspects of stress response in human infants. Acoustic features of infant crying are an indicator of neurobehavioral and neurological status not yet investigated in relation to epigenetic mechanisms. We examined NR3C1 methylation in placental tissue from a series of 120 healthy newborn infants in relation to a detailed set of acoustic features extracted from newborn infant cries. We identified significant associations of NR3C1 methylation with energy variation in infants' cries as well as with the presence of very high fundamental frequency in cry utterances. The presence of high fundamental frequency in cry (above 1 kHz) has been linked to poor vocal tract control, poor regulation of stress response, and may be an indicator or poor neurobehavioral integrity. Thus, these results add to evidence linking epigenetic alteration of the NR3C1 gene in the placenta to neurodevelopmental features in infants.

AB  - The success of compensatory wetland replacement is frequently judged on the basis of percent vegetation cover. Measuring percent cover of wetland species, or the survival of planted species, especially only one or two years after construction seems tautological. Aquatic insects have been used for many years as indicators of ecosystem integrity and may be useful as an integrative wetland assessment tool. This study was initiated to determine if adult insect assemblages could be used to differentiate between wetlands and uplands, and to identify site characteristics, especially vegetation, related to patterns in insect assemblages. We collected adult insect assemblages using light traps at wetlands in northeastern Ohio and southeastern Texas. We also measured properties of wetland vegetation structure and composition around the light traps and performed indirect gradient analysis. We found that ordinations of flying nocturnal insect assemblages generally separated upland from wetland sites and that insect ordination patterns were related to vegetation density and predominant vegetation growth forms such as vines, herbs, shrubs and trees.

AB  - UNS N10003 alloy is wildly used as a heat-resistant material for components to be used in high temperature thorium molten salt reactor (TMSR). Because of high temperature operating environment, prediction of its creep behavior is required for safety assessment of reactors. In this study, a series of uniaxial tensile creep tests has been conducted at 650 degrees C in an applied stress range from 220 MPa to 380 MPa. A creep damage model for UNS N10003 alloy based on Lemaitre's work has been derived as well as a creep constitutive equation for modelling creep strain. The experimental data have been used to determine parameters in the constitutive equation and the damage model. The model has been applied to structural integrity assessment of a thin-walled pressure vessel design for TMSR. The numerical results indicate that the pressure vessel design for TMSR is sound and safe in its designated 10-year design life.

AB  - In this study we have modified the BioPhotonics workstation (BWS), which allows for using long working distance objective for optical trapping, to include traditional epi-fluorescence microscopy, using the trapping objectives. We have also added temperature regulation of sample stage, allowing for fast temperature variations while trapping. Using this modified BWS setup, we investigated the internal pH (pH(i)) response and membrane integrity of an optically trapped Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell at 5 mW subject to increasing temperatures. The pH(i) of the cell is obtained from the emission of 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester, at 435 and 485 nm wavelengths, while the permeability is indicated by the fluorescence of propidium iodide. We present images mapping the pH(i) and permeability of the cell at different temperatures and with enough spatial resolution to localize these attributes within the cell. The combined capability of optical trapping, fluorescence microscopy and temperature regulation offers a versatile tool for biological research. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - Crabtree Creek, a relatively shallow stream in Wake County, North Carolina is a major tributary of the Neuse River, which has historically received much attention with regards to water quality and health concerns within the state. We undertook a preliminary survey of Crabtree Creek in an effort to assess the water quality and determine the ecological integrity of this drainage system. Data were obtained during spring, fall, and winter at seven sites along the creek. The substrate ranged from boulder to cobble, gravel, and sand with moderate to heavy sedimentation at many sites. Dissolved oxygen was not considered stressful to organisms, except at one location, and most chemical parameters fell within normal ranges. Coliform bacteria, detected at all locations, were especially high in four of the seven study sites. Overall, taxa diversity and richness were low, and the invertebrate community included few ephemeropterans, plecopterans, and trichopterans but had many other pollution-tolerant species. Depending upon the site and season, the biotic index suggested water quality ranged from very good to very poor.

AB  - Considering the relevant role played by the hydrological regime on the structure and functioning of floodplains, this study aims at characterizing different types of aquatic environments according to periphyton biomass and evaluating the influence of the fluviometric levels of the Parana River and other forcing functions upon the periphytic community. Periphyton (chlorophyll a) was analyzed in 28 habitats, during the years 2000 and 2001, in high and low water seasons. Both years were characterized by lacking the characteristic high water season. The Principal Components Analysis revealed two groups. The first component was positively associated with hydrometric level, electric conductivity. pH and transparency, and negatively with total nitrogen and total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon and turbidity. The second component separated the habitats of Parana River in the period of low waters from other environments, mainly for hydrometric level and high transparency values. Periphytic biomass of the habitats demonstrated that the maintenance of the functional integrity of the Upper Parana River floodplain is closely related to its hydrologic cycle.

TI  - True versus perturbed forest inventory plot locations for modeling: a simulation study
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis plot information is widely used for timber inventories, forest health assessments, and environmental risk analyses. With few exceptions, true plot locations are not revealed; the plot coordinates are manipulated to obscure the location of field plots and thereby preserve plot integrity. The influence of perturbed plot locations on the development and accuracy of statistical models is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the influence is related to the spatial structure of the data used in the models. For ordinary kriging we examined the difference in mean square error based on true and perturbed plot locations across a range of spatial autocorrelations. We also examined the difference in mean square error for regression models developed with true and perturbed plot locations across a range of spatial autocorrelations and spatial resolutions. Perturbing plot locations did not significantly influence the accuracy of kriging estimates, but in some situations linear regression model development and accuracy were significantly influenced. Unless the independent variable has high spatial autocorrelation, only coarse spatial resolution data should be used to develop linear regression models.

AB  - Clinical assessment is the gold standard of diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and assessment of the success of therapeutic interventions. Changes in clinical state are the principal indicator of disease presence and progression. Clinical status is a complex state determined by an interaction of host and disease factors. Host factors manifest as cerebral reserve, determined by genetic and environmental-historical influences. Variability in host factors creates variability in clinical states not attributable to disease burden and compromises the extent to which clinical evaluation and disease activity are directly related. The utility of biomarkers is judged by the degree to which they reflect clinical outcomes. Some biomarkers are more directly related to disease activity. are less influenced by host factors, have smaller standard deviation of measures, and require fewer patients to establish between-group differences than clinical assessment. Biomarkers must closely reflct clinical outcomes to be useful as evaluations of disease progression or as outcomes in clinical trials.

AB  - The utility and credibility of environmental assessments depend on the use of unbiased data. However, it is increasingly clear that, despite peer review, much of the scientific literature is biased. Sources of bias include publication practices, research design and implementation, funding influences, investigator expectations, statistical methods, confounding, suppression, and fraud. Assessors can take precautions against biased data by performing their own reviews of the sources of data, checking for retractions and corrections, requiring full disclosure of methods, acquiring original data and reanalyzing it, avoiding secondary sources, avoiding unreplicated studies or studies that are not concordant with related studies, and checking for funding or investigator biases. Journals, government agencies, and other institutions can take many more types of actions to reduce bias in scientific data. Some of these are already being implemented but others will require a greater willingness to enforce scientific ethical standards.

AB  - Environmental control in galleries and museums is a necessity and is informed by the knowledge of ongoing processes of deterioration which can threaten the integrity and stability of artworks. Invisible dimensional changes in many works of art occur following environmental fluctuations as materials respond to the changes in humidity and temperature. The constant influence of dimensional changes usually remains invisible until displacement generates visible deterioration and irreversible damage. This paper exploits fully non contact coherent interferometry in a sequential masking procedure for visualising and studying surface deformation which is the direct effect of dimensional alterations induced by humidity changes. Surface deformation during dimensional displacements of constituent materials may occur on any artwork within an unstable environment. In this context, the presented research study explores the diagnostic potential of fully non contact sensors for the direct structural assessment of environmental effects as they occur in real time on works of art. The method is employed to characterise material responses, complementing and improving understanding of material behaviour in unstable environments.

AB  - ICI has developed over many years a comprehensive approach to loss prevention via its 6 stage hazard study methodology for Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) protection. More recently, regulatory requirements have reinforced the need to reduce the SHE risks arising from process operations to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable. The integrity of existing operations, which predate the rigorous application of the hazard study approach, are regularly reviewed and assessed given best current practise on design and operating standards. It is apparent from such studies that considerable specialist expertise and plant manpower is required to perform such an assessment adequately. This paper, therefore, describes the development of a rapid evaluation technique to help facilitate the assessment of environmental risks from process plant and the effectiveness of tank bunding. The technique, Rapid Assessment of Spill Potential (RASP), builds on and adapts well proven ideas used in the Hazard Study methodology. These ideas have been incorporated into a flexible modelling tool based on object oriented techniques.

AB  - To analyze different methodological approaches to determining the marketing attractiveness of international markets and their convergence assessing. Develop an indicators system for assessing the convergence of international markets to determine their marketing attractiveness for domestic agricultural enterprises. The international markets have been rated on the basis of summing the ranks of indicators of attractiveness method of their business environment for Ukrainian farmers by the product group "1008 Buckwheat, millet and other cereals" in order to identify more favorable conditions for doing business. The application of this approach allowed to develop a target portfolio for further targeting the implementation of the internationalization strategy by domestic producers of the product group "1008 Buckwheat, millet and other cereals". The methodological basis of the study are general and special research methods: epistemological and systems analysis - in the study of 'economic convergence" definition; systems theory and systems analysis - to analyze of process determining the marketing attractiveness of international markets and assessing their convergence; statistical analysis, synthesis and comparison - to identify trends in the entry of agricultural enterprises of Ukraine to international markets; comprehensive assessment of the convergence of agricultural enterprises of Ukraine under the conditions of international diversification. It has been proved that in the expert assessment of convergence indicators the markets of foreign countries, the indicators of which are as close as possible to the economy of Ukraine, should be singled out. It has been determined that the markets of Austria and Nigeria are promising for domestic agricultural enterprises, producers of the commodity group "1008 Buckwheat, millet and other cereals", with the possibility of overcoming a significant gap in certain indicators, namely: the market of Austria, Nigeria where there is low quality regulation and also unfavorable investment conditions. The scientific and methodological approach to the complex assessment of the convergence of new international markets for domestic agricultural enterprises under the conditions of international diversification has been substantiated and developed. The result of the evaluation allowed to come up to the conclusions about the marketing opportunities of domestic agricultural enterprises under the conditions of entering the markets of these countries. As a result of the proposed approach, it is possible to identify foreign markets that demonstrate favorable conditions for doing business in them, which indicates the presence of convergent conditions, which is a prerequisite for the entry of goods of domestic agricultural enterprises in the markets of these countries. As a result of the proposed approaches, there were identified new international markets, that demonstrated favorable conditions for doing business in them by domestic agricultural enterprises producing the product group "1008 Buckwheat, millet and other cereals". It has beed developed in the study a target portfolio for further targeting the strategy implementation of internationalization domestic producers of the product group "1008 Buckwheat, millet and other cereals".

AB  - Temperature-humidity index (THI) calculation following the equation developed by the National Research Council (A Guide to Environmental Research on Animals, 1971) requires ambient temperature (AT) and relative humidity (RH). Those data are widely and readily available at local meteorological stations. However, studies showed that using average AT and RH retrieved from the closest stations is not appropriate for estimating on-farm conditions. The present objectives were (1) to study summer on-farm environmental conditions, (2) to explore the relationship between summer THI calculated with on-farm data and summer THI calculated with local weather station data, and (3) to verify whether THI calculated with summer meteorological station data could be adapted to better represent summer on-farm conditions. Six tiestall dairy farms located in 2 regions of the province of Quebec [ Eastern Quebec (EQ) and Southwestern Quebec (SWQ)] were enrolled in this study. Within-barn conditions were monitored using 3 remote data loggers from August 2016 through August 2017. Two loggers were installed inside at varying distances relative to the ventilation inlet (L1: closest to inlet; L2: farthest from inlet) and a third was installed just outside of the barn (L3). Values retrieved from each logger and the closest local meteorological station were used to calculate daily THI according to the National Research Council formula and were ultimately compared. Our results showed that THI varied within the barn depending on the proximity relative to the inlet because THI measured by L1 was lower than THI measured by L2 in both regions. Moreover, our results showed that in both regions AT measured onfarm was consistently higher than AT measured at the weather station. The opposite was observed with RH, as it was significantly lower on-farm in EQ and numerically lower in SWQ compared with RH extracted from weather stations. Overall, this led to THI being lower by 4.6 and 3.7 units at the weather stations compared with within-barn conditions for EQ and SWQ farms, respectively. Hence, using local meteorological station data to estimate on-farm conditions would lead to an underestimation of heat stress level in dairy cows. Adapting THI calculations by including daily maximum AT and minimum RH retrieved from the local weather station instead of their average counterparts led to a better estimation of within-barn conditions. However, the difference between THI measured on-farm and the adapted THI calculated with weather station data remained significant. Although the adaption made to THI allowed for a closer relation to on-farm conditions, THI calculated with weather station data should only be used to assess heat stress level in dairy cows when heat stress thresholds are adapted for such data.

AB  - Simple Summary Chronic heat-stress exposure directly affects broiler immune response. Immunosuppression was demonstrated in broiler exposed to chronic heat stress with deterioration in humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Natural immune modulator material is considered as a safe material for human consumption of poultry products. Citrullus colocynthis (CC) is a natural herb plant that has traditionally been used in folk remediation. Anti-diabetic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory attributes are some of the CC medical properties. The present study aims to investigate the immune modulator potentials of CC seeds supplementation to chronically heat- stressed-exposed broilers. Results demonstrated that CC seeds supplementation to heat-stressed broilers was able to alleviate the negative impacts of heat stress on broiler immune responses and antioxidant status. Thus, CC seeds are suggested to be added to broilers reared under heat stress in order to improve the immune response and consequently ameliorate productivity. There is an extensive search for natural products that can be introduced to broiler rations to improve performance, especially during the unfavorable breeding conditions. Under heat-stress conditions, the immune response seriously deteriorates, which consequently impairs broiler production performance. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the potentials of Citrullus colocynthis seeds (CCs) supplementation to modulate the immune response of broilers subjected to chronic heat stress. A total of 300 Cobb-500 male broiler chickens aged 21 days were randomly divided into two equal groups and reared under either thermo-neutral condition (24 +/- 1 degrees C) or subjected to cyclic heat stress (34 +/- 1 degrees C for 8 h). Each group was further divided into two groups (5 replicate x 15 chicks) and was fed either the basal diet or the basal diet with 0.1% CCs supplementation. The results showed that heat stress impaired the production performance by lowering the final body weight and feed intake as well as impairing feed conversion. The levels of stress markers (i.e., malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and corticosterone) increased (p < 0.05), whereas the activity of antioxidant enzymes decreased in broilers exposed to heat stress. Further, heat stress caused direct suppression of broiler humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The stimulating index of T and B lymphocytes proliferation, as well as the antibody titer against sheep red blood cells, were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by heat-stress exposure. However, CCs supplementation to broilers subjected to heat stress improved (p < 0.05) the final body weight, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (FCR), compared to the non-supplemented stressed group. The cellular and cell-mediated immune response indicators significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) with CCs supplementation. Supplementation of CCs to broilers reared under similar environmental conditions elevated the total white blood cells (TWBCs) count and the broiler stimulating index of T and B lymphocytes. It can be concluded that CC seeds can be effectively used to stimulate the immune response and improve the production performance of broilers reared under heat-stress condition.

AB  - 3D electron diffraction (3D ED), also known as micro-crystal electron diffraction (MicroED), is a rapid, accurate, and robust method for structure determination of submicron-sized crystals. 3D ED has mainly been applied in material science until 2013, when MicroED was developed for studying macromolecular crystals. MicroED was considered as a cryo-electron microscopy method, as MicroED data collection is usually carried out in cryogenic conditions. As a result, some researchers may consider that 3D ED/MicroED data collection on crystals of small organic molecules can only be performed in cryogenic conditions. In this work, we determined the structure for sucrose and azobenzene tetracarboxylic acid (H(4)ABTC). The structure of H(4)ABTC is the first crystal structure ever reported for this molecule. We compared data quality and structure accuracy among datasets collected under cryogenic conditions and room temperature. With the improvement in data quality by data merging, it is possible to reveal hydrogen atom positions in small organic molecule structures under both temperature conditions. The experimental results showed that, if the sample is stable in the vacuum environment of a transmission electron microscope (TEM), the data quality of datasets collected under room temperature is at least as good as data collected under cryogenic conditions according to various indicators (resolution, I/sigma(I), CC1/2 (%), R-1, R-int, ADRA).

AB  - Agri-environmental indicators such as nutrient balance may play a key role in soil and water quality monitoring, although short-term experiments might be unable to capture the sustainability of cropping systems. Therefore, the objectives of this study are: (i) to evaluate the reliability of long-term experimental N and P balance estimates to predict real field (RF) (i.e., short-term transitory) conditions; and (ii) to compare the sustainability of short- and long-term experiments. The LTE-based predictions showed that crops are generally over-fertilised in RF conditions, particularly maize. Nutrient balance predictions based on the LTE data tended to be more optimistic than those observed under RF conditions, which are often characterised by lower outputs; in particular, 13, 44, and 47% lower yields were observed for winter wheat, maize, and soybean, respectively, under organic management. The graphical evaluation of N and P use efficiency demonstrated the benefit of adopting crop rotation practices and the risk of nutrient loss when liquid organic fertiliser was applied on a long-term basis. In conclusion, LTE predictions may depend upon specific RF conditions, representing potential N and P use efficiencies that, in RF, may be reduced by crop yield-limiting factors and the specific implemented crop sequence.

AB  - Wildland fire is a key ecosystem process that shapes the landscape of Western United States. Changes in fire regimes can therefore have profound impact on ecosystem functions and services, including carbon cycling, habitat conditions, and biodiversity. This study examined fire regime changes in the Northern Rocky Mountain region using a landscape succession model (LANDSUMv4). The objective is to report a new method to develop fire regime condition class (FRCC) maps by comparing historical reference conditions of fire regimes simulated using historical fire record and the LANDSUMv4 model - with current fire regimes developed using 27 years remote sensing fire product and LANDSUMv4. Results of this study indicate that most forest ecosystems in the study region experienced less frequent but more severe fires during the contemporary time period compared to the historical conditions. Fire regimes have changed the most for montane forests which historically were dominated by frequent and nonlethal fires. Forest ecosystems characterized by infrequent stand replacement fires also experienced moderate departure from historical fire conditions. FRCC assessment method proposed in this study can be applied to other areas of U.S. The findings of this study will help reveal contemporary fire dynamics in this region and serve for future fire and fuel studies and other forest management applications.

AB  - Quinoa is a traditional Andean seed crop highly tolerant to abiotic stresses. Since most seed crops cultivars are sensitive to drought stress, quinoa is considered as a valuable candidate for severe environmental conditions to which the plant is exposed. In this study we focused on the impact of hydropriming on drought tolerance in three quinoa cultivars (Q26, Q29 and Titicaca) in two arid regions of Iran. We observed that, under field conditions, quinoa responded to drought stress with a significant decrease in growth, yield component, seed yield and biochemical traits including photosynthetic pigments and relative water contents. In contrast, malondialdehyde, electrolyte leakage and proline concentration in all quinoa cultivars in both regions increased. However, seed priming significantly improved growth and seed yield. The results of the correlation analysis revealed that seed yield was highly positively related to pigments and proline concentration. Therefore, it could be suggested that these traits are efficient and reliable indicators for indirect selection of tolerant quinoa cultivars under drought stress conditions. In general, Q26 and Q29 were considered as superior cultivars for well-watered conditions and Titicaca cultivar was found relatively more drought tolerant than other cultivars. This study may contribute to the understanding of seed priming could be applied as an efficient approach to ameliorate the adverse effects of drought stress in quinoa cultivars.

AB  - Spatially distributed environmental measurements at plant level can be used to create a precise and detailed representation of the climate at various regions inside a greenhouse. Climatic heterogeneity can cause significant differences in terms of yield, productivity, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the plants, as well as the development of various diseases. This work presents: i) the assessment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) operation reliability and accuracy in actual greenhouse conditions, ii) the development of a distributed monitoring system using a WSN in a commercial greenhouse, and iii) the analysis of the collected spatially distributed data for the investigation of possible problematic situations for the growing plants caused by climatic heterogeneity inside the greenhouse. A prototype WSN was initially developed in order to investigate the effects of the environmental conditions to the operation reliability of the network and assess its performance and the feasibility of its operation in a commercial greenhouse. The enhanced WSN was then installed in a commercial greenhouse to investigate the spatial variation of the existing environmental conditions. Analysis based on WSN measurements showed significant spatial variability in temperature and humidity with average differences up to 3.3 degrees C and 9% relative humidity and transpiration, with the greatest variability occurring during daytime in the summer period. There were conditions that favoured condensation on leaf surfaces and other problematic situations. (c) 2016 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - For signalling to be honest the handicap principle claims that signals must impose fitness costs so that only the best individuals can afford the most exaggerated signals. The cost of signalling in terms of reduced survival decreases, however, towards the end of an individual's lifetime, which can induce an increase in signalling effort as a terminal effort. I show for the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, that a decrease in survival prospects through impaired condition leads to an increase in red nuptial coloration that makes the signal less reliable as an indicator of male parental ability. Males in poor condition with a large signal sometimes cannibalized all the eggs tl-ley received, probably to start a new breeding cycle with a higher energy reserve. However, the inclusion of socially imposed costs of signalling through male-male competition during courtship increased the honesty of the signal, as some males in poor condition and of poor parental ability decreased their signal expression. Some cheaters still occurred, but the signalling system was honest on average. This implies that socially imposed costs are important in the maintenance of honest sexual signalling. Dishonesty may occur under favourable conditions when the cost of signalling is reduced. This emphasizes the importance of considering the environmental conditions experienced by individuals when investigating the evolution and maintenance of honest sexual signals.

AB  - Lecideoid lichens as dominant vegetation-forming organisms in the climatically harsh areas of the southern part of continental Antarctica show clear preferences in relation to environmental conditions (i.e. macroclimate). 306 lichen samples were included in the study, collected along the Ross Sea coast (78 degrees S-85.5 degrees S) at six climatically different sites. The species compositions as well as the associations of their two dominant symbiotic partners (myco- and photobiont) were set in context with environmental conditions along the latitudinal gradient. Diversity values were nonlinear with respect to latitude, with the highest alpha diversity in the milder areas of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (78 degrees S) and the most southern areas (Durham Point, 85.5 degrees S; Garden Spur, 84.5 degrees S), and lowest in the especially arid and cold Darwin Area (similar to 79.8 degrees S). Furthermore, the specificity of mycobiont species towards their photobionts decreased under more severe climate conditions. The generalist lichen species Lecanora fuscobrunnea and Lecidea cancriformis were present in almost all habitats, but were dominant in climatically extreme areas. Carbonea vorticosa, Lecidella greenii and Rhizoplaca macleanii were confined to milder areas. In summary, the macroclimate is considered to be the main driver of species distribution, making certain species useful as bioindicators of climate conditions and, consequently, for assessing the consequences of climate change.

AB  - It is well established that the expression of many ornamental traits is dependent on the current condition of the bearer. However, conditions experienced in early life are also known to be important for an individual's subsequent fitness and therefore, directly or indirectly, for the fitness of their mate. Specifically, a recent hypothesis suggests that sexually selected traits might be sensitive to conditions experienced during early-life development and thereby function as honest indicators of developmental history. Whether this applies to colourful male plumage, however, is largely unknown. We tested this idea with a field experiment by manipulating neonatal nutrition in a sexually dichromatic passerine, the hihi (Notymystis cincta). We found that carotenoid supplementation increased nestling plasma carotenoid concentration, which was in turn correlated with increased yellow saturation in male breeding plumage after moulting. We also found that the post-moult luminance (lightness) of the white ear-tufts tended to be reduced in males that had received an all-round nutritional supplement as nestlings. Black breeding plumage was not affected by neonatal nutritional treatment. Although the mechanisms that generate colourful plumage are evidently diverse, our results show that at least some parts of this display are accurate indicators of environmental conditions during development.

AB  - A field study was performed with 218 dairy cows in nine dairy herds in order to investigate the prevalence of post partum fatty infiltration of the liver and its relationship to subsequent body condition scores, blood variables and milk production. The mean concentration of triacylglycerols in the liver was 61.2 mg/g wet liver tissue. The prevalence of fatty liver (more than 50 mg triacylglycerol in 1 g wet liver tissue) was 54.1%. Serum non-esterified fatty acids, urea and blood glucose concentrations appeared to be significant indicators of hepatic lipidosis between 6 and 17 days post partum (R-2 = 0.33). High milk production and large losses of body condition score in early lactation were significant indicators of hepatic lipidosis from a retrospective point of view (R-2=0.22). Single body condition scores were not significantly related to the concentration of triacylglycerol in the liver. It was concluded that, according to the classification used, fatty liver seems to be fairly common in early lactating dairy cows. Although correlation coefficients were too low to enable a precise and accurate description of liver triacylglycerol content, we found some biologically explicable variables in commercial herds that were significantly related to the liver triacylglycerol content.

AB  - Secondary sexual traits can be indicators of individual condition that may present seasonal polyphenism as a result of the differential costs of expression along the season. Wing spots in male damselflies of the Calopterygidae family are secondary sexual traits associated with intrasexual competition and mate choice. Hetaerina titiaDrury is a calopterygid damselfly where males show red and black wing spots, contrasting with other species of the genus whose males only express a red wing spot. In the present study, we evaluate the seasonal variation of the expression of male's red and black wing spots and their allometric patterns. Additionally, we measure male condition in the form of proteins, lipids, soluble carbohydrates and glycogen in early and late seasons. Black wing spots present higher variation than red wing spots and males of the late season are more pigmented. Allometry is positive for wing red spot in the early season and for black spot in the late season. Males of the late season present a higher concentration of proteins, soluble carbohydrates and glycogen, although there is no variation in the lipid content. The results of the present study suggest that, in H. titia males, black pigmentation replaces the function of the red pigmentation to signal condition. Both traits, however, may be heavily affected by environmental situations (e.g. food availability).

KW  - FAULT-DETECTION

KW  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - Condition assessment (CA) of bearings can be performed by using left-right hidden Markov models, because of the monotonically increasing pattern of the bearings degradation. Classical CA approaches assume that all possible system states are fixed and known a priori. The training of the system is performed offline at once with data from all of the system states. These assumptions significantly impede condition assessment applications in case that all the possible states of the system are not known in advance, or changes in environmental or operative conditions occur during the tool's usage. To overcome these limitations, we propose combining left-right continuous HMMs (CHMM) with a change point detection algorithm for (i) estimating, from historical observations, the initial number of the CHMM states and the initial guess of its model parameters and (ii) updating the state space as well as the model parameters during monitoring. Moreover, to deal with multidimensional sensor measurements, we propose using kernel principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the proposed methodology have been performed using both simulated and real data from the NASA benchmark repository. Compared to state of the art techniques, the proposed methodology results in (i) an improvement of the HMM training phase in terms of iterations number; (ii) the detection of unknown states at an early stage; and (iii) an effective change of the CHMM's structure to represent the degradation processes more accurately in presence of unknown conditions.

AB  - Conditions in James Lake vary from uncontaminated and nearly neutral pH conditions through most of the lake, to extremely low pH conditions (2.1 in places) contaminated with Fe, Al and SO, adjacent to an abandoned pyrite mine near the lake outlet. Six assemblages representative of distinct arcellacean habitats were recognized in sediment-water interface samples collected in the lake using Q-mode Cluster Analysis. R-Mode analysis of this distributional data corroborates previous results indicating that arcellacean strains from within the same species are useful for discriminating environments. Cucurbitella tricuspis dominates most samples and had to be deleted from analysis to determine benthic faunal relationships. This species is seasonally planktic and thus readily transported; it should not be considered in intralake studies. Arcella vulgaris overwhelmingly dominates extremely hostile low pH environments (<5.5) near the old mine site in samples where Shannon Diversity Index values of <1.000 are recorded. The highly variable pH in James Lake permitted the determination of precise boundary conditions for distribution of this species. These results indicate that Difflugia protaeiformis "claviformis" is an ideal indicator of industrial contamination under higher pH conditions. The D, protaeiformis "amphoralis" and "acuminata" strains are more closely linked to uncontaminated muddy substrates characterized by high proportions of diatoms, a probable important food source. The presence of Lesquerasia spiralis seems to be partially linked to substrate type with greater numbers typically found in coarser sediments.

AB  - Leaks and breakdowns of pipelines can lead to catastrophic failures and cause economical losses worldwide. Currently, condition monitoring has become a challenging process because of various reasons such as fluctuating external conditions, natural hazards. Pipelines are installed in severe conditions and are subjected to degradation mainly due to corrosion and metal loss. This study attempted to classify different types of metal loss faults using historical inspection data of oil and gas fields. For this purpose, Support Vector Machines (SVM) were employed to classify and predict various types of metal loss faults which were affecting the life condition of a crude oil pipeline. The historical inspection data was acquired from a crude oil pipeline located in Sudan. Different types of SVM models were trained and quadratic SVM type was selected for the present study due to its high prediction accuracy. The performance evaluation of the proposed SVM model was done using the confusion matrix. The developed SVM model provides promising results with a prediction accuracy of 93.0%. As a result, the fault detection rate (FDR) for all faults is found to be 90.4%, while the misclassification rate (MR) is 9.6%. The prediction of metal loss fault type may help in condition assessment and maintenance schedule to take prior actions for the better life of pipeline which reduces the degradation rate of a pipeline.

TI  - Effect of sample area and sieve size on benthic macrofaunal community condition assessments in California enclosed bays and estuaries
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Benthic macrofauna are used extensively for environmental assessment, but the area sampled and sieve sizes used to capture animals often differ among studies. Here, we sampled 80 sites using 3 different sized sampling areas (0.1, 0.05, 0.0071?m2) and sieved those sediments through each of 2 screen sizes (0.5, 1?mm) to evaluate their effect on number of individuals, number of species, dominance, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) ordination, and benthic community condition indices that are used to assess sediment quality in California. Sample area had little effect on abundance but substantially affected numbers of species, which are not easily scaled to a standard area. Sieve size had a substantial effect on both measures, with the 1-mm screen capturing only 74% of the species and 68% of the individuals collected in the 0.5-mm screen. These differences, though, had little effect on the ability to differentiate samples along gradients in ordination space. Benthic indices generally ranked sample condition in the same order regardless of gear, although the absolute scoring of condition was affected by gear type. The largest differences in condition assessment were observed for the 0.0071-m2 gear. Benthic indices based on numbers of species were more affected than those based on relative abundance, primarily because we were unable to scale species number to a common area as we did for abundance.

AB  - Due to its fast deterioration, soybean (Glycine max L.) has an inherently poor seed vigor. Vigor loss occurring during storage is one of the main obstacles to soybean production in the tropics. To analyze the genetic background of seed vigor, soybean seeds of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross between Zhonghuang24 (ZH24, low vigor cultivar) and Huaxia3hao (HX3, vigorous cultivar) were utilized to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying the seed vigor under -20 degrees C conservation and accelerated aging conditions. According to the linkage analysis, multiple seed vigor-related QTLs were identified under both -20 degrees C and accelerated aging storage. Two major QTLs and eight QTL hotspots localized on chromosomes 3, 6, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, and 19 were detected that were associated with seed vigor across two storage conditions. The indicators of seed vigor did not correlate well between the two aging treatments, and no common QTLs were detected in RIL populations stored in two conditions. These results indicated that deterioration under accelerated aging conditions was not reflective of natural aging at -20 degrees C. Additionally, we suggest 15 promising candidate genes that could possibly determine the seed vigor in soybeans, which would help explore the mechanisms responsible for maintaining high seed vigor.

AB  - The assessment of thermal sensation is the first stage of many studies aimed at addressing thermal comfort and at establishing the related criteria used in indoor and outdoor environments. The study of thermal sensation requires suitable modelling of the human body, taking into account the factors that affect the physiological and psychological reactions that occur under different environmental conditions. These aspects are becoming more and more relevant in the present context in which thermal sensation and thermal comfort are represented as objectives or constraints in a wider range of problems referring to the living environment. This paper first considers the models of the human body used in steady-state and transient conditions. Starting from the conceptual formulations of the heat balance equations, this paper follows the evolution occurred during the years to refine the models. This evolution is also marked by the availability of increasingly higher computational capability that enabled the researchers developing transient models with a growing level of detail and accuracy, and by the validation of the models through experimental studies that exploit advanced technologies. The paper then provides an overview of the indicators used to characterise the local and overall thermal sensation, indicating the relations with local and overall thermal comfort.

AB  - Adsorption systems driven by engine waste heat are one of the possible alternatives to the conventional automobile air conditioning in terms of energy savings and environmental issues. Assessment of this issue are carried in a two-part study. In this first part I, theoretical and experimental investigations were performed on a two bed, silica gel adsorption chiller for automotive applications. A prototype adsorption system with a total weight of about 86 kg was developed and tested to driven by low-grade waste heat. The single adsorbent bed consisted of three plate-fin heat exchangers connected in parallel. An improved non-equilibrium lumped parameter model was developed to predict the transient performance of the system. The model is fully dynamic and takes into account the mass transfer resistance and pressure drop for each component of the system. The results showed that the model is able to accurately predict the dynamic performance of the system under different operating conditions and configuration modes with a short calculation time. The tested chiller was able to produce an average cooling capacity of about 2.1 kW with a COP of 0.35 at the rated operating conditions.

AB  - The objectives of this research were: (1) to quantify indicators of riparian condition; and (2) to assess these indicators for detecting change in riparian condition. Two multi-spectral QuickBird images were acquired in 2004 and 2005 for a section of the Daly River in north Australia. These data were collected coincidently with vegetation and geomorphic field data. Indicators of riparian condition, including percentage canopy cover, organic litter, canopy continuity, bank stability, flood damage, riparian zone width and vegetation overhang, were then mapped. Field measurements and vegetation indices were empirically related using regression analysis to develop algorithms for mapping organic litter and canopy cover (R 2=0.59-0.78). Using a standard nearest-neighbour algorithm, object-oriented supervised image classification provided thematic information (overall accuracies 81-90%) for mapping riparian zone width and vegetation overhang. Bank stability and flood damage were mapped empirically from a combination of canopy cover information and the image classification products (R 2=0.70-0.81). Multi-temporal image analysis of riparian condition indicators (RCIs) demonstrated the advantages of using continuous and discrete data values as opposed to categorical data. This research demonstrates how remote sensing can be used for mapping and monitoring riparian zones in remote tropical savannas and other riparian environments at scales from 1km to 100skm of stream length.

AB  - Understanding how wild animals adapt to perturbations and their consequences for life history traits and population dynamics is a current focus of attention in ecology and conservation biology. Here, we analysed variation in the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (N:L ratio), a proxy of stress level, in wild roe deer Capreolus capreolus from three populations experiencing markedly different environmental conditions. We first assessed whether among-individual differences in the N:L ratio were consistent over time and across environmental contexts. We then investigated how both individual characteristics (behaviour at capture, age, sex, body mass), and environmental context (habitat and year quality) were linked to this indicator of stress level. We found moderate, but consistent, repeatability of the N:L ratio in all three populations, indicating stable among-individual differences in the way individuals cope physiologically with varying environmental conditions. In addition, we found a weak, but consistent, association between the N:L ratio and behaviour at capture in two of the three populations. Finally, the N:L ratio also varied in relation to temporal changes in environmental conditions. In particular, individuals had, on average, higher levels of stress in poor-quality years in two of the three populations. We discuss our results in relation to the coping styles framework.

AB  - Aquatic pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) from a 72-m-long sediment core from Lake Chalco in central Mexico document macrophyte vegetation and paleolimnological conditions during the last glacial (similar to 85-10.8 k cal a BP). We compared macrophyte vegetation and NPP records with data for authigenic carbonate deposition estimated from concentrations of total inorganic carbon. We estimated saline and variable trophic conditions during the last glacial. An association indicative of higher salinity conditions characterized by NPP and diatom assemblages characteristic of alkaline and saline environments is documented. Changes in hydrophyte taxa and microalgae assemblages were related to trophic level fluctuations. Higher salinity environments were contemporary with arid intervals reconstructed based on abundances of inorganic carbonate. Two main periods were evident in this record: (i) 85-29 k cal a BP [Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5b-MIS 3] characterized by saline conditions with high abundance of Type-TXA, and variable high carbonate content, and (ii) 29-10.8 k cal a BP (MIS 2-MIS 1) when conditions changed to higher trophic levels and lower salinities, characterized by extremely low values of Type-TXA and carbonate content. Spring and summer insolation and latitudinal position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone over the last glacial were considered as possible controllers of the recorded paleoenvironmental changes.

AB  - The knowledge of the biodegradation rates is essential to studies of the biogeochemistry and ecology of aquatic systems. It helps us to quantify the production and uptake rates of chemical components and their recycling, and to understand the mechanisms and rates of organic matter accumulation in sediments. Experimental studies of biodegradation processes in six types of mineralized skeletons were performed in shallow-marine waters of Calvi Bay, Corsica and in estuarine waters of Roscoff, Brittany. Three types of mollusk shells, sea urchin skeletal plates, crab cuticle and fish vertebrae were exposed to oxic and anoxic conditions over periods of 15 days to 30 months. After recovery of the substrates, protein assays, bacterial counts and organic carbon analyses were performed.
   Quantitative protein assays and bacterial counts indicate that biodegradation of mineralized skeletal structures occurs at a slower rate in anoxic conditions than in oxic conditions. Bacterial analysis showed that in anoxic environment, less than 0.5% of the consumed organic matter is converted into bacterial biomass. The aerobic biodegradation rate was positively correlated with the organic content of the skeletons.
   Anoxic biodegradation of skeletons occurred at much slower rates in estuarine sediments than in shallow marine sediments. Preservation of skeletal structures in estuarine conditions appears to be correlated with the abundance of dissolved organic matter rather than with high sedimentation rates.

KW  - VOLUME
AB  - This study, based on two questionnaire surveys from two cities in Norway with different climate conditions, explores to which extent weather tolerance in terms of travel behaviour here defined as using a non-motorized vehicle despite poor weather conditions (precipitation and/or cold weather) - is related to socio-demographic factors, environmental attitudes, transport habits as well as the climate conditions (coastal/inland) of where people live. Three indicators are used to measure 'weather tolerance': a) Disagreement to the statement "I always drive when it rains"; b) Willingness to walk 2-3 kilometers in minus 10 degrees Celsius or more in steady snowfall (yes/no), and c) Willingness to walk 2-3 kilometer in +20 degrees Celsius or more in steady rainfall" (yes/no). The study finds that environmental attitudes and travel habits (as perceived by the respondents) are the factors most strongly related to weather tolerance, independent on how it is measured, when other factors are controlled for. The findings suggest that policy measures to change attitudes/ increase environmental awareness as well as promoting outdoor activity in general can be effective in terms of making people choose active transportation even in poor weather conditions. This might be important steps to reduce the likelihood of car use in the future, when extreme weathers are to become more likely.

AB  - The recent warming trends have led to rising concerns on how the changing climate has been altering and will continue to alter agroclimatic conditions in China. In this study, high resolution climate scenarios from regional climate models (RCMs) are used as input to the agro-ecological zones (AEZ) model for China and to compute a comprehensive set of agroclimatic indicators. Uncertainties in the projected impacts of climate change on agroclimatic conditions are also discussed with respect to (1) RCM outputs for different emission scenarios, and (2) differences in projections obtained from two different RCMs under the same emission scenario. The results indicate a significant extension of the crop growing period in tandem with the rising temperatures during the crop growing season, which may lead to increase in multi-cropping opportunities at high latitudes and thus advance the total potential output per unit of cropland. However, the results show that the Southwest China will experience a significant reduction in the value of humidity index, implying severe challenges for future agricultural development in the region. Spatially explicit patterns of changes in future agroclimatic conditions, as revealed in this study, can be beneficial for policy-makers, farming communities and other stakeholders to assess risk factors, design adaptation and mitigation measures, and improve management practices at the local to regional scales.

AB  - Groundwater samples were collected along a groundwater flow path in the Carrizo Sand aquifer. in south Texas, USA. Field measurements that included pH, specific conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation-reduction potentials (Eh in mV), alkalinity, iron speciation, and H2S concentrations were also conducted on site. The geochemistry (i.e., concentrations, shale-normalized patterns, and speciation) of dissolved rare element elements (REEs) in the Carrizo groundwaters are described as a function of distance along a flow path. Eh and other redox indicators (i.e., DO, Fe speciation, H2S, U, and Re) indicate that redox conditions change along the flow path in the Carrizo Sand aquifer. Within the region of the aquifer proximal to the recharge zone, groundwaters exhibit both highly oxidizing and localized mildly reducing conditions. However, from roughly 10 km to the discharge zone, groundwaters are reducing and exhibit a progressive decrease in redox conditions. Dissolved REE geochemical behavior exhibits regular variations along the groundwater flow path in the Carrizo Sand aquifer. The changes in REE concentrations, shale-normalized patterns, and speciation indicate that REEs are not conservative tracers. With flow down-gradient, redox conditions, pH and solution composite, and adsorption modify groundwater REE concentrations, fractionation patterns, and speciation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Frequency Domain Spectroscopy is a popular non-invasive method that is widely used for condition assessment of oil-paper insulation in real-life power transformers. Conventional Frequency Domain Spectroscopy is done using sinusoidal excitation over a wide frequency range. In this work, a different approach has been taken to investigate some more possibilities of Frequency Domain Spectroscopy using non-sinusoidal excitation for a better condition assessment of oil-paper insulation. For that, triangular waveshape was chosen as non-sinusoidal excitations whose slope can be changed to vary the harmonic content and amplitudes of constituent components. Samples with preset moisture contents that emulate the oil-paper insulation of real-life transformer have been prepared in the laboratory for the assessment of insulation condition. For a comparative study, both sinusoidal and triangular excitations having same peak as well as time period are applied to the prepared samples under controlled environmental condition and corresponding dielectric response currents are measured. From the applied voltages and corresponding dielectric response currents, dielectric dissipation factors are calculated and compared. It has been observed that use of non-sinusoidal excitation provides better results than sinusoidal excitation in the estimation of paper moisture content. It has also been observed that among the applied non-sinusoidal excitations, a particular waveform provides more accurate information about the paper moisture content.

AB  - This research work evaluated the biofilm succession on stone media and compared the biochemical changes of sludge in attached and suspended biological reactors operated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Stones incubated (30 +/- 2 degrees C) with activated sludge showed a constant increase in biofilm weight up to the fifth and seventh week time under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively, where after reduction (>80%) the most probable number index of pathogen indicators on ninth week was recorded. Reduction in parameters such as biological oxygen demand (BOD) (47.7%), chemical oxygen demand (COD, 41%), nitrites (60.2%), nitrates (105.5%) and phosphates (58.9%) and increase in dissolved oxygen (176.5%) of sludge were higher in aerobic attached growth reactors as compared with other settings. While, considerable reductions in these values were also observed (BOD, 53.8%; COD, 2.8%; nitrites, 28.6%; nitrates, 31.7%; phosphates, 41.4%) in the suspended growth system under anaerobic conditions. However, higher sulphate removal was observed in suspended (40.9% and 54.9%) as compared with biofilm reactors (28.2% and 29.3%). Six weeks biofilm on the stone media showed maximum physiological activities; thus, the operational conditions should be controlled to keep the biofilm structure similar to six-week-old biofilm, and can be used in fixed biofilm reactors for wastewater treatment.

AB  - Objective: Patients with schizophrenia consistently show performance deficits on measures of visual backward masking, but the nature of these deficits is not well understood. Performance deficits on backward masking tasks may indicate an underlying predisposition instead of the presence of illness, because deficits are present in unaffected first-degree relatives. Performance deficits in remitted patients would constitute converging support for this hypothesis. Method: Eleven patients with recent-onset schizophrenia who were in a period of no medication use during remission of psychosis were compared with a matched normal group on three visual masking conditions. These conditions included target identification tasks with a high-energy mask, a low-energy mask, and a blurred target. Results: Patients in psychotic remission showed significant deficits across all conditions. In addition, trend analyses revealed significant group differences in the shape of the masking functions: the comparison group showed an oscillating performance pattern across all masking conditions, whereas the patients did not exhibit this pattern on any condition. Conclusions: These data from patients in well-documented psychotic remission add converging support for the hypothesis that deficits on backward masking procedures are indicators of vulnerability to schizophrenia. Because visual masking procedures may reflect underlying neural oscillations of 30 to 70 Hz in the visual cortex, the pattern of results is consistent with the theory that visual masking deficits in schizophrenia stem from an underlying failure to establish cortical oscillations.

AB  - Objective Early-life conditions play an important role in human development, affecting health status and survival. Conditions in utero partly depend on the external environment and thus vary in relation to the season of birth. The aim of this study was to investigate if people born in different seasons of the year differ in values of biomarkers that reflect conditions during fetal development.
   Methods The study was conducted among Polish rural women recruited at the Mogielica Human Ecology Study Site. The participants were 234 women aged 45 to 92 (mean = 60.2; SD = 10.44). The indicators of early-life environment analyzed in the study were: Absolute Finger Ridge Count (AFRC), the difference between mean number of ridge counts in both thumbs and both little fingers (Md15), overall facial fluctuating asymmetry (OFA), central facial asymmetry (CFA), right and left hand 2D:4D.
   Results Values of biomarkers of fetal development did not vary among groups of women born in different seasons of the year.
   Conclusions Lack of differences in values of biomarkers according to birth season may indicate that: (a) season of birth is not a good indicator of early-life conditions; (b) tested biomarkers do not reliably reflect the prenatal environment; (c) season of birth does not fully overlap with the sensitive periods of biomarker development and thus fails to capture differences in developmental conditions.

AB  - Drought is one of the important factors limiting crop production in arid and semi-arid regions. Four drought resistance criteria, consisting of canopy temperature, stomatal resistance, transpiring area and rate of water loss by excised-leaves were examined in two experiments conducted in optimum and stress moisture conditions in 1995. A randomized complete block design with four replications and six genotypes was used for each experiment.
   Under optimum moisture conditions, there was a significant difference in canopy temperature at midday between drought resistant and drought sensitive genotypes. A significant linear relationship was also obtained between this criterion and yield reduction ratio as determined by Y-r = 1-(Y-s/Y-p) (Y-s and Y-p = yield under stress and non-stress conditions, respectively), at the ear emergence stage. The only significant difference between cultivars in respect to stomatal resistance in stress conditions was that of adaxial leaf surface in ear emergence stage. No significant linear relationship was obtained between transpiring area and yield reduction ratio. Cultivars differed in respect to rate of water loss (RWL) and initial water content (IWC) in ear emergence and grain filling in stress environment only. Ultimately, three criteria namely canopy temperature, stomatal resistance and RWL, in explicated conditions were recognized as beneficial drought resistance indicators.

AB  - S100B is a calcium-binding protein concentrated in glial cells, although it has also been detected in definite extra-neural cell types. Its biological role is still debated. When secreted, S100B is believed to have paracrine/autocrine trophic effects at physiological concentrations, but toxic effects at higher concentrations. Elevated S100B levels in biological fluids (CSF, blood, urine, saliva, amniotic fluid) are thus regarded as a biomarker of pathological conditions, including perinatal brain distress, acute brain injury, brain tumors, neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative disorders, psychiatric disorders. In the majority of these conditions, high S100B levels offer an indicator of cell damage when standard diagnostic procedures are still silent. The key question remains as to whether S100B is merely leaked from injured cells or is released in concomitance with both physiological and pathological conditions, participating at high concentrations in the events leading to cell injury. In this respect, S100B levels in biological fluids have been shown to increase in physiological conditions characterized by stressful physical and mental activity, suggesting that it may be physiologically regulated and raised during conditions of stress, with a putatively active role. This possibility makes this protein a candidate not only for a biomarker but also for a potential therapeutic target.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine whether birds of different breeds, with different preferences for environmental elements and kept in identical conditions, would exhibit different behaviour and stress levels. The research material consisted of 50 laying hens of the Green-legged partridge (Zk), Polbar (Pb), and Leghorn (Lg) breeds. The birds were provided with identical environmental conditions. They were kept on litter in separate boxes, with 25 individuals of one breed per box, in the same building. An open field test was used in determining the behaviour of the birds. Levels of cortisol in serum and corticosterone in feathers were evaluated, and haematological and biochemical analyses of blood were performed. Leghorns proved to be a highly excitable and active breed whose needs cannot be fully satisfied in the standard conditions of large farms. Based on a differential leukocyte count, their hyperactivity was associated with increased stress. The Green-legged partridge exhibited the lowest stress levels. Birds kept in the same environmental conditions were found to differ significantly in the level of stress, probably because of differences in their behavioural needs and the possibilities of satisfying them. To reduce stress levels and improve the welfare of hens, it is necessary to verify their preferences first. Stress indicators are elevated in highly excitable birds, and the conditions on large farms are not conducive to meeting their behavioural needs.

AB  - Novel physical and chemical conditions of many modern ecosystems increasingly diverge from the environments known to have existed at any time in the history of Earth. The loss of natural land to urbanization is one of the most prevalent drivers of novel environments in freshwaters. However, current understanding of aquatic community response to urbanization is based heavily upon aggregate indicators of community structure and linear or wedge-shaped community response models that challenge ecological community theory. We applied a new analytical method, threshold indicator taxa analysis (TITAN), to a stream biomonitoring data set from Maryland to explicitly evaluate linear community response models to urbanization that implicitly assume individual taxa decline or increase at incrementally different levels of urbanization. We used TITAN (1) to identify the location and magnitude of greatest change in the frequency and abundance of individual taxa and (2) to assess synchrony in the location of change points as evidence for stream community thresholds in response to percent impervious cover in catchments. We documented clear and synchronous threshold declines of 110 of 238 macroinvertebrate taxa in response to low levels of impervious cover. Approximately 80% of the declining taxa did so between; similar to 0.5% and 2% impervious cover, whereas the last 20% declined sporadically from; similar to 2% to 25% impervious cover. Synchrony of individual responses resulted in distinct community-level thresholds ranging from <= 0.68% (mountains), 1.28% (piedmont), and 0.96% (coastal plain) impervious cover. Upper limits (95% confidence intervals) of community thresholds were <2% cover in all regions. Within distinct physiographic classes, higher-gradient, smaller catchments required less impervious cover than lower gradient, larger catchments to elicit community thresholds. Relatively few taxa showed positive responses to increasing impervious cover, and those that did gradually increased in frequency and abundance, approximating a linear cumulative distribution. The sharp, synchronous declines of numerous taxa established a consistent threshold response at exceptionally low levels of catchment urbanization, and uncertainty regarding the estimation of impervious cover from satellite data was mitigated by several corroborating lines of evidence. We suggest that threshold responses of communities to urban and other novel environmental gradients may be more prevalent than currently recognized.

AB  - The risk assessment for the environmental impact of oil spills in Australia is often conducted in part using a combination of spill mapping and toxicological thresholds derived from laboratory studies. While this process is useful in planning operational responses, such as where to position equipment stockpiles and whether to disperse oil, and can be used to identify areas near the spill site where impacts are likely to occur, it cannot accurately predict the environmental consequences of an oil spill or the ecosystem recovery times. Evidence of this disconnect between model predictions and observed impacts is the lack of a profound effect of theDeepwater Horizonwellhead blowout on recruitment to fisheries in the northern Gulf of Mexico, contrary to the predictions made in the Natural Resources Damage Assessment and despite the occurrence of impacts of the spill on marine mammals, marshes, and deep water ecosystems. The incongruity between predictions made with the current approach using threshold monitoring and impacts measured in the field results from some of the assumptions included in the oil spill models. The incorrect assumptions include that toxicity is acute, results from dissolved phase exposure, and would be readily reversible. The toxicity tests from which threshold models are derived use members of the ecosystem that are easily studied in the lab but may not represent the ecosystem as a whole. The test species are typically highly abundant plankton or planktonic life stages, and they have life histories that account for rapid changes in environmental conditions. As a consequence, these organisms recover quickly from an oil spill. The interdependence of ecosystem components, including the reliance of organisms on their microbiomes, is often overlooked. Additional research to assess these data gaps conducted using economically and ecologically relevant species, especially in Australia and other understudied areas of the world, and the use of population dynamic models, will improve the accuracy of environmental risk assessment for oil spills.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-18.

AB  - The annual and regular flood pulse is the main hydrologic feature found in the large floodplains along Amazonian rivers triggering nutrient cycles, growth rhythms and life cycles of the biota as well as primary and secondary productivity. The construction of hydroelectric dams in the Amazon basin substantially alters the hydrologic regime resulting in severe social, ecological and environmental impacts. While the majority of studies evaluate these impacts in the area of the reservoir and the surroundings of the dam, we focus on disturbances in floodplain forests downstream of the hydroelectric power plant, in this case the Balbina dam, constructed in the 1980s damming the Uatuma River (Central Amazonia). The lowest topographies in the floodplain forests downstream of the dam are dominated by dead trees of Macrolobium acaciifolium (Benth.) Benth. (Fabaceae), a flood-tolerant species forming annual tree rings in consequence of the flood pulse. In this study we evidence alterations in the magnitude and frequency of the hydrologic conditions of the Uatuma River downstream of the hydroelectric power plant comparing the pre-dam (1973-1982) and post-dam (1991-2012) period analyzing a set of biologically relevant hydrologic indicators. To investigate the relationship between the hydrologic changes caused by the dam and the year of death of individuals of M. acaciifolium we use cross-dating techniques (dendrochronology) and radiocarbon dating (C-14) as two independent methods. Cross sections of 17 dead individuals were analyzed and individual tree-ring series cross-dated with a well-replicated living trees' chronology of the same species and region (1804-2012). The outermost tree ring was isolated to perform radiocarbon dating. The dendrochronological and C-14 proxies matched in 88% of the cases, while in the 12% mismatched maximum deviation at least one year. Trees died during periods of consecutive years of inundation, up to two decades after the implementation of the hydroelectric dam. Considering the planning of construction of several dozen dams in the Amazon region there is a critical need to include the downstream impacts in all discussions of hydroelectric implementation.

AB  - Biomonitoring is critical for characterizing and monitoring status, spatial patterns, and long-term trends in the ecological condition of freshwater ecosystems. The selection of cost-effective bioindicators is a critical step in establishing such monitoring programs. Key indicator considerations are a reliable response to anthropogenic disturbances, a high benefit-cost-ratio and sensitivity at multiple spatial extents. We evaluated non-linear responses of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) and fish to the effects of native vegetation loss within buffers of 100 m and 1000 m and assessed the sampling and processing costs involved for each assemblage. We sampled 37 neotropical stream sites in the Formoso River network, a karstic region of the Bodoquena Plateau, midwest Brazil, lying in the ecotone between the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biological hotspots. We used TITAN (threshold indicator taxa analysis) to identify six indicator taxa, four EPT genera and two fish species. The four EPT genera had low negative thresholds to native vegetation loss, whereas the two fish species had positive thresholds. Thresholds were lower for the 100 m buffers than the 1000 m buffers for EPT. The most sensitive taxon (Macronema, Trichoptera) had a threshold of 0% native vegetation loss in the 100 m buffers and nearly 40% in the 1000 m buffers. For taxa richness, we found no non-linear response to the effects of native vegetation loss for buffer extent nor assemblage. The total cost for EPT biomonitoring was US$ 3,616; whereas for fish, the total was US$ 1,901. Although fish were less expensive than EPT, they did not respond negatively to native vegetation loss and their positive threshold started at 48%, a level of vegetation loss that was highly disruptive of EPT. Therefore, we do not recommend using fish to monitor the effects of native vegetation loss on headwater streams in the Bodoquena Plateau. Although EPT monitoring costs 52% more than fish assemblage monitoring, it detected earlier impacts of the effects of native vegetation loss on stream biota, especially in the 100 m buffer. Therefore, EPT are more cost-effective early warning indicators for monitoring the effects of native vegetation loss in Bodoquena Plateau headwaters.

AB  - Reforestation with multiple tree species is a promoted strategy to mitigate global change and to improve forest resistance against natural hazards. Dryland reforestation often fails because seedlings suffer from harsh conditions in degraded areas. Positive species interactions can overcome recruitment drawbacks by ameliorating environmental stress, but there is a strong need to advance functional insights from well-designed experiments.
   We studied the vitality of 19,712 tree seedlings from 12 species in a Mediterranean common garden experiment (Sardinia). Vitality was assessed as an integrated index of foliage discoloration and defoliation measures, which are in dry areas potential indicators of early plant performance. The experimental design properly replicated all monocultures and a selection of mixed communities with different levels of species richness (SR) and functional diversity (FD). From the second year onwards, a water availability treatment (irrigated versus non-irrigated) was added to the design. In the second year, seedling vitality was strongly determined by species identity and irrigation, but ecological interactions between trees were not relevant.
   In the third year, however, broad-leaved species were significantly more vigorous in mixed assemblages. Importantly, FD was identified as a seven times stronger predictor compared to SR. This suggests that a certain degree of trait diversification is essential to benefit from facilitative interactions. The positive FD effects were principally mediated by the presence of pines (P. pinea, P. pinaster and P. halepensis) in the neighborhood of broad-leaved trees. The latter had, on average, a 23% greater likelihood to have the highest vitality score in mixture with pines. The creation of a favorable physical and biotic neighborhood by pines is likely caused by their fast juvenile growth and adequate crown light transmission. FD effects on seedling vitality were positive, but contrary to the stress-gradient hypothesis, they were of similar magnitude in both irrigated and non-irrigated blocks.
   We conclude that local neighborhood facilitation provides essential assistance for broad-leaved trees passing a critical seedling stage in semi-arid regions. This knowledge can contribute to increased success rates in forest rehabilitation in these regions.

AB  - The feeding diversity of subtidal samples of macroinvertebrates from Ria Formosa was estimated with Shannon-Wiener information index and complementary evenness. The results were compared with other commonly used methodologies under the European Water Framework Directive, such as diversity indices, AMBI and ITI.
   Assuming that in a healthy environment all feeding groups are present, and that no group clearly dominates, the feeding diversity is expected to be maximal and the evenness feeding diversity will be close to 1. In degraded environments some feeding groups might be absent or having low relative abundance, and generally with one or two groups dominating the community. in this way the evenness feeding diversity index would measure deviations from expected values due to a degradation of the environment. Although confirmation of this approach needs to be tested in other shallow waters, the results obtained show interesting features.
   To each of the 297 species belonging to the Ria Formosa data matrix a feeding group was assigned, among six groups: surface deposit feeders, subsurface deposit feeders, herbivores, suspension feeders and suspension/deposit feeders (species which have the two feeding modes depending on food availability). The carnivorous, parasites, omnivorous and scavengers were all grouped together, forming the sixth group. Most of the stations of Ria Formosa showed high feeding diversity, which could correspond to a good or high ecological status (ES) except at one location, that occasionally showed low feeding diversity. This poor condition was essentially due to low water renewal and extreme environmental variation of some parameters, such as salinity. At some locations an intermediate feeding diversity was observed mainly due to natural accumulation of organic matter. Other commonly used indices also point out to the same tendencies.
   We propose the evenness feeding diversity estimate approach as a practical and apparently robust method to estimate the ES of shallow waters, which can be used together with other common indicators. This approach has also the advantage of showing low sensibility to small samples and to low taxonomic identification effort. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study shows that metal-contaminated sediments cause adverse biological effects at all levels of biological organization, from cellular to ecosystem-level responses, even where the corresponding surface water meets water-quality-based criteria. We studied the effects of contamination from the abandoned Alder Mine, Alder Mill, and Red Shirt Mill located near the town of Twisp on the eastern slopes of the north Cascade Mountains in Okanogan County, Washington (U.S.A.) on fish and wildlife habitat in the Methow River. Ore deposits in the area were mined for gold, silver, copper and zinc until the early 1950s. An up-gradient and down-gradient approach was used to compare impacted sites to control sites. Although the dissolved metal concentrations in the Methow River were below the limits of detection, eight elements were identified as contaminants of potential environmental concern (COPECs) in sediments. Results revealed contamination impacts at ecosystem, community, population, individual, cellular, subcellular, and molecular levels. Metal contaminants in forest soils around the mines were present at concentrations toxic to soil bacteria suggesting that functional properties related to nutrient cycling and energy flow have been effected. Exposed trout in the Methow River showed reduced growth compared to controls. Histopathological evidence is consistent with copper-induced metabolic disease. Glycogen bodies were present in trout hepatocyte cytosol and nuclei and the presence of glycogen inclusions was pathognomic of Type IV glycogen storage disease (GSD IV). This condition suggests food is being converted into glycogen and stored in the liver and that the glycogen is not being converted back normally into glucose for distribution to other tissues in the body, which is a likely cause for the poor growth and development observed in fish and macroinvertebrates. Glycogen storage disease is caused by either a deficiency or inactivation of the glycogen branching enzyme, which results in the synthesis of an abnormal glycogen molecule that is insoluble due to a decreased number of branch points and increased chain length. Further examination of hepatocytes by transmission electron microscopy also revealed the accumulation of electron-dense metal-granules in the mitochondrial matrix. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the natural dynamics of estuaries and their response to changes in the human-related or climatic drivers is fundamental to guarantee their environmental quality. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the water quality dynamics in an urban estuary, the Tagus estuary (Portugal), across different temporal scales. This estuary supports diverse uses and activities and its ecological value is well recognized. Three field campaigns were performed covering distinct seasons (Spring, Summer and Autumn - 2018). Physical, chemical and biological data were measured along the estuary. The acquired data was then integrated into a set of indicators and compared with historical data, to assess the long-term evolution of the water quality in the estuary. Results showed marked spatial gradients, typically with larger concentrations of chlorophyll a, nitrate and silicate upstream. Silicate and nitrate presented a conservative behavior. Ammonium and phosphate were not conservative, which suggests an anthropogenic pressure along the estuary. Seasonally, the highest nutrients and suspended solids concentrations were found in Autumn, after a period of rainfall, pointing out to the relevance of land runoff for material supply into the estuary. These conditions were favorable for phytoplankton development upstream, once chlorophyll a was maximum during this campaign (24 mu g/L in the upper estuary). Regarding the nutrients classification, results suggest that the upper estuary is at risk with a "Medium" status. The middle and downstream areas presented a "High" status, with the exception of the middle-right margin that is also at risk ("Medium" status). The assessment of the historical data suggests that high loads of nutrients have been reaching the Tagus estuary over time, with a decreasing trend in recent years. The trophic index (TRIX) suggests a "Moderate" trophic status in the middle and upstream areas of the estuary. As for nutrients, a "Poor" classification was obtained in the middle-right margin of the estuary, mainly due to ammonium concentrations, confirming an intensification of anthropogenic pressure at this site. Similarly to the nutrients status, TRIX suggests some improvement of the water quality in the Tagus estuary in recent years compared to the 1980s. These results provide further insight regarding the water quality dynamics in the Tagus estuary and are useful to support management.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate vegetation changes on small Mediterranean islands under the impact of the drastic expansion of the gull colony, at local scale over eleven years using a set of permanent plots. First, we focused on functional aspects of vegetation in addition to its specific composition with regard to the plant functional types (Raunkiaer growth forms and Grime life strategies) as indicators of vegetation changes. Second, we used STATICO analysis to investigate patterns of change in the relationship between environmental variables and floristic composition. Third, we quantified the changes in the abundance of plant functional types by applying a simple comparison test between the two observation dates. Fourth, we investigated the relationship between vegetation changes (species turnover, plant functional type dynamics, and species richness) and gull density by performing simple linear regression. Our results show that gull density did not evolve equally for all plots. For areas where gull density increased, we recorded ruderalization of the vegetation. Surprisingly, in areas where there was a decrease in gull density, no clear pattern of vegetation change was apparent. We observed a statistically significant increase in the number of plant species due only to the increase in ruderal and stress ruderal and geophyte species. Gull colonies were responsible for high species turnover between 1997 and 2008. The higher the density of gulls, the lower the species number in 1997 and 2008. For high gull nest densities, we observed a high proportion of ruderal plant species and a low proportion of stress tolerant species. Gulls induced an increase of stress-ruderal species. We show that nest density recorded in 1997 is mainly responsible for the changes in vegetation composition, species turnover and proportions of plant functional types. We noted that a decrease in gull nest density does not necessarily induce a return to previous vegetation composition patterns. This may be seen as evidence of the inertial nature of the changes in island vegetation in the face of strong changes in environmental conditions such as the recent drastic expansion of gull colonies.

AB  - Simple Summary: Soil microorganisms are the core of maintaining soil ecological functions. Recognition of microbial community diversity in saline soil contributes to nutrient management and crop production. Meanwhile, microbial activity is easily affected by changes in soil properties. This study addressed how the composition and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities changed under different saline conditions to identify the sensitivity of bacteria or fungi to salinity. The primary objective was to evaluate the relationship between soil's microbial community diversity and soil's physicochemical factors, and to explore the vital microbial predictors in salinized soil. The results showed that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are pivotal in salinized soil, and this finding can provide guidance for the demand for plant rhizosphere growth-promoting bacteria as a bioindicator in saline soil. To investigate the diversity and structure of soil bacterial and fungal communities in saline soils, soil samples with three increasing salinity levels (S1, S2 and S3) were collected from a maize field in Yanqi, Xinjiang Province, China. The results showed that the K+, Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ values in the bulk soil were higher than those in the rhizosphere soil, with significant differences in S2 and S3 (p < 0.05). The enzyme activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), invertase, urease and catalase (CAT) were lower in the bulk soil than those in the rhizosphere. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) demonstrated that the soil microbial community structure exhibited significant differences between different salinized soils (p < 0.001). Data implied that the fungi were more susceptible to salinity stress than the bacteria based on the Shannon and Chao1 indexes. Mantel tests identified Ca2+, available phosphorus (AP), saturated electrical conductivity (ECe) and available kalium (AK) as the dominant environmental factors correlated with bacterial community structures (p < 0.001); and AP, urease, Ca2+ and ECe as the dominant factors correlated with fungal community structures (p < 0.001). The relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes showed positive correlations with the salinity gradient. Our findings regarding the bacteria having positive correlations with the level of salinization might be a useful biological indicator of microorganisms in saline soils.

AB  - Cage culture of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in large reservoirs is an emergent aquaculture practice in Brazil. Due to the availability of large amounts of suitable quality waters in hydroelectric dams, there is a large but still undetermined potential for cage aquaculture in the upper Parana River basin. Sustainable aquaculture production should consider assessment of ecological carrying capacity for rational use of natural resources such as water bodies. The present survey estimates the ecological carrying capacity for tilapia cage culture in several sites on a large reservoir of "Ilha Solteira" upper Parana River basin, Southeastern Brazil. Ecological carrying capacity was estimated based on the Dillon and Rigler (1975) mass balance model, considering limnological and farming field data to evaluate area-specific Phosphorus loads that can be assimilated in these environments. Using average farming data of feed composition, tilapia (O. niloticus) whole body composition and Feed Conversion Rate (FCR), the estimated emission of Phosphorus per ton of fish produced was 14.8 kg P ton(-1). Modeling provided evidence for the importance of feed Phosphorus content and availability for determination of total allowable production, as well as the relevance of proper inputs of limnological field data. When field data was collected, only two sites (Ponte Pensa and Dourados) had aquaculture activities; as aquaculture is expanding, limnological information provided in the present study is a registry of conditions found before the massive aquaculture development. Production estimated to the reservoir as a whole (156,000 ton) is more than fivefold the pooled production (30,000 ton) of the fifteen selected sites; if production estimated to the reservoir as a whole cluster around a few best sites, than effects on water quality is expected to be even more drastic. The limit of 1% occupancy by aquaculture posed by Brazilian government is not an effective safeguard against excessive eutrophication, and detailed limnological studies are demanded for each inlet assigned for cage aquaculture. The impact of cage fish farming on the aquatic environment by the release of nutrients that affect water quality can not only bring about conflict with multiple users, but also primarily exert a negative feedback effect in the cage operations themselves.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the concentration of Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, and Fe in sediments of the Ichkeul Lake and rivers ecosystem in northern Tunisia; their comparison with international sediment quality criteria was also proposed to assess the extent of metal pollution and their origin using various pollution indicators. For this purpose, sediment samples were collected in thirteen locations and characterized for metal content (Pb, Cr, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Fe) using the total digestion technique. Pollution level was assessed via the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (C), potential ecological risk (PER), and pollution load index (PLI). Our results showed that all metals were lower than the threshold effect levels (TEL), the effect range low (ERL), the probable effect level (PEL), the effect range median (ERM), and the probable effect concentration (PEC) value, except Pb and Cr (higher than TEL), the threshold effect concentration (TEC), and the toxicity reference value (TRV). The geoaccumulation index (Igeo) indicated no pollution for Cr, Cu, Zn, and Fe, but moderate pollution for Pb. The enrichment factor showed no enrichment for most of the studied metals. This was further confirmed by the contamination factor that indicated low contamination levels, with the exception of Pb. The pollution load index (PLI) showed moderate pollution status in all the studied stations in the Ichkeul Lake and rivers ecosystem. The statistical results presented similar trends of Zn and Pb probably due to their similar pollution sources. It was found that the Ichkeul Lake and river ecosystems are characterized by moderate pollution status in all the studied sites except for that of a feeder river drained from an old lead mine which had relatively high metallic concentrations of Pb and Cd. It can be argued that effective remediation strategies and environmental management plans are required to control and reduce the input of environmentally hazardous toxic pollutants (Cd and Pb). This study may serve as a useful reference tool pertinent to approaches to the remediation of the old lead mine area surrounding the Ichkeul Lake as well as other areas under similar ecological conditions..

AB  - We investigated the seasonal changes in macroinvertebrate reference communities in four Mediterranean stream types (temporary. evaporite calcareous at medium altitude, siliceous headwaters in high altitude, and calcareous headwaters at medium and high altitudes) and the interannual changes in the two headwaters stream types in Spain. Eighty-eight seasonal reference sites distributed into 23 basins were sampled on three occasions (spring summer and autumn of 2003), and 18 interannual reference sites distributed in 6 basins were sampled in the autumn of 2003, 2004 and 2005 to examine this temporal variability. Interannual reference sites were a Subset of seasonal reference sites. The analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) performed on Bray-Curtis similarity distances, using presence-absence data, showed no seasonal or interannual changes in the macroinvertebrate communities. The influence of seasonal and interannual variability was also tested in all the stream types using 18 macroinvertebrate metrics classified as richness, index, multimetric index, tolerance/intolerance and diversity. ANOVAs showed no seasonal differences in any of the studied metrics for temporary and evaporite calcareous at medium altitude and most of the metrics in the two headwaters stream types. This suggests the suitability of using a single season approach for the biomonitoring purposes of these metrics. Conversely, the seasonal differences detected in the metrics related with EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) and OCH (Odonata, Coleoptera and Heteroptera) taxa in calcareous headwaters indicate possible differences in the relative presence of mcrohabitats (riffles and pools) as it result of flow variation. No interannual changes were detected in any of the metrics except EPT/OCH in siliceous headwaters. However, the large variability in the annual rainfall in this stud area suggests that this three-year study period may be too short to assess the effect of climatic variations oil the ecological status assessment. In general, the lower temporal variability (measured as seasonal and interannual coefficients of variation) of the taxon richness metric (S) and the two studied indices (IBMWP and IASPT), compared with the other metrics, make them a priori robust indicators to assess ecological status in Mediterranean streams.

AB  - Many areas on the earth are facing the threat of ecological degradation, and unreasonable economic development has further exacerbated environmental problems. Constructing ecological security patterns based on an ecological network is such an integrated approach to protecting regional ecological sustainability. This paper selected Denko County of Bayannaoer City, Inner Mongolia, which is located in the desert oasis area, as the study area. Ecological sources were identified through ecosystem importance assessment, and interaction force theory was used to model ecosystem processes in heterogeneous landscapes via comparing the minimum cumulative ecological resistance and the maximum ecological gravity between ecological sources, and thus to identify ecological corridors and to constructing forest-grass ecological network (FG eco-network) of the study area. This paper also set 11 development scenarios to study the impact of different development strategies on the FG ecological network. Moreover, the complex network theory was used to analyze the topology and statistical characteristics of the FG eco-network in 11 development scenarios. The results show that the ecological network in the study area has been gradually destroyed with the increase of the proportion of economic development in the development scenario; the connection between some ecological patches has changed and the connectivity and coreness, PageRank, etc. have gradually decreased. The study found that the network density increases slightly in the (0.9, 0.1) mode, while it gradually decreases in other scenarios with the increase of the proportion of economic development. Moreover, in the (0.9, 0.1) mode, although the destruction occurred at the edge of the desert, the FG eco-network within the sample circle expanded. This represents that economic development does not necessarily lead to the deterioration of the ecological environment in this area. Under the existing natural conditions, the study area still has room for economic development, but space is limited. Based on the interaction force theory, this study provides a new approach to identifying the ecological network. Also, the development scenarios set up in this study can provide a reference for sustainable development.

AB  - Increase in anthropogenic pressures on freshwater ecosystems, globally and locally in South Africa, has made it difficult to meet environmental flow requirements and maintain these systems. The Letaba-Olifants catchment is one such example, where the upstream water demands place pressure on the river downstream as it flows through the Kruger National Park. We used the activity rates of Hydrocynus vittatus as a line of evidence to assess (1) the effects of telemeter tagging on their activity rates in three potential post-tagging recovery periods and (2) their vulnerability to predation and the causality related to the environmental stressors placed on the river catchment in the Olifants River Gorge, Kruger National Park, South Africa. We determined H. vittatus activity rates as locomotive movement using radio telemetry methods linked remotely to an online data management system. We telemeter tagged nine individuals from 08 May to 28 June 2018. However, only seven fish were successfully tracked for the duration of our study, and two individuals moved out of range of the remote network shortly after release and could not be located. The tagged H. vittatus individuals were found to have reduced activity at least within the first 7 days after tagging compared with the time after that. The results showed that three individuals were preyed on by predators after the tagging procedure recovery period. This coincided with abnormal low flow conditions, where the Letaba River ran dry. African fish eagles Haliaeestus vocifer were the only confirmed predator, whilst predation by other species was also evident.
   Conservation implications:
   Monitoring of H. vittatus using telemetry is a viable tool to use when assessing environmental stressors in remote locations. The abnormally low water levels in the Olifants and Letaba Rivers (cessation of flow in the Letaba River) during our study may have compromised the predator avoidance strategies of tagged H. vittatus and may further be affecting the viability of the H. vittatus populations in Kruger National Park. The synergistic effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors impact negatively H. vittatus populations and potentially other aquatic biotas.

AB  - Previous studies have shown the potential of remote-sensing tools to monitor coastal wetlands at a landscape scale. Several biophysical parameters are typically used to evaluate ecosystem conditions such as the chlorophyll content, an indicator of photosynthesis activity. In natural environments characterized by a large fraction of standing litter - such as the marshes on the Atlantic coast of the Buenos Aires Province - spectral indices designed for green vegetation change their typical response and, hence, their biophysical interpretation requires more attention. In this work, a theoretical study was performed to determine if it is possible to detect and eventually quantify the abrupt reductions of leaf chlorophyll content (Ca+b) in Sporobolus densiflorus the dominant vegetation in these marshes - using hyperspectral data. To achieve this, in situ radiometric measurements in the VIS-NIR-SWIR (Visible, Near-Infrared and Short Wave Infrared) spectral region and biological data, acquired over S. densiflorus specimens in several campaigns, were used to set up an inversion procedure based on the radiative transfer model PROSAIL. By applying this model, simulated reflectances that fit the measured reflectances were obtained and by means of this inversion a theoretical canopy reflectance data set for S. densiflorus was modelled using the PROSAIL parameters. The performance of several vegetation indices typically used to estimate chlorophyll content was studied using the simulated and modelled reflectances, among which MTCI (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index), Macc and MCARI/OSAVI (Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Index) indices showed significant correlation with Ca+b. By means of addressing the performance of these indices together with BLRs (Baseline Residuals), a two-step VILUT (Vegetation Index - Look-Up Table) inversion model was proposed to retrieve Ca+b, which first corrects the effect of variable leaf area index (LAI) using a BLR index (using bands at 800, 1100 and 1300 nm), and then retrieves Ca+b by either using MCARI/OSAVI or another BLR (using bands at 657, 672 and 700 nm). Even though both procedures perform similarly well in the estimation of Ca+b (coefficient of determination R-2 about 0.6) the two steps BLR-based approach is preferred, given that these indices are a priori less sensitive to undesired atmospheric effects.

AB  - To evaluate a specific form of resource management, for example, the maintenance of valuable cultural landscapes, the contributions of many different viewpoints must be considered. In this paper, a model for assessing and integrating the different aspects contributing to landscape evaluation is proposed. Some results of its use in landscape assessment in the Madrid region (central Spain) are discussed.
   The model takes into account five assessment dimensions which are considered to be independent-the ecological, productive, economic, social and cultural evaluative systems and it recognises and assumes conflicts and trade-offs between these components. The inclusion of the production system as an independent assessment dimension is original and is justified because it is the link that connects the ecological and economic systems. Since this dimension acts most directly on the ecosystem, the production system includes the attribute of ecological or strong (in the sense of [For the Common Good, Beacon Press, Boston, 19941) sustainability.
   The evaluation method places special emphasis on defining a conceptual framework, and from this defines scenarios in comparison with which particular development models (landscape planning, resources management) can be evaluated. Seven scenarios, coming from a hypothetical, traditional sustainable scenario of resources management, are defined. One of these, the sound sustainable scenario, is defended as the only one viable in the long term, particularly in developing countries.
   This method was employed to evaluate the agricultural and natural landscape of the Madrid region municipalities. The multivariate approach adopted was based on the selection of indicator sets for each evaluative dimension. The structure of relationships among indicators was then analysed separately for each dimension and values assigned to the municipalities according to their position on the main axes of the multivariate analyses. Each municipality was assigned to one of the seven development scenarios by means of discriminant analysis. The approach's greatest assets are its flexibility in the selection of the indicators and the efficacy in its monitoring and comparison of the different analysed cases once a rigorous conceptual framework was established.
   The paper discusses the conditions for the sustainability of the human activities and provides a method for evaluating and comparing scenarios of resources management. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.
