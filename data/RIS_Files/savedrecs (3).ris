AB  - Soil is the habitat for a number of living organisms that perform essential functions within the ecosystem; their functions and interactions are modified according to different ways of land occupation. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of edaphic fauna in different soil occupation systems. The study was carried out in different soil occupation systems: millet, maize, soybean, eucalyptus, preserved cerrado, disturbed cerrado, and pasture, with 130 pitfall traps installed per treatment. Soil fauna organisms were identified at the level of large groups (orders and family), and then examined under the following biological diversity indices: Shannon index, Pielou index, average and total richness, and abundance. The highest abundance was found under millet growing conditions (9,974 individuals), and the lowest abundance values were found in soybean soil (222 individuals) and maize (824 individuals). Uniform distribution of groups in the area with soybean crops, due to the homogeneous management of the area, provided the highest biological index (H'=2.69). Principal component analysis (PCA) explained 50.9% of the data along the main axis and 34.6% of the data along the secondary axis. The different systems of soil occupation showed different abundance and diversity, demonstrating how soil occupation interferes with the dynamics of the invertebrate soil fauna.

AB  - The density, population, length, yield and sex proportion of the Anadara tuberculosa Sowerby (1833) were studied in the mangroves of Golfito and Playa Blanca, Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica from 2008-2010. A. tuberculosa was more abundant in Golfito mangroves (2.77 units m(2)), than Playa Blanca mangrove (0.14 units m(2)). The average lengths were 42.1mm for Golfito (under the Costa Rican legal minimal length for exploitation: 47mm) and 48.35mm for Playa Blanca mangrove. Maximum densities in Golfito were measured in the outlet of Purruja River (mangrove of Purruja) and mangroves Congo, Ceibo y la Trocha. The average total weights were 24.48g for Golfito and 36.35g for Playa Blanca. The condition index (a meat yield measurement) was higher in Golfito (23.45%) than in Playa Blanca (17.01%). The male ratio was 1: 1. These results suggest that A. tuberculosa population is declining in these mangroves. Therefore, it's necessary to implement repopulation projects of the mollusc in the mangroves of Golfo Dulce, in conjunction with government authorities, NGOs and civil society. Mangrove workers and consumers are needed in that potential projects, to make the mollusc a sustainable natural resource exploited by different community members.

AB  - The limitation to sustain the Patagonian red octopus Enteroctopus megalocyathus aquaculture is the lack of an efficient diet to obtain high survival during the paralarvae stage. This work has studied the performance of paralarvae under different combinations of feeds and temperatures using a factorial design. The diets were based on various Artemia enrichments: (a) Nannochloropsis sp, (b) Ori-gold (Skretting) and (c) LC60 (Phosphotek). The temperatures chosen were in accordance with those found in their environment: 10 degrees C (winter), 12 degrees C (spring-autumn) and 14 degrees C (summer), by triplicate. The factorial combinations were tested in two experiments with paralarvae of different age: Exp 1, from newly hatched to 14 days after hatching (DAH), and Exp 2, from that point to 42 DAH. It was concluded that temperature was the primary variable affecting mortality, feed intake, relative weight condition index, morphometric variables and trypsin activity. The enriched Artemia diets had the main impact on the leucine-aminopeptidase activity, and on the fatty acid contents, mainly 20:5n-3 (EPA) and 22:6n-3 (DHA). Paralarval growth was increased by temperature with only one diet and at a certain age. Nutritional requirements varied between early and late paralarvae, and the possibility of changing the diets according to the development age is discussed.

AB  - Riparian strips are used worldwide to protect riverbanks and water quality in agricultural zones because of their numerous environmental benefits. A metric called Riparian Strip Quality Index, which is based on the percentage area of riparian vegetation, is used to evaluate their ecological condition. This index measures the potential capacity of riparian strips to filter sediments, retain pollutants, and provide shelter for terrestrial and aquatic species. This research aims to improve this metric by integrating the ability of riparian strips to intercept surface runoff, which is the major cause of water pollution and erosion in productive areas. In Canada and the Nordic countries, rapid surface drainage from snow melt and spring rains is often practiced to avoid production delays and losses. This reduces the efficiency of riparian buffer strips by promoting soil erosion due to concentrated runoff. A new proposed metric called Riparian Strip Efficiency Index (RSEI), incorporates not only land cover information, but topographic and hydrologic variables to model the intensity and spatial distribution of runoff streamflow, and the capability of riparian strips to retain sediments and pollutants. The research is performed over the La Chevrotiere River Basin in the Portneuf municipality in Quebec (Canada) using hydrological modeling, land cover and topographic data extracted from very high spatial resolution World View-2 imagery as a unique source of inputs. The results show that RSEI provides a better characterization of the ecosystem services of riparian strips in terms of pollutants filtration and prevention of soil erosion in agricultural areas. RSEI will allow a better management of agricultural practices such as drainage and land leveling. Further, it will provide to land managers information to monitor environmental changes and to prioritize intervention areas, which ultimately targets to ensure optimal allocation of private or public funds toward the most inefficient and threatened riparian strips.

AB  - The environmental health of 31 provincial administrative regions in China from 2003 to 2010 was evaluated using time series principal component analysis based on the comprehensive indicator system for environmental health. The environmental health index increased continuously at a fluctuating rate from 2003 to 2009 but decreased slightly in 2010. However, such an increase resulted in the rapid and continuous development of industrial air pollution, natural protection, industrial solid waste and economic condition, as well as the slow development of health condition and the continuous deterioration of forest resource rather than the harmonious development of various environmental aspects. The environmental health indices of eastern and western China showed variation trends similar to that of the whole country: increasing continuously from 2003 to 2009 but decreasing slightly in 2010. The environmental health indices of northeast and central China increased continuously from 2003 to 2010. During these 8 years, central and western China achieved more rapid environmental health development than eastern China, thereby significantly narrowing the gap among central, western, and eastern China.

AB  - In the Chausey archipelago, growth of the burrowing bivalve Venus verrucosa (Mollusca: Veneridae) has been shown to be highly variable between closely located sites (<1 km). To explain this small-scale spatial variability, we tested the trophic hypothesis using both fatty acid markers, and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15). Environmental parameters, including substrate, were also analysed to discriminate their effects on potential trophic differences. Results of isotopic fractionation and lipid profiles of water column and digestive gland samples both showed a large contribution of phytoplankton to the diet of V verrucosa. More surprisingly, the same results suggest that Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae macroalgae could contribute to the nutrition of V verrucosa as dissolved exudates. Whereas site differences were not observed between the food sources of V verrucosa, we showed that growth performance index was correlated to wave height. Thus, we hypothesized that the high local growth variability could be controlled by the hydrosedimentary dynamics. In addition, although no significant growth differences were found between intertidal and subtidal populations, better condition index and more total lipids were found in the digestive gland of intertidal V verrucosa, suggesting potential compensatory growth mechanisms.

AB  - Sustainable nature management and ecosystem conservation depends critically on scientifically sound and stakeholder-relevant analytical frameworks for monitoring and assessing ecological condition. Several general frameworks are currently being developed internationally, including the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV), and the UN's SEEA EEA Ecosystem Condition Typology (ECT). However, there has so far been few attempts to develop empirical implementations of these general frameworks, or to assess their applicability for environmental decision-making at national or regional scales. In this paper, we aim to fill this implementation gap by demonstrating a practical application of an empirically-based ecological condition assessment framework, the Index-Based Ecological Condition Assessment (IBECA). IBECA defines seven major classes of indicators of ecological condition, representing distinct ecosystem characteristics, and empirically synthesizes indicators for each of these characteristics from various monitoring data. We exemplify and explore the utility and robustness of IBECA using a case study from forest and alpine ecosystems in central Norway, and we investigate how IBECA aligns with the two international frameworks EBV and ECT. In particular, we analyze how the different approaches to categorize indicators into classes affect the assessment of ecological condition, both conceptually and using the case study indicators. We used eleven indicators for each of the two ecosystems and assessed the ecological condition according to IBECA for i) each individual indicator, ii) the seven ecosystem characteristics (indicator classes), and iii) a synthetic ecological condition value for the whole ecosystem. IBECA challenges key concepts of the international frameworks and illustrates practical challenges for national or regional level implementation. We identify three main strengths with the IBECA approach: i) it provides a transparent and management-relevant quantitative approach allowing assessment of spatio-temporal variation in ecological condition across indicators, characteristics and ecosystems, ii) the high degree of flexibility and transparency facilitates updating the ecological condition assessments, also back in time, as improved data and knowledge of indicators emerge, and iii) the quantitative and flexible procedure makes it a cost-effective approach suitable for fast management implementations. More generally, we stress the need for carefully choosing appropriate classification and aggregation approaches in ecological condition assessments, and for transparent and data-driven analytical approaches that can be adjusted as knowledge improves.

AB  - Over 50 hydropower dams in California will undergo relicensing by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in the next 15 years. An interpretive framework for biological data collected by relicensing studies is lacking. This study developed a multi-metric index of biotic integrity (IBI) to assess biological condition below hydropower diversion dams on west slope Sierra Nevada streams based on benthic macroinvertebrates (BMIs). Ten streams were sampled above the upstream influence of peak reservoir storage and at five downstream sites sequentially spaced 500 m apart. Reference conditions were defined by screening upstream study sites and 77 other regional streams using quantitative GIS land use analysis, reach-scale physical habitat (PHAB) data and water chemistry data. Eighty-two metrics were evaluated for inclusion in the IBI based on three criteria: (1) good discrimination between reference and first downstream sites with some indication of recovery over the distance sampled; (2) sufficient range for scoring; (3) minimal correlation with other discriminating metrics. The IBI showed good discrimination between reference and downstream sites with partial recovery as distance downstream increased, and was validated with an independent dataset. Individual metrics, IBI scores and multivariate ordination axes were poorly correlated with PHAB variables across sites. When only reference and first downstream sites were evaluated, decreased IBI scores were related to lower habitat variability and substrate coarsening below dams. Lower IBI scores below dams were most strongly associated with altered hydrologic regime, especially non-fluctuating flows as defined by the flow constancy/predictability index. Flow restoration experiments would be valuable in developing management actions that achieve a sustainable balance between conflicting human and ecological needs for freshwater.

AB  - U.S, EPA Region IX is supporting bioassessment programs in Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada using biocriteria program and Regional Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (R-EMAP) resources. These programs are designed to improve the state, tribal and regional ability to determine the status of water quality. Biocriteria program funds were used to coordinate with Arizona, California and Hawaii which resulted in these states establishing reference conditions and in developing biological indices. U.S, EPA Region IX has initiated R-EMAP projects in California and Nevada. These U.S. EPA Region IX sponsored programs have provided an opportunity to interact with the States and provide them with technical and management support. In Arizona, several projects are being conducted to develop the State's bioassessment program. These include the development of a rotational random monitoring program; a regional reference approach for macroinvertebrate bioassessments; ecoregion approach to testing and adoption of an alternate regional classification system; and development of warm-water and cold-water indices of biological integrity. The indices are projected to be used in the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) 2000 water quality assessment report. In California, an Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) has been developed for the Russian River Watershed using resources from U.S. EPA's Non-point Source (NPS) Program grants. A regional IBI is under development for certain water bodies. in the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board. Resources from the U.S. EPA Biocriteria program are being used to support the California Aquatic Bioassessment Workgroup (CABW) in conjunction with the California Department of Fish & Game (CDFG), and to support the Hawaii Department of Health (DoH) Bioassessment Program to refine biological metrics. In Nevada, R-EMAP resources are being used to create a baseline of aquatic information for the Humboldt River watershed. U.S. EPA Region IX is presently working with the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) to establish a Nevada Aquatic Bioassessment Workgroup. Future R-EMAP studies will occur in the Calleguas Creek watershed in Southern California, and in the Muddy and Virgin River watersheds in southern Nevada, and the Walker River watershed in eastern California and west-central Nevada.

AB  - In order to verify the trophic position and condition of Engraulis anchoita larvae, this study applied stable isotope technique and condition indexes. The area comprises the continental shelf off the Cabo Frio (from 40 to 120 m depth), where a seasonal upwelling of the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) occurs in summer. Larvae were sampled in winter 2001 and in summer 2002. Stable isotopes of natural carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) were measured in larval pools separated by length whereas RNA/DNA, protein and histology were performed for individual larvae. The values of d13C for larvae of different developmental phases were similar in winter and summer. Big larvae had a N-15-enrichment of almost 3%, in relation to the small ones, showing an increase of trophic level in summer. Despite the variation of RNA/DNA, protein values and histological classification, the tendency of better condition larvae in summer was clear. This variation is related to scenarios of SACW upwelling over the shelf. Those findings agree with the suspended particulate matter and zooplankton isotope values in winter that suggested a more oligotrophic situation than in summer. These results indicate that nutrient enhancement is coupled to better Argentine anchovy larval condition.

AB  - Population dynamics, reproductive biology and the ichthyoplankton of Cetengraulls edentulus Cuvier (Pisces, Clupeiformes, Engraulidae) in the Saco dos Limoes cove, Florlanopolls, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Data used in this study are from a monitoring program conducted in the Saco dos Limoes cove, Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. In this program, fish fauna were collected in 17 surveys from July 1999 to April 2001. For this study, 3820 individuals of Centengraulls edentulus Cuvier, 1828 were examined regarding population and reproductive parameters, such as, length at sexual maturity (118 mm for the combined sexes, 112 mm for males and 118 mm for females), frequency distributions for total length, length-weight relationship (Wt = 0,0000003 x Lt(3,6708)), sex ratio, seasonal variation of the gonad maturation stages, gonadosomatic index, condition factor, somatic condition factor, reproductive cycle and timing of spawning. Ichthyoplankton samples were also examined in order to verify the sharing of this species in such samples. It was determined correlations between biological and environmental parameters, such as, surface and bottom temperature, and salinity in the water column. The results revealed that Centengraulls edentulus is strategically fitted to the environmental and biological conditions found in this area, which is used during its life cycle for reproduction, feeding and growing.

AB  - We investigated the effect of salinity on growth, survival, and condition of pinfish Lagodon rhomboides juveniles (36-80 mm standard length) in two laboratory experiments in July 2003 and June/July 2004. Our results show that juvenile pinfish grown in laboratory conditions under a range of salinities experience rapid growth and high survival in typical estuarine-like salinities (15-30 ppt). We also found that relative weight as an index of condition corroborates the idea that pinfish are well adapted to survive and grow in a wide range of salinities. Such rapid growth and high survival in a dynamic environment may afford juvenile pinfish potential ecological advantages over other estuarine-dependent fish species that are relatively more constrained by changes in salinity regime. Because coastal development is wide-spread throughout Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic estuaries, insights concerning the impacts of human-induced changes to estuarine environments are essential for effective management practices.

AB  - To assess fully the potential of parasites for the biological control of Australian brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand, factors affecting the prevalence and intensity of such infections need to be determined. In this study we investigated the effects of season, sex, and age on endoparasite infection in possums from a single forest/farmland site in the lower North Island, New Zealand. Seasonal changes in prevalence and intensity of infection were found for most of the parasites, but the patterns of change varied between species. Parasite prevalences were generally similar in male and female possums, except for the Trichostrongylus spp., which were more prevalent in males. The prevalences of Parastrongyloides trichosuri, Paraustrostrongylus trichosuri and Trichostrongylus retortaeformis were generally lower in young animals (0-1 year) and in animals aged 4 years and older. A body condition index and prevalence of infection showed a significant negative relationship for coccidia, and significant positive relationships for Bertiella trichosuri and Paraustrostrongylus trichosuri. Parastrongyloides trichosuri and Paraustrostrongylus trichosuri, the species of greatest interest for biological control, infected possums rapidly once they became independent from their mothers, and maintained a high and relatively constant prevalence through the year in adults.

AB  - Although bottom-up forcing and overfishing are known to induce shifts in ecosystem states, system changes and their reversibility under each factor are still poorly understood. In this paper, dynamic food web simulations are conducted to evaluate when and why ecological thresholds may be exceeded, and whether bottom-up forcing or fishing is more likely to induce irreversible ecosystem states. Simulations are conducted using a calibrated food web model of the upwelling system off central Chile (33-39 degrees S) and the Ecopath with Ecosim software version 5.1. The effects of fishing scenarios are explored by changing fishing mortality according to trophic level. The effects of bottom-up forcing scenarios are explored by changing phytoplankton biomass, as a function of sea temperature, at El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and decadal scales. Simulations are carried out for 150 years and impacts, system recovery and regime shifts from each scenario are evaluated using trophodynamic indicators and limit reference points for biomass of functional groups as proxies of food web state and ecological thresholds, respectively. Proportionally distributed fishing along trophic levels is the least harmful fishing scenario, resulting in biomass limit reference points rarely being exceeded and high system recovery. Concentrating fishing at higher and lower trophic levels more likely causes reference points to be exceeded and induces ecosystem changes with low-to-medium recovery potential. No limit reference points are exceeded (or regime shift induced) under ENSO-scale bottom-up forcing. Decadal scale bottom-up forcing has different effects on the system depending on the sequence in which the high and low phytoplankton biomass periods are simulated. A shift from low phytoplankton biomass towards high phytoplankton biomass does not result in biomass limit reference points being exceeded, whereas the opposite sequence results in a large number of limit reference points being exceeded with medium recovery. The interplay between fishing and decadal scale bottom-up forcing indicates that bottom-up forcing can dampen the effects of fishing, whereas fishing increases the number of limit reference points exceeded and decreases the recovery observed under decadal scale bottom-up forcing. Results suggest that fishing (especially unsustainable strategies) is more likely to cause ecological thresholds to be exceeded and to induce regime shifts of low recovery than decadal scale bottom-up forcing. We consider these results of relevance for the management of fisheries in their ecosystem context. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil is substantive component of biosphere, which is exposed to plethora of pollutants including heavy metals. These are added by natural as well as anthropogenic activities. Upsurge in heavy metal content affects all organisms by biomagnification. So, it becomes vital to create a database of heavy metals concentration in soil. This is relevant in countries where unsustainable intensive agriculture, industrial and urban development is in progress. The present review of the scientific literature from 1991 to 2018 on heavy metals in soils in India shows that Zn and Pb exceeded their limits for Indian natural soil guidelines (Zn 22.1 and Pb 13.1 mu g/g), Canada (Zn 200 mu g/g), Swedish (80 mu g/g) and Poland (Zn 300 mu g/g) soil guidelines. The mean values of As and Cu for all soil types except for roadside soils, exceeded the limits. The average value of Cd for all soil types exceeded their limit. The mean values obtained for soils of India are Fe (23774.84 mu g/g), Mn (872.54 mu g/g), Zn (359.94 mu g/g), Cu (183.67 mu g/g), Cr (161.42 mu g/g), As (148.70 mu g/g), Ni (112.41 mu g/g), Pb (61.87 mu g/g), Co (37.63 mu g/g) and Cd (14.16 mu g/g). Cluster analysis and factor analysis were employed to different soil types and showed multiple sources of these metals. The contamination factor (CF), enrichment factor (EF) and potential contamination index (Cp) showed that Cd and As are the main contaminants. The results of ecological risk index indicated that Cd is the main pollutant in the different soils of India. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A significant number of OCPs were detected, but the levels found were generally low, mainly in the recent samplings (2010-2014). The levels of Sigma DDs (sum of DDTs and its metabolites, pp '-DDE and pp '-DDD) ranged between 0.22 ng/g dry weight (dw) in samples from the Ria of Pontevedra and 46.4 ng/g dw in mussels from the Ria of Arousa. Both aldrin and endrin were not detected or were below the analytical limits of detection. With regard to other pesticides, dieldrin is the major compound, followed by gamma-HCH, isodrin, alpha-HCH and transnonachlor. Significant ANOVA regressions indicated variations in levels of some OCPs with the biological parameters (lipid, condition index and shell length). Univariate and multivariate analysis of OCP levels revealed no significant differences between Rias. Temporal trends showed an important decline of OCPs in the studied samples during the period 1998-2014.

AB  - Improved functionality of phase change materials (PCM) through dispersion of nan oparticles is reported. The resulting nanoparticle-enhanced phase change materials (NEPCM) exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity in comparison to the base material. Starting with steady state natural convection within a differentially-heated square cavity that contains a nanofluid (water plus copper nanoparticles), the nanofluid is allowed to undergo solidification. Partly due to increase of thermal conductivity and also lowering of the latent heat of fusion, higher heat release rate of the NEPCM in relation to the conventional PCM is observed. The predicted increase of the heat release rate of the NEPCM is a clear indicator of its great potential for diverse thermal energy storage applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - FRESH-WATER BIODIVERSITY
AB  - Anthropogenic activities are changing the state of ecosystems worldwide, affecting community composition and often resulting in loss of biodiversity. Rivers are among the most impacted ecosystems. Recording their current state with regular biomonitoring is important to assess the future trajectory of biodiversity. Traditional monitoring methods for ecological assessments are costly and time-intensive. Here, we compared monitoring of macroinvertebrates based on environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling with monitoring based on traditional kick-net sampling to assess biodiversity patterns at 92 river sites covering all major Swiss river catchments. From the kick-net community data, a biotic index (IBCH) based on 145 indicator taxa had been established. The index was matched by the taxonomically annotated eDNA data by using a machine learning approach. Our comparison of diversity patterns only uses the zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units assigned to the indicator taxa. Overall, we found a strong congruence between both methods for the assessment of the total indicator community composition (gamma diversity). However, when assessing biodiversity at the site level (alpha diversity), the methods were less consistent and gave complementary data on composition. Specifically, environmental DNA retrieved significantly fewer indicator taxa per site than the kick-net approach. Importantly, however, the subsequent ecological classification of rivers based on the detected indicators resulted in similar biotic index scores for the kick-net and the eDNA data that was classified using a random forest approach. The majority of the predictions (72%) from the random forest classification resulted in the same river status categories as the kick-net approach. Thus, environmental DNA validly detected indicator communities and, combined with machine learning, provided reliable classifications of the ecological state of rivers. Overall, while environmental DNA gives complementary data on the macroinvertebrate community composition compared to the kick-net approach, the subsequently calculated indices for the ecological classification of river sites are nevertheless directly comparable and consistent.

AB  - Samples of Pecten maximus cultured using the ear-hanging technique were collected at regular intervals from April 1990 to July 1991, The gametogenic cycle has been studied in relation to the environmental conditions (temperature, chlorophyll a and seston) and assessed by two different methods: determination of the gonad condition index and study of the oocyte diameter by image analysis following a stereological technique, Two principal spawning periods were found, the first one in late spring and early summer(May-June 1990, June-July 1991), the second one in winter (February-March 1991). The temperature ranges from 11 to 21 degrees C with maxima in July and minima in December, Low temperatures during maturation gave rise to a delay in the spawning period. Spring spawning appears to occur after a threshold temperature around 16 degrees C is reached, whereas winter spawning takes place at lower temperatures (12-13 degrees C) and can be triggered by a phytoplankton bloom, Minor spawnings may be possible in late summer and at the beginning of autumn, No sexual resting period exists. The number of atretic oocytes were very high throughout the year, Oocyte lysis appears to be a common process linked to the reproductive strategy.

TI  - Adaptive assessment and management of riverine ecosystems: The Crocodile/Elands River case study
T2  - WATER SA
LA  - English
AB  - The River Health Programme (RHP) is being designed to generate information regarding the ecological state of riverine ecosystems in South Africa. An adaptive assessment and management procedure is suggested as a means of linking the monitoring outcomes of the RHP with water resource management decisions. The potential of such a procedure is demonstrated, using data that have been collected, through the pilot application of the RHP, on the Crocodile and Elands Rivers, Mpumalanga.
   In order to assess the collected data relative to a reference state, homogeneous river segments were identified. Each segment was classified in terms of its relative ecological integrity, based on three biological indicators (fish, benthic invertebrates, riparian vegetation). These assessments of current integrity were compared with management goals and quality objectives for the respective ri, er segments. Finally, river segments were ranked in terms of priority for receiving management attention, and an example is given of formulating appropriate management actions for addressing a high priority need.
   The systematic following of the step-wise procedure would facilitate and formalise the linking of data collection and assessment, the setting of management goals and quantifiable objectives, the selection of management options, and the monitoring of responses to chosen management actions.

AB  - The use of a multi-biomarker approach with three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) through an active biomonitoring strategy appears to be a promising tool in water quality assessment. The present work proposes to assess the efficiency of these tools in the discrimination of some sites in a large scale on the Meuse basin in Europe. The study was part of an EU program which aims to assess water quality in the Meuse across the French Belgian border. Sticklebacks were caged 21 days upstream and downstream from the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Namur (Belgium), Charleville-Mezieres (France), Bouillon (Belgium) and Avesnes-sur-Helpe (France). First, the state of a variety of physiological functions was assessed using a battery of biomarkers that represented innate immunity (leucocyte mortality and distribution, phagocytosis activity, respiratory burst), antioxidant system (GPx, CAT, SOD and total GSH content), oxidative damages to the membrane lipids (TBARS), biotransformation enzymes (EROD, GST), synaptic transmission (AChE) and reproduction system (spiggin and vitellogenin concentration). The impacts of the effluents were first analysed for each biomarker using a mixed model ANOVA followed by post-hoc analyses. Secondly, the global river contamination was assessed using a principal component analysis (PCA) followed by a hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC). The results highlighted a small number of effects of WWTP effluents on the physiological parameters in caged sticklebacks. Despite a significant effect of the "localisation" factor (upstream/downstream) in the mixed ANOVA for several biomarkers, post-hoc analyses revealed few differences between upstream and downstream of the WWTPs. Only a significant decrease of innate immune responses was observed downstream from the WWTPs of Avesnes-surHelpe and Namur. Other biomarker responses were not impacted by WWTP effluents. However, the multivariate analyses (PCA and HAC) of the biomarker responses helped to clearly discriminate the different study sites from the reference but also amongst themselves. Thus, a reduction of general condition (condition index and HSI) was observed in all groups of caged sticklebacks, associated with a weaker AChE activity in comparison with the reference population. A strong oxidative stress was highlighted in fish caged in the Meuse river at Charleville-Mezie`res whereas sticklebacks caged in the Meuse river at Namur exhibited weaker innate immune responses than others. Conversely, sticklebacks caged in the Helpe-Majeure river at Avesnes-sur-Helpe exhibited higher immune responses. Furthermore, weak defence capacities were recorded in fish caged in the Semois river at Bouillon. This experiment was the first to propose an active biomonitoring approach using three-spined stickleback to assess such varied environments. Low mortality and encouraging results in site discrimination support the use of this tool to assess the quality of a large number of water bodies.

AB  - Watershed ecological security provides the basic guarantee of regional sustainable development; thus, reliable watershed ecological security evaluation is of great significance in revealing the watershed ecological security status and promoting the healthy development of the watershed society and ecological environment. To construct the ecological function area, this study used the East-Liao River basin as the analysis object and discussed the delimitation method of ecological security evaluation, which provided the reference and basis for studying and exploring the optimal ecological regulation method of the basin. The following results were obtained: from 2000 to 2020, the regions with lower ecological security index changed from northwest to southeast of the watershed, and presented the spatial distribution of "unsafe"-* "generally safe"-* "relatively safe"-* "safe", with the center of gravity concentrated in the middle of the watershed; the spatial differences of ecological security became significant with the addition of ecological function zones, and they show a certain spatial aggregation trend; from 2000 to 2020, the ecological security level was predominantly safer, and the distribution of gravity center showed a circular state; the ecological security level of the watershed can be improved by adjusting the proportion of regional land use types. According to the results, countermeasures and approaches of watershed ecological security regulation were suggested, and four subareas were established: forbidden development zones, traditional utilization zones, ecologically sensitive/fragile zones, and key ecological function zones; this would provide a basis for further analysis of environmental governance in the East-Liao River basin of Jilin Province. Nevertheless, the countermeasures and approaches of ecological security regulation proposed in this study will also be useful for land use planning and runoff management in other watersheds around the world.

AB  - Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) is the causal agent of the most important viral disease of citrus. Symptoms that may affect the productive potential of citrus plants are observed in Uruguayan orchards even though resistant rootstocks are used. CTV is fully eliminated in propagative materials by the National Sanitation and Certification Program, but since the virus and its vector are widespread in the country, the risk of infection in the field persists. In this situation, using mild CTV strains in a cross-protection program would be a useful alternative to attempt to increase yield and quality of the local citrus industry. To this aim, this study assessed the biological and molecular characteristics of 32 local CTV isolates. Bioassays were conducted in a greenhouse with controlled conditions. Each isolate was graft-inoculated on Mexican lime, sweet orange, sour orange and Duncan grapefruit indicator plants. Symptoms and their intensity were evaluated. Molecular characterization was carried out by RT-PCR amplification, using primers for the p25, p20 and p23 genes. PCR products were sequenced, nucleotide sequences were aligned with international reference strains and phylogenetic trees were constructed. Results of the biological and molecular analysis showed the prevalence of severe CTV isolates with a high genetic variability. Two out of 32 characterized isolates were selected as mild CTV isolates to be tested as candidates for future cross-protection experiments. The survey showed a complex scenario for the management of CTV in Uruguay.

AB  - Our study illustrated the ecological conditions in the rivers of Lake Taihu Basin (LTB) using an index of biotic integrity based on phytoplankton (P-IBI), and its performance was compared with the previously developed water quality index (WQI). Samples were collected seasonally at 96 sites covering the major rivers from September 2014 to January 2016. Three critical ecological indices, i.e., phytoplankton density, chlorophyll a (chl a), and Menhinick, were selected from a pool of 22 candidate indices mainly according to the correlations among indices and environmental parameters. The results indicated that the ecological status of LTB based on P-IBI was significantly different at spatial (especially between Tiaoxi and the other 5 river systems) and seasonal scales. Furthermore, the proposed P-IBI effectively identified the major environmental parameters (total nitrogen, ammonium, total phosphorus, and permanganate index) associated with each level (bad, low, and moderate). Moreover, the P-IBI was closely and positively correlated with the WQI at the spatial scale regardless of season. However, the ecological conditions were significantly worse according to the P-IBI at both the spatial (P < 0.001) and seasonal scales (P values of 0.018 in winter and < 0.001 in other seasons, respectively), and the seasonal distribution pattern differed between the two methods. Our study suggests that the P-IBI provides an essential supplement for the assessment of ecological conditions of rivers and that the selected critical indices (phytoplankton density, chl a, and Menhinick) are suitable for river ecosystems. Additionally, compared with WQI, the water quality condition was generally worse when using P-IBI, and this phenomenon requires further attention during water quality assessments, as well as different seasonal distribution patterns.

AB  - To examine links between the metallothionein (MT) status of an organism and its general health, we transplanted adult specimens of the freshwater bivalve Pyganodon grandis (formerly Anodonta grandis) from a less to a more contaminated lake in the mining area of Rouyn-Noranda, in northwestern Quebec. The transplanted bivalves were maintained in open enclosures placed in the bottom sediments of the contaminated lake; in addition, indigenous specimens were maintained in control enclosures in their lake of origin. Up to 16 individuals were removed from pairs of enclosures at times t = 0 (June 1990), 5, 14, 30, 60, 90, and 400 d. Excised gill tissue was analyzed for metallothionein, Cd, Cu, Zn, Ca, and malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation. Metal partitioning in the gill cytosol, as determined on a subset of gill samples from transplanted molluscs, changed markedly during the experiment. After 400 d, Cd was present in the low molecular weight fraction of the gill cytosol, and symptoms of cellular toxicity were detected in the transplanted molluscs (elevated [MDA] and [Ga]). At the whole organism level, the marked transplanted bivalves grew more slowly over the 400-d experiment than did marked control bivalves in Lake Opasatica, and their condition index deteriorated over time.

AB  - Two physical and four biochemical condition indices were used to assess seasonal fluctuations in the condition of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, at one polluted and one clean site in Manukau Harbour, New Zealand, from June 1988 to March 1990.  Oysters from the polluted site typically possessed thicker, heavier shells, with four to seven internal chambers (possibly the result of TBT contamination).  No chambering was observed in shells from the clean site.  At both sites, oyster condition (as measured by any of the six indices) was not strongly correlated with whole weight on any sampling occasion (all cases r < 0.35).  Sampling over the 22-month period showed strong seasonal variability in condition.  The general pattern was for low condition from summer through winter building to peak values in the following spring-summer.  Changes in condition were attributable principally to fluctuations in glycogen (at the polluted site) and protein (at the clean site).  Of the six condition indices employed, only the two physical condition indices (based on dry flesh weight per shell cavity volume and shell weight) consistently separated the clean from the polluted site.  Possible factors affecting oyster condition and the use of condition measurements in environmental monitoring are discussed.

AB  - Fish communities of ten streams in the Davy Crockett National Forest were sampled for 12 months in 1994 and 1995. Fish assemblages were identified and subjected to the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) and various biological indices to estimate stream quality. The SAS(C) program was used to perform a cluster analysis, Friedman's two-way ANOVA, and Spearman's Rank Correlation to show variances in diversity and fish assemblages between streams. The species list was highly diverse and included some uncommon species. Eight of the ten study streams were similar in quality to Piney Creek, the least impacted stream of the ecoregion. Water quality, anthropogenic influence and impact were inferred for each stream and compared to the results of a concurrent physical/chemical survey.

AB  - McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, is home to a unique marine biota with an ecology that has evolved in this frigid environment over millions of years. The region is one of the least disturbed, and possibly the last pristine, marine ecosystem on Earth. Here, the results of three seasons of fishing in the shallow nearshore waters of McMurdo Sound are reported. A shift in the composition of small fish species at one site, Inaccessible Island, has been observed in just five years. The shift in shallow water species composition occurred during a period that followed the maturation of a commercial fishery for the Antarctic toothfish, Dissostichus mawsoni Norman, a predator of smaller fish, and the presence of a large iceberg, termed B-15, at the mouth of McMurdo Sound during the early 2000s that trapped the annual sea ice in the area leading to the unusual accrual of multi-year sea ice. The data presented here provide a current record of species composition and physiological condition of small, shallow water fishes at three sites in McMurdo Sound, providing a current baseline for the assessment of future changes wrought by environmental changes and unprecedented fishery pressures in the Ross Sea.

AB  - The Middle East (ME), as an arid and semi-arid region, is prone to environmental risks and stresses, such as drought are inseparable phenomena of the region. In this study, an approach for identifying sustained vegetation cover (SVC) is suggested to identify the connection between SVC and drought. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) were used to filter zones of rich vegetation cover from poorly vegetated or non-vegetated regions of the ME. The change detection of vegetation cover was computed by the NDVI differencing technique, and the vegetation condition index (VCI) and normalized vegetation supply water index (NVSWI) were used to derive drought indices. The standardized precipitation index (SPI) and rainfall anomaly index (RAI) were used to monitor the intensity of meteorological drought events. A comparison of the estimates of vegetation change, remote sensing-based VCI, and meteorological drought indices revealed that the highest SVC is concurrent with the occurrence of drought. Moreover, it was found that the most severe meteorological drought and VCL-based drought condition occurred in 2008 and that the highest percentage of SVC was also obtained for this year. The results suggest the possibility of using the SVC instead of other spectral indices, such as the NDVI, VCI, NVSWI, and NVSWI, for the superior assessment and detection of environmental stresses such as drought.

AB  - The geothermal system of the Araro region, located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt of Mexico, hosts various hot springs with unique physicochemical characteristics, including temperatures ranging from 45 degrees C to 78 degrees C. The microbial diversity in these hot springs has been explored only by culture-dependent surveys. In this study, we performed metagenomic Illumina MiSeq, and 16S and 18S rRNA pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial life are residing in the microbial mats of the springs called Tina-Bonita. Our results show the presence of 186 operational taxonomic units, 99.7% of which belong to bacteria, 0.27% to eukaryotes, and 0.03% to archaea. The most abundant bacterial divisions are the Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Cyanobacteria, which include 105 genera. The ecological indexes indicate that the microbial mats have moderate microbial diversity. An abundant group of genes that participate in photosynthesis, including photosynthetic electron transport, as well as photosystems I and II, were detected. Another cluster of genes was found that participates in sulfur, nitrogen, and methane metabolism. Finally, this phylogenetic and metagenomic analysis revealed an unexpected taxonomic and genetic diversity, expanding our knowledge of microbial life under specific extreme conditions.

AB  - To examine the extent to which human activities near the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon influence the accumulation of trace elements (TE) in Ruditapes decussatus, individuals were transplanted from a natural bank located in the lower lagoon to three sites located in clam growth grounds under the influence of a small city (Faro), a fish farming centre (Olhao) and a site near the lagoon inlet (Lavajo). Concentrations were determined in substrate of the clam grounds and in the digestive gland, gills, mantle plus siphons, and remaining tissues of clams in four periods of the year. These measurements were accomplished with the monthly survey of the gametogenic stages, condition index, proteins, glycogen, total lipids, pH and osmolarity of hemolymph. Arsenic, Cu, Mn, V, Cr and Pb were preferentially linked to the digestive gland, while Cd was linked to the gills. TE concentrations in the digestive gland and remaining tissues were higher in winter, most likely reflecting additional inputs associated with rain. The lack of disruptions in biological parameters and the prolonged period of spawning and gonad recovery in clams suggest that the current TE availability in the lagoon has a minor influence on the reproductive cycle and hence on clam production.

AB  - The use of multimetric indices (MMIs), such as the widely used index of biological integrity (IBI), to measure, track, summarize and infer the overall impact of human disturbance on biological communities has been steadily growing in recent years. Initially, MMIs were developed for aquatic communities using pre-selected biological metrics as indicators of system integrity. As interest in these bioassessment tools has grown, so have the types of biological systems to which they are applied. For many ecosystem types the appropriate biological metrics to use as measures of biological integrity are not known a priori. As a result, a variety of ad hoc protocols for selecting metrics empirically has developed. However, the assumptions made by proposed protocols have not be explicitly described or justified, causing many investigators to call for a clear, repeatable methodology for developing empirically derived metrics and indices that can be applied to any biological system. An issue of particular importance that has not been sufficiently addressed is the way that individual metrics combine to produce an MMI that is a sensitive composite indicator of human disturbance. In this paper, we present and demonstrate an algorithm for constructing MMIs given a set of candidate metrics and a measure of human disturbance. The algorithm uses each metric to inform a candidate MMI, and then uses information-theoretic principles to select MMIs that capture the information in the multidimensional system response from among possible MMIs. Such an approach can be used to create purely empirical (data-based) MMIs or can, optionally, be influenced by expert opinion or biological theory through the use of a weighting vector to create value-weighted MMIs. We demonstrate the algorithm with simulated data to demonstrate the predictive capacity of the final MMIs and with real data from wetlands from Acadia and Rocky Mountain National Parks. For the Acadia wetland data, the algorithm identified 4 metrics that combined to produce a -0.88 correlation with the human disturbance index. When compared to other methods, we find this algorithmic approach resulted in MMIs that were more predictive and comprise fewer metrics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present work addresses the importance of considering the working structural conditions when evaluating the expansive behavior of alumina-magnesia castables under chemical corrosion. Slag resistance tests were conducted on spinel castables with different expansion levels, inserted in cement-bonded high alumina blocks, to limit their expansion, and compared to the results attained after performing the same experiments without any constraint. The results pointed out that in an expansion controlled condition, the penetration indexes were reduced as a result of the lower volume of pores in the castable microstructure. Moreover, this benefit was enhanced for the coarser MgO-containing materials, contradicting the trends usually observed when no structural constraint is considered.

AB  - Sexual size dimorphism is widespread among snakes and has also been observed in lengths of body appendages such as in tails. Males typically possess longer tails than females and this dimorphism in tail length has generally been attributed to the importance of the tail in mating and reproduction. We used body size measurements, snout-vent length (SVL) and tail length (TL) as well as a body condition index (BCI) as a measure of quality in Caspian Whip Snakes from Hungary, in order to shed light on sexual dimorphism patterns. The SVL of males (1061 +/- 133 mm, n = 25) were significantly longer than that of females (887 +/- 208 mm, n = 41). However, the proportion of TL to total length was lower in males than in females (0.257 +/- 0.018 and 0.274 +/- 0.017, respectively). The BCI of females (386 +/- 10) was significantly higher than that of males (343 +/- 15). Females having proportionally longer tails compared to males seems to be the reverse of the usual trend. Selective pressures on the tails of female snakes are less obvious, as tail length may be linked to more than one function, and hence be simultaneously subjected to more than one type of selective force.

AB  - A basic approach to blind source separation is to define an index representing statistical dependency among the output signals of the separator and minimize it with respect to the separator's parameters. The most natural index might be mutual information among the output signals of the separator. In the case of convolutive mixture, however, since the signals must be treated as time series, it becomes very complicated to concretely express the mutual information as a function of the parameters. To cope with this difficulty, in most of the conventional methods, the source signals are assumed to be independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) or linear. Based on this assumption, some simpler indices are defined, and their minimization is made by such an iterative calculation as the gradient method. In actual applications, however, the sources are often not linear processes. This paper discusses what will happen when those algorithms postulating the linearity of the sources are applied to the case of nonlinear sources. An analysis of local stability derives a couple of conditions guaranteeing that the separator stably tends toward a desired one with iteration. The obtained results reveal that those methods, which are based on the minimization of some indices related to mutual information, do not work well when the sources signals are far from linear.

AB  - Interest by land-management and regulatory agencies in using biological indicators to detect wetland degradation, coupled with ongoing use of this approach to assess water quality in streams, led to the desire to develop and evaluate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for wetlands that could be used to categorize the level of degradation. We under-took this challenge with data from coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes, which have been degraded by a variety of human disturbances. We studied six barrier beach wetlands in western Lake Superior, six drowned-river-mouth wetlands along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, and six open shoreline wetlands in Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron. Plant, fish, and invertebrate communities were sampled in each wetland. The resulting data were assessed in various forms against gradients of human disturbance to identify potential metrics that could be used in IBI development. Our results suggested that the metrics proposed as potential components of an IBI for barrier beach wetlands of Lake Superior held promise. The metrics for Lake Michigan drowned-river-mouth wetlands were inconsistent in identifying gradients of disturbance; those for Lake Huron open embayment wetlands were yet more inconsistent. Despite the potential displayed by the Lake Superior results within the year sampled, we concluded that an IBI for use in Great Lakes wetlands would not be valid unless separate scoring ranges were derived for each of several sequences of water-level histories. Variability in lake levels from year to year can produce variability in data and affect the reproducibility of data collected, primarily due to extreme changes in plant communities and the faunal habitat they provide. Substantially different results could be obtained in the same wetland in different years as a result of the response to lake-level change, with no change in the level of human disturbance. Additional problems included limited numbers of comparable sites, potential lack of undisturbed reference sites, and variable effects of different disturbance types. We also evaluated our conclusions with respect to hydrologic variability and other major natural disturbances affecting wetlands in other regions. We concluded that after segregation of wetland types by geographic, geomorphic, and hydrologic features, a functional IBI may be possible for wetlands with relatively stable hydrology. However, an IBI for wetlands with unpredictable yet recurring influences of climate-induced, long-term high water periods, droughts, or drought-related fires or weather-related catastrophic floods or high winds (hurricanes) would also require differing scales of measurement for years that differ in the length of time since the last major natural disturbance. A site-specific, detailed ecological analysis of biological indicators may indeed be of value in determining the quality or status of wetlands, but we recommend that IBI scores not be used unless the scoring ranges are calibrated for the specific hydrologic history pre-dating any sampling year.

AB  - Aquatic organisms at Chernobyl have now been chronically exposed to environmental radiation for three decades. The biological effects of acute exposure to radiation are relatively well documented, but much less is known about the long-term effects of chronic exposure of organisms in their natural environment. Highly exposed fish in freshwater systems at Chernobyl showed morphological changes in their reproductive system in the years after the accident. However, the relatively limited scope of past studies did not allow robust conclusions to be drawn. Moreover, the level of the radiation dose at which significant effects on wildlife occur is still under debate. In the most comprehensive evaluation of the effects of chronic radiation on wild fish populations to date, the present study measures specific activities of Cs-137, Sr-90, and transuranium elements (Pu-238, Pu-239,Pu-240, and Am-241), index conditions, distribution and size of oocytes, as well as environmental and biological confounding factors in two fish species perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) from seven lakes. In addition, relative species abundance was examined. The results showed that both fish species are, perhaps surprisingly, in good general physiological and reproductive health. Perch, however, appeared to be more sensitive to radiation than roach: in the most contaminated lakes, a delay of the maturation of the gonads and the presence of several undeveloped phenotypes were evident only for perch and not for roach.

AB  - Worldwide, stocking of fish represents a valuable tool for conservation and maintenance of species exploited by recreational fishing. Releases of hatchery-reared fish are more and more recognized to have numerous demographic, ecological, and genetic impacts on wild populations. However, consequences on intraspecific trophic relationships have rarely been investigated. In this study, we assessed the impacts of supplementation stocking and resulting introgressive hybridization on the trophic niches occupied by stocked, local, and hybrid lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) within populations of piscivorous and planktivorous ecotypes stocked from a wild piscivorous source population. We compared trophic niches using stable isotope analysis (delta(13) C and delta N-15) and trophic position among the three genetic origins. Putative genetic effects were tested with phenotype-genotype association of "life history" ecological traits (body size, growth rate, condition index, and trophic niche) and genotypes (RADscq SNP markers) using redundant discriminant analysis (RDA). Results showed that sympatry resulting from the stocking of contrasting ecotypes is a risk factor for niche partitioning. Planktivorous populations are more susceptible to niche partitioning, by competitive exclusion of the local fish from a littoral niche to an alternative pelagic/profundal niche. Observed niche partitioning is probably a manifestation of competitive interactions between ecotypes. Our results emphasize that ecotypic variation should be considered for more efficient management and conservation practices and in order to mitigate negative impact of supplementation stocking.

AB  - Parasites often have direct impacts on their host physiology or function, which can in turn have indirect effects on interspecific interactions and ecosystem structure. The present study investigates the effect of trematode parasite infection on the ecologically and commercially important venerid clam Austrovenus stutchburyi. Although the indirect impacts of clam infection on the broader benthic community, mediated by impaired burrowing of parasitized clams, have been well documented before, the more direct impacts on the clam itself remain poorly studied. The consequence of parasite infection on clam growth rate, mortality, body condition and foot length was quantified in a three-month laboratory experiment, in which juvenile clams were infected with varying levels of the echinostome trematode Curtuteria australis. Although mortality was unaffected by parasite infection, greater numbers of parasites deleteriously affected the growth rate, body condition and foot length of clams. This may result in delayed maturity and a lower filtration rate for infected individuals, as well as a reduced ability to bury into the sediment. Consequently, increased parasite infection not only has subsequent broader impacts on the surrounding ecological community, but can also affect the clam host directly and lower its value as a harvested species.

AB  - Securing economically and ecologically significant molluscs, as our oceans warm due to climate change, is a global priority. South eastern Australia receives warm water in a strengthening East Australia Current and so resident species are vulnerable to elevated temperature and marine heat waves. This study tested whether prior exposure to elevated temperature can enhance resilience of oysters to ocean warming. Two Australian species, the flat oyster, Ostrea angasi, and the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, were obtained as adults and "heat shocked" by exposure to a dose of warm water in the laboratory. Oysters were then transferred to elevated seawater temperature conditions where the thermal outfall from power generation was used as a proxy to investigate the impacts of ocean warming. Shell growth, condition index, lipid content and survival of flat oysters and condition of Sydney rock oysters were all significantly reduced by elevated seawater temperature in the field. Flat oysters grew faster than Sydney rock oysters at ambient temperature, but their growth and survival was more sensitive to elevated temperature. "Stress inoculation" by heat shock did little to ameliorate the negative effects of increased temperature, although the survival of heat-shocked flat oysters was greater than non-heat shocked oysters. Further investigations are required to determine if early exposure to heat stress can enhance resilience of oysters to ocean warming.

AB  - The measure of value called emergy is used to evaluate the flows of energy and resources that sustain the biosphere including the economy of humans. A donor system of value based on solar emergy required to produce things is suggested as the only means of reversing the logic trap inherent in economic valuation, which suggests that value stems only from utilization by humans. The stocks of natural capital and flows of environmental resources are evaluated in emergy and related to Global World Product, Several emergy indices are introduced as a means of evaluating sustainability of economies and processes. The total emergy flux of the biosphere is composed of 32% renewable flows of sunlight, tidal momentum and deep heat (it was 68% in 1950), and 68% slowly-renewable and nonrenewable flows. An index of environmental loading on the biosphere is shown to have increased about 4 times since 1950, while an index of global sustainability suggests that overall, sustainability of the global economy has precipitously declined.

AB  - Increased heat-related morbidity and mortality are expected direct consequences of global warming. In the developed world, most fatal heat exposures occur in the indoor home environment, yet little is known of the correspondence between outdoor and indoor heat. Here we show how summertime indoor heat and humidity measurements from 285 low-and middle-income New York City homes vary as a function of concurrent local outdoor conditions. Indoor temperatures and heat index levels were both found to have strong positive linear associations with their outdoor counterparts; however, among the sampled homes a broad range of indoor conditions manifested for the same outdoor conditions. Using these models, we simulated indoor conditions for two extreme events: the 10-day 2006 NYC heat wave and a 9-day event analogous to the more extreme 2003 Paris heat wave. These simulations indicate that many homes in New York City would experience dangerously high indoor heat index levels during extreme heat events. These findings also suggest that increasing numbers of NYC low-and middle-income households will be exposed to heat index conditions above important thresholds should the severity of heat waves increase with global climate change. The study highlights the urgent need for improved indoor temperature and humidity management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The marine bivalve Macoma balthica has disappeared from the Spanish part of the Bay of Biscay during the past four decades. Investigating the possible role of climate change in forcing this species up north, we translocated it down south, back into two Spanish estuaries, and followed the thermal acclimatization of the metabolic rate during spring, summer and autumn. Our results reveal that in natural populations the respiratory response to temperature becomes down-regulated during summer and autumn. The respiration rate in the southward translocated populations became down-regulated to a safe level at very high temperatures (31 degrees C), but remained high at average temperatures instead. These translocated populations showed a gradual reduction of the condition-index, down to the level of starvation at the end of summer. Combined with an increased metabolic rate this indicates that the translocated specimens suffered from elevated maintenance rates. We conclude that short-term but frequent exposure to >30 degrees C in the Spanish estuaries, induces elevated maintenance rates in M. balthica, and ultimately starvation. M balthica indeed disappeared from the northern Spanish coast due to increasing summer maxima during the last decades. We prospect that the southern distribution limit of M. balthica will shift further north, and that the clam will eventually disappear from the entire Bay of Biscay with future increases in Summer temperatures.

St. Helens National Volcano Monument (Washington), and Firehole River at Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming).  Principle components analysis was performed on the variables temperature, dissolved iron, species diversity index, and environmental condition.  Recently disturbed environments had a significant effect on the occurrence of N. fowleri.  This finding supports the flagellate-empty habitat hypothesis of Griffin, which stressed that the ameba is most likely to be found where the environment has been cleared of competitors and predators.  An informal probability index for the occurrence of N. fowleri is proposed as a useful tool for managers of recreational waters.

AB  - Pollution of water bodies causes stress on organisms inhabiting them. Determination of biomarkers and bioindicators on fish populations reflects whether they are subject to stress. We assessed two populations of Ameca splendens and Goodea atripinnis in a reference site (spring "El Rincon") and De La Vega reservoir, which receives wastewater of a sugar industry, on Ameca River course. We analyzed level of lipid peroxidation and enzymatic activities of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, acetylcholinesterase and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase as biomarkers; we also studied age classes and various body indexes. Environmental factors were recorded and a water quality index was assessed. Water quality was better in the spring than in the reservoir. Organisms inhabiting the reservoir presented higher oxidative stress by the lipid peroxidation levels, and neurotoxic impacts by the acetylcholinesterase and some detoxification mechanisms were evident by the gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activities. Integrated Biomarker Response demonstrate that De La Vega reservoir is a more stressing place to organisms living there, particularly for A. splendens. In both species, males were more affected than females. Condition and reproductive parameters in reservoir showed evidences of physiological changes due to xenobiotics exposure and suggest a tactic of the organisms to survive in this site. Both biomarkers and body indexes revealed that A. splendens is a more sensitive species than G. atripinnis to environmental stress. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation exhibits a significant degradation for dissolved organic matter (DOM) in natural water ecosystems. However, research on photodegradation process of terrestrial components (e.g., humic-like substances) of DOM are limited due to drastic water dilution and rapid degradation. Here, photochemical degradation of terrestrial soil DOM with abundant humic-like substances from different land use were investigated by utilizing spectral technologies. Simulated UV radiation caused obvious losses on concentration, component structures, and fluorescence characteristic of soil DOM samples. The correlations between absorption specific parameters (a(280), SUVA(254), and S-R) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were especially pronounced (p < 0.05), which could be used as valid indicators to determine changes in DOM composition and molecular size during photobleaching process. The decreases of DOM fluorescence intensity were corresponded to first-order kinetic and half-life reactions. The greatest reduction on fluorescence intensity (31.56-81.97%) belonged to peak C (i.e., humic-like substances). Overall, DOM from forest and grass soil ecosystems was more easily photochemical degraded than anthropogenic soil DOM. Enhancive contribution of fresh DOM formed by photodegradation increased autochthonous characteristic and bioavailable nutrition by increasing biological index (BIX) values and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration. The slight microbial decomposition effects on DOM happened in unsterilized dark condition. Our findings provided insights for understanding the rapid photodegradation processes of composition and structure of terrestrial DOM.

AB  - The reproductive cycle of the rock oyster Striostrea prismatica was determined at two fishing areas, General Villamil and Ayangue (located on the southern coast of Ecuador), between May 2012 and April 2013. Monthly sampling campaigns were performed at both locations. The tissues were histologically examined to determine gonadal index (GI), oocyte development, follicular area coverage and sex ratio. Surface seawater temperature, salinity and chlorophyll a concentration were measured during samplings. Our results show a similar annual reproductive pattern at both locations. The GI reached maximum values during the summer. Oysters reached highest ripeness in January and February, while spawning occurred in February-March. Gametogenesis was linked to a consistently increasing follicular area (from 1.3 +/- 0.7% to 85.8 +/- 7.8%) and associated to surface seawater temperature. Spawning coincided with warm water temperature fluctuations and a seawater salinity decrease. No correlation was found with Chlorophyll a concentration. The sex ratio of sampled populations was 1:1, suggesting that oysters sizing more than 10 cm in shell length present a stable sex proportion in the population. The diameter of mature oocytes was significantly reduced (32.7%) during histologically preparations in comparison to fresh oocytes. Our study provides useful information of environmental factors that may control the observed gametogenesis and spawning activity of S. prismatica.

AB  - Our study was carried out on two species of clams, Venerupis aurea laeta and Cerastoderma edule glaucum, from Ganzirri Lake considered as "environmental biomarkers" for their changes in physiology, morphology or distribution under the influence of substances in the environment. The aim of the present study was to conduct a statistical analysis on Venerupis and Cerastoderma to investigate the difference between the two autochthonous clams according to the presence of metals, and to link metal concentrations to the reproductive cycle of clam during 2009-2010. Metal analysis was carried out with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Accuracy and precision were assessed by analyzing the certified standard matrix: mussel tissue NIST SRM 2976. The multivariate analysis was made using the SPSS 13.0 software package for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). In this study, the concentrations of some metals found in clam tissues showed seasonal cycles with higher values in summer than in winter. The significances of metal concentrations differences between Venerupis and Cerastoderma samples were estimated with Mann-Whitney U-test. The concentrations of Ag, As, Cd, Mn, Se and Zn show a significant p-level that suggests a difference between the two group samples. Statistical analysis showed that the link of metal concentrations to the reproductive cycles of Venerupis and Cerastoderma was not evident.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether fry of golden shiners Notemigonus crysoleucas reared in ponds differed with respect to growth, survival, feed conversion, total yield, condition, and response to low dissolved oxygen when fed a practical diet of 36% protein from animal and plant sources (five ponds) versus a diet of only plant sources (six ponds). Newly hatched fry (1 mg) were stocked at 2.5x10(6)/ha in 12 fertilized ponds (0.04 ha each). Fish were fed twice daily at a rate of 8.0-15.9 kg/ha for 12 weeks. Chlorophyll a was not different between diets. indicating that natural food production in ponds was similar between treatments. Between-treatment differences in average individual weight (0.56-0.59 g), relative weight (114.4-115.6), Fulton's condition index (K=0.88), total yield (40.8-45.6 kg), feed conversion (0.85-0.95). and survival (75.9-79.2%) were not significant. Postharvest survival of fish exposed to low dissolved oxygen at 20degreesC in a laboratory test was not affected by diet. These results indicate that diets with all plant protein sources are suitable for raising golden shiners in fertilized ponds from first-feeding fry to small juveniles.

AB  - The microbial communities and overall health of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, have long been topics of interest due to the fundamental economic and ecological roles this species maintains. A broad scale characterization of the oyster microbiome over spatial and seasonal scales, however, has never been carried out. The primary goal of this study was to examine the factors mediating microbial communities of the gut and pallial fluid of C. virginica at three sites within the Long Island Sound estuary, with a focus on both genetic structure (T-RFLP) and physiological profiling (EcoPlates) of the microbiome. Results indicated that the genetic structure of microbial communities of oysters was minimally separated across sites, but was influenced by season. Although the microbial community structure was similar, the number of carbon sources utilized by these communities (richness) varied across site, season, and anatomical location within the host. Parameters including oyster condition index, Dermo disease, and ambient water temperature were measured to assess their influence on the oyster microbiome. Only water temperature was found to have a significant relationship with microbial community structure and richness. Results suggest that a core microbiome may exist within the eastern oyster, specifically for those populations that are not genetically distinct.

AB  - A habitat approach was promoted in the framework of ecological status assessment of transitional waters, assuming the importance of habitat heterogeneity to the overall system status. The approach was applied to the use of fish-based multimetric indices by adapting them to seagrass and marsh habitats in the Venice lagoon, Italy, through selection of appropriate metrics and reference conditions. While for marsh habitats, no clear patterns resulted, the index response for seagrass was consistent with the habitat degradation and loss recorded in the lagoon between 2002 and 2005 and with the higher habitat disturbance in southern and central lagoon sub-basins. The assessment of individual habitats is presented as a first step in the process of evaluating the overall condition of a Mediterranean lagoon environment, which should also take account of the diversity of habitats and their availability within the system to properly define an overall index of ecological status.

AB  - We conducted feeding experiments with captive, wild-strain wood ducks (Aix sponsa) during winters 1990-91 and 1991-92 to test effects of increasing levels of food restriction on body mass dynamics, mortality, and pair formation. Male and female wood ducks fed restricted diets (i.e., 5, 10, 15, or 20% less food [g] than consumed on the previous day by a control group fed ad libitum) weighed less (P less than or equal to 0.037) than birds fed ad libitum; those on 15 and 20% restricted diets weighed least. Increased mortality and decreased pair formation occurred only within the 20% restricted group (P less than or equal to 0.049). We concluded that food restriction ranging between 15 and 20% of ad libitum intake may signify a threshold above which survival and reproduction of captive wood ducks may be impaired. Because energy costs of free living are greater than in captivity, a lower threshold may exist for wild wood ducks. Research is needed to validate the threshold theory for free-ranging wood ducks and other waterfowl, and to evaluate its potential application for conservation of winter foraging habitat. Conservation of bottomland hardwood ecosystems, which provide important foraging habitat for migrating and wintering wood ducks, should be encouraged to prevent potential negative effects on wood duck life-cycle events.

AB  - The ecological aspect of organic farming refers to the ability to maintain the resilience of agroecosystems. This paper aims at investigating the species diversity of entomofauna (harmful and beneficial) on the soil surface in an organic apple orchard under the conditions of ecological management approaches. The organic orchard is located on the land of the village of Vodenichane. Yambol region, Bulgaria. Field surveys of entomofauna on the soil surface in the apple orchard were carried out in 2018 and 2019 with monthly reporting of 'pitfall trap' (soil traps) placed in a checkerboard pattern under the crowns of selecid trees. The Dominance index was higher in 2018 in comparison with the dominance index reported in 2019 and showed the capacity of taxons of higher ecological plasticity to increase their number in return for other taxons in the agrocenosis under survey. The other ecological index is the Equitability index, which expresses the uniformity in the distribution of the total number among the separate species and shows a tendency towards striving for achieving optimal development. Equitability was higher in 2018 as compared to the equitability in 2019, which means that the taxons in the complex were more evenly distributed from a systematic point of view.

AB  - Drought, which causes the economic, social, and environmental losses, also threatens food security worldwide. In this study, we developed a vegetation-soil water deficit (VSWD) method to better assess agricultural droughts. The VSWD method considers precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (PET) and soil moisture. The soil moisture from different soil layers was compared with the in situ drought indices to select the appropriate depths for calculating soil moisture during growing seasons. The VSWD method and other indices for assessing the agricultural droughts, i.e., Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI), Vegetation Health Index (VHI) and Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), were compared with the in situ and multi-scales of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEIs). The results show that the VSWD method has better performance than SDCI, VHI, and TVDI. Based on the drought events collected from field sampling, it is found that the VSWD method can better distinguish the severities of agricultural droughts than other indices mentioned here. Moreover, the performances of VSWD, SPEIs, SDCI and VHI in the major historical drought events recorded in the study area show that VSWD has generated the most sensible results than others. However, the limitation of the VSWD method is also discussed.

AB  - The abalone Haliotis diversicolor (Reeve) or 'tokobushi' is being cultured in Kagoshima, southern Japan for stock enhancement of fishing grounds. However, with decreasing catches from the wild some fishermen's group may eventually resort to rearing tokobushi until of marketable size. Growth experiments of tokobushi fed macroalgae in floating net cage and plastic tanks were conducted to evaluate the influence of culture system, macroalgal food, age and water temperature on their culture. In floating net cage, marketable sizes were obtained at the age of 457-822-day old (15-27-month old) with highest growth rate of 2.36% g day(-1) and 0.21 mm day(-1). One advantage of the plastic tank culture system was that the tokobushi shell remained clean throughout the culture period. Macroalgal food affected the growth rate; Sargassum fusiforme (Setchell)- and Ulva pertusa (Kjellman)-fed tokobushi were better than Meristotheca papulosa (Montagne)-fed. Further, 1-year-old tokobushi had better growth performance and condition index than the 2-year-old cohort, and growth rates were higher at 17 degrees C than at 12 degrees C. These findings should help tokobushi farmers design their mariculture scheme considering both economic and environmental aspects.

AB  - The content of Cu, Zn, Pb, As, Cd, and Ni was determined by ICP-OES in spatial soil and parts (root, branches, leaves, and fruit) of the apple tree (Malus spp.) from polluted sites near The Mining and Smelting Complex Bor (Serbia). The aim of this study was to examine if the obtained results can be used for biomonitoring purposes. Data recorded in plant parts, especially leaves, gave very useful information about the environmental state of the Bor region. Conveniently, these data described well the capability of investigated plant species to assimilate and tolerate severely high concentrations of heavy metals in its tissues, which may further allow the possibility for utilization of the apple tree for phytostabilization.

AB  - A multiproxy approach based on benthic foraminifera, sediment grain-size, total organic carbon content, major and trace element concentrations, and radionuclide activities was used to investigate the recent landscape evolution of the Canche Estuary (eastern English Channel, France). In the present study the radiometric dating based on Pb-210 and Cs-132 activities could only establish that the sediments were deposited recently. As an alternative method, aerial historical pictures were used for the first time to date core sediments as well as to enhance the palaeoenvironmental interpretations. In approximately one hundred years, an initial naked tidal flat has been gradually replaced by a vegetated salt marsh. In the bottom part of the core, foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by Cribroelphium excavation and Elphidium margaritaceum. Haynesina germanica is the most abundant taxon in the middle part of the core while Entzia macrescens is dominant in the upper part. The sediment core represents a typical fining-upward succession in a low-impacted tide-dominated estuary filled by progradation. Our outcomes highlight how a multidisciplinary approach based on abiotic and biotic parameters is essential for understanding complex transitional areas like estuaries. When dating is not provided by classic radiometric methods, historical pictures (< 100 years) may constitute a valuable alternative method to reconstruct recent environments.

AB  - Levels of tributyltin and its breakdown compounds, including the first record of monobutyltin (MBT) in history for Latin America, were determined in native mussels (Brachidontes rodriguezii) by means of CG-MS, after extraction/derivatization assisted by ultrasound. The samples were collected in 2013 in Bahia Blanca Estuary (Argentina) at 6 sites, which reflect different levels of maritime activities.
   Total butyltins (TBts = TBT + DBT + MBT) levels ranged from 19.64 to 180.57 ng Sn g(-1) dry weight. According to the Oslo-Paris commission, the results indicated that 73.9% of mussels could be under biological effects risks associated with TBT pollution. In accordance with the calculated bioaccumulation factors, approximately 56% of samples appeared to have accumulated TBT through the sediments.
   All sampling sites were shown to be impacted by organotin compounds (OTCs) showing variable levels through seasons, which could be related with the variation of the water temperature.
   Degradation index analyses suggested aged inputs of TBT possibly under a general degradation process at the area of study. In addition, the occurrence of DBT and MBT could not be uniquely attributed to the degradation pathway of the TBT; in fact, results outlined the possible contribution of some punctual and diffuse sources at the area such as proximity to plastic industries, industrial effluents, sewage outlets and domestic wastewaters.

AB  - Biotic indices are commonly used in biomonitoring programs to assess the quality of surface waters. In the present study, a number of biotic indices based on benthic macroinvertebrates have been applied in assessing the water quality of a mountainous stream (Pelion, Central Greece). Samplings were done in summer and autumn 2012 in two sampling sites (Karamani, Servanates) using two sampling methods: (a) a standard pond net and (b) the Surber method. Invertebrate identification was performed to the family level. The Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) score, the Average Score Per Taxa (ASPT), the Lincoln Quality Index, as well as the Iberian BMWP, and the Iberian ASPT were applied to the benthic macroinvertebrate samples to assess the water quality of each site. According to ASPT, IASPT and LQI, the biological water quality of both sampling sites was very good, regardless of the season and the sampling method used, with the exceptions of the summer samplings in Servanates with both sampling methods, and in Karamani with Surber, for which a good water quality was assessed with LQI and IASPT, respectively. In contrast, the BMWP and IBMWP scores for the sampling site Servanates were low, corresponding to fair water quality, but this effect was attributed to the particular hydrological conditions of this site. The sampling method did not significantly affect the sampling efficiency and, consequently, the results of the water quality evaluation.

AB  - Animal movements, residence times, and subsequently foraging strategies, should vary with habitat quality. We used acoustic and satellite telemetry, as well as stable isotopes, to look at movement patterns, macro-scale habitat use, and trophic ecology of blacktip reef sharks, Carcharhinus melanopterus, between two lagoons (eastern and western) at Palmyra Atoll, a US National Wildlife Refuge in the central Pacific. Sharks in the Palmyra lagoons have relatively small home ranges and appear to obtain most of their energy from the lagoon ecosystem. Sharks showed low levels of migration between lagoons over periods of several years, and individuals in the larger western lagoon tended to have longer residence times than those in the smaller eastern lagoon. Furthermore, for sharks in the western lagoon, there was no relationship between total length (TL) and delta N-15, C-13 relative isotope concentrations, or a Body Condition index (BC). For sharks in the eastern lagoon, TL was positively related to delta N-15 and negatively related to delta C-13 and BC. These results suggest that there are low levels of mixing of sharks between lagoons, and these are leading to differences in trophic ecology and potentially foraging success. Although the causative factors behind these differences are unknown, shark home range location can potentially lead to variation in trophic ecology, even over small spatial scales.

AB  - This study examined the influence of increasing temperatures in spring and summer on biochemical biomarkers in Mytilus galloprovincialis mussels sampled from Bizerte lagoon (northern Tunisia). Spatial and seasonal variations in a battery of seven biomarkers were analyzed in relation to environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, and pH), physiological status (condition and gonad indexes), stress on stress (SoS), and chemical contaminant levels (heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and PCBs) in digestive glands. Integrated biological response (IBR) was calculated using seven biomarkers (acetylcholinesterase (AChE), benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase (BPH), multixenobiotic resistance (MXR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and metallothioneins (MT). Seasonal variations in biological response were determined during a critical period between spring and summer at two sites, where chemical contamination varies by a factor of 2 for heavy metals and a factor 2.5 for PAHs. The analysis of a battery of biomarkers was combined with the measurement of physiological parameters at both sites, in order to quantify a maximum range of metabolic regulation with a temperature increase of 11 A degrees C between May and August. According to our results, the MT, MDA, CAT, and AChE biomarkers showed the highest amplitude during the 11 A degrees C rise, while the BPH, GST, and MXR biomarkers showed the lowest amplitude. Metabolic amplitude measured with the IBR at Menzel Abdelrahmen-the most severely contaminated station-revealed the highest metabolic stress in Bizerte lagoon in August, when temperatures were highest 29.1 A degrees C. This high metabolic rate was quantified for each biomarker in the North African lagoon area and confirmed in August, when the highest IBR index values were obtained at the least contaminated site 2 (IBR = 9.6) and the most contaminated site 1 (IBR = 19.6). The combined effects of chemical contamination and increased salinity and temperatures in summer appear to induce a highest metabolic adaptation response and can therefore be used to determine thresholds of effectiveness and facilitate the interpretation of monitoring biomarkers. This approach, applied during substantial temperature increases at two sites with differing chemical contamination, is a first step toward determining an environmental assessment criteria (EAC) threshold in a North African lagoon.

AB  - As environmental issues have become increasingly important in economic research and policy for sustainable development, firms in the private sector have introduced environmental and social issues in conducting their business activities. Such behaviour is tracked by the Dow Jones Sustainable Indexes (DJSI) through financial market indexes that are derived from the Dow Jones Global Indexes. The sustainability activities of firms are assessed using criteria in three areas, namely economic, environmental and social. Risk (or uncertainty) is analysed empirically through the use of conditional volatility models of investment in sustainability-driven firms that are selected through the DJSI. The empirical analysis is based on financial econometric models to determine the underlying conditional volatility, with the estimates showing that there is strong evidence of volatility clustering, short and long run persistence of shocks to the index returns, and asymmetric leverage between positive and negative shocks to returns.

AB  - Background and Aims In Australia, grapevine varieties are tested for viruses by woody indexing (WI) in combination with other procedures during post-entry quarantine and prior to their introduction into the nucleus collections of high health certification programs. The aim of this study was to determine the reliability and accuracy of WI for virus detection in different climatic conditions. Methods and Results Replicated experiments were conducted in a hot climate, a cool climate and a screenhouse. Indicator plants were inoculated with Grapevine virus A, Grapevine virus B, Grapevine fleck virus, Grapevine leafroll-associated virus (GLRaV) 1, GLRaV-2, GLRaV-3, GLRaV-9 and Rupestris stem pitting-associated virus. Indicators were observed during three years for characteristic symptom development and tested for viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Virus transmission was not always successful. Symptoms were not always observed in each year at each trial site even if viruses could be detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Conclusions WI reliability was affected by the success of bud-take, transmission of the virus from the candidate bud to the indicator and different climatic conditions. It is recommended that WI be carried out for a minimum of three years in the field. Significance of the Study Understanding the effect of different climatic conditions on WI will improve the reliability of grapevine virus detection in Australia.

AB  - A new approach to recruitment overfishing diagnosis is presented. We hypothesize that condition of recruits should increase when recruitment failures are caused by fishing activity. This would be a consequence of the increase in trophic resource availability, because the population is smaller than that which the ecosystem could support. Temporal series of hake recruit condition were calculated from MEDITS survey data collected in Mediterranean geographical sub-areas (GSAs) 1, 6. 17 and 19 from 1994 to 2015. Multiple linear regressions were used to analyse the relationship between mean annual condition and abundance of recruits and climatic indices in each GSA. Significant correlations were only detected in GSA 6, where 69% of condition variability was explained by the negative correlation with recruit abundance, and with two climatic indices, the Western Mediterranean Oscillation and the standardized air temperature anomaly at surface from the Gulf of Lions. Despite the differences in recruit abundance among GSAs, their mean annual condition oscillated around the same basal value during most of the time series, pointing to density-dependent mortality rates as an important mechanism stabilizing hake recruitment to levels close to the carrying capacity when populations do not suffer recruitment overfishing. This pattern changed when the decreasing recruit abundance trend drove GSA 6 condition values persistently above those of the rest of the GSAs. According to our hypothesis. hake in GSA 6 is in recruitment overfishing.

AB  - Six feeding groups of 60 early juveniles (0.6 g) of a rheophilic cyprinid barbel Barbus barbus were reared in triplicate in 18 glass aquaria. Fish fed a commercial formulated dry diet Aller Futura were compared with those on natural food-commercially available frozen Chironomidae larvae at 17, 21 and 25 degrees C. Daily food rations were adjusted according to fish biomass, differences in hydration between the two diets, and rearing temperature. No mortality occurred during experiment. Temperature, and especially diet, both affected whole body proximate and mineral composition of B. barbus juveniles. Under conditions of this experiment the formulated diet Aller Futura seems to satisfy the demands for calcium and magnesium, while an elevated lipid content in this diet was found and marginally deficient phosphorus content can be concluded. These resulted in a depressed content of phosphorus and total minerals in the body, and in elevated lipid content and condition coefficient in the Futura-fed fish, but no visible body deformities occurred. Advantages and limitations of the condition coefficient K were discussed. This is a non-destructive, express indicator that can be used as a supplementary tool for estimation of changes in body proximate composition in fish juveniles of similar size within a population.

AB  - Woody plant demographics provide important insight into ecosystem state-shifts in response to changing fire regimes. In Australian tropical savannas, the switch from patchy landscape burning by Aborigines to unmanaged wildfires within the past century has been implicated in biodiversity declines including the fire-sensitive conifer, Callitris intratropica. C. intratropica commonly forms small, closed-canopy groves that exclude fire and allow recruitment of conspecifics and other fire-sensitive woody plants. C. intratropica groves provide a useful indicator of heterogeneity and fire regime change, but the mechanisms driving the species' persistence and decline remain poorly understood. We examined the hypothesis that C. intratropica population stability depends upon a regime of frequent, low-intensity fires maintained by Aboriginal management. We combined integral projection models of C. intratropica population behaviour with an environmental state change matrix to examine how vital rates, grove dynamics and the frequency of high- and low-intensity fires contribute to population stability. Closed-canopy C. intratropica groves contributed disproportionately to population growth by promoting recruitment, whereas singleton trees accounted for a larger proportion of adult mortality. Our patch-based population model predicted population declines under current fire frequencies and that the recruitment of new groves plays a critical role in the species' persistence. Our results also indicated that reducing fire intensity, a key outcome of Aboriginal burning, leads to C. intratropica population persistence even at high fire frequencies. These findings provide insight into the relationship between ecosystem composition and human-fire interactions and the role of fire management in sustaining the mosaics that comprise 'natural' systems.

AB  - Although long-term agricultural activity frequently decreases biodiversity, it remains unclear whether such biodiversity losses are readily reversible. There is no doubt that the important ecological function of seed bank is ecological memory, but few researchers have explored the role of seed banks in grassland ecosystem resilience and threshold theory. We used a space-for-time subrogation method, i.e., a natural meadow (never farmed but used for moderate gazing) and meadows farmed for 30 yr and then abandoned for 1, 10, and 20 yr, to determine if the biodiversity/ecosystem of subalpine meadows could be reversed to the natural vegetation state and to investigate the role of soil seed banks in grassland ecosystem restoration and resilience. After 20 yr of natural regeneration, aboveground vegetation composition and properties had recovered to the natural meadow state, suggesting that critical thresholds were not crossed. Seed bank composition and structure exhibited almost no change after agricultural disturbance for decades. The persistent seed bank had the highest contribution to vegetation regeneration in the 1-yr abandoned field, which had the highest seed density. Similarity between the seed bank and aboveground vegetation and seed density decreased with years since abandonment. Since the seed bank still reflected the desired state, the system had inherent resilience and had not have crossed the transition threshold. Thus, high-diversity persistent seed banks are an important indicator of high resilience of this ecosystem. High similarity between the seed bank and vegetation in early-abandoned fields may indicate that ecological resilience is triggered and be a warning signal that interventions are needed to avoid a state transition. In applying alternative stable state theory to ecological restoration, much attention should be given to the soil seed bank.

AB  - Changes in the amounts and proportions of leukocytes, known as leucocyte profiles, have been documented for several bird species and have been used to measure stress levels in these animals. The present work ascertained the biological and ecological attributes that influence the leukocyte profile of Antilophia galeata (Lichtenstein, 1823), the helmeted manakin. This species has been deemed useful in ecological studies because it responds to environmental changes. Blood samples drawn from 89 individuals of A. galeata captured in a Cerrado forest fragment were subjected to analysis under optical microscopy to identify and quantify leukocytes and micronuclei. The number of lymphocytes was greater for males, non-reproductive individuals and individuals infected with ticks. None of the leukocyte components differed in relation to age, molting or body condition index. The amount of micronuclei was correlated with values for total leukocytes, H/L ratio, heterophils, basophils and monocytes. The results suggest that reproduction may be an immunosuppressive factor for the species, producing sexual differences in lymphocyte availability. In addition, biomarkers of genotoxic damage (micronuclei) were related to the amount of leukocytes, indicating that individuals may be sensitive to environmental disturbances. Leukocyte profiles can be considered a useful tool for addressing ecological questions that are relevant to the conservation of species in degraded environments.

AB  - The use of effective methods for large-area drought monitoring is an important issue; hence, there have been many attempts to solve this problem. In this study, the Drought Information Satellite System (DISS) index is presented, based on the synergistic use of meteorological data and information derived from satellite images. The index allows us to monitor drought phenomena in various climatic and environmental conditions. The approach utilizes two indices for constructing a drought index: (1) the hydrothermal coefficient (HTC), which characterizes meteorological conditions across the study area over a long-term period; and (2) the temperature condition index (TCI) derived from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, which refers instantaneous land surface temperature (LST) to long-term extreme values. The model for drought assessment based on the DISS index was applied for generating drought index maps for Poland for the 2001-2019 vegetation seasons. The performance of the index was verified through comparison of the extent of agricultural drought to the reduction in cereal and maize yield. Analysis of variance revealed a significant relationship between the area of drought determined by the drought index and the decrease in cereal yield due to unfavorable growth conditions. The presented study proves that the proposed drought index can be an effective tool for large-area drought monitoring under variable environmental conditions.

AB  - Ecological impacts of vehicle traffic are a significant environmental management issue on many sandy shores. Impacts usually focus on lethal effects of vehicles to organisms, but sub-lethal effects which could reduce the fitness of macrofauna populations are equally possible but unknown. Consequently, we measured changes in body condition and burrowing performance of the beach clam Donax deltoides subjected to vehicle traffic on sandy shores in eastern Australia, Body mass index of clams on beaches open to traffic was 16% lower, but gonadosomatic index and relative valve thickness were not consistently linked to vehicle access to beaches. By contrast, off-road vehicles significantly impaired the burrowing performance of clams. After experimental exposure to ORV traffic (30 passes) and dislodgement from the sediment, the time taken for clams to re-bury into the sand doubled irrespective of the vehicle weight used. Because burrowing is such a critical function in the behavioural repertoire of sandy beach animals, the traffic-induced changes to organisms' performance found in this study may increase mortality by causing displacement to less favourable habitats by swash, and by intensifying the risk of predation and desiccation. When assessing the ecological impacts of vehicles on beach fauna, it is thus important to consider both lethal and sub-lethal effects. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study has been carried out to determine the presence and distribution of total heterotrophic bacteria (THB), coliform bacteria (CB), faecal coliform bacteria (FCB) and Escherichia coli bacteria inhabiting different running waters of Meric-Ergene River Basin in Turkey. The highest number of THB bacteria in water body was found in August at a site located in the Ergene River, and the lowest in December at a site located in the Meric (Maritsa, Evros) River. The highest number of THB in sediment was found in February at a site located in the Ergene River, and the lowest in July at a site located in the Meric River. Some physicochemical measurements have been done at the same time as the bacterial sampling to determine environmental conditions of the ecosystems. According to Spearman's correlation index, some environmental conditions were found to have a remarkable correlation with bacterial distribution (p<0.05). This research concluded that pollution load significantly increased bacteria count and played an important role in variation of bacterial quality of the rivers.

AB  - Environmentally benign, economically viable, and socially acceptable agronomic strategies are needed to launch a sustainable lignocellulosic biofuel industry. Our objective was to demonstrate a landscape planning process that can ensure adequate supplies of corn (Zea mays L.) stover feedstock while protecting and improving soil quality. The Landscape Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF) was used to develop land use strategies that were then scaled up for five U.S. Corn Belt states (Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota) to illustrate the impact that could be achieved. Our results show an annual sustainable stover supply of 194 million Mg without exceeding soil erosion T values or depleting soil organic carbon [i.e., soil conditioning index (SCI) > 0] when no-till, winter cover crop, and vegetative barriers were incorporated into the landscape. A second, more rigorous conservation target was set to enhance soil quality while sustainably harvesting stover. By requiring erosion to be < 1/2 T and the SCI-organic matter (OM) subfactor to be > 0, the annual sustainable quantity of harvestable stover dropped to148 million Mg. Examining removal rates by state and soil resource showed that soil capability class and slope generally determined the effectiveness of the three conservation practices and the resulting sustainable harvest rate. This emphasizes that sustainable biomass harvest must be based on subfield management decisions to ensure soil resources are conserved or enhanced, while providing sufficient biomass feedstock to support the economic growth of bioenergy enterprises.

AB  - The bioavailability of Cd, Cu and Zn from a metal-contaminated sediment was studied using Mytilus galloprovincialis embryos and larvae exposed to sediment elutriates, The elutriate concentrations tested were always lower than the threshold at which abnormal larval development appears. The Cd, Cu and Zn contents of the sediment, of the elutriate and of the larvae, as well as the larval growth, the condition index (CI), and the induction of metallothionein (NIT) in the larvae were measured. The Cl was only affected after 96 h of exposure, principally at the highest elutriate concentration (25%, corresponding to 0.1435 mug Cd l(-1) and 14 mug Zn l(-1)). Cd, Cu and Zn bioaccumulation was observed (48 and 96 h), in whole larvae as well as in the cytosolic fraction of their tissues, For the individual treatments (controls or different degrees of exposure), the lowest metal concentrations were observed in larvae after 96 h exposure, indicating biological dilution. Metallothionein induction in larvae was observed after 96 h exposure at the lowest elutriate concentrations tested, and was always strongly correlated with increasing metal contents in the cytosolic fraction, These relationships were significant for all 3 metals studied either individually or combined. The results indicate that these 3 metals are bioavailable to M galloprovincialis larvae and that NIT induction constitutes a more sensitive indicator of heavy metal pollution than embryotoxicity or larval growth experiments.

AB  - Although the false mussel Mytilopsis sallei Recluz, 1849 is recognised as an aggressive invasive species, its populations in several estuaries in Thailand are restricted to small areas. A salinity gradient is a major characteristic of its habitat, hence the effect of various salinity levels (0-40 ppt) on the mortality of larvae, juveniles and adults of M. sallei was investigated. Condition Indices of adults reared at different salinity levels for two months were measured. Spatial and temporal variations of salinity and false mussel abundance in a canal with a salinity gradient were also monitored. After an acute (48 h) test, survival of larvae was highest at salinity levels of 12.5 and 16.25 ppt and decreased at lower and higher levels. Juveniles survived at all salinity levels, but most adults died in the first 24 h at a salinity of 40 ppt, while condition indices were lowest at salinity levels of 30 and 35 ppt. In the field survey, highest false mussel abundance was consistently found at the middle part of the canal with mid-range salinity. The results suggested that salinity is a determinant of survival in M. sallei larvae and potentially regulates the dispersal success of false mussels. However, the importance of salinity was marginal in the later stages of its life history.

AB  - Freshwater mussels Anodonta anatina and Pseudanodonta complanata were exposed to (C-14)-pentachlorophenol. The wet weight based bioconcentration factor(BCF = activity in animal per activity in water) at steady state varied from 80 to 120 for A. anatina and from 61 to 85 for P. complanata. The species did not differ significantly in their wet weight or lipid based BCFs but dry weight based values were significantly higher (40-50%) for A. anatina.
   The soft tissue dry weight and dry weight based condition index of A, anatina (Cl-4=soft tissue dry weight per shell length) differed significantly between natural mussel populations. In animals kept from 4 to 8 months in laboratory conditions, the soft tissue dry weight and glycogen content decreased more rapidly when mussels were maintained at 15 than at 5 degrees C. However, glycogen content in the digestive gland or adductor muscle did not differ in mussels maintained in the laboratory (5 degrees C) when compared to the natural population. The adductor muscle protein content differed between laboratory maintained animals and the natural population in Lake Hoytiainen but there was no difference in the soft tissue lipid content.
   Trace metal concentrations and calcium in the soft tissue were in general higher in laboratory maintained mussels. In addition, laboratory maintenance affected the reproductive cycle of A. anatina.

AB  - The eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica provides a number of ecosystem services and is an important commercial fishery species along the US East and Gulf Coasts. Oyster populations have declined dramatically due to overharvesting, habitat loss, and disease. As restoration efforts and aquaculture of oysters continue to increase throughout their range, it is important to consider the impacts of a number of potential oyster pests, including the boring sponge Cliona spp. and the pea crab Zaops (Pinnotheres) ostreum, on oyster populations. Both of these have been demonstrated to reduce oyster growth, condition, and in some instances, reproductive output. Boring sponges in particular are a major concern for oyster growers and managers. Our monitoring efforts have suggested that pea crabs might be more prevalent in sponge-infested oysters; we therefore conducted an observational study to determine if there was any relationship between pea crab prevalence and sponge presence, and to examine whether the presence of both pests had synergistic effects on oyster condition. At 2 very different sample sites, North Carolina and New Jersey, oysters with 1 pest (i.e. boring sponge) were significantly more likely to have the second pest (i.e. pea crab) than the background population. Furthermore, sponge presence negatively affected oyster condition in North Carolina only, while pea crabs significantly reduced condition at both locations. When sponges and pea crabs were present together, the effects on oyster condition were additive. This study provides further evidence that interactions between an individual and a fouling/pest organism can alter oyster susceptibility to other parasites.

AB  - Tawera elliptica is a small size (baby) clam with an export fishery in southern Chile. The species is dioecious with external fertilization and without sexual dimorphism. The aim of this work was to optimize broodstock conditioning, induce spawning and describe embryonic development until the early larval stage in a hatchery. Broodstock were conditioned at 3 treatments (with/without sand; water circulation) for 48 days. The clams were fed with a mixed diet of macroalgae, with a daily ration of 250,000 cells/ml. Broodstock response was quantified using condition index and gonad development stages (histological techniques). For spawning induction, physical and biological methods were tested. The best response was achieved in males with physical induction. Histological analysis showed that the water circulation system treatment exhibited the highest percentage of maximum maturity. A fertilization ratio of 500:1 sperm:oocyte was used. The incubation was carried out in 3-L containers with filtered seawater at 10.7 +/- 0.9 degrees C without aeration. Observations, measurements and the duration of each embryonic and larval stage were recorded. The oocyte has a prominent gelatinous layer (= jelly coat) that disappears between the gastrula and trochophore stages. The status of the D-larval stage was reached at 107 h post fertilization with a mean valve length of 91.4 +/- 8.9 mu m. This is the first record of the complete embryonic development of this baby clam until the early larval stage and the conditioning in a water circulation system for 48 days are suitable for the species.

AB  - The present study was designed to compare the response to contaminants in diploid with triploid specimens of the oyster Crassostrea gigas. The reproduction investment in bivalve molluscs has priority on somatic growth. Thus, genetic sterilization by triploidy induction enables the energy flux to be directed toward somatic growth and glucide storage. Bioaccumulation was examined for Ag (10 mug/L), Cd (10 mug/L), and Cu (30 mug/L) to determine if the response to metals follows similar patterns in diploid (2n) and triploid (3n) groups. The effect of ploidy was also evaluated as a function of dry weight of soft tissue and condition index. Moreover, the reciprocal influence of these metals on their incorporation was studied. The results showed that the major factor governing the degree of metal bioaccumulation by oysters is the nature of the metal introduced in the experimental medium. Thus, the uptake of Cd is proportionally more important than in the case of Ag and even more in Cu. For Cu-treated samples, the influence of ploidy on weight and metal body burden (and Cu concentration) was not significant, whereas for Ag and Cd, significant differences according to genetic type were evidenced by higher tissue weight and lower concentrations in triploid than diploid specimens. Metal-metal interactions study especially showed a reciprocal antagonism between Ag and Cu.

AB  - The lower Cambrian sediments including the Qiongzhusi and Maidiping formations in the Sichuan Basin are generally considered as the main source rocks of Precambrian-Cambrian petroleum system. A comprehensive study integrated with multiple geochemical methods was conducted on 119 lower Cambrian drillcore samples collected from the upper Yangtze Platform. The results show that the fluctuation of sea level and climate during the deposition of the Qiongzhusi and Maidiping formations act as the critical factors controlling the watermass conditions and thus OM accumulation. During the deposition of upper Maidiping Formation (epsilon(1)m), the paleo-climate was arid and sea level was relatively low in the study area. The depositional environment indexes (U-EF-Mo-EF, gammacerane index, beta-camtane and V-EF) suggested that the upper epsilon(1)m was deposited in a strong restricted marine setting with high water salinity and anoxic water conditions in Ziyang-Weiyuan area. However, during the early Qiongzhusi Formation period, the paleoclimate became humid and sea level rose in the study area. High paleoproductiviy caused by high concentrations of nutrients brought by seawater and freshwater plays an important role in OM accumulation in the basal part of the Qiongzhusi Formation (epsilon(1)q). Furthermore, the model of paleopmductivity promotion caused by the coordinated control of climate and extensive transgression in the lower part of Gig may also be applicable to interpret the origin of high organic carbon abundance in the strata deposited in the same period with the epsilon(1)q (such as Shiyantou, Shuijingtuo and Niutitang formations) in other parts of the upper Yangtze Platform.

AB  - The aim of the present work is to broaden our knowledge on the variability of trace metals in mussel tissues, focusing on seasonal fluctuations in the three different sampling sites of Algerian west coast (Oran Harbor (Si), Ain Defla (S2) and Hadjaj (S3)). For this purpose, the bioavailability (metal indices) and bioaccumulation (metal concentrations in soft tissues) of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd), and the physiological characteristics (e.g. biological indices such as condition index (CI)) of mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis have been assessed and related to seasons and sites. In Si, the highest levels of metal concentrations and indices were obtained in mussels sampled in winter for Zn, Cu and Cd, but in summer for Pb. The biological indices significantly decreased in winter. In S2, the levels of concentrations and indices of all metals varied whatever the seasons, excepting in summer where the values were the lowest. In summer and spring, the biological indices were lower than in autumn and winter. The low growth of organisms in spring and summer might be correlated to the reproductive period and the low trophic level known in S2. S3, considered as a "pristine" area, showed low metal concentrations and indices, and high biological indices, reflecting the favorable physiological conditions for the mussel growth. This approach might be used in the monitoring of the quality of coastal waters and the present work provided a useful data set for Mediterranean monitoring network.

AB  - Most microplastics are expected to sink and end up in marine sediments. However, very little is known concerning their potential impact on sediment-dwelling organisms. We studied the long-term impact of microplastic exposure on two sediment-dwelling bivalve species. Ennucula tenuis and Abra nitida were exposed to polyethylene microparticles at three concentrations (1; 10 and 25 mg/kg of sediment) for four weeks. Three size classes (4-6; 20-25 and 125-500 mu m) were used to study the influence of size on microplastic ecotoxicity. Microplastic exposure did not affect survival, condition index or burrowing behaviour in either bivalve species. However, significant changes in energy reserves were observed. No changes were observed in protein, carbohydrate or lipid contents in E. tenuis, with the exception of a decrease in lipid content for one condition. However, total energy decreased in a dose-dependent manner for bivalves exposed to the largest particles. To the contrary, no significant changes in total energy were observed for A. nitida, although a significant decrease of protein content was observed for individuals exposed to the largest particles, at all concentrations. Concentration and particle size significantly influenced microplastic impacts on bivalves, the largest particles and higher concentrations leading to more severe effects. Several hypotheses are presented to explain the observed modulation of energy reserves, including the influence of microplastic size and concentration. Our results suggest that long-term exposure to microplastics at environmentally relevant concentrations can impact marine benthic biota. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Foraging disruption caused by human activities is emerging as a key issue in cetacean conservation because it can affect nutrient levels and the amount of energy available to individuals to invest into reproduction. Our ability to predict how anthropogenic stressors affect these ecological processes and ultimately population trajectory depends crucially on our understanding of the complex physiological mechanisms that detect nutrient availability and regulate energy metabolism, foraging behavior and life-history decisions. These physiological mechanisms are likely to differ considerably from terrestrial mammalian model systems. Here, we examine nucleotide substitution rates in cetacean and other artiodactyl genomes to identify signatures of selection in genes associated with nutrient sensing pathways. We also estimated the likely physiological consequences of adaptive amino acid substitutions for pathway functions. Our results highlight that genes involved in the insulin, mTOR and NF-kB pathways are subject to significant positive selection in cetaceans compared to terrestrial artiodactyla. These genes may have been positively selected to enable cetaceans to adapt to a glucose-poor diet, to overcome deleterious effects caused by hypoxia during diving (e.g. oxidative stress and inflammation) and to modify fat-depot signaling functions in a manner different to terrestrial mammals. We thus show that adaptation in cetaceans to an aquatic lifestyle significantly affected functions in nutrient sensing pathways. The use of fat stores as a condition index in cetaceans may be confounded by the multiple and critical roles fat has in regulating cetacean metabolism, foraging behavior and diving physiology.

AB  - Crassostrea gigas was introduced in Anegada Bay (North Patagonia, Argentina), in 1981 for aquaculture purposes. The species has, since established in the field, covered all available hard substrata in the bay and gradually expanded south along the coast of the neighboring province of Rio Negro, 90 km away from its original introduction site. Our work focused on the reproductive dynamics of the species at the introduction site, with emphasis on the thermal thresholds needed for each stage of gonad development. During early spring, the oysters in Anegada Bay go through active gonad proliferation. Maturity extends mainly from October to January. The first spawning occurs in November, when seawater temperature exceeds 17 degrees C, and peaks from December to February, when seawater temperature ties in the range of 19-21.5 degrees C. The timing of gonad development is size dependent. Larger (>= 70 mm) and medium-size oysters begin spawning first, whereas small oysters (<40 mm) represent the late spawners of the season. The C. gigas population in Anegada Bay is a clear and well-documented case of an introduction site where optimal environmental conditions are met, both for complete gonad maturation and for Successful larval survival and settlement. We compiled a series of C. gigas cases from different parts of the world in which reproduction is related to seawater temperature. We concluded that the thermal threshold for full female gonad ripening in this species is strict (temperature > 17 degrees C), and spawning only Occurs in those sites where this threshold is reached.

AB  - It is essential to maintain the health of forests so that they are protected against a diverse range of stressors and show improved resilience. An area-based forest health map is required for efficient forest management on a national scale however, most national forest inventories are based on in-situ observations. This study examined methodologies to establish an area-based map on tree vitality grade using field survey data, particularly that containing information on several trees at one point. The forest health monitoring dataset of the Republic of Korea was used in combination with 37 satellite-based environmental predictors. Four methods were considered: Multinomial logistic regression (MLR), random forest classification (RF), indicator kriging (IK), and multi-model ensemble (MME) approaches using species distribution models. The MLR and RF produced biased results, whereby almost all regions were classified as first grade; the spatialization results of these methods were considered inappropriate for forest management. The maps produced using the IK and MME methods improved the distinctions between the distributions of five grades compared to the previous two methodologies however, the MME method produced better results, reliably reflecting topographical and climatic characteristics. Comparisons with the vegetation condition index and bioclimate vulnerability index also emphasized the usefulness of the MME. This study is particularly relevant to the national forest managers who struggle to find the most effective forest monitoring and management strategies. Suggestions to improve spatialization of field survey data are further discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of selected biostimulators and foliar fertilizers on plant development, plant yield, soil fertility and soil biochemical activity (dehydrogenases, phosphatases, catalases) during the cultivation of pea (Pisum sativum L.). A field experiment was conducted between 2016 and 2018 at the Gorzyn Experimental and Educational Station, Poznan University of Life Sciences in Poland. The following treatments were tested: (1) control; (2) Titanit; (3) Optysil; (4) Metalosate potassium; (5) Rooter; (6) Bolero Mo; (7) Adob Zn IDHA; (8) Adob B and (9) Adob 2.0 Mo. Adob Zn IDHA stimulated yields, especially under average moisture conditions and less so in drought conditions, and the differences compared to control amounted 8.36 and 4.3%, respectively. The results showed a close relationship between the effects of the biostimulators and foliar fertilizers and weather conditions during the study. It was not possible to determine whether any of the biostimulators or foliar fertilizers had a positive effect on pea seed yield in any year. Similarly, it was difficult to clearly determine the effect of the biostimulators and fertilizers on biochemical activity in the soil, although soil enzyme activity was influenced most by application of the Bolero Mo fertilizer. In all study years, biological nitrogen fixation was always greater after the application of a biostimulator/fertilizer treatment.

AB  - Demand for data on the ecological condition of wetlands is increasing as state and federal management programs recognize its value in reporting on the ambient condition of the resource, targeting restoration and protection efforts. evaluating the effects of mitigation and restoration practices, supporting regulatory decisions, and tracking the impact of land use decisions. We developed an approach for generating a single measure of wetland condition from ecological variables used in hydrogeomorphic (HGM) assessment. An Index of Wetland Condition (IWC) was developed from HGM field data collected to assess freshwater, non-tidal flat, riverine, and depression wetlands in the Nanticoke River watershed. The HGM variables were screened and scored based on a range check, responsiveness, and metric redundancy, employing a method used to develop indices of biotic integrity. Weights of the individual variables were adjusted to reflect our understanding of wetland ecology and to include variables that represented the vegetation, hydrology, and buffer of a wetland. The final IWC score discriminated high, medium, and low site disturbance classes in flat and riverine wetlands and high and low disturbance classes in depressions, one-way ANOVA F-values ranged from 44.5 to 79.1 (all p <0.0001). The combination of the IWC and HGM assessments provides a comprehensive evaluation of the wetland resource. HGM produces information oil specific wetland functions. The IWC concisely conveys the ecological condition of the resource and maximizes the utility of the data collected in all HGM assessment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were used to trace specific sources of organic matter and the influence of these sources of carbon on the diet of the eastern oyster in the Greater Everglades. Oysters, as well as particulate organic matter (POM) and benthic microalgae (BMA) were sampled in three bays at three different stations from upstream to downstream during both wet and dry seasons. Significant salinity differences were observed in all estuaries between summer (wet) and winter (dry) seasons and were linked to freshwater inputs into the bays. Temperature followed a typical seasonal trend. Oysters were enriched in delta N-15 compared with POM and BMA, and similarly or slightly enriched in delta C-13 for both seasons. Lighter delta C-13 values in the upper stations in the estuaries suggest input of organic matter from terrestrial sources. Stable isotopes showed that oysters fed more on POM than on BMA. Condition index of oysters varied between stations and seasons in the three estuaries. Because the quality of organic matter consumed by oysters ultimately impacts the health of the oyster, changes in water quality and quantity of freshwater entering estuaries will have implications for future management of the habitat for this ecologically and economically important species.

AB  - Zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, were collected monthly from a copper-contaminated reservoir over a period of nearly 3 years. Copper concentrations in the organisms showed marked fluctuations reflecting changes in the water contamination. Bioconcentration patterns were influenced by the specific capacity of this sentinel organism to biologically integrate the continuously evolving water pollution; the sampling pattern, which inevitably introduced a certain subjectivity into monitoring results; and weight changes in the animals within the yearly cycle. Consequently, the successive monthly indications obtained with the zebra mussels provided a current biological assessment of a complex dynamic contamination situation. In a second experiment, caged mussels from three different populations were transferred for 3 months into the reservoir and sampled on six occasions. Mortality rates, attachment capacity, and a condition index revealed no substantial fitness disturbances in the transplanted organisms. Differences in dry weight throughout the experiment were attributable to the initial characteristics of each population. The influence of body mass on monitoring results was eliminated by replacing copper concentrations (mu g/g dry weight) with copper burdens (mu g/specimen). In terms of copper burdens, the three transplanted populations exhibited very similar metal patterns. Moderate quantitative differences between introduced and indigenous populations were interpreted as the result of physiological adaptation of the indigenous mussels to their contaminated environment. This study showed that the transfer technique with D. polymorpha is a useful tool for active biomonitoring programs.

AB  - Within Southern African biomes, droughts are recurrent with devastating impacts on ecological, economic, and human wellbeing. In this context, understanding the drought impact on vegetation is of extreme importance. However, information on drought impact on natural vegetation at the biome level is scanty and remains poorly understood. Most studies of drought impact on vegetation have largely focussed on crops. The few existing studies on natural vegetation are based on experiments and field measurements at individual tree level which are not representative of biomes. In this study, we mapped the spatial extent and severity of drought using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and then quantified the drought impact on Southern African biomes using the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) for the period 1998 to 2017. To compare drought impact across the biomes, we computed the percentage area of the biome with seasonal VCI <30. The drought trend for each biome was computed for each pixel using a linear regression model in R software using the seasonal VCI images from 1998 to 2017. Our result showed that extreme drought impact on vegetation was mainly confined to the southwestern biomes (i.e. the Nama karoo and desert biomes) with most drought occurring during the first half of the season. We also observed an increasing trend of VCI (1998 to 2017) across all biomes and this increasing VCI trend might be explained by woody encroachment which is prevalent in the Savannah and Grassland biomes. The results of this study provide baseline information on drought hotspots.

AB  - The possibility of using the natural biofiltration power of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis, 0.37 +/- 0.08 g ind(-1) dry weight) to dampen the potential detrimental effect of phytoplankton blooms on juvenile farmed sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) was tested in a fish farm during a 35-day mesocosm experiment. Mussel effective clearance rates averaged 41.15 +/- 14.19 m(3) h(-1) and led to a 6.3-13.1-fold reduction of the phytoplankton abundance as well as comparable decreases in chlorophyll a and turbidity. This improvement in seawater quality significantly enhanced fish physiological performances: weight-based growth rates were significantly higher (2.87 +/- 0.43% d(-1)) compared to control exposed to non-filtered (bulk) seawater (2.55 +/- 0.44% d(-1)). The same observation holds for the Fulton condition index and the metabolic activity (RNA:DNA ratio). For fish reared in bulk seawater, diatoms embedded in gills (Rhizosolenia imbricata, Thalassiosira sp.) and mucus overproduction indicated a stress (i.e. mechanical damages) induced by phytoplankton exposure which, in turn, may have affected fish energy balance. The use of mussels as a satisfying mitigation tool reducing phytoplankton bloom impacts is discussed with regard to phytoplankton bloom magnitude and ashore marine fish farming in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - A seasonal monitoring of indigenous (Gaspe Bay, Carleton, Havre-St-Pierre, Magdalen Islands and Blanc-Sablon) and transplanted (Gaspe Bay, Carleton, Havre-St-Pierre) mussels from different farm sites of Eastern Quebec allowed us to study mussel physiology as a function of environmental factors. A positive influence of phytoplankton cell concentration and temperature on the reproductive cycle was discovered even if no significant relationship has been showed because of the fragmented pattern of gametogenesis. A decrease of digestive gland index (DGI) was observed during gametogenesis. Development of gametes needs much energy and its great influence on digestive gland weight prevented us to correlate mussel growth with environmental factors. A decrease of phagocytic activity was observed in each site in midsummer, concomitantly to the most active spawning period. A significant positive correlation was remarked between maturity index in males and phagocytosis. A decrease of phagocytic activity could then have a direct impact on mussel population since it occurred during high temperature period when mussels had to face spawning, bacterial developments and diseases. It appeared in our study that reproductive cycle is a key event in mussel physiology and important for mussel farmers to follow-up. In the near future, we intend to develop and validate reliable indicators of the reproductive cycle in cultured mussels. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using historical (1970) and more recent (1996) Lake Erie plankton and trophic status data, we developed a Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) to measure changes in lake ecosystem health. We used discriminant analysis to determine phytoplankton and zooplankton community characteristics (metrics) that distinguished among levels of impairment. Traditional measures of lake trophic status classes (i.e., oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic), such as chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentrations, were used to classify sites on a gradient of impairment. We then judged the ability of plankton metrics to distinguish among trophic status classes. Because of the temporal variability found in plankton communities, we conducted analyses on a monthly basis (May-September). For June, July and August we found five unique metrics that could distinguish among trophic status classes. The P-IBI showed an increase in water quality in Lake Erie between 1970 (<3 = eutrophic) and the mid-1990s (1996 and 1997) (34 = mesotrophic) (which reflected mean ( standard error) total phosphorus concentrations (mu g/L) 1970 > 1996; western basin (41.53 +/- 2.68 > 29.75 +/- 1.39), eastern basin (14.84 +/- 0.82 > 7.74 +/- 0.28) and mean ( standard error) chlorophyll a concentrations (mu g/L) uncorrected for pheophytin 1970 > 1996; western basin (12.58 +/- 1.82 > 5.40 +/- 0.22), central basin (5.90 +/- 0.36 > 3.17 +/- 0.54), and eastern basin (5.17 +/- 0.38 > 1.67 +/- 0.18)), with declining water quality in the late 1990s (1998 and 1999) (similar to 3) and 2002 (<3). We recommend that the techniques used in creating the P-IBI be investigated for determining ecosystem health of other lakes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Caloosahatchee Estuary has been exhibiting signs of impaired ecological health due to the extensive hydrological alteration, agricultural land use, and increasing watershed development. This project investigated the responses of the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica at five locations in the Caloosahatchee River in relation to salinity changes, levels of heavy metals, pesticides, and PCBs in the water as well as in the oyster tissue. Individual heavy metal and organochlorine pesticide concentrations in oysters varied significantly between sampling locations and sampling months. PCB concentrations in oyster tissues were below detection limits as were the metal, pesticide and PCB concentrations in water at all the sampling locations. Both heavy metal and pesticide concentrations decreased with increasing distance downstream indicating upstream source of contaminants. The highly pathogenic oyster parasite Perkinsus marinus infection intensity (level) and prevalence (% infected oysters), condition index, spat recruitment, and gonadal index showed a seasonal trend varying with spawning activity and increased downstream. However, juvenile oyster growth was higher at upstream estuarine locations. Oyster responses varied more with seasonal programming (salinity), rather than due to contaminant levels. While significant correlations were noted between some oyster responses and metal concentrations in oyster tissues, overall metal concentrations were low compared to national averages. It appears that oyster health in the Caloosahatchee River is influenced more by freshwater inflow and resulting salinity fluctuations, rather than due to the measured contaminants.

AB  - Changes in the energy budget of the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin) due to metabolic alterations induced by Boonea impressa (Say) parasitism were analyzed using physiological and static measurements. Results showed that past parasitism by B. impressa caused no significant longterm metabolic stress to oysters during periods of high food availability. B. impressa did not have a significant negative impact on oyster net production, clearance rate, respiration rate, ammonia excretion rate, gamete production, Perkinsus marinus infection intensity, nor condition index during the parasitism experiment. Shell deposition rates were significantly (p < 0.01) reduced in oysters that had previously been parasitized by B. impressa. However, these same oysters had a significantly (p < 0.01) greater net production rate (J h-1) after parasitism. Data presented here support the premise that available energy, particulate inorganic and particulate organic matter can ultimately determine the ecological significance of B. impressa parasitism in oysters. Although previous studies have indicated that ecto-parasitism can be highly deleterious to oyster populations that are at or near limiting seston concentrations, no evidence was found in this study to suggest that significant decreases in shell deposition rates in oysters that had previously been highly parasitized by B. impressa were correlated with decreases in net production. In contrast, our results support the hypothesis that decreases in shell deposition rates are attributed more to physical hindrance and shell breakage rather than to diversions of energy already assimilated by C. virginica.

AB  - I developed a fish-based index of biotic integrity (IBI) to assess environmental quality in intermittent headwater streams in Wisconsin, USA. Backpack electrofishing and habitat surveys were conducted four times on 102 small (watershed area 1.7-41.5 km(2)), cool or warmwater (maximum daily mean water temperature >= 22 C), headwater streams in spring and late summer/fall 2000 and 2001. Despite seasonal and annual changes in stream flow and habitat volume, there were few significant temporal trends in fish attributes. Analysis of 36 least-impacted streams indicated that fish were too scarce to calculate an IBI at stations with watershed areas less than 4 km(2) or at stations with watershed areas from 4-10 km(2) if stream gradient exceeded 10 m/km (1% slope). For streams with sufficient fish, potential fish attributes (metrics) were not related to watershed size or gradient. Seven metrics distinguished among streams with low, agricultural, and urban human impacts: numbers of native, minnow (Cyprinidae), headwater-specialist, and intolerant (to environmental degradation) species; catches of all fish excluding species tolerant of environmental degradation and of brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) per 100 m stream length; and percentage of total individuals with deformities, eroded fins, lesions, or tumors. These metrics were used in the final IBI, which ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The IBI accurately assessed the environmental quality of 16 randomly chosen streams not used in index development. Temporal variation in IBI scores in the absence of changes in environmental quality was not related to season, year, or type of human impact and was similar in magnitude to variation reported for other IBI's.

AB  - 1.Bioindicators of habitat quality and environmental change must be identified quantitatively and tested independently to confirm their usefulness. We used the indicator value (IndVal ) method, which combines measures of habitat fidelity and specificity, to assess the indicator responses of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) in Tembe Elephant Park, South Africa. The indicator responses were verified by sampling in different areas of the Park, 2 years after the responses were originally quantified.
   2. We postulated that terrestrial insect indicators with different combinations of habitat specificity and fidelity might fulfil different indicator roles. Indicator species with strong habitat specificity (characteristic species) are unlikely to provide information on the direction of ecological change despite high vulnerability. Rather, detector species that span a range of ecological states are likely to be better in this role. We used IndVal for selecting such detector species that indicate the direction of ecological change.
   3. Sets of species were found to be robust bioindicators, i.e. reliably characteristic across the habitat of which they were indicative. The suite of indicators was refined by discarding those with IndVal s that varied significantly across years, thus improving the confidence in the final suite of species selected. By clearly responding to a change in habitat between two ecological states, detector species provided information complementary to that provided by characteristic species.
   4. The IndVal method enabled both the identification and testing of indicator (characteristic and detector) species. Because of its resilience to changes in abundance, IndVal is a particularly effective tool for ecological bioindication.
   5. We conclude that both characteristic and detector species are useful bioindicators of habitat quality and conversion. We propose that bioindicators that are categorized and verified in this way will have valuable application in the monitoring of habitat integrity.

AB  - Biological indicators of communities typically reflect a common environmental signal reflecting the general condition of the ecosystem, as well as individual signals by indicators differentially sensitive to particular environmental conditions. We describe here a method of integrating and interpreting such indicators from 19 New England lakes for five taxonomic groups (diatoms, benthos, zooplankton, fish, and birds). Our approach provides a systematic standardized way to integrate multiple metrics from different taxonomic groups by addressing four elements crucial to analyzing data from multiple indicators: covariate control, re-scaling of data, standardizing the sign of responses, and dimensional reduction. We evaluated the biological metrics against individual environmental stressors and against multivariate physicochemical metrics characterizing general anthropogenic stress among the lakes. The method detected a response to variation in the gross environmental condition of the lakes that was correlated across taxa and metrics. In addition, a differential response to near shore conditions was demonstrated for fish. The success of the approach in this study lends support to its general application to ecological monitoring involving complex data sets.

AB  - An ecosystem-based approach to bivalve aquaculture management is a strategy for the integration of aquaculture within the wider ecosystem, including human aspects, in such a way that it promotes sustainable development, equity, and resilience of ecosystems. Given the linkage between social and ecological systems, marine regulators require an ecosystem-based decision framework that structures and integrates the relationships between these systems and facilitates communication of aquaculture-environment interactions and policy-related developments and decisions. The Drivers-Pressures-State Change-Impact-Response (DPSIR) management framework incorporates the connectivity between human and ecological issues and would permit available performance indicators to be identified and organized in a manner that facilitates different regulatory needs. Suitable performance indicators and modeling approaches, which are used to assess DPSIR framework components, are reviewed with a focus on the key environmental issues associated with bivalve farming. Indicator selection criteria are provided to facilitate constraining the number of indicators within the management framework. It is recommended that an ecosystem-based approach for bivalve aquaculture be based on a tiered indicator monitoring system that is structured on the principle that increased environmental risk requires increased monitoring effort. More than 1 threshold for each indicator would permit implementation of predetermined impact prevention and mitigation measures prior to reaching an unacceptable ecological state. We provide an example of a tiered monitoring program that would communicate knowledge to decision-makers on ecosystem State Change and Impact components of the DPSIR framework.

AB  - Legislation in US and Europe has been adopted to determine the ecological integrity of estuarine and coastal waters, including, as one of the most relevant elements, the benthic macroinvertebrate communities. It has been recommended that greater emphasis should be placed on evaluating the suitability of existing indices prior to developing new ones. This study compares two widely used measures of ecological integrity, the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) developed in USA and the European AZTI's Marine Biotic index (AMBI) and its multivariate extension, the M-AMBI. Specific objectives were to identify the frequency, magnitude, and nature of differences in assessment of Chesapeake Bay sites as 'degraded' or 'undegraded' by the indices. A dataset of 275 subtidal samples taken in 2003 from Chesapeake Bay were used in this comparison. Linear regression of B-IBI and AMBI, accounted for 24% of the variability; however, when evaluated by salinity regimes, the explained variability increased in polyhaline (38%), high mesohaline (38%), and low mesohaline (35%) habitats, remained similar in the tidal freshwater (25%), and decreased in oligohaline areas (17%). Using the M-AMBI, the explained variability increased to 43% for linear regression, and 54% for logarithmic regression. By salinity regime, the highest explained variability was found in high mesohaline and low polyhaline areas (53-63%), while the lowest explained variability was in the oligohaline and tidal freshwater areas (6-17%). The total disagreement between methods, in terms of degraded-undegraded classifications, was 28%, with high spatial levels of agreement. Our study suggests that different methodologies in assessing benthic quality can provide similar results even though these methods have been developed within different geographical areas.

AB  - The increase of non-native species in rivers is of great concern. To assess the potential impact of a species it is necessary to consider the ecological state of the receiving ecosystem and the biology of the potentially invasive species. In this work we characterize two populations of Gobio lozanoi Doadrio & Madeira, 2004 (bio-metric and demographic parameter) and the invasibility (as a function of habitat quality, competing species, food supply, etc.) of the two rivers that they inhabit. In addition, biomarkers of energy reserve level are analyzed to investigate their role in the invasiveness of the species. The results show differences in energy reserve levels and invasiveness between the two fish populations, and differences in the potential invasibility of the two tributaries. In the river with lower resistance to invasion, the G. lozanoi population is well-structured, and specimens have higher lipid values. On the contrary, in the river with better ecological status (and therefore greater resistance to invasion) we found lower lipid values, higher protein values and low juvenile survival rate. The lipid level is revealed as a good indicator of invasiveness in populations of alien species, under favorable conditions for invasion.

AB  - Relevance. Rare earth elements (REE) and parameters of the basic salt composition (BSC) are the indicators of the ecological state of river waters and they can be used for water subjects monitoring system.
   The aim of the research is a comprehensive study of the REE and BSC to identify the factors determining the anthropogenic load on the basins of the rivers of southern Primorye.
   Research methods. Concentration of major ions (Cl-, SO42-, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+)were analyzed by ion chromatography (Shimadzu LC-20A), and REF were studied by mass spectrometry with an inductively coupled plasma (Thermo Finnigan Element 2). pH was measured by potentiometric method, total alkalinity was analyzed by direct titration by Bruyevich method, and total mineralization (Sigma n) is the total concentration of major ions.
   Results. Seasonal hydrochemical study of the BSC of southern Primorye rivers showed that river water is low-mineralized, average annual En does not exceed 100-150 mg/I. The investigation detected the significant increase in a part of sulfate ions in rivers Knevichanka, Razdolnaya and Artemovka during the spring flood, which is associated with fuel combustion in winter season, and household sewage. Regional level of total concentration of dissolved REE in the studied surface water varies from 0,16 to 2,72 mg/l. REE interval fluctuations in the water of some rivers is from 0,20 to 0,56 mg/I. High concentration of rare earth elements and dissolved salts in surface water of Razdolnaya, Artemovka, Knevichanka and Shkotovka rivers is associated with anthropogenic load on the basins of these rivers.

AB  - Environmental conditions and xenobiotic exposure can be sources of stress to living organisms. Biological markers are measurable indicator of changes which may happen at any biological level and which can be considered an early warning signal of some biological or environmental state or condition. A structured field study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between three biomarker assays and the spatial and temporal variation of each biomarker in samples of Mytilus edulis. The three biomarkers were the neutral red retention assay, micronucleus assay and comet assay, which indicate damage at different cellular/molecular levels. Three sites in Poole Harbour, an area on the South coast of the UK were sampled on six separate occasions at least three weeks apart. The results for the comet assay showed a significant difference between sites and between sampling dates whereas the results for the other two assays did not show a significant difference for either factor. There was no significant correlation between the results of any pair of the three biomarkers. The results of the micronucleus assay showed a significant correlation with water temperature. This temperature effect, as well as induced repair, may contribute to explain the lack of a strict correspondence between pollution gradients and biomarkers responses.

The character of Willis distribution (species distribution over the number of genera) and the genera-averaged index showed that the reservoir alga-flora is at the stage of saturation. Depending on the season and the year, the trophic status of the reservoir varied from a median gradation, eutrophic category, to a very high gradation, hypertrophic category; the degree of blooming in alga development varied from 2nd initial to 4th intensive. Based on phytoplankton characteristics, water quality was estimated by the 3rd class, water was classified as satisfactorily clear, weakly polluted, and beta-mesosaprobic.

AB  - Heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Hg, and As), grain-size, pH, Eh, and total organic material (TOM and TN) of 59 surficial sediments of mud area from the inner continental shelf of the East China Sea have been analyzed. The relations of the heavy metals to sediment composition, pH, reduction/oxidation conditions and total organic materials were evaluated with multivariate statistics analysis, and the hydrodynamic conditions such as coastal current and Taiwan warm current are the other important controlling factors to the distribution of heavy metals. Sediment enrichment factors and potential ecological hazard index (E(RI)) were used to assess the heavy metals accumulation; the results indicate that moderate contamination of most heavy metals is prevalent, and the contamination level in the estuary is rather high, which is mainly from anthropogenic source. Compared with other areas in China, the contaminant level of the study area is moderate.

AB  - This paper outlines the derivation of spatially-based models for fish-based assessment of the ecological status of rivers in England and Wales. The analysis highlights the key steps in the approach to develop such tools. For each step a number of alternative approaches were tested, and for each approach the major limitations and problems identified. This development of a multi-metric index in England and Wales indicated that, whilst the approach does provide promising results for the future, at this stage index development is constrained by limited data for some parts of the analysis. These mainly relate to coping with the zoogeographical influence of species distribution in a descriptive river typology, the availability of data for variables that adequately predict reference fish community types for impacted sites and availability of sufficient sites at a range of ecological conditions with which to test metrics and build an index that can be used to support implementation of the European Union Water Framework Directive.

AB  - In this study, some biological characteristics of the Golden grey mullet from the Gulf of Gabes (central Mediterranean, Tunisia) were examined; in particular, the gonado somatic index (GSI), hepato somatic index (HSI), condition factor (K), length at first sexual maturity (TL50) and fecundity (volumetric method) were calculated. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) indicated that the spawning season of the Golden grey mullet extends from October to December. The monthly variation of the hepato-somatic index (HSI) indicates that L. aurata saves lipid reserves in the liver. The length at first sexual maturity (TL50) was determined to be 23.73, 23.84 and 23.79 cm TL for female, male and combined sexes, respectively. In this study, the sex-ratio was unbalanced, with females dominating among large sized individuals (TL > 24.0 cm). Absolute fecundity, with a mean value of 286564, varied from a minimum of 210400 eggs for age 4+ to a maximum of 533600 for age 7+.

AB  - A study was carried out to determine the activities of radionuclides (Cs-137,K-40,Ra-226,Bi-214,Pb-214, and(210)Pb) and the levels of biochemical components (lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins) in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) along the Algerian coast. The goal was to evaluate the effect of mussels' biological parameters on radionuclide concentrations, through two coastal water biomonitoring programs. The mussels were taken from three study areas on the Algerian coast: Kristel (Oran), Surcouf (Alger), and Collo (Skikda), for the passive biomonitoring program and transplanted from each study area into the control site of Surcouf. Biochemical components were determined by means of UV-visible colorimetric assays, while the activity concentrations of radionuclides were measured by gamma-ray spectrometry. The results showed that carbohydrates were the most abundant biochemical components (40-60%) compared with proteins (20-40%) and lipids (15-20%).Cs-137 activity concentrations were below the lower limit of detection (LOD) for all samples, while the high activities of(40)K are the result of its behavior as stabile potassium K which is extensively used in the metabolism of mussels reflects the conditional state of mussels.Pb-210 concentration reflects the conditional state of mussels (morphometric parameters and proteins content). The mussels' bioaccumulation capacity for radionuclides was found to be dependent on the growing site and the biomonitoring time period.

AB  - Measures of condition in fishes are often used to assess the general well`-being of fish populations since condition reflects the biotic and abiotic factors experienced by individuals over moderate time scales. Fish condition can also be used as an indicator of ecosystem suitability in the context of ecosystembased management. From an ecosystem perspective, evaluation of fish condition is best described over multiple spatiotemporal scales and in a multi`-species context. This study analyzed 14 yr (2002-2015) of fisheries-independent trawl survey data to evaluate trends in condition for 16 demersal fishes inhabiting Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the USA. Seasonal and spatial variability in condition were inferred from linear mixed`-effects models, while dynamic factor analysis (DFA) was used to reveal coherence among and drivers of annual trends in condition across all species and for 3 subgroups representing trophic guilds. Patterns of intra`-annual condition varied among species, likely reflecting life history strategies and physiological responses to seasonal environmental conditions, while spatial patterns showed improved condition for both coastal and oligohaline species with increasing distance from their source. Annual trends in condition showed remarkable coherence for all fishes and for species within each trophic guild, suggesting that factors influencing condition-based indicators of ecosystem suitability operate at the community level. Spring mean surface chl a concentration was included in the selected DFA model for nearly all groups (exception: benthivores) and was statistically significant for several species, indicating the importance of bottom`-up processes on bay-wide annual fish condition.

AB  - This research aims to study a novel approach for waste load allocation (WLA) to meet environmental, economical, and equity objectives, simultaneously. For this purpose, based on a simulation-optimization model developed for Haraz River in north of Iran, the waste loads are allocated according to discharge permit market. The non-dominated solutions are initially achieved through multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). Here, the violation of environmental standards based on dissolved oxygen (DO) versus biochemical oxidation demand (BOD) removal costs is minimized to find economical total maximum daily loads (TMDLs). This can save 41 % in total abatement costs in comparison with the conventional command and control policy. The BOD discharge permit market then increases the revenues to 45 %. This framework ensures that the environmental limits are fulfilled but the inequity index is rather high (about 4.65). For instance, the discharge permit buyer may not be satisfied about the equity of WLA. Consequently, it is recommended that a third party or institution should be in charge of reallocating the funds. It means that the polluters which gain benefits by unfair discharges should pay taxes (or funds) to compensate the losses of other polluters. This intends to reduce the costs below the required values of the lowest inequity index condition. These compensations of equitable fund allocation (EFA) may help to reduce the dissatisfactions and develop WLA policies. It is concluded that EFA in integration with water quality trading (WQT) is a promising approach to meet the objectives.

AB  - The basic principles guiding the operation of the processing units of a chemical process are based on the following objectives. Safe operation of the processing units. Specified production rates must be maintained. Product quality specifications must be maintained. Perform satisfactorily under conditions different from the nominal design conditions. While process design aids in performing the principal function of the industry. that is to convert raw materials into products, it is process control and operability that is responsible for satisfying the above objectives. Currently, the most striking flaw in any industrial operation is the lack of associative interaction between the design and control systems. An improper interaction between the two not only leads to a design which might be uncontrollable, and hence infeasible, but also incurs a lot of expenses while attempting to operate in the uncontrollable regions. This research mainly focuses on analyzing the importance of the interaction between design, controllability and operability issues. A qualitative and a quantitative analysis of the criterion for operability that could be used during the design phase of a process have also been performed. Then these criteria have been tested on several test processes. Controllability has been assessed by the method of singular value analysis (SVA), which helps in the design of different control strategies, and compare them with a controllability index called condition number. Operability is assessed by the economic feasibility, environmental impact, safety, resiliency (ability to tolerate and to recover from undesirable changes and upsets) and flexibility (ability to operate at a range of feed conditions and parameter variations) of the process design. Quantitative measures were developed for economic feasibility (by annual equivalent profit) and environmental impact (environmental impact index). The operability and controllability analysis has been incorporated into the design of the process. While the qualitative analysis gave a feel of all the issues that need to be considered to make a process operable, the quantification of the criterion gave a simple method by which the best operable and controllable alternative can be chosen. Thus, with the above analysis, a procedure to assess the operability and controllability of a process was developed and the importance of their integration with design was proved. This analysis will be described within a framework that evaluates and optimizes processing alternatives where economics, environmental impact, and controllability are considered.

AB  - We developed a phytoplankton index of biotic integrity (P-IBI) for a German lowland river to assess effects of human disturbances on the biotic condition of riverine phytoplankton community. Six metrics (out of 36 original metrics) were selected from a training data set, based on Cumulative_R-2 and correlation index (CoI) between biotic metrics and environmental variables. The final P-IBI scores were calculated by averaging metrics for a site after transforming them to a discrete 1 (bad), 2 (low), 3 (moderate), 4 (good), 5 (high) scale according to the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). We then tested the robustness of P-IBI. The P-IBI and its six metrics were indicative of ecological integrity and water quality as indicated by canonical correspondence analysis and comparisons with other single metrics, although Cumulative_R-2 and Col values declined in the testing data set. By implementing the developed P-IBI in the study area, we found that the ecological status varied seasonally. The general ecological status of the study region was 'Moderate' regardless of seasonal variations, which was lower than the requirement ('Good' status) of WFD by 2015. The relative lower ecological status was probably caused by point sources, diffuse sources emissions and artificial drainage systems of the study area. Our study was an important trial for the development of IBI in a catchment without reference sites and the constructed P-IBI could be a useful tool to measure the long-term status of streams and the effectiveness of various watershed managements. Besides, further river basin managements are suggested to address point sources, diffuse sources as well as artificial drainage systems in order to gain a better water quality in the study region.

AB  - The Chesapeake Bay Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) and the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program's Virginian Province Benthic Index (EMAP-VP BI) were applied to 294 sampling events in Chesapeake Bay and the results were compared. These estuarine benthic indices are intended to identify benthic invertebrate assemblages that have been degraded by low dissolved oxygen concentrations or high concentrations of chemical contaminants. The B-IBI includes several community measures and weights them equally using a simple scoring system that compares them against values expected for undegraded sites. It includes I I measures of species diversity, productivity, indicator species and trophic composition. The EMAP-VP BI uses discriminant function coefficients to weight contributions of species diversity and the abundances of two indicator families. The two indices agreed on degraded or undegraded classifications for benthos at 81.3% of the sites. This level of agreement is within the level of accuracy achieved during index development and, therefore, may approach the limits that can be achieved. The indices were strongly associated (Pearson's r=0.75). The B-IBI was more conservative than the EMAP-VP BI, classifying 72.7% of the disagreements as degraded. The 55 sites where the indices disagreed were distributed in different habitats throughout the Bay except polyhaline sand. Many of the classification disagreements were at sites with index values close to, but on opposite sides of, the degraded-undegraded thresholds, with 49.1 % of the B-IBI values within 0.5 units and 81.8% within 1.0 units; the corresponding values for sites where both indices agreed were only 23.4% and 62.7%, respectively. The pattern for the EMAP-VP BI was similar, with 61.8% and 74.6% of disagreements and only 18.8% and 38.9% of agreements within 0.5 and 1.0 units of the threshold. Although the close agreement suggests that either index is suitable for evaluating the benthic condition, the B-IBI offers some additional advantages. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Substantial effort in recent years has been invested in developing monitoring protocols and indicators for assessing the health of coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes. Most efforts have collected data exclusively in Great Lakes coastal wetlands and have not evaluated coastal wetland indicator development in the context of other wetland types in the state, province, or region. "Inland" freshwater wetlands are also subject to multiple hydrologic cycles of differing time scales and in some landscape contexts may be as hydrologically variable as Great Lakes coastal wetlands. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency developed a Vegetation Index of Biotic Integrity (VIBI) for wetlands based on vascular plants as the indicator taxa group. The extension of the VIBI to Lake Erie coastal marshes was evaluated. Least-impacted Lake Erie marshes did not have significantly lower (or higher) scores (p < 0.001) although the upper 75th percentile of coastal wetland scores was not as high as the upper 75th percentile of inland wetland VIBI scores. Significant correlations (p < 0.01) were observed with two different human disturbance gradients in a combined data set of inland and coastal wetlands. Simultaneous metric evaluation using Principal Components Analysis showed some separation in metric performance between inland and coastal wetlands but also clear overlap, especially between reference-quality inland and coastal systems. Ordination of species presence and abundance data revealed similar patterns with some separation between inland and coastal wetlands but considerable overlap in species composition. Lake Erie coastal marshes represent another type of emergent marsh system. With minor modifications, the VIBI, developed with inland wetland data sets, worked well for assessing Lake Erie coastal wetlands in Ohio. The analysis of data from Ohio coastal wetlands with a larger inland reference data set shows the advantages of treating Great Lakes coastal wetlands as a type of freshwater wetland and working toward indicator development in the context of an overall state or provincial wetland classification and assessment program.

AB  - Climate and viticulture are indisputably linked and thus knowledge of the predominant weather and climate conditions of a given area is essential for optimum variety selection, viable production and overall wine quality. In this study, an assessment of the current (1981-2010) and future conditions (2021-2050 and 2061-2090) through principal climatic elements and six bioclimatic indices (i.e. Growing season average temperature, growing degree-days, Huglin index, biologically effective degree-days, dryness index and cool night index) at 23 weather stations proximal to the key mainland, coastal and island viticultural areas of Greece was performed. Mainland locations were generally colder due to their wider variety of terroir aspects and elevation, while coastal locations and islands faced proportionally more extreme temperatures and drier conditions. Trend analysis revealed that minimum temperatures increased at higher rates than the respective maximum temperatures at most locations. Climate change scenarios derived from the regional climate model RegCM4 suggested significant shifts towards warmer and drier conditions across all locations in the future. These conditions are very likely to advance phenology and harvest beyond what is considered suitable and will likely have detrimental impacts on wine quality. Differences in impacts will likely be seen between wine areas currently cultivated with early ripening (reducing variety suitability) versus those with later-ripening (increasing consistency in ripening) varieties. Overall, the changes projected for the future climate will challenge the Greek wine industry to increase its adaptive capacity through better understanding of temperature thresholds for the varieties grown and the adoption of new cultivation techniques and strategies.

AB  - The ability to access information for use in decision making is a well-recognized need within the context of management sciences. A similar need exists in order to make effective technical decisions pertaining to environmental resource management. Data bases are the principle vehicle by which scientists, engineers, and resource managers store and access environmental information. An integrated data-base mechanism is essential in order for federal agencies to manage programs such as enforcement of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), state of the environment (SOE) reporting, and the environmental assessment and review process (EARP). A data-base structure and data dissemination mechanism under current development within Environment Canada, Conservation and Protection, Atlantic Region, is presented along with some of its operational benefits and constraints.

AB  - The pygmy bluetongue lizard, Tiliqua adelaidensis, is an endangered scincid lizard that occurs in remnants of natural grasslands in the mid-north of South Australia. We assessed the factors affecting body condition of male and female lizards, using body size residuals as an index, over five sampling years. We included sex, phenotypic (patterned or plain morphs), temporal (sampling year and activity period within year), and climatic factors in our analyses. The results indicated that sampling year and activity period within the year were the two most important factors influencing variation in body condition of both male and female lizards over the period of the study. There were similar trends when we considered males and females separately. However, when prepartum and postpartum females were analysed separately, sampling year did not affect their body condition. None of the analyses showed any significant effect of phenotype on body condition. Winter-spring rainfall was positively correlated with body condition of females in the prepartum period, but showed no significant effect on mean body condition of any other grouping of adult lizards, nor a consistent direction of correlation among the different subsets of adult lizards that we considered. The substantial annual variations in the body condition of lizards, although of uncertain cause, provide important information for conservation managers who monitor persisting populations of this endangered species.

AB  - Four sites on each of two southeastern Wyoming streams, Medicine Bow River (MBR) and Rock Creek (RC), were investigated during the summer and autumn of 2001 and 2002. This investigation resulted in inventories of benthic insect communities being obtained from these two streams. It also resulted in twelve metrics being calculated from benthic insect communities, and these metrics were compared between two spatial units at different local scales. Of the metrics used, five indicated taxa richness, four indicated relative abundance, two indicated diversity, and one involved a biotic index for organic pollution. More specifically, we used each metric to compare the montane with the plains sub-basin, as well as to compare two distinctly different types of substrates within each of the sub-basins. Also, metrics were compared between the two streams. Results indicated that few differences were observed between naturally-occurring substrates within sub-basins. In addition, few differences were observed between the two streams. In contrast, however, several differences were observed between the montane and plains sub-basins. Such differences were caused from naturally-occurring variations in hydraulic and ecological conditions. These findings suggest that the spatial scale should be carefully considered when selecting metrics for use in monitoring programs that are designed to detect anthropogenic disturbances in lotic systems.

AB  - Technogenic releases from factories of non-ferrous metallurgy located in large cities lead to significant pollution of plants in inhabited and suburban areas. Toxicology tolerant plants such as poplars were used to create a sample bank to assess environmental pollution. Leaves were analysed for technogenic components. Using X-ray fluorescence, neutron activation and atomic absorption 30 elements were determined including technogenic (Hg, Pb, As, Sb, Cd) and terrigenic ones (Fe, Mn, Sr, K, Ca, Rb, P, Al, Cl, Zr). For plant matrices, absolute series for chemical elements were developed with respect to their average concentration range from maximal to minimal and relative series with respect to the ratio between average concentration - C(i) and background C(f).

AB  - This study on the growth pattern of the blood cockle Tegillarca granosa focused on the aspects of biometric prints on the shell, which aimed to predict the growth of the T. granosa population in the northern region of Malacca Strait. The local sample populations of the cockle were collected in three different intertidal areas called Lhokseumawe and Banda Aceh in Indonesia and Pulau Pinang in Malaysia. The biometric analysis showed that the length-weight relationship model of T. granosa populations in this region indicated that the cockle population generally had a negative allometric growth pattern (b < 3) or that shell length is more dominant compared to shell weight. Therefore, the result showed that the growth performance of T. granosa was not ideal, and the highest b value (the coefficient of biometric relationship) was recorded in Lhokseumawe, followed by Banda Aceh and Pulau Pinang. The value of the coefficient b could be affected by various factors such as environmental conditions, adaptation, and dietary patterns. Cluster analysis revealed that the population of T. granosa from the northern region of the Strait of Malacca was divided into two clusters, which were T. granosa from the northern Strait of Malacca (Banda Aceh and Lhokseumawe in Indonesia) and T. granosa from the Western Strait of Malacca (Pulau Pinang in Malaysia). The factors that might cause the differences in the biometric component of both clusters were at the geographical level on the source of population and local environmental parameters.

AB  - The increasing rise in sea surface temperature caused by human activities currently represents the major threat to biodiversity and natural food webs. In this study we used the Lessepsian mussel Brachidontes pharaonis, one of the most recent invaders of the Mediterranean Sea, as a model to investigate the effect of a novel prey and a chronic increase in temperatures on functional parameters of local consumers, compared to the native mytilid species Mytilaster minimus. In particular we focused on the whelk Stramonita haemastoma, a widespread Mediterranean intertidal predator that actively preys on bivalves, barnacles and limpets, by studying the direct effects of such multiple stressors on feeding and growth rate, projected into a future climate change scenario (RCP8.5) relative to 2046-2065 with higher hypothesized temperatures of 2 degrees C. Gastropods showed a significantly higher feeding rate (ADFR) on M. minimus at high (6.45 +/- 0.43) vs low temperatures (5.15 +/- 0.33) compared to B. pharaonis (2.84 +/- 0.37 vs 2.48 +/- 0.27). Ingestion rate (ADIR), however, recorded higher values for B. pharaonis at high (1.71 +/- 0.22) and low (1.49 +/- 0.16) temperatures, compared to M. minimus (0.17 +/- 0.01 vs 0.14 +/- 0.01). Prey significantly influenced growth rate, condition index and the length-weight relationship (LWR) of whelks, while only ADFR seemed to be influenced by higher temperatures. In conclusion the extra amount of energy from the novel prey, together with temperature side effects, successfully influenced growth rates and reproductive events, positively affecting the global fitness of whelks.

KW  - causal chain
AB  - In recent years, environmental indicators have become a vital component of environmental impact assessments and "state of the environment" reporting. This has increased the influence of environmental indicators on environmental management and policy making at all scales of decision making. However, the scientific basis of the selection process of the indicators used in environmental reporting can be significantly improved. In many studies no formal selection criteria are mentioned and when selection criteria are used they are typically applied to indicators individually. Often, no formal criteria are applied regarding an indicator's analytical utility within the total constellation of a selected set of indicators. As a result, the indicator selection process is subject to more or less arbitrary decisions, and reports dealing with a similar subject matter or similar geographical entities may use widely different indicators and consequently paint different pictures of the environment. In this paper, a conceptual framework for environmental indicator selection is proposed that puts the indicator set at the heart of the selection process and not the individual indicators. To achieve this objective, the framework applies the concept of the causal network that focuses on the inter-relation of indicators. The concept of causal networks can facilitate the identification of the most relevant indicators for a specific domain, problem and location, leading to an indicator set that is at once transparent, efficient and powerful in its ability to assess the state of the environment.

AB  - This study generated baseline information relative to overall performance of the winged pearl oyster Pteria sterna implanted at two groups (small and large) for half-pearl (mabe) production. This is a suitable technology to optimize the pearl production in the tropical coasts of Ecuador. The yield and quality of mabe pearl produced, as well as oyster condition index, increase in oyster survival, shell size and mass of tissues, and environmental variables were examined in this study. From 120 oysters used, 65 were of small size (25 nucleated, 25 nonnucleated and 15 for the initial sample; initial average shell length of 64.7 +/- 5.3 mm; similar to 6 months old) and 55 were of large size (20 nucleated, 20 non-nucleated and 15 for the initial sample; 78.0 +/- 5.8 shell length cm; similar to 10 months old). Hemispherical plastic nuclei (12.5 mm base diameter, 7 mm height) were used. All groups of oysters were anesthetized with 1% Eugenol and cultivated for five months (May through October 2017). At the end of the trials, only one dead oyster occurred in the small size group. A high percentage (29.2%) of adductor muscle over-growth on the nuclei occurred in small oysters, probably caused by the relatively fast growth rate (>= 8 mm in 5 months). A lower percentage of muscle over-growth on the nuclei (5.6%), thicker nacre deposition, and higher occurrence of regular-shaped mabe pearls were observed in large oysters, compared to small oysters. This study suggests that large oysters (> 80 mm) should be preferably used for half-pearl production in P. sterna to ensure the highest quality standards for commercialization.

AB  - The benthic settlement success of American lobster (Homarus americanus) postlarvae is a key factor in population dynamics, with the temperature being a key factor. Given the spatial distribution of the species, its pelagic larvae probably encounter various thermal zones during development. Little information is available on the ability of lobster larvae to acclimate to temperature or if this ability varies among geographic areas. The main objectives of this study were to characterize (i) the settlement behavior of the postlarvae in relation to (a) temperature during larval development and (b) the geographic origin of the maternal parent and (ii) the behavioral response of postlarvae with different thermal histories in the presence/absence of a thermocline. Results did not support the hypothesis of thermal adaptation among local populations, as settlement behavior of postlarvae did not differ among females from different geographic regions. In contrast, larval survival and settlement behavior and postlarval energetic conditions varied with development temperature. Behavioral plasticity in the benthic settlement was observed in relation to temperature structure of the experimental water column. This study suggests that there may be links between development temperature and the natural variability in survival and settlement of American lobsters. Findings emphasize the need for an integrated approach in lobster recruitment studies with the inclusion of behavior in dispersion models.

AB  - Parasitic isopod Ceratothoa oestroides (Cymothoidea, Isopoda) is a common and generalist buccal cavity-dweller in marine fish, recognised for its detrimental effect in fingerling and juvenile farmed European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Although distributed throughout the Mediterranean, the isopod provokes acute outbreaks mainly limited to particular endemic areas in Croatia (Adriatic Sea) and Greece (Aegean Sea). While numerous studies have previously evidenced its gross effect on farmed fish (i.e. decreased condition index, slower growth rate, lethargy and mortality), details on the host-parasite interaction are still lacking. Therefore, using a multimethodological approach, we closely examined the structure and appearance of isopod body parts acting in the attachment and feeding (stereomicroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy), and the extent of host tissues damage (histology, immunohistochemistry, micro-computational tomography) induced by parasitation. Interestingly, while hematophagous nature of the parasite has been previously postulated we found no unambiguous data to support this; we observed host tissues fragmentation and extensive hyperplasia at the parasitation site, and no structures indicative of heme detoxifying mechanisms in the parasite gut, or other traces of a blood meal. The bacterial biofilm covering C. oestroides mouthparts and pereopods suggests that the isopod may play a role in conveying secondary pathogens to the infected host, or alternatively, it serves the parasite in normal interaction with its environment.

AB  - In order to quantify and characterize the variance in rainforest tree physiology, whole tree sap flow responses to local environmental conditions were investigated in 10 species of trees with diverse traits at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. A simple model was developed to predict tree sap flow responses to a synthetic environmental variable generated by a principle components analysis. The best fit was obtained with a sigmoid function which explained between 74 and 93% of the variation in sap flux of individual trees. Sap flow reached an asymptote where higher light and evaporative demand did not cause sap flux to increase further. Soil moisture had little influence on sap flux. The morphological characteristics of the trees significantly affected sap flow; taller trees responded to changes in environmental variables sooner than shorter trees and high liana cover buffered tree sap flow responses to weather. The effect of species-specific differences on the model was small; the mean effectiveness of the model was reduced by 6% when parameters were estimated from a single pool of measurements taken from all individuals. The results indicate that sap flow response could be effectively estimated using a simple general model and composite environmental index for these 10 diverse tree species.

AB  - The biodiversity working group of the Arctic Council has developed pan-Arctic biodiversity monitoring plans to improve our ability to detect, understand and report on long-term change in Arctic biodiversity. The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) was identified as a target of future monitoring because of its circumpolar distribution, ecological importance and reliance on Arctic ecosystems. We provide the first exhaustive survey of contemporary Arctic fox monitoring programmes, describing 34 projects located in eight countries. Monitored populations covered equally the four climate zones of the species' distribution, and there were large differences between populations in long-term trends, multi-annual fluctuations, diet composition, degree of competition with red fox and human interferences. Den density, number of active dens, number of breeding dens and litter size were assessed in almost all populations, while projects varied greatly with respect to monitoring of other variables indicative of population status, ecosystem state or ecosystem function. We review the benefits, opportunities and challenges to increased integration of monitoring projects. We argue that better harmonizing protocols of data collection and data management would allow new questions to be addressed while adding tremendous value to individual projects. However, despite many opportunities, challenges remain. We offer six recommendations that represent decisive progress toward a better integration of Arctic fox monitoring projects. Further, our work serves as a template that can be used to integrate monitoring efforts of other species, thereby providing a key step for future assessments of global biodiversity.

AB  - The lake monitoring programme compliant with the Water Framework Directive has been implemented in Poland since 2007. Currently, the methods for three biological quality elements (BQEs): phytoplankton (the Phytoplankton Multimetric for Polish Lakes, PMPL), macrophytes (the Ecological State Macrophyte Index, ESMI) and phytobenthos (the Diatom Index for Lakes, IOJ) are officially applied and internationally intercalibrated. Based on the monitoring data from 256 lakes surveyed in 2010-2013 and assessed for all the three BQEs, we tested whether the assessment results obtained by the three biological methods were consistent and we searched for the causes of inconsistencies which we found. The lake classifications obtained from the PMPL and ESMI were highly consistent and the relationship between these metrics was relatively strong (R=0.66, p < 0.001). Both metrics correlated equally strongly with water quality indicators. However, the PMPL and ESMI indicated systematic dissimilarities in the sensitivity to eutrophication between shallow and deep lakes. In shallow lakes, the alarming symptoms of macrophyte community deterioration (lower values of ESMI) occurred at lower nutrient and Chla concentrations and were accompanied by a better status of phytoplankton (higher values of PMPL) than in deep lakes that can be explained by a synergistic effect of inorganic suspended solids and algal growth on water transparency. As a consequence, the positions of phytoplankton and macrophytes as early warning indicators in the eutrophication gradient in shallow lakes were inverted compared to those in deep lakes. Compared to the PMPL and ESMI, the IOJ method gave the least stringent assessment results, with 22% of lakes failing to meet the environmental objectives. The relationships between IOj and PMPL, and ESMI were relatively weak (R=0.17, p = 0.008 and R=0.17, p = 0.007, respectively). Moreover, the phytobenthos index IOJ correlated significantly more weakly with all the water quality indicators than either PMPL or ESMI did. The poor performance of the phytobenthos method in this study may suggest a limited indicator value of this BQE for lake assessment or inappropriate sampling design. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Schinias is a small coastal biotope under environmental pressure. Partial drainage of the wetland and different disturbing activities have degraded ecological habitats and decreased biodiversity for many decades. Recently, the construction of a rowing centre has restored hydrological regime and the area has been designated as a National Park; however, application of conservation measures meets difficulties of social and financial nature. In this paper, bird diversity is used as an indicator to examine Schinias' ecosystem state, according to three different scenarios: the first one refers to the diversity that had been recorded before restoration of the hydrological regime; the second one refers to the diversity that has been recently recorded and corresponds to the actual condition of the National Park with the rowing center; the third one corresponds to a potential diversity that would be observed in case Schinias became a solar saltwork.

AB  - This article describes the development of a framework for selecting a core set of indicators suitable for an integrated ecosystem health assessment of a governed landscape. Integrated assessments are those that consider a combination of biophysical, socioeconomic, and human health considerations. Highly governed landscapes are cultural landscapes that are strictly controlled by humans to the extent that they would revert to an entirely different form were it not for continued human intervention. One example of such a landscape, which serves as the setting for this investigation, is the former wetlands of the northeastern Italian coastal zone, which have been subject to widespread land reclamation and coastal development over the past century. The science of ecosystem health has been chosen as the frame of reference because "health" is not judged by the degree of "naturalness" but instead on the ability of the ecosystem to maintain and renew itself. The framework consists of first reviewing literature and methods related to ecological and environmental monitoring, state-of-the-environment reporting, landscape ecology, and sustainability. This is followed by the definition of indicator guidelines that are designed to assist in the evaluation and selection of potential indicators. A core set of indicators are then presented based on a conceptual framework devised for this purpose. indicators are classed as abiotic, biotic, and cultural, and selected according to the ecological districts comprising the study area. The ultimate goal is their application to an ecological monitoring and assessment program within a governed landscape such as the northeastern Italian coastal zone. Given such a commitment, the normal process of core indicator refinement can then proceed, based on such actions as further consultations with interested stakeholders and evaluation of methodological and practical constraints to their actual application.

AB  - This experiment evaluated the performance response of 12 lentil genotypes in a randomized complete block design with three replications under stress rain-fed and non-stress irrigated conditions in Ardabil, Iran. Combined analysis of variance revealed significant genetic variation among the genotypes for all measured traits. Mean comparisons showed that ILL-6031, ILL-9893 and ILL-8095 genotypes produced higher seed yield. These genotypes had higher values of harvest indices, seed number per pod, biological yield, pod number per plant and plant height than the other genotypes studied. They were early maturing types. Moreover there were significant positive correlation between seed yield with harvest index, biological yield, fertile pod number per plant and plant height. It was also found that the correlations between seed yield with number of days to 50% flowering and days to maturity were negative and significant. Based on the yields of genotypes under irrigation (YP) and rain-fed (YS) conditions, several quantitative drought tolerance indices, mean productivity (MP), tolerance index (TOL), geometric mean productivity (GMP), harmonic mean (HARM), stress susceptibility index (SSI) and stress tolerance index (STI), were used to evaluate drought responses of these genotypes. They showed that correlation coefficients of grain yield with HARM, GMP and STI indices in both environments conditions were positively significant. These indices. thus, differentiated stress intensity response (SI = 0.29) of genotypes under drought stress and non-stress conditions. According to the indices, it is concluded the three above mentioned genotypes were more drought tolerant than the others.

AB  - Droughts are a recurring hazard in sub-Saharan Africa, that can wreak huge socioeconomic costs. Acting early based on alerts provided by early warning systems (EWS) can potentially provide substantial mitigation, reducing the financial and human cost. However, existing EWS tend only to monitor current, rather than forecast future, environmental and socioeconomic indicators of drought, and hence are not always sufficiently timely to be effective in practice. Here we present a novel method for forecasting satellite-based indicators of vegetation condition. Specifically, we focused on the 3-month Vegetation Condition Index (VCI3M) over pastoral livelihood zones in Kenya, which is the indicator used by the Kenyan National Drought Management Authority (NDMA). Using data from MODIS and Landsat, we apply linear autoregression and Gaussian process modelling methods and demonstrate high forecasting skill several weeks ahead. As a bench mark we predicted the drought alert marker used by NDMA (VCI3M < 35). Both of our models were able to predict this alert marker four weeks ahead with a hit rate of around 89% and a false alarm rate of around 4%, or 81% and 6% respectively six weeks ahead. The methods developed here can thus identify a deteriorating vegetation condition well and sufficiently in advance to help disaster risk managers act early to support vulnerable communities and limit the impact of a drought hazard.

AB  - Tributyltin (TBT), one of the environmental pollutants, has been shown to impact the reproduction of animals. However, due to the lack of appropriate animal model, analysis of the affected molecular pathways in germ cells is lagging and has been particularly challenging. In the present study, we investigated the effects of tributyltin chloride (TBTCL) on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans germline. We show that exposure of C. elegans to TBTCL causes significantly elevated level of sterility and embryonic lethality. TBTCL exposure results in an increased number of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks in germ cells, subsequently leading to activated DNA damage checkpoint. Exposing C. elegans to TBTCL causes dose-and time-dependent germline apoptosis. This apoptotic response was blocked in loss-of-function mutants of hus-1 (op241), mrt-2 (e2663) and p53/cep-1 (gk138), indicating that checkpoints and p53 are essential for mediating TBTCL-induced germ cell apoptosis. Moreover, TBTCL exposure can inhibit germ cell proliferation, which is also mediated by the conserved checkpoint pathway. We thereby propose that TBT exhibits its effects on the germline by inducing DNA damage and impaired maintenance of genomic integrity.

AB  - The Suape Industrial Port Complex is one of the main Brazilian public ports that has caused several geomorphological changes in Ipojuca and Suape estuarine-lagoonal-bays since its construction. The present study deals with the first status on the Suape port ecosystem, recorded from 41 sediment samples throughout the Massangana/Tatuoca and Ipojuca/Merepe estuarine systems. Species diversity values are higher in the seaward part of the bays and decreases toward the inner parts. The dominance of Ammonia tepida in the inner portions of the bays is indicative of environmental instability and pollution of coastal waters. Eggerella spp., unusual in Brazilian fauna, was present only in the innermost portion of the Tatuoca estuary, in the dredged channel, where heavy metal impacts have been reported. Amphistegina gibbosa, Triloculina oblonga, and Quinqueloculina lamarckiana are represented on the outside of the bays and are indicative of high hydrodynamic marine environments. The Ipojuca and Merepe rivers presented the highest ecological index, possibly attributed to the marine and terrestrial/mangrove influence for the region. We infer that geomorphological transformation caused by the Suape Port installation modified and established environments with distinct characteristics, mainly in the Suape Bay dredged area, indicative of possible eutrophication of this environment. The new data may be useful for determining environmental conditions and establishing new ways to monitor the consequences of anthropogenic interference and dredging in the Massangana/Tatuoca and Ipojuca/Merepe estuarine systems.

AB  - This study aimed to select the most appropriate stocking density in the different annual climatic seasons, taking into account the thermal uncertainty and the risk preferences of the producer. To achieve this objective a decision theory approach (the decision table framework) and decision criteria with and without probabilities were used. The decision framework utilized was built using a bioeconomic model. This model was designed with data from an experimental freshwater aquaculture system (with three stocking densities: D-1 = 230, D-2 = 280 and D-3 = 330 shrimps m(-2)), literature research and local market conditions. The decision framework used acknowledged uncertainty associated to temperature variability, by defining three possible states of nature using historical records of environmental variables in the study region area. Due to the tropical location and the geography of the study area, the thermal oscillation within the climatic seasons and between the states of nature was low (around 4 degrees C). However, these minor differences in temperature were enough to produce variations up to 30% in the profits, depending on the climatic season, stocking density selected and the state of nature. Decision criteria with and without probabilities chose the highest density (D-3) as the best option in dry and rainy season (both warm seasons), and D-1 in the cold-front season (cold season). These results showed the importance of taking into account seasonal variations in the selection of production management strategies. This study also showed the pertinence of using decision criteria without probabilities in situations with a shortage of historical data, and when the historical behaviour is not a reliable indicator of future patterns, like the current climate change situation. This kind of analysis is even more important in locations with greater thermal oscillation, like middle and higher latitudes sites. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Present study was carried out, at Dardanelles and the Marmara Sea coasts during March 2011 to February 2012. Ostrea edulis, Mytilus gallopro, Ruditapes decussa, Ruditapes pheleppirnarum and Rapona venosa were collected seasonally along with temperature and salinity. Biochemical composition of molluscs (protein, lipid, carbohydrate, moisture and ash) was examined from the samples. Seasonal values of protein, lipid, carbohydrate, ash and moisture were mean 64.71 +/- 1.31%, 1.86 +/- 0.10%, 24.09 +/- 1.33%, 9.35 +/- 0.26% and 67.51 +/- 1.47% in R.venosa; 55.88 +/- 2.04%, 5.60 +/- 0.19%, 23.43 +/- 1.59%, 15.10 +/- 0.67% and 83.28 +/- 0.86% inR. philipinarium; 56.27 +/- 1.98%, 5.82 +/- 0.34%, 23.39 +/- 1.62%, 14.53 +/- 0.66% and 83.58 +/- 0.59% in R. decussatus; 54.03 +/- 2.82%, 10.52 +/- 1.22%, 22.84 +/- 4.33%, 12.61 +/- 2.54% and 82.45 +/- 1.70% in M. galloprovincialis; 48.11 +/- 3.04%, 8.81 +/- 0.65%, 29.16 +/- 4.62%, 13.92 +/- 1.89% and 82.25 +/- 2.66% in O. edulis, respectively. Consequently, the sampled mollusc species has high protein (40.19 - 67.38 %) and low lipid (1.65 - 12.86 %). Overall, R. venosa appears to be best as diet with relatively high protein and low lipid among other examined molluscs.

AB  - The functional explanation of nonbreeding territories in birds was analyzed in a migratory population of Robins (Erithacus rubecula) over-wintering in southern Spain. The behaviour of ringed territorial Robins was compared with that of Robins classified as floaters, ringed or not, during the winter of 1992-1993 to test two non-exclusive hypotheses. First, the good feeding patch hypothesis, that territories are the most profitable feeding areas, is not supported because body condition (fat score, body mass and body condition index) and feeding rates did not differ between owners and floaters. Second, the anti-predation hypothesis, that owners select protected areas with good cover to reduce mortality, does account for the maintenance of winter territories since owners spent a higher percentage of time hidden and were able to forage in less-exposed areas (i.e. closer to shelter) than floaters. Consequently, the winter territory of Robins should not be interpreted as a long-term defense of the most rewarding foraging patch. Instead, a good refuge and shelter seem to be the most important propel-ties of territories. Thus, by attacking the intruders, owners are defending a safe foraging area close to shelter. The anti-predation benefits (i.e. a familiar and safe foraging area as well as a good roosting place) would explain per se the maintenance of winter territories in Robins and the intense competition with conspecifics and other ecologically similar species wintering in the Mediterranean.

AB  - P>A fish-based assessment method was developed to estimate the ecological status of boreal rivers. Electric fishing data were collected from 902 rapids, together with information on the land use, channel modification and water chemistry. Discriminant function analysis was used to select fish variables that most correctly classified the undisturbed reference sites and human impacted sites into exact classes. The relationship between the level of human alteration and fish metrics was examined. Five metrics were selected for the index: the number of fish species, proportion of sensitive species, proportion of tolerant species, density of cyprinid individuals and the density of age-0+ salmonids. The value for each metric (between 0 and 1) was calculated according to a point estimate for classical probability. The index is used to estimate the ecological classification of rivers according to the EU Water Framework Directive.

AB  - This study deals with the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based bicycle level of service (BLOS) models for urban road segments carrying heterogeneous traffic. To accomplish this, the required data sets on the road geometric, traffic and built-environmental conditions are collected from 84 road segments located in various parts of four Indian cities. The satisfaction levels of bicyclists at each site are also assessed using a Likert scale of 1-6 (excellent-worst). Subsequently, three promising AI techniques namely, Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Genetic programming (GP) and Bayesian regularization neural network (BRNN) are utilized to develop the BLOS models. All models are trained and tested with eight significant attributes of the road segments. Among all models, the MARS-based one has shown the best prediction performance in the present context with a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.92 with averaged observations. On the other hand, GP has produced the simplest (regression-like) but reliable model, which is the most favourable for field applications. The relative importance of input variables has concluded that the outermost lane width, traffic volume, on-street parking activities and pavement condition index are by far the most important variables in the present context. Hence, these attributes should be largely prioritized in the planning process to enhance the perceived BLOS effortlessly.

AB  - The spatial distribution of fish early life stages can impact recruitment at later stages and affect population size and resilience. Northeast Arctic (NEA) cod spawning occurs along the Norwegian coast. Eggs, larvae, and pelagic juveniles drift near-surface towards the Barents Sea nursery area. In this study, a 35-year long time series of NEA cod larvae data was analysed in combination with factors that potentially may affect the distribution of eggs and larvae. These factors included biological aspects of the spawning stock, and environmental variables, such as water temperature, wind, ocean current, and prey abundance. Our aim was to shed light on how these factors influence larval abundance and distribution and how larval abundance and distribution influenced recruitment at age 3. We found that biomass and mean weight of the spawners were positively associated with larval abundance and that a high liver condition index of the spawners was associated with a north-easterly distribution of the larvae. The environmental variables showed generally weak or no correlations with abundance or distribution of larvae. Lastly, we found significant association between larval abundance and year-class abundance at age 3, while the spatial distribution metrics of the larvae, i.e. distribution extent, mean longitude, and mean latitude, showed no significant association with future year-class abundance.

AB  - To assess the toxicity and accumulation (total and subcellular partitioning) of cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), juvenile eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, were exposed for 4 weeks to a range of concentrations (Control, Low (1x), and High (4x)). Despite the 4-fold increase in metal concentrations, oysters from the High-Cd treatment (2.4 mu M Cd) attained a body burden that was only 2.4-fold greater than that of the Low-Cd treatment (0.6 mu M Cd), while oysters from the High-Hg treatment (0.056 mu M Hg) accumulated 8.9-fold more Hg than those from the Low-Hg treatment (0.014 mu M Hg). This fold difference in total Cd burdens was, in general, mirrored at the subcellular level, though binding to heat-denatured proteins in the High-Cd treatment was depressed (only 1.6-fold higher than the Low-Cd treatment). Mercury did not appear to appreciably partition to the subcellular fractions examined in this study, with the fold difference in accumulation between the Low- and High-Hg treatments ranging from 1.5-fold (heat-stable proteins) to 4.6-fold (organelles). Differences in toxicological impairments (reductions in condition index, protein content, and ETS activity) exhibited by oysters from the High-Cd treatment may be partially due to the nature of how different metals partition to subcellular components in the oysters, though exact mechanisms will require further examination.

AB  - Assessing the health and condition of animals in their natural environment can be problematic. Many physiological metrics, including immunity, are highly influenced by specific context and recent events to which researchers may be unaware. Thus, using a multifaceted physiological approach and a context-specific analysis encompassing multiple time scales can be highly informative. Ecoimmunological tools in particular can provide important indications to the health of animals in the wild. We collected blood and hair samples from free-ranging polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in the southern Beaufort Sea and examined the influence of sex, age, and reproductive status on metrics of immunity, stress, and body condition during 2013-2015. We examined metrics of innate immunity (bactericidal ability and lysis) and stress (hair cortisol, reactive oxygen species, and oxidative barrier), in relation to indices of body condition considered to be short term (urea to creatinine ratio; UC ratio) and long term (storage energy and body mass index). We found the factors of sex, age, and reproductive status of the bear were critical for interpreting different physiological metrics. Additionally, the metrics of body condition were important predictors for stress indicators. Finally, many of these metrics differed between years, illustrating the need to examine populations on a longer time scale. Taken together, this study demonstrates the complex relationship between multiple facets of physiology and how interpretation requires us to examine individuals within a specific context.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of stoking density on the pathogens reduction, through the sludge vermicomposting, using the most probable number of fecal coliforms as indicator. The sludge used was generated at an extended aeration system; the stoking density was investigated at 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 kg-worms/kg-sludge plus a control without worms. At the second day of experimentation the 0.1 kg/kg density achieved a significantly higher removal than the 0.2 kg/kg density. In the same day, all the stoking densities achieved the United States Environment Agency class B sludge standards. Between the 13 and 20 day all the stoking densities, with the exception of the control, achieved the USEPA class A standards. On day 20 the removal in the two biggest stoking densities was 100%.

AB  - Benthic, epiphytic, and phytoplanktonic diatoms, as well as soil and water physical-chemical parameters, were sampled from 70 small (average 0.86 ha) isolated depressional herbaceous wetlands located along a gradient of human disturbance in peninsular Florida to (1) compare diatom assemblage structure between algal types; (2) develop biological indicators of wetland condition; (3) examine synecological relationships between diatom structure and environmental variables, with the ultimate goal of developing an index of biological integrity using a single assemblage. Collected diatom samples were enumerated to 250 valves and identified to species or subspecies. An assessment of wetland condition was made using a landscape-scale human disturbance score (Landscape Development Intensity index, LDI), calculated for each site using land use maps and GIS.
   Assemblages from both impaired and reference sites were compared using blocked multi-response permutation procedures, the percent similarity index, and visually examined using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). No ecologically significant compositional differences were found within sites. Mantel's test (Mantel's r = 0.29, p < 0.0001) and NMDS (stress: 14.52, variance: 78.5%) identified epiphytic diatoms as the most responsive to human disturbance. Strong significant correlations (vertical bar r vertical bar(s)> 0.50, p < 0.05) were found between epiphytic NMDS site scores and soil pH, specific conductivity, water total phosphorous, and LDI, while soil pH, water color, soil TP, and turbidity were also significantly correlated (p < 0.05).
   Metrics to assess wetland condition were developed using epiphytic abundance data. Epiphytic taxa sensitive or tolerant to human landscape modification were identified using Indicator Species Analysis, and autecological indices relating diatom sensitivity to nutrients, pH, dissolved oxygen levels, saprobity, salinity, and trophic, status were calculated. Fourteen final metrics were identified, scored on an ordinal scale, and combined into the Diatom Index of Wetland Condition (DIWC). The DIWC was highly correlated with the disturbance score (Spearman's r(s) = -0.71, p < 0.0001), although the results need to be validated. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A hypothesis of the functional similarity of characteristics of natural processes forming a united physiographic process is theoretically justified and statistically verified using the time series of the data of microclimatic observations. This unity is manifested locally in time and is transformed into a new system of relations at changing background conditions of environment. The proposed computation scheme allows taking into account and identifying the persistent indicators of environmental state and the discrete moments of their variations using the method of rolling regression. The symmetry of processes is achieved by minimizing the residuals of functional relations of climatic characteristics derived by eliminating background impact. Proposed is a model of the genetic basis of the interdependence of natural processes based on the results of the data analysis and the formulae of the Legendre transform.

AB  - Global ecological conditions existing in the streams of northern Tunisia are very unequal. In consideration of their appropriate management and restoration requirements, breeding populations of 28 Odonata species were studied over an annual cycle in twenty-eight watercourses (22 permanent, 6 intermittent). In total, 7 363 larvae and 337 exuviae were collected. We developed a new indicator, the Tunisian Stream Odonatological Index (TSOI), to assess conservation aspects of Odonata biodiversity in African Mediterranean streams by analysing dragonfly communities. The TSOI operates at the species level. Taxonomic richness, voltinism, endemism, relative taxonomic distinctiveness, and regional conservation status (IUCN) are elements taken into account to design this index. Accordingly, presence of both Maghreb endemic and semivoltine species (Calopteryx exul, Platycnemis subdilatata, Aeshna cyanea, Boyeria Irene, Gomphus lucasii, Onychogomphus costae, O. forcipatus, and O. uncatus) may provide useful information about the refuge quality of each habitat type for species with different biological features, and their interest level from a conservation point of view. The results of a first application of this approach are presented in the paper as well. As far as we know, a biodiversity conservation index based on benthic invertebrates in the African Mediterranean area has never before been proposed nor used.

AB  - Due to rapid population growth, industrialization, and urbanization, it is particularly important to address the increasingly serious ecological security issues in the process of urbanization, while it is important to grasp the impact of changes in land use structure on ecological security for scientific planning and to aid decision-making. As a typical valley basin industrialized city in northwest China, Lanzhou has complex geomorphology and climate with distinct regional characteristics, and the relationship between land use and ecological security is complex. In order to understand the current status and influencing factors of ecological security in various regions of Lanzhou, and to explore the intrinsic connection between ecological security and land use, this study constructed an ecological security evaluation index system based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) model with 14 secondary factors including natural, social, and economic factors. Based on the entropy method, GIS was used to analyze the trend of ecological security in each district and to clarify the coupling relationship between ecological security and land use change in Lanzhou City. The results show that the ecological security index (ESI) of Xigu District, a typical heavy industrial area, increased from 0.26 to 0.35, and the ESI of Yuzhong County, an agricultural development area, increased from 0.51 to 0.55 from 2000 to 2017. Low ESI was mainly distributed in areas with developed heavy industry, while high ESI was mainly found in areas with favorable natural conditions and mainly agricultural development. Economic factors were the leading factors affecting the ecological security of Lanzhou. In general, changes in land use structure and ecological security were inextricably linked, and the two influence and interact with each other. These results could provide some reference for the study of ecological security development and land use change in typical river valley cities and also provide a new path for other cities to study ecological security and the conservation of the ecological environment.

AB  - Environmental policy and in particular the European water legislation, in the framework of the EU Groundwater Directive, has started to consider groundwater not only as a resource but as a living ecosystem. A precondition for comprehensive groundwater protection is thus the assessment of the biological and ecological state. The assessment of ecosystems requires consideration of ecological criteria, which so far are not available for groundwater systems. In the framework of a national project, the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) supports a consortium of scientists and stakeholders from water boards and regional environmental authorities to develop a first concept for an ecological assessment scheme for groundwater ecosystems. The attempts towards an integrative concept include the following steps: (i) selection of appropriate biological and ecological parameters, (ii) typology of groundwater ecosystems, (iii) derivation of a reference status (Leitbild) and natural background values for biological variables, (iv) identification of potential bioindicators and definition of threshold values, and (v) development of an assessment model. These proposed steps are discussed on the basis of a data set from two groundwater landscapes in Southern Germany. Investigations considered three different spatial units, i.e. the habitat unit at the local scale, and the aquifer type unit as well as the landscape unit at the regional scale. Fauna as well as bacterial communities could provide valuable ecological information on the ecosystems status. The paper reviews 'state of the art' knowledge and evaluates the near future perspectives for the development and implementation of groundwater ecosystems assessment programmes.

AB  - Wildlife is exposed to natural (e.g., food availability and quality, parasitism) and anthropogenic stressors (e.g., habitat fragmentation, toxicants). Individual variables (e.g., age, gender) affect behaviour and physiology of animals. Together, these parameters can create both great inter-individual variations in health indicators and interpretation difficulties. We investigated the relevance of body condition and somatic indices (liver, kidneys) as indicators of health status in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus, n= 560) captured along a metal pollution gradient in four landscape types (30 sampling squares 500-m sided). The indices were calculated using a recently proposed standard major axis regression instead of an ordinary least square regression. After considering age and gender for the body condition index, no landscape type influence was detected in the indices. However, important index variability was observed between sampling squares; this effect was included as a random effect in linear models. After integrating all individual and environmental variables that may affect the indices, cadmium (Cd) concentrations in both the liver and kidneys were negatively related to body condition and liver indices only for individuals from highly contaminated sites. Lead in the liver was negatively related to the liver index, and Cd in kidneys was positively linked to the kidney index, potentially suggesting metal-induced stress. However, interpretation of these indices as a wildlife ecotoxicology tool should be performed with caution due to the sensitivity of potentially confounding variables (e.g., individual factors and environmental parameters).

AB  - Composting of several organic wastes of different chemical composition (source-separated organic fraction of municipal solid waste, dewatered raw sludge, dewatered anaerobically digested sludge and paper sludge) was carried out under controlled conditions to study the suitability of different biological indexes (oxygen uptake rate, respirometric index, and respiratory quotient) to monitor the biological activity of the composting process. Among the indexes tested, oxygen uptake rate (also referred to as dynamic respirometric index) provided the most reliable values of microbial activity in a compost environment. On the other hand, values of the static respirometric index measured at process temperature, especially in the early stages of the composting process, were significantly lower than those of the dynamic index, which was probably due to oxygen diffusion limitations present in static systems. Both static and dynamic indexes were similar during the maturation phase. Static respirometric index measured at 37degreesC should not be used with samples obtained during the thermophilic phase, since it resulted in an underestimation of the respiration values. Respiratory quotient presented only slight variations when changing the process temperature or the waste considered, and its use should be restricted to ensure aerobic conditions in the composting matrix.

AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHW) are predicted to occur with increased frequency, duration and intensity in a changing climate, with pervasive ecological and socioeconomic consequences. While there is a growing understanding of the ecological impacts of warming and marine heatwaves, much less is known about how they influence the underlying physiology and health of species, and the nutritional properties of tissue. We evaluated the effects of different heatwave scenarios and ocean warming on the nutritional properties and immune health of the harvested gastropod Turbo militaris. Neither heatwave scenarios nor elevated temperatures had significant impacts on morphometrics, proximate composition or inorganic content of T. militaris. However, an increased moisture content and non-significant trends, such as elevated amount of lipids, and an increased number of hemocytes in the blood of T. militaris in the heatwave treatments were suggestive of mild stress. Overall, our study suggests that T. militaris is resilient to marine heatwaves and warming, although delayed, additive or synergistic stress responses cannot be ruled out. Understanding the possible effects of ocean warming and heatwaves on fisheries species could improve management actions to avoid species impacts, socioeconomic losses and negative effects to ecosystem service provision in a changing climate.

AB  - Unsustainable hunting of wildlife or bushmeat for human consumption across the tropics threatens both wildlife populations and the livelihoods of people who depend on these resources. The probability that hunting can be sustainable depends in part on ecological conditions that affect the 'supply' of and 'demand' for wildlife resources. In this study, supply is estimated across a number of tropical ecosystem types by calculating the theoretical 'maximum sustainable offtake' in kg/km(2) for harvestable wildlife. Demand is estimated from observed harvests in kg/km(2). We examine how supply and demand vary across relatively undisturbed ecosystems, indexed by annual rainfall. Supply is potentially highest in dry forests and wetter savannah grasslands and decreases in moist forests and more xeric grasslands. Demand tends to exceed supply in moist forests and xeric grasslands. Analogous to this ecological variation along the rainfall gradient is the gradient created by the conversion of tropical forests by humans. We hypothesise that the wild meat supply is greater in secondary forests and forest-farm-fallow mosaics than in undisturbed forests and test this with available data. We conclude that the probability that hunting will be sustainable varies with ecosystem type and degree of human disturbance and should influence where land is zoned for protected areas and where for wildlife harvests.

AB  - The presence of pharmaceuticals in the marine environment is a growing problem of global importance. Al-though awareness of the significance of this issue is increasing, many questions related to the ecotoxicology of pharmaceuticals remain unclear. Diclofenac is one of the drugs most commonly detected in the marine environ-ment and its potential toxicity has been previously highlighted, thus its impact on organisms deserves a special attention. Therefore, in this study, a thorough analysis of the effects of diclofenac on a condition and tissue level of a model representative of marine invertebrates - Mytilus trossulus - was performed. During the 25-day experiment, divided into exposure and depuration phases, bivalves were exposed to two environmentally relevant drug concentrations of 4 and 40 mu g/L. The study showed that mussels absorb diclofenac in their tissues and the highest recorded concentration was 1.692 mu g/g dw on day 8. Moreover, the content of diclofenac metabolites (4-OH and 5-OH diclofenac) was also examined, but they were not detected either in water or in tissues. Al-though exposure to low diclofenac concentrations did not significantly affect the condition index of organisms, changes in numerous histopathological parameters were noted. Performed histological examination provided additional valuable information on the influence of drugs on the functioning of invertebrates. Nevertheless, applicability of histopathological techniques in ecotoxicology of drugs requires additional evaluation in future studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sixteen years of annual censuses ( 1990-2005) of an assemblage of tide pool sculpins at Tatoosh Island, Washington, USA, revealed relative constancy in the numbers of recruits and adults. However, the dominant species as a recruit ( Clinocottus globiceps) was always replaced numerically as an adult by another species ( Oligocottus maculosus). When mechanisms of coexistence were evaluated, little support was found for either a lottery model, because competitive interactions are hierarchical, or a storage-effect model of coexistence, because the relative ranking of recruitment varied little among years and did not covary among species with environmental variables such as ocean temperature, upwelling indices, or an estimator of ocean productivity ( oyster condition index). There was also little evidence of niche partitioning based on habitat affinities. Additionally, predation-mediated coexistence had little support, given that the competitive dominant did not have the greatest rates of mortality. Instead, a competition-colonization trade-off may contribute to the coexistence of these species, where C. globiceps always recruits in the greatest numbers, while O. maculosus dominates the adult assemblage via competitive processes. The importance of post-recruitment processes in this assemblage is further suggested by some negative associations among species, the presence of density dependence, some habitat affinities, and previously published experimental work that demonstrated the competitive dominance of O. maculosus over C. globiceps.

AB  - We characterized the biotic integrity of the sub-tropical Duero River, Mexico, comparing current and past index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores with results of an environmental quality index (EQI), inventorying abiotic characteristics and human impacts, and documenting ecosystem changes over the last three decades. We sampled the fish community and measured environmental variables during the dry season of 2009 at 19 sites. We compared 2009 findings with fish data obtained in 1986 and 1991 at nine of the sites. The correlation between the IBI and EQI was high (r(2)=0.79, p=0.0002), indicating that the IBI accurately characterized environmental condition. Thirteen sites were degraded (68%) based on IBI scores, three were fair (16%) and three had good conditions (16%). Based on the EQI, 12 sites were classified as poor (63%), two as fair (11%) and five as good (19%). A cluster analysis of nine abiotic variables and the IBI values yielded three groups: six sites with good integrity and environmental quality, eight with high chemical oxygen demand and four with high total dissolved solids. A discriminant analysis (square canonical correlation: 0.922, and Wilks' lambda significance: 0.001) identified biochemical oxygen demand, distance to vegetation and total dissolved solids as the main predictors. Compared to 1986 and 1991, 2009 IBI values and ratings had declined significantly (multiple response permutation procedure A=0.16, p=0.0005), indicating a trend of environmental deterioration, with scores and ratings at 7 of 9 sites lower in 2009. One site had declined from good to fair, one from good to poor, five from fair to poor, one had remained fair and one had remained good. Degradation was related to excessive human water use, reduced river flows, increased wastewater discharge, deforestation, erosion, and invasive species, and mismanagement of preserved sites (springs), all of which highlight an urgent need to reverse declining environmental conditions.

AB  - The Algerian west coast is the prime recipient of several forms of pollution; hence, the necessity for an impact assessment of this coastal pollution using a suite of recommended marine biomarkers, including lysosomal membrane stability in living cells by the Neutral Red Retention Time (NRRT) method, the evaluation of micronucleus (MN) frequency, and the determination of acetylcholinesterase (ACNE) activity in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis, sampled from the large, polluted Oran Harbour (OH) and the Maarouf (Mrf) marine mussel farm between July 2005 and April 2006. The difference in the variations of the annual physical parameters between OH and Mrf corresponds to the influence of the domestic and industrial sewage discharged by the city of Oran. The biological data of the mussels (condition index, protein content) recorded at both sites were related to their natural reproductive cycle. This indicated that intrinsic variation between the sites due to different mussel development phases was minimal. The variation in the ACNE activity of some organs of OH and Mrf mussels, with minimal inhibition in July and a higher NRRT recorded in the granular haemocytes in the Mrf than in the OH mussels during the autumn and spring; depends on the quality of the biotope and on generic stress factors. Moreover, the variation in MN frequency, in general reflecting a non-significant seasonal and spatial genotoxic effect of the contamination at the two sampling sites; requires further investigations regarding biotic and abiotic variations.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide insights into traders' perceptions of and responses to environmental quality in markets of Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach Primary data were collected from 445 traders in five different markets (Odo-Ogbe, Olorunsogo Oja-Ife, Bonfo and Urban day) in Ile-Ife through questionnaire administration. Physical observations were also carried out for holistic and detailed assessment of the environment. Findings Results showed that most of the traders were married (64.6%), females (74.5%), who were young adults within the age bracket of 31-45 years (39.8%) while over half of them had secondary school education (55.2%) and spent between 8 and 9 h in the market on a daily basis. Using what is termed "Facility Condition Index" (FCI), it was shown that public toilet (FCI = 2.11), health centre (FCI = 1.76) and electricity supply (FCI = 1.43) were the three most deplorable facilities in the markets. Findings further showed that flooding, pollution and blocked drain, each with 22.1%, were the most common environmental problems. Originality/value The study extends the existing literature by examining traders' perceptions of environmental quality of open spaces (markets), which could be used as tools in proffering solution to the varying environmental problems of the markets by policymakers.

AB  - The blue mussel (Mytilus spp.) has been used to assess the potential biological effects of the discharge effluent from the Sydvaranger mine, which releases its tailings into Bok fjord at Kirkenes in the north of Norway. Metal bioaccumulation and a suite of biomarkers were measured in mussels positioned for 6 weeks at varying distances from the discharge outlet. The biomarkers used included: stress on stress (SS); condition index (CI); cellular energy allocation (CEA); micronuclei formation (MN); lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), basophilic cell volume (VvBAS); and neutral lipid (NL) accumulation. The individual biomarkers were integrated using the integrated biological response (IBR/n) index. The accumulation of Fe was significantly higher in mussels located closer to the discharge outlet, indicating that these mussels had been exposed to the suspended mine effluent. The IBR/n results were in good agreement with the location of the mussels in relation to the distance from the discharge outlet and expected exposure to the mine effluent. Several biomarkers showed responses resulting in higher IBR/n values of analysed mussels within a 3 km distance from the tailing discharge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Among the methods used for water quality monitoring in freshwater ecosystems we can find the phytotoxicity assessment and the seed germination and root elongation tests, which are the simplest methods recommended for environmental biomonitoring. The aims of this study were to assess the water toxicity of the Chalma river by the use of a bioassay with Lactuca sativa and to elaborate a biological index to diminish the water pollution condition of this river. Six study sites along the river were chosen, four of them located in the state of Mexico and two in the state of Morelos. The results were analyzed with multivariate methods: a principal component analysis and a similarity analysis. Three zones were differentiated according to the toxicity indices obtained: 1) the first three study sites showed positive values and low toxicity with high concentrations of nutrients, which could be promoting radical elongation, 2) the middle portion, represented only by the fourth study site, exhibited the lowest value of the root length index, with a classification of moderate toxicity and 3) the lower portion of the river, whose indices classified this zone as moderate to low toxicity. The last portion of the river was also associated with the accumulation of leachate compounds during the rainy season. Finally, the indices obtained showed that the sensitivity of the Lactuca sativa seeds bioassay generated an integral biological response. This information can be used for ecotoxicological risk assessment.

AB  - Skin lesions frequently present in adult lizards may be due to a variety of causes, both physical and infectious, including excessively high humidity and environmental temperature, malnutrition, concurrent disease etc. On the other hand, skin lesions in lizards could be simple evidence of various behavioural patterns and biotic interactions. However, studies on frequencies of dermal lesions and their anatomical and environmental correlates in lacertid lizards are rare. Here, we use Podarcis muralis to analyse the relations between occurrence of ectodermal lesions and three possible indicators of environmental stress (body condition index - BCI, infestation by ticks and tail condition) by evaluating differences among local populations at uni- and multivariate level. Our results showed that BCI, together with body size and sexual size dimorphism, varied between populations but had no direct influence on the presence of lesions. Males had higher frequencies of lesions and ticks but lower frequencies of broken tails than females. All three parameters varied between sites likely due to differences in predation/parasite exposures and agonistic interactions with conspecifics between sexes and populations. Results of multivariate analyses suggested that the occurrence of lesions is decoupled from the other morphological stress indicators. Detected associations indicated that relations between presence of lesions and other analysed variables are rather complex. Directions for further research on ectodermal lesions in lacertid lizards are provided.

AB  - The length-weight relationship and condition factor (K) are useful descriptors in population fish biology, because they provide essential information on growth strategies, nutritional status and reproduction. They are also parameters widely used to compare the condition of aquatic systems with varying degrees of human intervention. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of populations in pristine ecosystems, provides relevant basic information to understanding changes or effects in populations under these pressures. The San Pedro river (Valdivia basin), southern Chile, is a system characterized by its current low intervention level, high fish diversity and low abundance of introduced species. We describe the length-weight relationship and condition factor of 12 native fish of the San Pedro river, for over two annual cycles, analyzing their growth strategies and seasonal variability in condition factor. The results of the length-weight show that the most of species exhibit isometric growth, especially Diplomystes camposensis, Basilichthys australis and Brachygalaxias bullocki, however, some species have a tendency to allometry (Galaxias maculatus, Galaxias platei and Trichomycterus areolatus). The values of K show that species such as Percilia gillissi have a strong annual variability, associated with the breeding season and greater supply of food. We give this information as baseline data to understand the functioning of fish populations in natural conditions and to be used for the evaluation of future projects that may impact these ecosystems.

AB  - Triploid shellfish are sterile and retain product quality during, and after the spawning period. Field evaluations of diploid and triploid mussels demonstrated that triploids had a greater growth rate than diploids. The growth difference was evident in the first growing year after deployment in a high growth site. This difference was not detectable in a low growth Site until the second year after deployment, suggesting possible differential growth of triploids versus diploids, related to environment. Diploid mussels in the low growth site were notably less sexually mature in the first year; therefore, the differential performance of triploids between test sites may have been related to spawning. After 11 months in the field, triploids had a mean shell length 1.05% (P = 0.48) larger than diploids in the low growth site versus 8.09% (P < 0.001) larger in the high growth site. Triploids examined after a spawning event showed no histological evidence of spawning, while 71% of diploids showed some evidence of spawning. Shell length, relative soft tissue weight, and condition index were all higher in triploids. This resulted in a maximum observed increase in dry tissue weight of 62.82% and a mean shell length increase of 10.95% when triploids were compared to diploids after the local spawning event. A highly skewed sex ratio in triploid mussels, in favor of males. confirmed a similar observation in triploid Mytilus galloprovincialis. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined the response of bird communities to a gradient of human impact in the Adirondack Park of northern New York State by testing the relationship of land use management types to an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) across the Adirondack landscape. We created the IBI by placing birds into 12 different guild categories and scoring study blocks according to relative representation of specialist versus generalist guild types. We investigated three questions relating to the effects of land use management on biotic integrity in the Adirondacks: (1) are there differences in biological integrity among the major land use types; (2) if so, what characteristics of these land use types are associated with high integrity bird communities; and, (3) to what degree is land management regulation effective in maintaining biological integrity in the Adirondack Park? We found significant differences in total, functional, compositional, and structural integrity on five land use types ranging from hamlet to wilderness. In all cases, integrity was lowest in hamlet areas and increased along the gradient to its highest level in wilderness areas.
   Biotic integrity showed strong groupings of the five land use classes. We found that bird community integrity was strongly related to roadlessness and that birds primarily responded to the distinction between developed and undeveloped land types. In contrast to roads and human development, forest management impacts in the Adirondacks do not appear to be of a high enough intensity to have significant negative impacts on breeding bird community integrity. Clustering of development is a means by which integrity may be safeguarded for the long term in the Adirondack Park. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The oil industry is one of the main productive activities in Mexico and has a huge infrastructure, including a wide pipeline network that crosses urban, industrial, agricultural and natural areas. The threat of crude oil spills is greatest in those regions with a high concentration of oil extraction and refining activities, as in the case of the Coatzacoalcos and Tonala Rivers Low Basin. This study ranked the geosystems of the basin in terms of vulnerability to pipeline crude oil spills. Very high vulnerability (level I) was assigned to the water bodies (lakes and rivers) and their margins of influence, including surfaces that flood during normal hydraulic load. High vulnerability areas (level II) comprised surfaces that can flood during extraordinary hydraulic load related with extreme hydrometeorological events. The remaining three vulnerability levels were defined for areas with low or negligible flooding potential, these were ranked according to physical (slope, relief and permeability), biological (richness, singularity and integrity) and socio-economic (social marginalization index and economic activities index) conditions. These results are presented on a map for better visualization and interpretation. This study will be useful to establish preventive and effective emergency management actions in order to reduce remediation costs and adverse effects on wild species. It also can help local and national authorities, oil industry and civil protection corps to better protect ecosystems, natural resources and human activities and goods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An accelerating trend of global urbanization accompanying population growth makes frequently updated land use and land cover (LULC) maps critical. LULC maps have been widely created through the classification of remotely sensed imagery. Maps of urban areas have been both dichotomous (urban or non-urban) and entailing of discrete urban types. This study incorporated multispectral built-up indices, designed to enhance satellite imagery, for introducing new urban classification schemes. The indices examined are the new built-up index (NBI), the built-up area extraction index (BAEI), and the normalized difference concrete condition index (NDCCI). Landsat Level-2 data covering the city of Miami, FL, USA was leveraged with geographic data from the Florida Geospatial Data Library and Florida Department of Environmental Protection to develop and validate new methods of supervised and unsupervised classification of urban area. NBI was used to extract discrete urban features through object-oriented image analysis. BAEI was found to possess properties for visualizing and tracking urban development as a low-high gradient. NDCCI was composited with NBI and BAEI as the basis for a robust urban intensity classification scheme superior to that of the United States Geological Survey National Land Cover Database 2016. BAEI, implemented as a shadow index, was incorporated in a novel infill geosimulation of high-rise construction. The findings suggest that the proposed classification schemes are advantageous to the process of creating more detailed cartography in response to the increasing global demand.

AB  - Nassarid snails are important opportunistic scavengers widely found in marine intertidal shores and trophic transfer is a predominant source of metal accumulation in these species, thus there is a significant need to understand the controls of metal trophic transfer. In the present study, we took advantage of a severely contaminated estuary and collected two prey organisms (oysters Crassostrea angulata and barnacles Fistulobalanus albicostatus) with different contamination histories. These naturally contaminated prey were fed to a marine neogastropod Nassarius siquijorensis for a period of up to 7 weeks. We then investigated the influences of prey type, metal burden, and subcellular distribution in the prey on the metal accumulation, trophic transfer, and potential toxicity on N. siquijorensis. We demonstrated an obvious negative relationship between the trophic transfer and the metal concentration in prey or the metal dosage. N. siquijorensis exhibited food avoidance behavior to the Cu contaminated food, which effectively reduced the metal ingestion and resulted in a decrease of trophic transfer, as well as a potential toxic effect from dietary exposure. On the other hand, our results also implied the metal-specific impact of subcellular metal distribution in prey on the trophic transfer to N. siquijorensis. Our study suggested that metal burden and feeding avoidance should be considered in studying the trophic transfer of metals in marine benthic food chain. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Atlantic Forest is an ecosystem historically managed without restrictions. Over the years, this situation led to a fragmentation of the forest environment with the consequent loss of habitats for all kinds of organisms in the region. The present work is a checklist of macrofungi found in a native forest in Obera (Misiones, Argentina), where conservation and regeneration practices have been held since 2009 to recover its natural state. Sampling took place in different seasons for 3 years. 136 species have been identified, distributed in 13 orders, 32 families and 86 genera. The objective of the present work was to set a precedent of macrofungi diversity in the area. This will allow studying macrofungi ecological succession and their potential as bio-indicators of forest recovery.

AB  - Ocean acidification is predicted to have severe consequences for calcifying marine organisms especially molluscs. Recent studies, however, have found that molluscs in marine environments with naturally elevated or fluctuating CO2 or with an active, high metabolic rate lifestyle may have a capacity to acclimate and be resilient to exposures of elevated environmental pCO(2). The aim of this study was to determine the effects of near future concentrations of elevated pCO(2) on the larval and adult stages of the mobile doughboy scallop, Mimachlamys asperrima from a subtidal and stable physiochemical environment. It was found that fertilisation and the shell length of early larval stages of M. asperrima decreased as pCO(2) increased, however, there were less pronounced effects of elevated pCO(2) on the shell length of later larval stages, with high pCO(2) enhancing growth in some instances. Byssal attachment and condition index of adult M. asperrima decreased with elevated pCO(2), while in contrast there was no effect on standard metabolic rate or pH(e). The responses of larval and adult M. asperrima to elevated pCO(2) measured in this study were more moderate than responses previously reported for intertidal oysters and mussels. Even this more moderate set of responses are still likely to reduce the abundance of M. asperrima and potentially other scallop species in the world's oceans at predicted future pCO(2) levels.

AB  - Tool selection is a multi-criteria decision-making problem in the presence of various selection criteria and a set of alternatives, but previous works are limited to evaluating the tools within the workshop tool library. To intelligently select proper inserts across suppliers under the Internet environment, an insert data format based on ISO 513 was established, and a framework was then designed to obtain a set of alternatives from different suppliers based on fuzzy intervals. Then, knowledge was described with convenient language and the simple membership function to build an intelligent system, which would infer the matching degree of insert characteristics to the machining conditions. Furthermore, analytic hierarchy process was applied to sort the alternatives. Finally, the case study shows that compared with previous works and machinists, this work not only obtains a set of alternatives from all suppliers who uploaded their product data with the designed format but comprehensively evaluates the insert (take finishing low-carbon steel as an example, both cemented carbide and cermet are recommended, the nose radius reduces 25%, the environmental index increases 25%, while the rake reduces 11.25%, when compared with machinists who tend to select the larger rake angle foe finishing). A platform was also developed based on Visual Studio 2015 and SQL Server 2012 to improve selection efficiency for inexperienced CNC operators, purchasers, and vendors.

AB  - Swimming pools are used around the world for recreational, rehabilitation and physical activity. From an energy and environmental standpoint, grey water as a waste thermal potential of swimming pools is a valuable heat source produced continuously in extensive, measurable and large quantities. The main objective of this article is to analyse the feasibility of proposed grey water heat recovery (GWHR) system from the showers and backwater from swimming pool filters for an indoor pool located in recreation centre in Poland. Analysis, calculations and results were obtained and discussions of water and energy consumption were carried out for the mentioned indoor swimming pool on the basis of real measurements case study for water flow rate, water temperature in swimming pools and showers. The results ensure a significant potential of energy savings by using the proposed GWHR system, which allows to reduce the energy demand by 34% up to 67% for pool water preheating and domestic hot water (DHW). The environmental impact of proposed GWHR system was analysed and calculated by using Common Air Quality Index. Environmental results are illustrated and discussed specially for the reduction of CO2, NOX, SOX emissions and dust and ensure a significant reduction of these pollutants in range of 34% to 48%.

AB  - The cockle Cerastoderma glaucum represents a significant element of the benthic community in Lake Qarun, Egypt. The population of this species has severely declined in the lake. For stock position assessment, cockles were collected in the winter of 2008 and 2018. The body size (length-frequency) distributions considerably varied among the collections. A single peak at 14 mm was present in 2008, and two peaks appeared ten years later (one at 13mm and another at 19 mm). The total weight, shell weight and flesh weight of individuals collected in 2008 exhibited isometric increase with shell length (SL). For samples collected in 2018, flesh weight increase was slower than shell length, indicating negative allometric growth. When 50% of the population achieved maturity (SM50), their sizes were 7.7 and 7.4 mm of SL for 2008 and 2018 collections, respectively, consistent with the sexual maturity being related to size rather than age. The overall sex ratios did not significantly differ from unity (1:1). The results of this study suggest that the species is sensitive to salinity changes and water pollution, with larger individuals being more resistant than the smaller ones. This may have implications for species' long-term reproduction and density.

AB  - 1. Birds respond to unpredictable events in the environment by releasing corticosterone, which triggers alternate responses to overcome stressful situations. However, it has been questioned whether altricial nestlings perceive and respond to ecological stressors. Although some studies show adrenal responsiveness in non-precocial species, others report a hyporesponsive period postulated to avoid deleterious effects of corticosterone.
   2. To test whether the environmental surroundings of nestlings modulate their stress levels we used a multi-tier comparative approach of plasma corticosterone: (1) within an individual, (2) among nestlings within a brood hierarchy, (3) among broods within a colony and (4) among individuals from different colonies.
   3. Nestlings reacted to our protocol by elevating their corticosterone. Baseline levels differed between colonies, and were higher in singleton nestlings compared with two- and three-chick broods, but there were no differences related to within-brood hierarchies, age or condition index.
   4. Acute levels were higher in older birds, suggesting a developmental change in adrenal responsiveness. Body condition also explained acute levels but only in singleton nestlings, with higher concentrations in heavier birds.
   5. Overall our results indicate that altricial nestlings do respond to a variety of environmental stressors, and variation in aspects of environmental quality (e.g. food supply, parental care) may be associated with the differences in stress.

AB  - Sea turtles are long-lived migratory species that are sensitive to anthropogenic impacts. Their condition reflects that of marine ecosystems and can serve as an indicator for environmental monitoring. However, evaluating body condition parameters, as a proxy for health, is challenging and often overlooked. The purpose of this study was to validate a straightforward method for assessing the body condition of nesting loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), and to investigate whether body condition was correlated with epibiont loading. To achieve this, 60 nesting loggerhead sea turtles were sampled and categorized into five body conditions ranging from very poor to very good. Injuries, skin deformities and plastron shape were used for this classification. Epibionts were collected from the same turtles and identified, with species richness, diversity, community structure and barnacle loading compared among body conditions. Epibiont communities were correlated with body condition as both species richness and abundance increased with a decline in turtle body condition. Barnacle epibionts showed great variation among different body conditions, having significantly higher numbers on turtles in poor condition. All parameters in this study showed similar distinctive relationships with body condition of loggerhead turtles from poor to very good body condition. The body condition index used in this study can be applied readily and, along with barnacle counts, can provide basic baseline information on turtle health.

AB  - In some small, often unstable, streams of the Gila River drainage, New Mexico, Gila trout Oncorhynchus gilae populations fluctuated numerically seasonally and annually. Few differences were noted in length-weight and size-structure comparisons, but Fulton condition index varied significantly. Time of sample and time since disturbance (natural or human-caused) were often associated with differences in condition. Other factors may include availability of prey, cannibalism and reproductive condition. The repeatedly sampled McKnight Creek population illustrated the resilience of Gila trout populations to natural disturbances. A scouring flood in 1988 caused a >90% reduction in numbers, but, by 1992, population structure was not substantially different from that of other streams. Likewise, juvenile/adult ratio, density, and per cent large specimens (greater than or equal to 200 mm total length) of most other samples were within the ranges for the McKnight Creek population. Gila trout density (no. fish min(-1) electrofishing) tended to increase with higher elevation and greater drainage density (stream km catchment(-1) km(-2)) but decreased with larger catchments. Information gained in this study demonstrates that a variety of factors must be considered when evaluating the relative well-being of Gila trout populations and illustrates the importance of larger, more hydrologically complex drainages to the long-term survival of Gila trout populations. degrees 1997 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB  - A comprehensive wading bird nesting database for the Everglades watershed in south Florida was compiled for the time period of 1903 through 2001. The limitations and applications of this database were assessed with the purpose of ultimately strengthening wading bird performance measures used as an index of ecosystem integrity for the Everglades restoration effort. The database is limited for some inferences, such as comparing between individual years, because of a lack of standardization in sampling methodology. As such, it should be used as an index of wading bird numbers rather than as an absolute population measure. However, the database is adequate to understand long-term, system-wide trends and the range of variability in nesting effort by the wading birds. Results from the analyses indicate that trends in numbers of nesting wading birds differ among species. It is estimated that the number of White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) and Wood Stork (Mycteria americana) nests have decreased by 87% and 78%, respectively, in the Everglades since the 1930s. There has also been a significant increase in the time interval between large nesting events for White Ibis and Wood Stork and a decrease in the magnitude of large nesting events for White Ibis over the past 70 years. The number of Great Egret (Ardea alba) nests has increased, the magnitude of large nesting events has increased, and the interval between large nesting events has decreased. There has also been a 61% decrease in the percentage of wading bird nests located in the southern Everglades and a 46% increase in the percentage of nests located in the central northern Everglades since the 1980s. These types of quantitative comparisons can be used to refine and strengthen the proposed wading bird performance measures used to gauge the health of the Everglades for the Everglades restoration effort. The time interval between large nesting events may be appropriate as an additional performance measure because it may capture the variable nature of wading bird numbers in response to hydrologic fluctuations in the Everglades.

Based on the conducted research and analysis of the data from the previous monitoring of these waters, it was concluded that due to the specificity of the studied surface water bodies, the following additional parametres - iron, manganese, phenols and mercury - should be added to the current operational and control monitoring. The acceptance of these additional indexes will allow more accurate and complete reflection of the water conditions, determination of the real environmental states of the water bodies and will improve the planning for their conservation.

AB  - In order to study the possibility of gaining commercial benefit from culturing an excess of one sex of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), comparative data on the growth rate and condition of male and female oysters are reported. Historically, measurement of sex-specific growth rate in oysters has been overlooked or confounded by protandric sex. The recent conclusion that the sex ratio of Pacific oysters is predominantly under genetic rather than environmental control introduces the possibility of manipulating sex ratio for commercial gain if they exhibit asynchronous sex-specific growth rates. Pacific oysters were cultured intertidally in Smoky Bay, south Australia. The observations, made over the 7-month gametogenic cycle from August to February to ensure no sex reversal, were of growth rates of male and female oysters and ambient chlorophyll a concentrations. Mean shell growth of female oysters was significantly faster than that of males (4.5 +/- 3.3 compared with 3.8 +/- 3.2 mum day(-1) mm(-1) total length). Sex-specific asymmetries in length and weight were generally significant and increased in magnitude during the 7-month study period, suggesting potential commercial benefits from increasing the proportion of cultured female oysters. The fastest increase in the sex-specific disparity in growth and condition came after the October chlorophyll a peak, suggesting that females utilize blooms more efficiently than males. Our results compare favourably with methods currently used to increase oyster growth (e.g. triploidy can provide growth gains of 13-51%).

AB  - Nucleic acid ratios (RNA:DNA, RNA:protein or total RNA content) have been successfully used as indirect measures of short-term growth in a range of marine organisms. However, using biochemical and physiological indicators in environmental impact assessment requires changes to be evaluated against a background of natural variability (e.g. spatial differences in the seasonal variability and size-dependence in bivalve condition). The natural temporal and spatial variability in nucleic acid ratios and condition indices in adult cockles Austrovenus stutchburyi was investigated along a gradient of increasing sediment grain size and wave exposure in an estuary on the east coast of New Zealand. The results were examined in relation to bivalve reproductive state, water temperature, and sediment and hydrodynamic characteristics of the estuary. The magnitude of seasonal variability in RNA was site-specific and increased towards more exposed sites, likely due to enhanced food availability at these sites. In addition, investigation of the effect of bivalve size class on nucleic acid ratios and condition indices revealed site-specific patterns. Thus, by integrating information over a range of spatial and temporal scales, we can increase our understanding of the interaction between the physiology of estuarine soft-sediment bivalves and their spatially and temporally complex environment to provide a sound basis for assessing the effects of added environmental stressors.

AB  - Economic and industrial growth in Malaysia has led to various environmental problems, which in turn affected the quality of human life and nature. At present, the management plans, particularly for river rehabilitation, are less effective in addressing issues related to Malaysian rivers. To date, most of the efforts undertaken have focused on evaluating the physicochemical properties of water, whereas biological evaluation determining the health of a river ecosystem is less attended to. Therefore, this study has aimed to develop a multimetric index and biocriteria applicable to the biological assessment of Malaysian streams. Four rivers in the state of Johor have been selected as the sources, each representing different gradients of land use. The reference and impaired sites both have been determined based on various physicochemical, instream features and riparian habitat quality criteria. The resulting candidate metrics have then been evaluated in terms of redundancy, sensitivity and responsiveness to environmental changes, using the stepwise procedures. Integration of six potential metrics across three categories (i.e. taxonomic richness, taxonomic composition, and tolerance and intolerance index) has consequently produced a four-level discriminatory biocriteria for river health assessment: < 20% (severely impaired); 20%-55% (moderately impaired); 56%-92% (slightly impaired); and > 93% (non-impaired). The re-scored result has revealed that the water quality of Sg Ayer Hitam Besar to be non-impaired, with excellent water quality. Meanwhile, Sg Berasau and Sg Mengkibol have slightly impaired water quality, whereas Sg Melana is moderately impaired with fair to poor water quality. Thus, this multimetric index has strongly differentiated the reference and impaired conditions accordingly, which substantiated the suitability of the discriminatory criteria for Johor stream assessment. Hence, the establishment of macroinvertebrate-based index of biotic integrity (MIBI) and biological criteria may provide indispensable information in managing river ecosystem more effectively.

AB  - The development of bioindicators for wetlands, especially ephemerally hydrated depressional and isolated wetlands, can be problematic because of seasonal changes in hydrology and target indicator organism biology. To determine if benthic diatoms could be used as a multi-season biological indicator of wetland condition in isolated forested wetlands of Florida, USA, I I wetlands were sampled twice during a 5-month period, once when dry, then again when hydrated. Sites sampled when dry had significantly higher diatom taxa richness at genus and species levels. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and multiple response permutation process analyses resulted in no obvious or significant wet/dry grouping of species or genus level abundance data. Five of seven diatom metrics of the Florida Wetland Condition Index (FWCI) for depressional forested wetlands were significantly linearly correlated (p < 0.05), while only one of seven metrics (a dissolved oxygen indicator) had a significantly different mean in paired t-test analyses. The final FWCI was significantly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.85, p < 0.001) between wet and dry sites, and no difference was found in mean FWCI score between wet and dry sites (t = -1.98, p = 0.076), suggesting that with additional research, benthic diatoms may be used to monitor and assess wetland condition regardless of season or site hydrologic conditions.

AB  - A land use regression (LUR) model for the mapping of NO2 concentrations in Ottawa, Canada was created based on data from 29 passive air quality samplers from the City of Ottawa's National Capital Air Quality Mapping Project and two permanent stations. Model sensitivity was assessed against three spatial representations of population: population at the dissemination area level, population at the dissemination block level and a dasymetrically derived population representation. A spatial database with land use, roads, population, zoning, greenspaces and elevation was created. Polycategorical zoning data were used in dasymetric mapping to spatially focus population data derived from the dissemination blocks to a sub-block level for comparison purposes. Dasymetric population mapping provided no significant LUR model improvement in explained variance when compared to block level population; however, both the former were significantly better than the dissemination area level population representations. However, where block level population is not available or too costly to acquire, our method using polycategorical zoning data provides a viable alternative in LUR modelling endeavours.

AB  - Comparisons between aquatic and terrestrial species provide an opportunity to examine how sex-specific adaptations interact with the environment to influence body shape. In terrestrial female tortoises, selection for fecundity favors the development of a large internal abdominal cavity to accommodate the clutch; in conspecific males, sexual selection favors mobility with large openings in the shell. To examine to what extent such trends apply in aquatic chelonians we compared the body shape of males and females of two aquatic turtles (Chelodina colliei and Mauremys leprosa). In both species, females were larger than males. When controlled for body size, females exhibited a greater relative internal volume and a higher body condition index than males; both traits potentially correlate positively with fecundity. Males were more streamlined (hydrodynamic), and exhibited larger openings in the shell providing more space to move their longer limbs; such traits probably improve mobility and copulation ability (the males chase and grab the female for copulation). Overall, although the specific constraints imposed by terrestrial and aquatic locomotion shape the morphology of chelonians differently (aquatic turtles were flatter, hence more hydrodynamic than terrestrial tortoises), the direction for sexual shape dimorphism remained unaffected. Our main conclusion is that the direction of sexual shape dimorphism is probably more consistent than sexual size dimorphism in the animal kingdom. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The reproductive cycle of two natural populations of the carpet-shell clam Ruditapes decussatus, in Araxos lagoon and in Evinos estuary, were determined by monthly examination of gonads from November 2000 to October 2001. The histological examination showed that in Araxos lagoon individuals were in the inactive stage from November to January, when gonadal development first took place. Ripe individuals appeared in April and the spawning activity begun in June and continued increasingly until October. The redevelopmental stage lasted from July to September and the duration of the completely spawned stage was from June to October. In Evinos estuary, the inactive stage took place from November to June. In some individuals gonadal development began in January and ripe individuals appeared in May. The spawning stage lasted from July to October, the redevelopmental stage appeared only in August and the completely spawned stage took place from August to September. The clams did not show any sign of hermaphroditism. The percentage of females was 57.5% in Araxos lagoon and 60% in Evinos estuary. The clams in Araxos lagoon had a more intense spawning activity, while clams in Evinos estuary stayed significantly longer in the inactive stage. The condition index presented a higher mean value and lower variability in Araxos lagoon than in Evinos estuary.

AB  - Shallow, saline inland lakes occur over large areas in Central-Europe and they bear exceptionally high biological conservation values. Climate change and anthropogenic activities threaten their natural conditions, or even their existence. These aquatic ecosystems are exposed to multiple stress like naturally high conductivity, pH and nutrient load with very low transparency for light. As they are subjects of criteria set by the EC Water Framework Directive and biological conservation managment, there is an urgent need for developing a suitable quality index for their ecological status assessment. As one major Biological Quality Element, benthic diatoms may provide a reliable basis for their ecological status indication. Here, in a large data set covering the soda lakes of the Carpathian basin, we developed a species-and a trait-based diatom ecological status index. First, based on the weighted average method, we developed a type specific, species-based diatom index (DISP = Diatom Index for Soda Pans) using conductivity as master variable of environmental constrains; and therefore the ecological status in soda lakes. Furthermore, by adapting and improving further the widely-used diatom ecological guild concept, we also developed an alternative trait-based index, which helps avoiding some limitations arising from the obvious complexity of the taxonomy-based approach. Our DISP index covered a significantly larger species pool for index calculation, and responded to conductivity in a more reliable way compared to other available indices. In the trait-based index (TBI) motility, small cell size, and less roundish, more elongated shape as functional and morphological traits indicated pristine ecological conditions (i.e high conductivity) of the soda pans. Planktic life form, high and low ecological guild profiles, as well as the large cell size indicated worse ecological conditions (e.g. lower conductivity). Our study highlights that benthic diatoms provide a reliable basis for ecological status assessment in soda lakes. While both the taxonomic and the functional trait approaches performed well in our analysis, the success of the trait-based approach may enable the use of our TBI index in biomonitoring and conservation management of soda lakes outside of the Carpathian basin, independently of the geographic location.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY

AB  - The gametogenic cycle of the leech, Asiaticobdella buntonensis from two localities was investigated and found to be simultaneously hermaphroditic. Spermatogenesis reached a state of maturation before oogenesis in a cycle of summer reproductive maturation and winter quiescence comparable to related Hirudinidae. Leeches collected f rom the more northerly, warmer water bodies on the Makhatini Flats (32-degrees 08'E / 27-degrees 27'S) were similar, although there is some evidence that their gametes matured earlier and remained in a mature condition longer than those collected from the more temperate collection site at Happy Valley Nature Reserve, Durban (31-degrees 00'E / 30-degrees 00'S). An understanding of the gametogenic cycle of this potential medicinal leech under natural conditions, provides an index against which the effects of manipulating laboratory conditions on mass rearing can be inferred.

AB  - Mussel culture was practiced in the raft system in Sinop area Black Sea, from May 2005 to May 2006. One-year old rope grown mussel with a mean length of 40.28 +/- 0.51 mm and a mean live weight of 6.06 +/- 0.20 g were stocked in nylon socks, and suspended from the raft system. Effects of environmental factors including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, seston, particulate inorganic matter and particulate organic matter on some growth parameters were monitored during the experimental period. At the end of the experimental period, the mean mussel shell length was 58.86 +/- 2.81 mm, while mean live weigth was 18.53 +/- 2.25 g. The growth rate was low during the winter and resumed in March. The monthly distribution of meat yield changed between 16.23 and 23.93% with a mean of 20.55 +/- 0.78%. The minimum and maximum meat yield were in April and July, respectively. There was a positive correlation between meat yield and particulate organic matter (P < 0.05). The highest value of Specific Growth Rate (SGR) was in the first four months when the mussels Were smaller size and food availability was higher. The final production was 7.97 +/- 0.18 kg per meter of rope. In the light of these results, mussel culture in the raft system was discussed.

AB  - Density, age structure, and growth rates of wild brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Whetstone Brook in northcentral Massachusetts were monitored for 4 years before and 3 years during limestone treatment to mitigate acidic conditions. The population density of brook trout increased significantly during treatment. Liming did not have any significant effects on the growth rates of brook trout or brown trout. Actual survival rates of brook trout and brown trout were not calculated due to the low density of both species, but more older individuals of both species were captured during the treatment period. Fulton condition factors (an index of fish condition) increased significantly for both brook trout and brown trout during treatment. Seven-day in situ bioassays of brown trout and rainbow trout demonstrated that liming improved the chemical environment for fish in Whetstone Brook. During a pretreatment bioassay in 1987, 100% rainbow trout mortality was observed at both the control and treatment stations in Whetstone Brook. Brown trout mortality was 67% in the control station and 70% in the treatment station. The pH during the 1987 bioassay averaged 4.90 in the control station and 4.99 in the treated station. During a bioassay conducted in 1990 after treatment began, rainbow trout mortality was 100% in the control station and 0% in the treatment station. Brown trout mortality was 17% in the control station and 0% in the treatment station. The pH during the 1990 bioassay averaged 5.23 in the control station and 6.60 in the treatment station. Analysis of total aluminum in the gills of fish from the 1990 bioassay revealed higher levels in fish from the control station than in those from the treatment station.

AB  - With the passage of the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act in 2000, coastal states were mandated to assess and sample coastal recreational waters for bacterial ambient water quality parameters. The assessment of beach sites required the application of federal guidelines and a tiered approach to delineating the beaches. Eighty-seven beach sites in Oregon were evaluated and ranked by use, available information, pollution threats, sanitary survey and monitoring data results, exposure considerations, and economic/development factors. This ranking resulted in 19 high priority beaches (tier 1), five medium priority beaches (tier 2), 23 low priority beaches, and 40 beaches with a rank of none in Oregon. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) is designed to describe status, trends and spatial pattern of indicators of condition of the nation's ecological resources. The proposed sampling design for EMAP is based on a triangular systematic grid and employs both variable probability and double sampling. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator provides the foundation of the design-based estimation strategy used in EMAP. However, special features of EMAP designed to accommodate the complexity of sampling environmental resources on a national scale require modifications of standard variance estimation procedures as well as development of new techniques. An overview of variance estimation methods proposed for application to EMAP's sampling strategy for discrete resources is presented.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) demands consideration of normative definitions for assessing ecological state of marine waters. For phytoplankton, 'deviations from the ideal' need to be considered for species composition and abundance, average biomass and the occurrence of blooms. A combination of phytoplankton metrics has been developed which, when considered in combination, should provide a confident assessment of the ecological state of each water body under assessment. The aim of this study was to evaluate phytoplankton community structure in different coastal and estuarine water bodies within England and Wales, and to contribute evidence towards the development of a community-based phytoplankton indicator. Influences of seasonality on the species assemblage were tested using a long-term data set available from a long-term monitoring site just offshore of Plymouth, UK. There is a substantive seasonal influence to the data, with a maximum of 10-14 common species (out of a potential 20) reoccurring within the same calendar month over a 10-year time span. Comparisons between reference and test water bodies give a range of common species of between 3 and 11 species within water type and season. A statistical and qualitative approach for comparing the most common species occurring between a reference and test site were tested for development of a WFD phytoplankton assessment tool. Overall, the results indicate that there are distinct phytoplankton assemblages over seasons which could form the basis of a community assessment metric. However, differences in boundary conditions are negligible between the different areas. There is evidence that community populations may be ubiquitous across marine water types in England and Wales, and development of generic seasonal lists across typologies could be appropriate in the further development of this tool.

AB  - A two-season sampling program in the Gulf of Kalloni, Greece, documents the foraminiferal fauna of this deep, narrow embayment and demonstrates a close relationship between circulation dynamics and the composition of foraminiferal assemblages. Seventeen stations were sampled in April 1993 and twelve in September 1993. The distribution of foraminiferal assemblages was not compared to selective measures of environmental parameters, as usually done, but to the circulation of tide- and wind-induced currents computed on the basis of a 2D vertical integrated hydrodynamic model. The asymmetric extension of marine influence, resulting from the water circulation, and the greater confinement in the center of gyratory currents clearly affects the distribution of foraminiferal assemblages. Owing to these relationships, six dominant species serve as good descriptors of hydrodynamic conditions; of those, Ammonia tepida and Haynesina sp. are the most important. Q-mode and R-mode cluster analyses, as well as the environment index (Ic) calculated on the basis of selected species, also show clear relationships with hydrodynamics, such as more restricted marine conditions away from the mouth and a stronger marine influence along the southern coast. In particular, le appears to serve as a useful tool for a quick characterization of the environment, including the detection of any anthropogenic impact. The most significant impact, high organic matter input, results in a lower density and species richness, a higher Ic index and increased dominance of the tolerant species Ammonia tepida and Haynesina sp.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of salicylic acid (SA), beeswax waste extract (BWE) and licorice extract (LE) as novel biostimulants, on drought-induced oxidative stress on sesame. The treatments consisted of three drought stress conditions (full irrigation, 90 % field capacity (FC); moderate stress, 60 % FC; and severe stress, 30 % FC) together with four exogenous foliar applications (control, water; LE, 5000 ppm; BWE, 2000 ppm; and SA, 1.5 mM). Plants subjected to drought stress displayed significant reduction in plant height, leaf area index, biological and seed yield, chlorophyll a and b content, quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), net photosynthetic rate (P-n), stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration (T-r) and water use efficiency (WUE). Drought stress stimulated Malondialdehyde (MDA), proline, protein and carotenoid contents, and catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), Guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activity, while the exogenous foliar application of substances mitigated the oxidative damages. The alleviated effect of BWE on drought stress was more effective than those of LE and SA. In conclusion, it could be recommended that the application of the natural substances may lead to overcoming the negative effects of drought stress by regulating osmoprotectants content and antioxidant defense system, increasing mineral nutrients in plant organs and adjusting photosynthesis systems; consequently, contributing to improving the sesame productivity.

AB  - Freshwater mussels (order Unionoida) face multiple environmental stressors, which pose serious conservation challenges to this diverse assemblage of aquatic invertebrates. Of these stressors, elevated water temperature from global climate change and other anthropogenic sources may be the most ubiquitous and could be placing many mussel populations dangerously close to their thermal maxima. We tested the hypothesis that elevated water temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C) adversely affected physiological responses in adults of four North American species of mussels (Amblema plicata, Elliptio complanata, Fusconaia flava and Lampsilis cardium) in 21-d laboratory tests. Oxygen consumption rates were directly affected by temperature in E.complanata and L.cardium, and indirectly affected by temperature in A.plicata and F.flava. Rates of O-2 consumption were generally positively correlated with water temperature. Ammonium excretion rates varied significantly with temperature in E.complanata and generally increased with temperature. The amount of O-2 consumed relative to nitrogen excreted (O:N ratio), varied significantly with temperature in A.plicata, E.complanata and F.flava. The tissue condition index varied among temperatures and species. These data suggest that elevated temperatures can alter metabolic rates in native mussels and may decrease the amount of energy that is available for key biological processes, such as survival, growth and reproduction.

AB  - Pea (Pisum sativum L var. Laguna) seeds were submitted to extrusion process at 129, 135 and 142 degrees C and modifications on the proximate composition and nutritional parameters were evaluated. Peas were a good source of protein (24 g/100 g), amino acids (sulphur amino acids were the limiting ones), dietary fibre (18 g/100 g), carbohydrates (53 g/100 g), energy (330 kcal/100 g), riboflavin and thiamine (0.1 -0.2 mg/100 g). Pea seeds also contained non-nutritive compounds such as alpha-galactosides (4 g/100 g), phytic acid (0.4 g/100 g) and trypsin inhibitor activity (2 TIU/mg). Extrusion cooking caused a slight increase of protein and fat content, whilst it reduced dietary fibre, thiamine and alpha-galactosides, and led to negligible trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) levels. The protein quality of pea measured by biological indexes (net protein utilisation, net protein ratio, relative net protein ratio, true protein digestibility and biological value) was not affected by extrusion treatments. Protein quality measured by chemical indexes (chemical score and protein digestibility corrected amino acid score) decreased in processed peas. Among extruded peas, those processed at 135 degrees C presented the highest chemical indexes. Therefore, the aforementioned condition could be considered adequate for the manufacture of novel pea-derived products with high nutritive value. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pandalidae is one of the most diverse families of marine shrimps. Most studies on pandalid shrimps focus on their vertical zonation, and there are few studies on their horizontal distribution and their relation to environmental factors. The aim of this paper was to study the small-scale spatial and temporal patterns of pandalid shrimps in two nearby areas off the Balearic Islands that have different environmental regimes, and determine the relationship between these patterns and the environmental conditions. Information was obtained from seasonal and annual experimental surveys. The abundance and biomass of all the pandalid shrimps caught as well as the length, weight, sex and maturity stage of the most abundant species were recorded. Environmental parameters were obtained from seasonal experimental surveys and included data on hydrography, trophic resources and sediment characteristics. Information about the trawl fleet was obtained through onboard sampling, and daily landings data were obtained from sales records. Eight pandalid species were found during the annual and seasonal experimental bottom trawl surveys carried out around the Balearic Islands. These species showed clear spatial differences in their population dynamics at the two study sites, the Algerian sub-basin (AsB) and the Balearic sub-basin (BsB), which could be related to the different environmental conditions of the two sub-basins. The relative importance of pandalid shrimps of the genus Plesionika in the slope crustacean communities was higher in the Algerian sub-basin. The abundances of Plesionika martia, Plesionika acanthonotus, Plesionika giglioli and Plesionika antigai were higher in the Algerian sub-basin, and only Plesionika heterocarpus, the most benthic species among those analysed, was more abundant in the Balearic sub-basin, where trophic webs are supported largely by suprabenthos rather than zooplankton biomass. The influence of water masses depends on the specific bathymetric distribution, and the shallowest species (P. antigai was related to the Western Mediterranean Intermediate Waters, while the deepest species (P. martia and P. acanthonotus) were related to the warmer and more saline Levantine Intermediate Waters and Western Mediterranean Deep Waters. The two species found in intermediate waters (P. heterocarpus and P. giglioli) had a deeper distribution in the Algerian sub-basin, where the layer of Levantine Intermediate Waters is wider. The mean length of P. heterocarpus was higher in the Balearic sub-basin, and that of P. mania was higher in the Algerian sub-basin. The condition index was higher in the BsB than in the AsB for both P. heterocarpus and P. mania. This could be because the BsB is influenced to a greater extent by slope fronts that increase the primary production in the area, and thus enrich the trophic chain. The condition index also showed seasonal differences, which could be related to the reproductive cycle and to the availability of potential food resources. The strong relations found between the geographical distribution of the pandalid shrimps in the Balearic Islands and the environmental variables imply that there are important differences between populations of nearby areas when the environmental conditions in which they live differ.

AB  - This study investigated the somatic growth and energy allocation strategy of two sympatric hake species (Merluccius polli and Merluccius senegalensis), coexisting under the strong influence of the Mauritanian upwelling. The results revealed that ontogeny, bathymetry, geography and reproduction shaped the differences found between the condition dynamics of the two species. Aside from species-specific differences, individuals were observed in better condition in the northernmost area (more influenced by the permanent upwelling) and in the deepest waters, probably the most favourable habitat for Merluccius spp. Both species also displayed contrasting trade-offs in energy allocation probably due to the dissimilarity of their habitats, which favours the existence of divergent adaptive strategies in response to different ontogenic requirements. It was hypothesized that M. polli invests in mass and energy reserves while sacrificing growth, as larger sizes may not provide an ecological advantage in a deeper and more stable environment. Moreover, M. senegalensis capitalizes on a steady growth without major disruptions, enabling earlier spawning at the expense of a lower somatic mass, which is fitting to a less stable shallower environment. This study sheds new light on differences in the biological traits and life strategies of Merluccius spp., which permit their overlap in a complex upwelling system and may contribute to the long-lasting scientific-based management of these species.

AB  - The interactions between cod (Gadus morhua), herring (Clupea harengus) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) in the Central Baltic Sea were examined with a simple dynamic model, an alternative to more complicated and data-demanding multispecies and ecosystem models. The main aims of the study were to compare the effect of alternative structures on the model output and examine the control relationships in the fish assemblage under different environmental conditions. The effect of environmental conditions was modelled using a stock-recruitment equation for cod incorporating an environmental index. The model output was especially sensitive to the functional response in predation by cod on herring and sprat. The type II functional response led to a collapse of the clupeid stocks when cod was abundant, while the type III response produced more realistic stock dynamics. According to the simulations, an abundant cod stock was able to keep the sprat stock at a low level, while the herring stock was less affected and benefited from the decreased density of sprat. Simulation of different fishing scenarios indicated that reducing fishing mortality to the level currently advised by ICES would allow the recovery of the cod stock even in unfavourable environmental conditions.

AB  - In 1981, James R. Karr's paper 'Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities' provided the first description of a multimetric procedure to assess the biotic integrity of aquatic ecosystems. To assess the contribution of the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) and ideas proposed by Karr for the management of aquatic ecosystems, we carried out a scientometric analysis of the papers published from 1981 to 2011 that cited Karr's study. The papers were obtained from Thomson Reuters' database (ISI Web of Knowledge) in October 2011. We used all papers that cited 'Karr, 1981' to assess temporal trends in citations and to identify which journals cited the index most frequently. A total of 93 papers were selected from the two journals that most frequently cited Karr's study, namely Hydrobiologia and Ecological Indicators. For each paper selected, we determined whether the study was empirical, theoretical, or methodological. For empirical papers we assessed the type of environment where the study was carried out, the indicator organisms used, and whether the IBI was applied. To identify which ideas suggested by Karr have been discussed in the literature, we assessed all papers found. In the time frame studied, 734 papers cited 'Karr, 1981'. The number of citations increased significantly with time. Most papers that cited 'Karr, 1981' were empirical, carried out in rivers and streams, and used fish as bioindicators. The main ideas discussed in these studies were related to the creation and use of the IBI, as well as to limitations and difficulties in its application. Our results suggest that the ideas proposed by Karr have contributed to the conservation of aquatic ecosystems. However, criteria for choosing different metrics, as well as the definition of reference conditions, are issues that need to be addressed in order to make the IBI a more robust index.

AB  - In the present study, specimens of the invasive clam, Corbicula fluminea, were collected above and below possible sources of potentially toxic trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn) in the Altamaha River system (Georgia, USA). Bioaccumulation of these elements was quantified, along with environmental (water and sediment) concentrations. Hierarchical linear models were used to account for variability in tissue concentrations related to environmental (site water chemistry and sediment characteristics) and individual (growth metrics) variables while identifying the strongest relations between these variables and trace element accumulation. The present study found significantly elevated concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Hg downstream of the outfall of kaolin-processing facilities, Zn downstream of a tire cording facility, and Cr downstream of both a nuclear power plant and a paper pulp mill. Models of the present study indicated that variation in trace element accumulation was linked to distance upstream from the estuary, dissolved oxygen, percentage of silt and clay in the sediment, elemental concentrations in sediment, shell length, and bivalve condition index. By explicitly modeling environmental variability, the Hierarchical linear modeling procedure allowed the identification of sites showing increased accumulation of trace elements that may have been caused by human activity. Hierarchical linear modeling is a useful tool for accounting for environmental and individual sources of variation in bioaccumulation studies.

AB  - Phenotypic differentiation between populations is thought to occur mainly at spatial scales where gene-flow is restricted and selection regimes differ. However, if gene flow is nonrandom, dispersal may reinforce, rather than counteract, evolutionary differentiation, meaning that differences occurring over small scales might have a genetic basis. The purpose of this study was to determine the cause of differences in mean phenotype between two parts of a population of great tits Parus major, separated by < 3 km. We conducted a partial cross-fostering experiment between two contrasting parts of this population to separate genetic and environmental sources of variation, and to test for gene-environment interaction. We found strong environmental effects on nestling size, mass and condition index, with nestlings reared in a low density part of the population being larger, heavier and in better condition, than those in a high density part, irrespective of their origin. In addition, we found smaller, but significant, differences in nestling condition and shape associated with the areas that birds originated from, suggesting the presence of genetic differences between parts of this population. There was no evidence of gene-environment interaction for any character. This experiment is thus consistent with previous analyses suggesting that differences between parts of this population had evolved recently, apparently due to phenotype-dependent dispersal, and indicates that population differentiation can be maintained over small spatial scales despite extensive dispersal.

AB  - Comparative studies of streams with altered versus conserved riparian zones are important to evaluate the degree of alterations caused by inappropriate use of these streams' vital buffer zones. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of riparian deforestation on the habitat structure of southern Brazilian Amazonian headwater streams, as well as to provide elements for impact assessment and the monitoring of these water bodies. We selected ten sites and two headwater streams at each site; one stream was located in an area with preserved riparian vegetation (pristine streams) and the other stream in a deforested riparian zone (altered streams). Stretches of these streams were analyzed across hydrological periods (dry period, beginning of the rainy period, and end of the rainy period) for hydromorphological aspects, water physical-chemical variables, and habitat integrity (proportion of forestation in buffer zones and habitat integrity index). Compared to pristine streams in all the hydrological periods analyzed, altered streams presented lower oxygen concentration ((similar to)1.0 mg/L), an increase of 1 C-o in water temperature, and less organic material availability. We found that riparian deforestation affects habitat structure variability among hydrological periods, making them more homogeneous. Therefore, beyond the necessary broadening of the spatial scale of studies in this region, monitoring these understudied headwater stream environments is also crucial for determining the magnitude of deforestation effects on these vulnerable aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has ongoing programs to encourage the evaluation of stream conditions based on biological indicators. Bioassessments reveal impairments but do not identify causes of impairments, a necessary step in the restoration of aquatic life. Furthermore, changes in biological condition are often caused by multiple stressors (chemical, physical, biological). To address this need, the USEPA has developed guidance to identify probable causes of biological impairments in aquatic ecosystems and to provide a structure for organizing the scientific evidence to make a credible case. The concepts and organizational structure of the process have potential applications to most ecoepidemiological investigations.

AB  - The phenotypic variation of living organisms is shaped by genetics, environment, and their interaction. Understanding phenotypic plasticity under natural conditions is hindered by the apparently complex environment and the interacting genes and pathways. Herein, we report findings from the dissection of rice flowering-time plasticity in a genetic mapping population grown in natural long-day field environments. Genetic loci harboring four genes originally discovered for their photoperiodic effects (Hd1, Hd2, Hd5, and Hd6) were found to differentially respond to temperature at the early growth stage to jointly determine flowering time. The effects of these plasticity genes were revealed with multiple reaction norms along the temperature gradient. By coupling genomic selection and the environmental index, accurate performance predictions were obtained. Next, we examined the allelic variation in the four flowering-time genes across the diverse accessions from the 3000 Rice Genomes Project and constructed haplotypes at both individual-gene and multigene levels. The geographic distribution of haplotypes revealed their preferential adaptation to different temperature zones. Regions with lower temperatures were dominated by haplotypes sensitive to temperature changes, whereas the equatorial region had a majority of haplotypes that are less responsive to temperature. By integrating knowledge from genomics, gene cloning and functional characterization, and environment quantification, we propose a conceptual model with multiple levels of reaction norms to help bridge the gaps among individual gene discovery, field-level phenotypic plasticity, and genomic diversity and adaptation.

AB  - Macroalgae is a biological key element for the assessment of the ecological status in coastal waters in the frame of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC). Here we propose a methodology for monitoring water quality based on the cartography of littoral and upper-sublittoral rocky-shore communities (CARLIT, in short). With the use of spatial databases, GIs, and available information about the value of rocky-shore communities as indicators of water quality, it is possible to obtain an environmental quality index representative of the ecological status of rocky coasts. This index, which completely fulfils the requirements of the WFD, is expressed as a ratio between the observed values in the sector of shore that is being assessed and the expected value in a reference condition zone with the same substrate and coastal morphology (Ecological Quality Ratio, EQR). The application of this index to the coast of Catalonia (North-Western Mediterranean) is presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Huanglongbing (HLB), the citrus disease associated with the bacteria 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus', is the most important threat of the Mexican citrus industry. Since 2009, this bacterium has been detected in 11 out of 23 citrus producing states of the country, although with a limited distribution in each state. The Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama [Hemiptera: Psyllidae]) is the vector of this bacterium; the insect is distributed in all the citrus growing zones of Mexico. Presently, the lime production zone in the Mexican states of Colima, Jalisco, Michoacan, Nayarit, and Sinaloa, near to the Pacific Ocean coast, is the most affected by this disease. One of the main strategies to retard or stop the advance of HLB consists in the regional management of the psyllid populations. In order to contribute to the support of this strategy we analyzed the daily courses of temperature and rainfall all over the country to classify the citrus zones according to the probability of occurrence of favorable conditions for rapid and continuous psyllid reproduction. The results indicate that one of the most important regions of sweet orange production of Mexico, southern Veracruz and the region named "La Huasteca", where the states of Veracruz, Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosi and Hidalgo converge, represent the zones with the highest risk for an accelerated reproduction of the psyllid.

AB  - In the framework of climate change, it has been predicted that the Mediterranean Basin will experience the greatest loss of biodiversity, because it will be heavily affected by several drivers of change. In particular, Italy is an important geographical area because it represents a key hotspot of biodiversity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of global climate chan-e on terrestrial small mammals (Rodents and Soricomorphs) in Italy. Barn owl (7:1,to alba) pellet analysis was applied to study the temporal variations of microteriocoenoses structure. We revisited 21 roosting, sites which had been previously studied by other authors and we carried out a similar study in order to analyse possible changes in small mammal communities. Analyses covered a period of about 30 years and the gap between the first and second sampling ranges from I I to 33 years. Collecting localities were grouped according to the Bioclimatic Map of Italy. Several ecological indexes were applied and their changes through time were analysed for each Bioclimatic Region. Results show a significant increase in thermoxerophilic species in the last thirty years, particularly in the Mediterranean Region. This observed rise is likely due to global and local warming. In fact, higher temperatures, lower precipitation and increasing xerothermic conditions could have facilitated the spread of thermoxerophilic species. The persistence of such a trend could lead to a series of serious ecological consequences in the future, including a possible reduction in biodiversity.

AB  - Ecological-hydrological analysis of erosion processes on the key watersheds of Southern Ural steppe was used to determine the surface runoff as a function of the physico-geographic and anthropogenic conditions, i.e., snow storage and soil moisture reserves before winter, whose contribution reaches 68-81%. The rate of humus losses in chernozems and dark chestnut soils was calculated for different periods in accordance with erosion stress and the extent of the economic development of the territory. Agroecological types of arable lands with different surface runoff characteristics, rates of natural soil formation, and erosion-related soil losses are identified. Measures aimed to reduce humus losses in soils are proposed. Relationships between the rates of soil formation and erosion losses are proposed to be used as ecological-hydrological criterion (index) of soil stability.

AB  - This research investigated the potential of cement stabilized shale quarry dust for possible use as road foundation material. From the results, the shale consists mainly of SiO2 (27.7-60.1%), Al2O3 (7.30-17.9%), CaO (3.91-32.3%) and LOI (4.93-18.8%). The shale quarry dust (SQD) in its natural state had an average liquid limit (LL) as 38%, plasticity index (PI) as 24% and fines fraction as 14%, which is regarded as poor material according to American Society for Testing and Materials recommendation. The plasticity, compaction, California bearing ratio (CBR) and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the SQD were evaluated in its natural state and when mixed with varying percentages of cement. When stabilized with 3% cement, the strength parameters such as CBR and UCS showed improvement by about 20 and 25%, respectively, while the swellability indicators; plasticity and shrinkage limit reduced by about 56.2 and 46.6%, respectively, suggesting substantial improvement in the volume stability, strength and stress-strain properties and continued strength gain with time of the cement treated materials. The presence of the carbonate minerals contributed to the improved strength of the SQD for a given cement type and dosage. The beneficial changes in geotechnical properties of SQD when treated with 6% Portland cement, indicate that treated shale material satisfy most Nigerian specifications for highway fill and embankment, base and sub-base material. Their use, in heavy traffic highway, however, may be handled with caution as the continued high LL may likely imply some swelling on moisture influx.

AB  - The Loosdrecht lakes are a system of shallow, interconnected, peat lakes in the centre of The Netherlands. The main environmental functions of the Loosdrecht lakes are nature and recreation. From the point of view of the Dutch policy, a Specific Environmental Quality ('Bijzondere Milieukwaliteit') should be set for these lakes.
   The most serious environmental problem of the area is eutrophication. The Loosdrecht lakes have, by increasing external phosphorus loading, changed, from clear lakes with few macrophytes, followed by a period of abundant characean growth, to turbid lakes dominated by cyanobacteria and detrital matter. Eutrophication was counteracted by use of sewerage systems and dephosporization of the supply water. The resultant decrease in external phosphorus loading did not result in a decrease of turbidity by suspended particles.
   The eutrophication of the lake ecosystems was described as a series of phases. One of those phases, the status around 1940, has been used as an ecological reference system.
   By means of a graphical presentation technique, the so-called 'AMOEBE-approach', the state of the environment of the Loosdrecht lakes has been visualized. Thirty-two ecological parameters, including both biotic and abiotic factors, have been selected and quantified. Concrete target values for these parameters have been derived from historical reports and from Lake Western Loenderveen, located close to the Loosdrecht lakes, but less eutrophic.
   The general conclusion is that the state of the environment of the Loosdrecht lakes is far from what is required with respect to a Specific Environmental Quality, as many of the selected parameters, like water transparency, total phosphorus, mineral nitrogen, cyanobacteria, bream, pike, macrophytes, birds and otter, deviate by over an order of magnitude from their desired levels.

AB  - The concepts of ecosystem health and ecosystem integrity are discussed and found to be ecologically inappropriate. The phrase ecosystem health is based on an invalid analogy with human health requiring acceptance of an optimum condition and homeostatic processes maintaining the ecosystem at a definable optimum state. Similarly, ecosystem integrity is not an objective, quantifiable property of an ecosystem. Health and integrity are not inherent properties of an ecosystem and are not supported by either empirical evidence or ecological theory.

AB  - Selective logging is the main anthropogenic disturbance in tropical forests, driving shifts in species abundances. Body size and body condition are important metrics of fitness that may be affected by habitat degradation. We conducted a four-year study to investigate how selective logging impacted the body size and body condition index (BCI) of 55 Bornean bird species and whether changes in body metrics were associated with shifts in relative population abundance. Frugivorous and omnivorous birds had reduced body size in selectively logged versus unlogged forest, but we found no evidence for selective removal of individuals driven by sex differences or post-fledging body size, indicating different developmental conditions for frugivores and omnivores in logged forest. Change in body size between forest types showed no clear patterns for insectivorous birds, and did not differ between IUCN categories. BCI of birds was affected by study year, suggesting an effect of climatic conditions on food availability, but not by logging. At the community level, post-logging change in population abundance was not associated with reduced body size, although between species variation suggests that adverse environmental conditions and different coping strategies underlie body size reductions in logged forest. Our study suggests that body size is a valuable metric to assess how logging impacts forest birds, pointing towards potential functional consequences related to seed dispersal within logged forests and need for improved silvicultural practices.

AB  - Environmental regulations often have the objective of eliminating the lower tail of an index of environmental quality. That part of the distribution of environmental quality moves somewhere above a threshold and where in the original distribution it moves is a function of the control strategy chosen. This paper provides an approach for estimating the economic benefits of different distributional changes as the worst environmental conditions are removed. The proposed approach is illustrated by examining shifts in visibility at Class I visibility areas (National Parks and wilderness areas) that would occur with implementation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Regional Haze Program. In this application we show that people value shifts in the distribution of visibility and place a higher value on the removal of a low visibility day than on the addition of a high visibility day. We found that respondents would pay about $120 per year in the Southeast U.S. and about $80 per year in the Southwest U.S. for improvement programs that remove the 20% worst visibility days.

AB  - The assessment of the ecological status, as required by the Water Framework Directive (WFD), plays an important role in coastal zone management, but only a small number of ecological indices are applicable on rocky bottoms. In this study, we apply a previously defined ecological quality index based on the cartography of littoral and upper-sublittoral rocky-shore communities (CARLIT), based on the sensitivity of algae dominated communities to anthropogenic impacts along a moderate urban gradient. We also apply this index in four Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), proposed as reference sites at a regional scale. After comparing the outputs with water variables and other quality indices, we can affirm that (1) the CARLIT index is suitable to detect different kinds of anthropogenic pressures, that (2) the choice of proper reference sites is a focal point in the fulfilment of the WFD (Water Framework Directive) and that (3) historical data are important to define reference conditions and the degradation of ecological status.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for the growth and development of fruit trees, playing an important role in photosynthesis, nucleic acid synthesis, and enzyme activity regulation. The plasticity of plant phenotypic has been investigated in diverse species under conditions of P-deficiency or P-excess. Based on these researches, P level fluctuations in different species result in different characteristics of the response. Nevertheless, little is known about the response of pear seedling rootstock (Pyrus betulifolia Bunge) to the changing of P levels. To explore the effects of different levels of P on the growth of pear seedling rootstock, we performed the hydroponic assays to determine and analyze the biological indexes including growth parameters, photosynthetic rate, root and shoot morphological traits, and concentrations of macro- and micronutrients. The results show that either deficiency or excess of P inhibited the growth and development of pear seedling rootstock. Root growth (down 44.8%), photosynthetic rate (down 59.8%), and acid phosphatase (ACP) activity (down 44.4%) were inhibited under the P-deficiency conditions (0mM), compared with normal P conditions (1mM). On the other hand, dark green leaves, suppression of root elongation (down 18.8%), and photosynthetic rate (down 25%) were observed under regimes of excessive P, compared with normal P conditions (1mM). Furthermore, the root concentration of not only P, but also those of other mineral nutrients were affected by either P treatment. In brief, these results indicated that a careful choice of P fertilizer supply is crucial to ensuring normal growth and development of pear seedling rootstock.

AB  - In the present study, we analyzed a unique phytophysiognomy in the Amazon region, which is formed by savanna-like vegetation on iron-rich soil (known locally ascanga) located within an iron-ore mining region. We used the habitat template theory to test the hypothesis that changes in the physical-chemical properties of streams and the physical structure of their habitats at in-stream and micro-basin (landscape) levels affect the taxonomic and trophic composition of immature aquatic insects. For this, we used a local environmental matrix composed of nine physical-chemical and structural habitat variables, together with the Habitat Integrity Index. We also calculated landscape metrics based on the area of the micro-basin, such as relief, slope, mean current flow, and vegetation cover. We divided the aquatic insects into five functional feeding groups based on their diet and food sources. Our results indicate that changes in the trophic level of the insects of the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera are more easily observed than the taxonomic structure of communities. The loss of environmental integrity and vegetation cover were responsible for 84% of the variation observed in the composition of functional feeding groups (FFGs). Our study shows that aquatic insect communities in thecangaand in the Amazon regions dominated by forest require specific in-stream and landscape conditions. These findings reinforce the need for the preservation of areas ofcangavegetation, which not only have a unique levels of biological diversity, but are also targeted for the exploitation of their economically valuable natural resources.

AB  - We investigated the influence of mesohabitats on fish communities and on attributes of a multimetric index of fish integrity in the River Meuse basin. Three consecutive 150 m sectors in a Meuse tributary (Ourthe, Belgium), each divided in two or three sub-sections presenting various percentages of mesohabitats (riffles, runs and pools), were sampled by electrofishing. In each sub-section, relative and absolute biomasses of each fish species were estimated. The presence of limnophilic cyprinids was inversely correlated (r(2) = 0.70 and 0.56 for absolute and relative biomass, respectively) with the percentage of riffles. Salmonids preferred runs and their absolute biomass was highly dependent (r(2) = 0.71) on the proportion of this mesohabitat, whereas biomass of limnophilic cyprinids was highly correlated (r(2) = 0.75 and r(2) = 0.82 for absolute and relative biomass, respectively) with pools. A positive correlation (r(2) = 0.58) was established between relative biomass of predators and the percentage of this mesohabitat. An IBI was calculated for the three sectors on the basis of results from the entire Meuse catchment. Scores of most metrics showed low variation among sectors but values of two metrics (% of individuals as tolerant, % of individuals as ubiquitous spawners) were greatest in sector 2, where pools predominated. Further, the lowest IBI score (51/65, integrity class: fair to good) was recorded in sector 2 where pools dominated, while sector I (where runs dominated) obtained the highest score (63/65, integrity class: excellent). Sector 3 which has a balanced proportion of riffles and runs obtained an intermediate score (57/65). Considering the response of IBI to the natural variation of mesohabitat proportions, it appears that an accurate sampling requires the prospection of a variety of mesohabitats (with a majority of runs) for the evaluation of river quality.

AB  - Fishes were collected in all four streams of the Presque Isle Bay watershed in Eric, PA, to assess the environmental effects of urbanization. These streams were evaluated using an index of biotic integrity (IBI) combined with a multivariate analysis. Four reference streams in adjacent non-urban watersheds were selected for comparison. IBI values and associated impairment status of sites varied from eight sites in three streams that were impaired, to six sites on the four reference streams which were acceptable. The highest diversity sites were the sites farthest downstream in three of the streams, where 6-19 species were collected per site. No fishes were collected in the lowest diversity site and no Pennsylvania species of concern were collected at any sites. Our results indicate that at least half of the stream fish assemblages in the Presque Isle Watershed are impaired, likely due to effects of urbanization.

AB  - Coral reefs are threatened worldwide by climatic change and increasing anthropogenic pressures. Standardized and simple metrics assessing their status and their potential to recover are urgently needed to achieve large scale homogeneous information. Here we propose a synthetic Coral Condition Index (CCI) based on the proportional abundance of coral colonies belonging to six ordinal categories which represent their condition: recently dead, bleached, smothered, upturned, broken, and healthy. CCI ranges from 0 (100% of dead corals) to 1(100% of healthy corals) with low values suggesting large scale disturbances (e.g., climate impacts), and high values suggesting disturbances acting on a small scale that can be averted by local management actions. We tested the performance of this index in Maldives, which suffered from coral mass mortality following bleaching in 1998 and mechanical damage due to the tsunami of 2004. In our evaluation CCI was applied on the most represented species, i.e., tabular Acropora and Pocillopora, which were counted from 2005 to 2010 using replicated belt transects at several depths and across different habitats. CCI did not show correlated to the number of total coral colonies suggesting the possibility to employ the index under different levels of coral abundance. CCI detected high levels of coral damage, which is likely due to the documented slow recovery of Maldivian reefs after the two major disturbance events. Further tests in other tropical regions with different coral species might promote CCI as an additional parameter for coral reef monitoring and restoration programs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Moisture content is an important measure of seafood quality as the flesh including liver naturally has high water content. Furthermore, moisture content is an important measure of ecological and environmental monitoring studies on coral reef fishes. However, few studies have reported the moisture content in coral reef fishes. Liver moisture contents and biological factors such as condition factor, hepatosomatic index (HSI) and gonado somatic index were examined in twenty-one coral reef fish species collected in Malaysian South China Sea. Four species of parrotfishes genus Scarus spp. were found to have significantly lower liver moisture relative to other reef fish species. A significant negative correlation was found between moisture content and HSI.

AB  - On the basis of the analysis of wide temporal monitoring data, a forecast of the integrated hydrochemical indicators of the waters of the Inhul river (Ukraine) was carried out. The performed analysis was also the basis for the determination of a mathematical model of natural fluctuations of the indicators studied. The determined sinusoidal dependence of the integrated water quality indicators allowed determining the average time of fluctuations concerning the processes of self-organisation of river waters. In practice, the developed mathematical models may constitute a valuable support and supplement to the existing models in the field of prediction of self-organization processes of river waters. They may also contribute to even more effective minimization of undesirable effects of anthropogenic impact on aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The aims of this study were to describe the reproductive cycle of the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) off the south coast of Sicily and determine whether intra- and inter-annual reproductive trait variations, if any, are adaptive responses which maximize reproductive success under environmental fluctuations. Biological data were collected from purse seine and mid-water pelagic trawl commercial catches landed in Sciacca (Sicily) over 6 yr (1997-2002) at fortnightly intervals, analysing a total of 84 581 individuals. No inter-annual changes in length at first reproduction were observed, with a mean pooled value of 11.26 cm for both sexes being found. Spawning intensity, indicated by gonadosomatic index, condition factor and length-weight relationships, seem to be governed by food availability prior to spawning. Anchovy reproductive investment was limited by the area's low primary production. There was a synchrony between reproductive cycle and temperature. Water warming marks the onset of a period of high water stability in the area, and its later cooling marks the onset of a period with low water stability. The relationship between reproductive cycle and temperature is therefore probably a reproductive strategy having evolved to ensure that spawning takes place during the period of the year when water column stability is higher, favouring food concentration and egg and larval retention in the spawning areas.

AB  - A series of serious environmental problems have appeared in North China, especially in the Loess Plateau. The 'Grain for Green Program' project has been implemented to address issues caused by vegetation degradation. Human beings play a key moderating role between drought and vegetation; however, it is not clearly understood how typical land cover changes from human activities impact the ability of vegetation to resist drought. To represent meteorological drought and vegetation dynamics, this study applied the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. We investigated the vegetation response relationship to drought and how changing land cover affected it. The land cover changes associated with strategic human activity were also analyzed using the response relationship and environmental characteristics. Our results showed that land cover changes contributed to abnormal changes in vegetation dynamics and type. From 2001 to 2016, meteorological drought showed an insignificant difference in Loess Plateau. To a certain extent, land cover changes could extend vegetation response time with the implementation of the 'Grain for Green Progam'. Response time to the drought of different vegetation types in both changed and unchanged land cover showed an increasing trend from early-period to later-period. Similar response time to drought was among cropland, forest, grassland, construction land, and desert of unchanged land cover vegetation in different Grain for Green periods. Forest cover effectively improved vegetation response time and reduced vulnerability. This study improves the understanding of vegetation change and offers guidance for environmental protection projects and evaluating ecological restoration.

AB  - MR imaging is the most appropriate non-invasive technique for quantifying the growth of somatic and gonad tissues and to determine sex in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. However, this technique is too costly for field studies where oysters are used as bioindicators of environmental quality or to be applied routinely in hatcheries. We have tested the ability of low Nuclear Magnetic Resonance relaxometry, a much less expensive technique, to obtain phenotype parameters that can be used to monitor the physiological state of oysters. NMR measurements were carried out at three different periods using a low field spectrometer equipped with a 50 mm diameter probe to investigate 60 oysters in their first year of maturity, which were then dissected to measure internal shell cavity volume and dry flesh weight and to determine sex and gonad development. The NMR results showed that it was possible to determine both internal shell cavity volume and dry flesh weight in less than one minute with very high determination R(2) coefficients (0.95 and 0.94, respectively). The results showed also that it was possible to identify sex and gonad development, with success rates of 93% and 83%, respectively. For oysters with dry weight above 0.7 g, the success rate in identifying sex was 100%. Further studies are required to design an NMR probe that is appropriate for larger oysters and to improve sex discrimination and prediction of gonad development with larger study groups.

AB  - The stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta(13) C) and nitrogen (delta(15) N) of the muscle, ctenidia and viscera of the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata. showed the dilution and assimilation of tertiary treated sewage along an estuarine gradient. The enriched 15 N values of oyster ctenidia and viscera from within 50 m of the sewage outfall indicated the use of N-15-enriched tertiary treated sewage effluent (16 2.3 parts per thousand) as a nutrient source. The effect of sewage nitrogen on oyster 615 N was localised, with oysters 5 km upstream and downstream of the outfall not significantly enriched. Viscera 615 N was most sensitive to sewage nutrients and delta(13) C significantly defined an ocean-to-estuarine gradient. High variance in isotope ratios of viscera compromised its use as an indicator of anthropogenic nutrients, and this also reduced the utility of whole-body stable isotope ratios. Ctenidia was the most useful indicator tissue of sewage discharge at the scale of this study, being consistently and significantly enriched in delta(15) N close to the sewage outfall and delta C-13 clearly defined an estuarine gradient with less internal variability than viscera. Muscle 515 N was least sensitive to sewage effluent and showed the least variability, making it more suited to investigations of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment over larger spatio-temporal scales.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the quality of coastal Southwestern Mediterranean: sea of Algeria. The study consist on a monitoring seasonal changes in biological indices (biometric and physiological) and observing the bioaccumulation of trace metals (Pb, Cu and Zn) in the flesh of mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck, 1819). The availability of trace metals in the sediment was determined annually, when the disturbance of the environment was minimal. Exception of the sediment which has a single summer sampling, the sampling of batch of thirty (30) individuals of mussels was collected at each site "Sidi Mejdoub" and "Willis" (Mostaganem: western region) and "Bateau cass," (Algiers: center region), seasonally: November 2013 (autumn), February 2014 (winter), May 2014 (spring) and August 2014 (summer). The concentration of these metals has been determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. The contamination index of sediments show that does not present high levels of metals in sediment, the trace metals studies in the site of "Willis" is more available than the other sites. The seasonal changes of the biometric and physiological indices on the mussel shows good growth of these species in "bateau cass,", unlike the other samples taken from the two other sites. The levels of trace metals reveals that the level of copper and zinc is in the references. However, all the analyzed mussels are contaminated by lead: (Concentrations twice higher than the recommended limit).

AB  - Genotoxicity endpoints are useful tools to biomonitor the physicochemical and biological quality of aquatic ecosystems. A caging study on the freshwater bivalve Dreissena polymorpha was planned to run over four seasons in the Seine River basin in order to assess whether DNA damage measured in transplanted mussels to polluted area vary according to seasonal changes. Three sites were chosen along the Seine River, one upstream from Paris and two downstream, corresponding to a chemical gradient of water contamination. The DNA strand break (comet assay) and chromosomal damage (micronucleus test) were measured in caged mussels at each site and in winter, spring and summer, along with PAH water contamination, PAH bioaccumulation, the mussel condition index (CI), the gonado-somatic index (GSI) and the filtration rate (FR). The level of DNA strand break measured in winter was low and increased in spring, concomitantly with FR and GSI. Over the same period, micronucleus (MN) frequency and PAH bioaccumulation decreased significantly in caged mussels, with both parameters positively correlated to each other. DNA strand-break levels and MN frequencies showed inter-site variations corresponding to the chemical contamination gradient. These two genotoxicity endpoints usefully complement each other in field studies. These results show that the MN test and comet assay, when applied to gill cells of caged zebra mussels, are sensitive tools for freshwater genotoxicity monitoring. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The abundance, ratio of ecologo-trophic groups of microorganisms, microbial biomass, and predominant members of the taxonomic composition of microbial complexes are indicators of the different ecological states of soils of the central floodplain and islands of the upper delta of the Selenga River under arid conditions. The highest coefficients of oligotrophy with an increased share of microorganisms growing on the nitrogen-free Ashby medium, as well as predominance of Arthrobacter bacteria, were determined in low-moistened soils of the islands. In general, low microbiological activity (in comparison with the soils of the central floodplain depressions), resulting from a lack of moisture, is observed in these soils despite the uncontrolled cattle grazing in the areas of the latter.

AB  - Condition indices are commonly used in an attempt to link body condition of birds to ecological variables of interest, including demographic attributes such as survival and reproduction. Most indices are based on body mass adjusted for structural body size, calculated as simple ratios or residuals from regressions. However, condition indices are often applied without confirming their predictive value (i.e., without being validated against measured values of fat and protein), which we term 'unverified' use. We evaluated the ability of a number of unverified indices frequently found in the literature to predict absolute and proportional levels of fat and protein across five species of waterfowl. Among indices we considered, those accounting for body size never predicted absolute protein more precisely than body mass, however, some indices improved predictability of fat, although the form of the best index varied by species. Further, the gain in precision by using a condition index to predict either absolute or percent fat was minimal (rise in r(2)<= 0.13), and in many cases model fit was actually reduced. Our data agrees with previous assertions that the assumption that indices provide more precise indicators of body condition than body mass alone is often invalid. We strongly discourage the use of unverified indices, because subjectively selecting indices likely does little to improve precision and might in fact decrease predictability relative to using body mass alone.

AB  - The Suquia River basin (Cordoba, Argentina) is under a strong negative impact due to multiple sources of anthropic pollution. The main goal of our study was to evaluate if variations in the water quality of Suquia river basin affect the reproductive biology of Cnesterodon decemmaculatus and determine if the responses provided by the species can be considered as biomarkers of river quality. This assessment was performed through the measurement of morphological, histological and somatic parameters in adult males collected at four sampling sites during the beginning and the end of the breeding season. The water quality evaluation carried out through the estimation of a water quality index (WQI) and pesticides concentrations in water, revealed a pollution gradient along the studied basin. The same variation pattern was registered for the somatic index. In addition, the analysis of the morphology of the male copulatory organ (gonopodium) showed that individuals collected at Cordoba city had the lowest Gonopodium-Somatic Index (Gonop-SI) value, while those sampled at the most polluted site showed abnormalities in the small structures of the gonopodium. On the other hand, few histological alterations were found in the liver whereas no alterations were found in gonads along the river. The results obtained allowed us to characterize the environmental conditions of the studied basin and demonstrated the water quality deterioration along the Suquia River. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Clearly defined changes in the fishes of the Lower Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Texas and Mexico, have been documented since 1953. More recent surveys show that the original freshwater fish fauna has been retreating from the lower reaches and is being replaced by brackish and marine invaders. A total of 13 localities between Colombia (Nuevo Leon, Mexico) and the delta ( 580 km) were surveyed, with a total fish fauna of 142 species, which include native, exotic, and intruding species. Changes were analysed by locality. These changes show a loss of the majority of freshwater species, replacement of low to higher salinity forms. This shift is very clear in marine invaders, with some species penetrating the whole area investigated. Those changes are more noticeable in the lower-most localities, and diminish upstream. Data suggest that the changes in the basin, reflecting shifts in whole-basin ecology, include elevated temperature, salinity, turbidity, and lower runoff levels. There are indications of higher levels of pollution as well. Information obtained in this study is being incorporated in an Index of Biological Integrity to appear elsewhere.

The growth parameters obtained were: (i) Bhattacharya: L-infinity = 24.14 mm shell length, K= 1.03 year(-1), t(0) = - 0.181, C= 0.78 and WP = 0.77 of year (i.e. September); (ii) ELEFAN I: L-infinity = 27.3 mm, K = 0.82 year(-1), C = 0.85 and WP = 0.92 of year (i.e. November), and an R-n, value of 0.394. The growth confirmed to a negative allometric pattern. The longevity estimated was 3.66 years. Natural mortality and total mortality (Z would be equal to M, being F= 0) were estimated 1.255 and 1. 177 year(-1), respectively. The reproductive period, estimated from the condition index, is from the second half of the spring to early autumn with a peak between May and June. The recruitment pattern occurred as Unimodal with a peak between June and August. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A selected suite of cytochemical parameters in Mytilus edulis are altered in response to field and laboratory exposure to chemical contaminants. These biomarkers include lysosomal stability, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-ferrihemoprotein reductase activity, liposfuscin deposition, and accumulation of lysosomal and cytoplasmic unsaturated neutral lipid. Normal variations in physiological processes (influenced by exogenous seasonal changes in temperature, salinity, food availability, etc.) may alter the sensitivity of these biomarkers to contaminant exposure. To address this issue, M. edulis (complex) were sampled monthly from a reference nonurban site (Coupeville, Penn Cove) and a polluted urban site (Seacrest, Elliott Bay) in Puget Sound, WA, for a period of 15 months. Physiological measurements including total length, total weight, somatic and mantle weights (an indication of gonadal development and reproductive status), condition index, and the presence or absence of hemic neoplasia (HN, or leukemia) were recorded. Significant differences in lysosomal stability, lysosomal and cytoplasmic unsaturated neutral lipids, lipofuscin deposition, and NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase activity in cells of the digestive gland or digestive tubules were generally found in mussels taken throughout the year from Seacrest compared to mussels sampled from Coupeville, consistent with exposure to chemical contaminants. No seasonally influenced suppression of the entire suite of parameters as measures of contaminant exposure was evident. Therefore these biomarkers can be used to evaluate contaminant exposure in mussels throughout the entire year.

AB  - The ecological continuity of 28 northern hardwoods, spruce-fir (Picea-Abies), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L. Carriere), and eastern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.), stands in the Canadian Maritimes has been assessed and the sites ranked among 77 stands in the Acadian Forest Ecoregion using an index of ecological continuity based on the total number of calicioid lichens and fungi collected at each site. Distinguished by their tiny (1-2 mm tall) stipitate apothecia, the calicioid lichens and fungi are a natural unit of investigation, with most species dependent on the occurrence of mature forests containing trees of different ages and varied light and temperature regimes. Given that the diversity of microhabitats can be expected to increase over time in an ageing forest and that the calicioid lichens and fungi can be found growing in more of these microhabitats than any other group of species, it is the presence or absence of these species that provides the evidence whether a forest that looks old really is old and has been little disturbed over a long period of time. Among the stands under investigation in the Maritimes, the wilderness areas at French River, Panuke Lake, Margaree River, North River, and Sugarloaf Mountain in Nova Scotia, the Little Tobique cedar stand at Mount Carleton Provincial Park in New Brunswick, and the Townshend Woodlot Natural Area on Prince Edward Island have been assessed as ancient forest sites based on of the presence of more than 15 calicioid species. Described here as the oldest of the old growth, an ancient forest is defined as a fourth category of forest succession following pioneer, seral, and young old-growth forests. Nine young old-growth forests have also been identified in the Acadian Forest Ecoregion of the Canadian Maritimes, as have several seral and pioneer-stage stands. For those stands assigned calicioid index scores of 10 or less, these values are considered accurate reflections of the much modified or secondary nature of these communities as recorded in site descriptions. For those stands that have been modified by the effects of pollution or the spruce budworm, an assessment using an index of ecological continuity is considered as much a measure of ecological integrity as it is of continuity.

AB  - Based upon several years of experience in investigations with macrozoobenthos in rivers in the states of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, a biological assessment system has been developed to indicate pollution levels caused by easily degradable organic substances from sewers. The biotic index presented here is aimed at determining water's saprobic levels and was, therefore, named the "Saprobic Index for Brazilian Rivers in Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro states" (ISMR). For this purpose, saprobic valences and weights have been established for 122 taxa of tropical macrozoobenthos. Investigations were carried out in little, medium sized and big rivers in mountains and plains. Through ISMR, a classification of water quality and the respective cartographic representation can be obtained. Data collection and treatment methods, as well as the limitations of the biotic index, are thoroughly described. ISMR can also be used as an element to establish complex multimetric indexes intended for an ecological integrity assessment, where it is essential to indicate organic pollution.

AB  - Limited resources and budget are the most important problem facing the road management sector; therefore, apportionment of maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) requirements and priorities at the right time and logical are the most significant factors . Roadway will request continuous (M&R) works to avoid deterioration result from repetitive vehicle weight as well as other factors such as environmental factors. Whether, with the allocation budget that was allocated for roadway maintenance work; there is a necessity to efficiently used the obtainable funding. To execute this, a systematic approach for planning M-and-R process to reach optimum the benefits from roadway segment and minimize necessary funding and costs to repeat the pavement into first state. This process defined as the pavement maintenance management system (PMMS); thus, approach would enable agency to allotted funds, labors, equipment and other resources, most efficiently .This paper demonstrates the applying process of the maintenance program according to the genetic algorithm optimization. The aim of it was to obtain the optimal maintenance strategy alternative percent to reach best values for service life extended as well as increasing the pavement condition index (PCI) along with a specific budget that is not sufficient to restore the whole pavement to its previous state. After applying this program, it was found that it gives the road an additional service life (1.2 years), and at the same time it gives an increase in PCI value (3.8%), taking into consideration the limited resources allocated for maintenance.

AB  - The functional ecological guild approach is the cornerstone for the development of Indices of Biotic Integrity and multi-metric indices to assess the ecological status of aquatic systems. These indices combine metrics (unit-specific measures of a functional component of the fish community known to respond to degradation) into a single measure of ecological assessment. The guild approach provides an operational unit linking individual species characteristics with the community as a whole. Species are grouped into guilds based on some degree of overlap in their ecological niches, regardless of taxonomic relationships. Despite European fish species having been classified into ecological guilds, classification has not been standardised Europe-wide or within the context of classifying species into guilds from which metrics can be developed for ecological assessment purposes. This paper examines the approach used by the EU project FAME to classify European fish species into consistent ecological guilds and to identify suitable metrics as basic tools for the development of a standardised ecological assessment method for European rivers to meet the requirements of the Water Framework Directive.

AB  - Sequential extraction procedure has been carried out to scrutinize the geochemical association of Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Lead (Pb), and Manganese (Mn) with the main sedimentary phases (exchangeable, carbonate, Fe-Mn oxides, organic, and residual fraction) at 10 marine sediment samples collected from the Suez Gulf. Global contamination factor was used to identify the pollution hotspots, which indicated the existence of intensive metal contamination at stations close to the northern part of the Gulf, especially for Cd, Cu, and Pb. The potential ecological risk indices: Potential ecological risk index, risk assessment code, and modified risk assessment code revealed that there are potential hazards to marine biota caused by Cd, Cu, and Pb due to the increased levels of these metals in the labile fractions, which are vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions. This work is a good basis for further studies about metal fractionation in the Suez Gulf. It is also very helpful for government decisions about the development of the Gulf.

AB  - The aim of the intercalibration exercise presently performed by the EU is to identify and resolve significant inconsistencies between the ecological quality classifications of EU Member States and the normative definitions of the EU Water Framework Directive. Based on benthic macroinvertebrate data of two European stream types (small siliceous mountain streams and medium-sized lowland streams in Central and Western Europe) we correlated the indices of 10 river quality assessment methods (ASPT, BMWP, DSFI, German Multimetric Index, Saprobic Indices) applied in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Slovak Republic, Sweden and United Kingdom. National class boundaries were compared via regression analysis. Assessment methods of the same type (Saprobic Indices, BMWP/ASPT scores) showed best correlation results (R-2 > 0.7). The good quality status boundaries of the national methods deviated up to 25%; thus indicating the necessity to harmonize the national classification schemes. Prerequisites of the presented intercalibration approach are (1) a sufficiently large and consistent dataset representative of the respective common intercalibration types and (2) agreement on common type specific reference conditions.

AB  - Environmental conditions can strongly influence the growth performance of pearl oysters and affect pearl farm production schedules. Growth and condition index (CI) of two age cohorts of Pteria penguin were measured for 13 months to investigate differences in growth performance between four culture sites within the northern (Vava'u) and southern (Tongatapu) island groups of the Kingdom of Tonga. Environmental conditions were also measured at culture sites and used to explore potential effects on oyster growth and condition. Between island groups, growth performance of P. penguin was superior at northern sites and was most strongly related to higher water temperatures at these sites. Within the southern island group, growth performance varied significantly between sites and may be driven by differences in wave energy. Monthly growth rates (G(M)) of P. penguin also showed significant temporal variation related to age and environmental conditions. This study demonstrated significant variation in the growth performance of P. penguin at latitudinal and local scales and suggests that in oligotrophic marine environments with minimal terrestrial inputs, such as Tonga, water temperature and wave exposure may be the primary environmental conditions influencing the growth performance of P. penguin. This study therefore recommends that optimal culture sites for P. penguin in Tonga are characterized primarily by warmer water temperatures (25-30 degrees C) and low wave exposure (<15 joules m(2) day(-1)). Culture of P. penguin at sites with more suitable environmental conditions enables pearl production to begin up to 34.2 % (6.5 months) earlier than at less-suitable sites and this may greatly influence mabe pearl farm profitability and feasibility.

AB  - A long-standing question in the study of sexual selection is: if an attractive male trait signals heritable aspects of quality, how does genetic variation associated with that trait persist in the face of directional selection? It has been proposed that sensitivity to condition in general could allow a sexual signal to show heritable variation even under persistent directional selection. The multitude of genes underlying components of condition present a large target for mutation, and so genetic variance in condition may not be readily exhausted by selection. Insights gained in studies of the red junglefowl are relevant to this hypothesis, and provide a model for research in other systems. The fleshy comb of male red junglefowl is among the best-studied sexual signals. Multiple components of condition, such as health, immune function, testosterone, and social status, influence comb growth, and, in the present study, we provide the first comprehensive integration of this large body of evidence to lay out the compelling case for condition-dependence of the junglefowl comb. Variation in comb size is heritable and, most important to this issue, is genetically correlated with heritable variation in a body condition index. Although understanding of the red junglefowl's comb is far from complete, it exceeds our understanding of many other sexual signals and provides an empirical model for the study of condition-dependent signals in general.

AB  - For more than a decade, Lakeland, FL, has invested in restoring its urban Lake Hollingsworth from a hypereutrophic state to its natural eutrophic state. The lake bottom was dredged of nearly 2 million m(3) of accumulated organic sediments, and treatment wetlands, storm water curb inlet strainers, and a storm water baffle box were installed within the lake's catchment area to reduce the loading of dirt, leaves, and trash to the lake. After dredging ceased, the lake was dosed one time with alum to improve water clarity and reduce phosphorus recycling from its sediments. Water quality surrogates for algal biomass- Secchi disk transparency and water column total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll-alpha concentrations- were reviewed to assess Lakeland's progress towards its goal. In the years since dredging has stopped, algal biomass concentration in Lake Hollingsworth has significantly declined. Even with these improvements, however, the lake still remains hypereutrophic.

AB  - A water temperature simulation model was developed to estimate the effects of water management on the thermal environment in rice paddies. The model was based on two energy balance equations: for the ground and for the vegetation, and considered the water layer and changes in the aerodynamic properties of its surface with water depth. The model was examined with field experiments for water depths of 0 mm (drained conditions) and 100 mm (flooded condition) at two locations. Daily mean water temperatures in the flooded condition were mostly higher than in the drained condition in both locations, and the maximum difference reached 2.6 degrees C. This difference was mainly caused by the difference in surface roughness of the ground. Heat exchange by free convection played an important role in determining water temperature. From the model simulation, the temperature difference between drained and flooded conditions was more apparent under low air temperature and small leaf area index conditions; the maximum difference reached 38 degrees. Most of this difference occurred when the range of water depth was lower than 50 mm. The season-long variation in modeled water temperature showed good agreement with an observation data set from rice paddies with various rice-growing seasons, for a diverse range of water depths (root mean square error of 0.8-1.0 degrees C). The proposed model can estimate water temperature for a given water depth, irrigation, and drainage conditions, which will improve our understanding of the effect of water management on plant growth and greenhouse gas emissions through the thermal environment of rice paddies.

AB  - Periphyton assemblage data collected from 233 stream site-visits (49 in 1993, 56 in 1994 and 128 in 1995) throughout the Mid-Appalachian region were used to develop a periphyton index of biotic integrity (PIBI) based on 1) algal genera richness; 2) the relative abundances of diatoms, Cyanobacteria, dominant diatom genus, acidophilic diatoms, eutraphentic diatoms, and motile diatoms: 3) chlorophyll and biomass lash-free dry mass) standing crops; and 1) alkaline phosphatase activity. Thirty-seven diatom genera and 38 non-diatom genera were collected. The relative richness and relative abundance (RA) of these genera were used to calculate the RA metrics of the PIBI. PIBI scores ranged from 48.0 to 85.1 among the 233 site-visits with an overall regional mean (+/-1 SE) of 66.1 +/- 0.5. The 10 metrics and the PIBI were correlated with 27 chemical, 12 physical habitat, and 3 landscape variables. Overalls PIBI was inversely correlated with stream depth, stream water color, and Fe. Component metrics were significantly correlated with several chemical (Al, acid neutralizing capacity, Cl, Fe,Mn, N, Na, P, pH, Si, SO4 total suspended solids), physical habitat (channel embeddedness, riparian disturbances, stream depth stream width, substrate composition), and landscape (% of the watershed in forest, agriculture and urban land uses) variables. Canonical correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between the 10 PIBI metrics and 4 significant environmental gradients related to general human disturbances (stream acidity, stream substrate composition, and stream and riparian habitat). Analysis of variance revealed significant differences in PIBI scores for lowland vs highland streams, and among stream orders. Annual differences were explained by differences in the proportions of sampling sites in lowland streams in each year. The univariate distribution of PIBI scores was used to set threshold PIBI values for the assessment of ecological condition in Mid-Appalachian streams.

AB  - The increase of human activities in recent years has significantly interfered and affected aquatic ecosystems. In this present study, we investigate the effects of urbanization in the community structure of aquatic macroinvertebrates from Atlantic Forest streams. The sampling was conducted in the mountainous region of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 10 urban and 10 preserved streams during the dry season (August September) of 2012. The streams were characterized for its environmental integrity conditions and physico-chemical properties of water. The macroinvertebrates were sampled on rocky substrates with a kicknet. A total of 5370 individuals were collected from all streams and were distributed among Ephemeroptera, Odonata, PI ecoptera, Hemiptera, Megaloptera, Coleoptera, Trichoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera. In urban sites, all those orders were found, except Megaloptera, while only Mollusca was not found in preserved streams. We performed a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis that separated two groups distributed among sites in urban communities and another group outside this area. The dominance was significantly higher at urban sites, while the a diversity and equitability were greater in preserved sites. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was also performed, indicating that most taxa associated with high values of the Habitat Integrity Index (HII) and a few genus of the order Diptera with the high values of ammonia, total nitrogen, associated to streams in urban sites. Urban and preserved streams differ by physical-chemical variables and aquatic macro invertebrates. In urban streams, there is most dominance, while alpha diversity and equitability are higher in preserved streams.

AB  - The heavy metal contents (Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Hg, and As) of 88 surface sediment samples from the western Sunda Shelf were analyzed to determine their spatial distribution patterns and contamination status. The results demonstrated that high enrichment regions of heavy metals were focused in the Kelantan, Pahang, and Ambat river estuaries, and deep water regions of the study area. These high enrichment regions were mainly controlled by riverine inputs and their hydrodynamic conditions. The enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (Igeo), and potential ecological risk index (PERI) were used to assess heavy metal accumulation. The results indicated that the study area was not significantly contaminated overall at the time of the study; however, Cd, As, and Hg were at levels corresponding to moderate contamination at many stations located in the Pahang River estuary, Kelantan River estuary, and north-eastern region of the study area, primarily because of anthropogenic activities.

AB  - Is there a relationship between peoples' socioeconomic level and the quality of the environment in which they live? TO answer this question, spatial autocorrelation was used to associate a social and economic index with an environmental one, using the census tracts of Mar del Plata (Argentina). This demonstrated a positive answer to the question, i.e. those who possess economic resources have the capacity to live in a healthy environment. The integration of the variables of these two indices in a cluster analysis showed a spatial configuration similar to that obtained with the spatial autocorrelation. This reflected the need to improve environmental conditions in those less favored sectors as, in addition to the economic context, a healthy environment is one of the factors necessary for good quality of life.

AB  - Background. Transgenic Bt rice has not been approved for commercial cultivation because of the fierce public debate on food safety, biosafety regulation and ecological risk. Meanwhile, the concentration of CO2 and temperature in the atmosphere, as important environmental factors affecting the persistence of exogenous Bt protein, have increased. Elevated CO2, increased temperature, the planting of transgenic Bt rice and their interactions may further influence the structure and complexity of soil food web. However, the effects of transgenic Bt rice planting on soil organism remain largely unexplored before its commercial production especially under global climate change.
   Methods. Here, we assessed the influences of transgenic Bt rice (cv. HH with fused Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac in contrast to its parental line of non-Bt rice cv. MH63) on soil nematode communities under the conditions of elevated CO2 concentration and increased temperature for 2 years of 2016 and 2017 in open-top chambers located in Ningjin County, Shandong Province of China.
   Results. Elevated CO2 concentration remarkably increased the abundance of fungivores and significantly decreased their nematode channel ratio (NCR) and enrichment index (EI) irrespective of rice variety (transgenic Bt rice or non-Bt rice) or temperature (normal temperature or increased temperature). Additionally, rice variety and temperature did not significantly change soil nematode composition, abundance and ecological indices (including total maturity index (Sigma MI), Shannon diversity (H'), structure index (SI), NCR and EI). However, apparent seasonal changes were observed in theses aforementioned variables.
   Discussion. These results suggested that atmospheric CO2 concentration but not temperature or rice variety has great impacts on soil nematode community, especially fungivores.

AB  - In this study a habitat quality index based on Auchenorrhyncha (Insecta: Hemiptera) species composition was used to investigate the index's ability in discriminating hill prairie quality along a gradient of disturbance, based on the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory grading criteria; whether this index differs from other vegetation-based measures of quality; and examine the relationships between Auchenorrhyncha and vegetation integrity and diversity. Auchenorrhyncha and vascular plants were sampled from 14 Illinois glacial-drift hill prairies representing a range in quality. Insects and plants were sampled from late July through August, 2007 and analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results from this study showed that Floristic Quality Index, Auchenorrhyncha Quality Index, as well as other Auchenorrhyncha and plant diversity and integrity index values are greater in high, followed by mid, then low quality hill prairie remnants. Also, these analyses showed that perennial C4 grasses are strongly associated with prairie Auchenorrhyncha. These data suggest that judicious used of prescribed burning or brush removal may be needed to prevent woody-encroachment from eliminating prairie vegetation and Auchenorrhyncha on low quality sites; and restoration of perennial C4 grasses on low quality sites are needed to support more prairie Auchenorrhyncha fauna. Reintroductions of conservative (i.e., prairie-dependent and fire-sensitive) Auchenorrhyncha may also be needed to improve Auchenorrhyncha integrity on mid and low quality sites but these reintroductions need to be used in combination with reduced burn management or the inclusion of unburned refugia to reduce the extirpation of these fire-sensitive insects.

AB  - We applied the index of biotic integrity (IBI) to the portion of the Arkansas River basin within the Southwestern Tablelands ecoregion, located on the Great Plains of southeastern Colorado. Only nine IBI metrics were appropriate for this region, largely because of the depauperate and tolerant ichthyofauna. The modified index was then used to assess effects of U.S. Army mechanized infantry training on biotic integrity of the Purgatoire River at 12 sites adjacent to the Pinon Canyon Maneuvers Site, a remote and relatively undisturbed canyon reach on a seventh-order Arkansas River tributary. Decrease in abundance of adult red shiners Cyprinella lutrensis, a tolerant omnivorous species, over a 6-year period (1983-1989) caused marked increases in the IBI at 9 of 12 sites despite lack of obvious changes in environmental quality after training began in 1985. Neither sampling variation nor the magnitude and timing of floods were sufficient to explain the large decrease in red shiner abundance. Other attributes of the biota, such as presence of long-lived fishes and lack of introduced species, provided no evidence for detrimental change. The majority of potential IBI metrics were hampered by the low fish species richness, the preponderance of trophic and habitat generalists, or other attributes of the depauperate ichthyofauna. Moreover, human perturbations that cause change in fish communities of midwestern U.S. streams are suspected in many cases to mimic natural disturbances in this system, so they may have relatively little effect. Conversely, some perturbations considered benign in more mesic environments are likely to cause dramatic changes. We therefore propose that our understanding of the structure, function, and natural variation of fish communities in western Great Plains streams must increase substantially before we can define fully appropriate measures of biotic integrity for these lotic systems.

AB  - Hybrid zones provide natural experiments where new combinations of genotypes and phenotypes are produced. Studying the reshuffling of genotypes and remodeling of phenotypes in these zones is of particular interest to document the building of reproductive isolation and the possible emergence of transgressive phenotypes that can be a source of evolutionary novelties. Here, we specifically investigate the morphological variation patterns associated with introgressive hybridization between two species of sole, Solea senegalensis and Solea aegyptiaca. The relationship between genetic composition at nuclear loci and individual body shape variation was studied in four populations sampled across the hybrid zone located in northern Tunisia. A strong correlation between genetic and phenotypic variation was observed among all individuals but not within populations, including the two most admixed ones. Morphological convergence between parental species was observed close to the contact zone. Nevertheless, the samples taken closest to the hybrid zone also displayed deviant segregation of genotypes and phenotypes, as well as transgressive phenotypes. In these samples, deviant body shape variation could be partly attributed to a reduced condition index, and the distorted genetic composition was most likely due to missing allelic combinations. These results were interpreted as an indication of hybrid breakdown, which likely contributes to postmating reproductive isolation between the two species.

AB  - Spatial distributions of the concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Zn in tissue of the mussel Mytilus californianus and its use as biomonitor of metals were studied in the west coast of Baja California, Mexico. Mussels were collected from seven sampling sites along 600 km of the coastline, from the Mexico-EUA border to the northern limit of the San Sebastian Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, in Baja California Sur. The highest concentrations of Cu and Zn (6.8 mu g/g and 77.0 mu g/g dry weight) were found in San Quintin. These could be the result of the use of fertilizers in a large agriculture zone nearby. On the other hand, the highest Cd concentration was found in Erendira (16.6 mu g/g). Based on the cadmium biogeochemistry of this region, upwelling could constitute the most important Cd source, even over the anthropic sources. The correlations between concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Zn and those normalized by the organisms' condition index (r = 0.90, r = 0.86, and r = 0.57, respectively), suggest that environmental Cd and Cu levels are better reflected by Mytilus californianus than Zn levels. However, copper results must be taken with caution. All Cd concentrations found in this study exceeded the maximum permissible limits recommended by the World Health Organization and the United States Food and Drug Administration.

AB  - The growth and mortality rate of different size of mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, were compared in Mersin bay, Izmir. Mussel sampling was performed on a monthly basis over 1 year, together with hyrobiological parameters. Water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, total particulate matter (TPM) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were determined. Average chlorophyll a, TPM and POC values were 3.88 +/- 1.62 mu g L-1, 13.12 +/- 3.68 mg L-1 and 252 +/- 121.89 mu g L-1 respectively. Initial mean lengths of mussels for each size group were 10 mm (9.91 +/- 0.25 mm), 20 mm (20.14 +/- 0.29 mm), 30 mm (30.66 +/- 0.21 mm), 40 mm (40.14 +/- 0.21 mm), 50 mm (50.62 +/- 0.21 mm), 60 mm (59.77 +/- 0.21 mm) and 70 mm (69.47 +/- 0.62 mm). Maximum growth in length occurred during the spring-summer months. The annual length increments of mussel size groups were 46.22, 41.42, 30.3, 28.03, 20.63, 16.34 and 12.03 mm from small to large size groups respectively. Small mussels grew faster than large mussels and reached commercial size at the same time. Mortality was < 5% for all groups at the end of the experiment.

AB  - Analyzing and evaluating the state and heterogeneity of ecosystems are required for ecosystem-based management. The abundance size spectrum is a promising approach for evaluating pelagic ecosystems. To analyze the heterogeneity of pelagic ecosystems in the northern South China Sea (NSCS) in summer, a simplified abundance size spectrum (SASS) was proposed. Picophytoplankton (0.2-2 mu m), microphytoplankton (10-160 mu m), mesozooplankton (160-2000 mu m), and macrozooplankton (505-8,000 mu m) were sampled in the NSCS in August 2007, and used to build the SASS. On the basis of the SASS parameters, spatial heterogeneity in pelagic ecosystems was detected, and the study waters were distinctly categorized into the river plume or upwelling-affected area and its adjacent coastal area, the deepwater area, area near the Luzon Strait, and the offshore shelf area. Contrasts of SASS parameters between the eastern and western pelagic ecosystems out of the Pear River estuary demonstrate the fast ecosystem response to the spreading of the Pearl River plume. These results indicate that the SASS could be a good indicator for the state of pelagic ecosystems in the NSCS. In addition, the SASS approach is easily available and labor- and time-saving, thus the SASS could be a useful tool for monitoring and evaluating the state of pelagic ecosystems and their responses to perturbations.

AB  - An index of the physical condition of an animal should describe its endogenous available energy. The welfare of the animal depends on its ability to spend its stored energy (lipid and protein) in order to survive the environmental and behavioural challenge at the particular time of its capture. I propose a new index to predict the survival chance of the subject. The new index of physical condition takes into account the available endogenous energy reserves and the known needs of the species at that particular time of year. I further illustrate this new method of estimating the physical condition by running a trial with Common Eiders, Somateria mollissima.

AB  - This study aims to overview the U.S. sustainable development by measuring the environmental performance of 50 states over the period of 2009-2018. To attain the objective, we employ data envelopment analysis for environmental assessment where we prioritize the minimization of CO2 emissions first and the maximization of gross state product later under the concept of managerial disposability (i.e., an environment-based performance measure). Then, we examine how the state-level environmental performance measures are associated with their political and spatial contexts. For the purpose, we conduct the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test across groups of states characterized by their political transitions in the presidential and gubernatorial elections and defined by the regions of the U.S. Economic Development Administration and Environmental Protection Agency. Based on our empirical results, we find that (a) overall environmental performance has gradually enhanced over time, (b) there are statistically significant differences in the environmental performance measures along with the political transitions, and (c) states on both coasts have outperformed those of the middle in the measurement.

AB  - The present study was carried out to evaluate the biological characteristics of Pachygrapsus marmoratus in the southern Black Sea, Ordu, Turkey. A total of 1503 crabs, ranging from 0.9 to 4.3 cm in carapace length (CL), were collected monthly from November 2012 to October 2013. Female: male ratio was found to be 1:1. Measured male and female crabs were grouped in 0.49 cm CL class intervals. The mean CL, carapace width (CW) and weight (W) were determined as 2.55 +/- 0.02 cm, 2.90 +/- 0.02 cm and 14.21 +/- 0.27 g, respectively, for all individuals. Correlation analysis was also conducted to reveal relationships between size parameters for males and females as well as between egg number and size. The b values of CW and W for male, female and ovigerous crabs were found to be 3.1, 3.06 and 2.95, respectively. Number of large-sized individuals and growth rate was higher in males compared to females. The highest correlation was found between CW and CL in both sexes. The mean condition index values were calculated as 49.03 for males and 45.79 for females. Ovigerous females were observed only from May to July 2013. The fecundity estimates ranged from 8989 to 151,578 eggs/crab, with an average value of 57,814.53 +/- 3349 eggs/crab. The egg diameter ranged between 328.40 mu m and 423.38 mu m, with a mean size of 365.83 +/- 1.97 mu m. There was a positive relationship between egg number and female size.

TI  - Yield stability of hybrid vs pureline hard winter wheats in regional performance trials
T2  - CROP SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Hybrid hard winter wheats (Triticum aestivum L.) have shown superior grain yield potential in regional performance trials during the last decade. Evidence for enhanced yield stability, combined with enhanced yield potential, would facilitate wider acceptance of hybrid wheat by growers. Hybrid and pureline yield stability and environmental responsiveness were compared with the use of data from the Southern Regional Performance Nursery (SRPN), 1990 through 1995, and Agripro Standard Variety Trial (SVT), 1993 and 1994. Hybrid and pureline yields were regressed on an environmental index based on location mean yields for purelines, and response slope and deviations were calculated. Analyses were conducted separately for each nursery, as hybrid and pureline entries varied. Hybrids showed significantly higher mean yields compared with purelines and the yield advantage generally increased with increasing environmental yield potential. Average regression slope for hybrids was significantly higher (1.09-1.12) than for purelines (1.0) in the 1994 and 1995 SRPN and 1993 and 1994 SVT. Hybrid slopes were not significantly different from those for purelines in the 1990 through 1993 SRPN, where they ranged from 1.0 to 1.07. There was no crossover in yield response between hybrids and purelines at lower yield levels. Deviations from regression were of similar magnitude for hybrids and purelines. Confidence intervals for hybrid and pureline regressions generally overlapped throughout the observed yield ranges in the SRPN. In the 1993 and 1994 SVT, hybrid and pureline confidence intervals diverged as environmental yield potential increased. Compared with pureline cultivars, hybrid wheats have potential for enhanced mean yield and greater yield response to favorable environmental conditions with similar deviations from expected response.

AB  - This article pertains to the analysis of recurrent event data in the presence of spatial correlation. Consider units located atnpossibly spatially correlated geographical areas described by their longitude and latitude and monitored for the occurrence of an event that can recur. We propose a new class of semiparametric models for recurrent events that simultaneously account for risk factors and correlation among the spatial locations, and that subsumes the current methods. Since the parameters involved in the models are not directly estimable because of the high dimension of the likelihood, we use composite likelihood approach for estimation. The approach leads to estimates with population interpretation where their large sample properties are obtained under a reasonable set of regularity conditions. Simulation studies suggest that the resulting estimators have a very good finite sampling properties. The methods are illustrated using spatial data on recurrent esophageal cancer in the northern region of France and recurrent wildfire data in the province of Alberta, Canada.

AB  - Stream restoration projects have become increasingly common, and the need for systematic post-project evaluation, particularly for small-scale projects, is evident. This study describes how a 70-m restored reach of a small urban stream, Baxter Creek (in Poinsett Park, El Cerrito, California), was quickly and inexpensively evaluated using habitat, biological, and resident-attitude assessments. The restoration involved opening a previously culverted channel, planting riparian vegetation, and adding in-stream step-pool sequences and sinuosity. Replicated benthic macroinvertebrate samples from the restored site and an upstream unrestored site were compared using several metrics, including taxa richness and a biotic index. Both biological and habitat quality improved in the restored compared with the unrestored section. However, when compared with a creek restored 12 years before, habitat condition was of lower quality in the recently restored creek. A survey of the neighborhood residents indicated that, overall, they were pleased with the restored creek site. The approach used in this demonstration project may be applicable to other small-scale evaluations of urban stream restorations.

AB  - The need to implement Ecosystem-Based-Management (EBM) in marine ecosystems and the recent adoption of European Union directives, such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), make indicators that are able to describe ecosystem state particularly relevant. The trophodynamic context is promising in that it can define integrative ecosystem indicators from modelling and field data. Here we analyze energy accumulation across trophic levels (TLs), i. e. the accumulation of energy in various biomass components of an ecosystem. The analysis of biomass accumulation across TLs, previously applied to surveys and model output data, was applied to a time series (1970 to 2010) of landings in the Mediterranean Sea and its 8 sub-areas. The standardized cumulative biomass versus TL curves for each year were fit to a logistic function, revealing that the accumulation pattern was detectable using landings data and confirming prior patterns. Parameters describing the curve shape, i. e. basal biomass, inflection point and steepness, were considered as possible indicators for assessing changes of ecosystem state through time. These parameters were able to detect systems modification in terms of both space and time and exhibited differential sensitivity to external drivers. The inflection point was mainly fishery-driven, whereas steepness seems to respond to environmental features, indicating an ability to discriminate across major ecosystem drivers. The application of Monte Carlo un certainty analysis showed that all of the parameters are sufficiently robust to possible sampling errors in the TL assignment to the different taxa. Collectively, these results confirm the robustness of patterns for cumulative biomass across TL curves seen in a growing number of marine eco systems. These emergent features suggest that this approach could produce useful ecosystem indicators for the implementation of EBM and the MSFD.

AB  - Diatoms are widely used in stream bioassessment due to their broad distribution, extraordinary variability and the ability to integrate changes in water quality. The indices Specific Polluosensitivity Index (SPI), standardized Biological Diatom index (BDI), European Economic Community Index (CEC) and Generic Diatom Index (GDI), originally developed in France, are often applied in Portugal to evaluate stream ecological quality based on diatom communities. Alternatively, predictive models resulting from the comparison between the communities of the study site and those of a set of reference sites representing undisturbed or the best available conditions of a given region have been proposed as valuable methods for evaluating the ecological status of streams. In the present study, we applied the four above-mentioned widely used diatom-based indices (SPI, BDI, CEC and GDI) and a predictive model (MoDi) to 54 sites located in central Portugal to assess the sensitivity of the five methods to a range of anthropogenic disturbances cumulatively affecting streams and represented by 27 variables (e.g., organic enrichment, changes in morphology of the channels, integrity of the riparian corridor, land use in the catchment). The results were analyzed comparatively through Spearman correlations, Boxplots and Stepwise Discriminant Analysis. This study confirmed the sensitivity of diatoms to organic and nutrient contamination (showed by the MoDi, BDI, CEC and SPI) and revealed the importance of suspended solids (through the MoDi, GDI, and SPI). The relevance of modifications in land use to diatoms was shown by all methods applied, except for the GDI. The MOM also revealed the importance of changes in the structure and morphology of the reach and the channel, like the construction of artificial walls or embankments and connectivity; the BDI also related its assessments with the riparian zone integrity; and the SPI was not useful in detecting morphological pressures. The GDI produced the most divergent assessments and was less effective in revealing the anthropogenic disturbances. The use of the predictive model (MoDi) is therefore a good method for the assessment of streams in central Portugal because it expresses a great diversity of quantitative and qualitative changes in freshwater systems reflected in the structure (species richness and abundance) of diatom communities.

AB  - Quantitative indicators of biological integrity are needed for streams in the Great Plains of North America, but it was not known whether the index of biotic integrity (IBI) approach would be effective in this semiarid region. Great Plains streams have a depauperate and tolerant ichthyofauna and highly variable physicochemical conditions that may mask the effects of non-point-source pollution and stream habitat degradation. We developed an IBI based on fish assemblages by screening metrics for range, responsiveness to human influence, precision, and lack of redundancy; we then tested the IBI's ability to detect anthropogenic effects by validating the index with an independent data set. The IBI was composed of 10 metrics based on species richness and composition, trophic and reproductive guilds, and age structure. These 10 metrics had many significant correlations with substrate and water chemistry variables but had fewer significant correlations with riparian condition and watershed variables. Of the watershed variables, road density had the highest number of significant correlations with final IBI metrics. The IBI was validated by demonstrating its responsiveness to aggregate measures of human influence, site-level habitat, and water chemistry, and its lack of responsiveness to factors that varied naturally, such as stream size and site elevation. The IBI was also temporally stable within and between years during repeat visits to a subset of sampled reaches. This IBI can be used as a measure of biological integrity for management of prairie streams faced with threats such as introduced species, intensive agriculture, grazing, and coalbed natural gas extraction. Although we developed this IBI based on data from Montana prairie streams only, our IBI can probably serve as a framework for other North American plains streams and our results suggest that the IBI approach may be useful in other semiarid regions of the world.

AB  - The body condition of the shore crab Carcinus maenas in a temperate coastal system (western Dutch Wadden Sea) was followed over 14 mo. Fulton's condition factor K, dry weight condition and the percentage of dry weight were determined as indirect indices, while bomb calorimetry was applied to obtain the energy density and total energy, as direct biochemical measures of condition. General linear models identified sex, size and season as relevant regressors explaining observed variance in crab condition, whereas colour morphotype effect was negligible. The seasonal pattern was consistent with the natural cycling in temperature and expected food availability, but the peak in body condition differed depending on the type of measure used: energy peaked in autumn, while morphometric condition was at its highest in winter, uncovering different latencies in the response of direct and indirect indices. Concordant with higher energy investment in reproduction, body condition and energy content of non-ovigerous females were higher than those of males, and egg-bearing females always had the lowest condition values. Energy content of adult females ranged from 16.37 +/- 1.30 (winter 2013) to 19.83 +/- 0.54 kJ g(-1) ashfree dry weight (AFDW) (autumn 2013), attaining 18.77 +/- 1.22 kJ g(-1) AFDW prior to the onset of reproduction in 2012, while maximum energy density of ovigerous females (eggs excluded) was 16.49 +/- 0.64 kJ g(-1) AFDW. Besides low correlation between indirect and direct indices, fluctuations were more pronounced in the energetic data. Therefore, the morphometric measures seem weak surrogates to estimate energy density of these crabs.

AB  - Climate variability and the rapid warming of seas undoubtedly have huge ramifications for biological processes such as reproduction. As such, gametogenesis and spawning were investigated at two sites over 200km apart on the south coast of Ireland in an ecosystem engineer, the common cockle, Cerastoderma edule. Both sites are classed as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), but are of different water quality. Cerastoderma edule plays a significant biological role by recycling nutrients and affecting sediment structure, with impacts upon assemblage biomass and functional diversity. It plays a key role in food webs, being a common foodstuff for a number of marine birds including the oystercatcher. Both before and during the study (early 2010mid 2011), Ireland experienced its two coldest winters for 50years. As the research demonstrated only slight variation in the spawning period between sites, despite site differences in water and environmental quality, temperature and variable climatic conditions were the dominant factor controlling gametogenesis. The most significant finding was that the spawning period in the cockle extended over a greater number of months compared with previous studies and that gametogenesis commenced over winter rather than in spring. Extremely cold winters may impact on the cockle by accelerating and extending the onset and development of gametogenesis. Whether this impact is positive or negative would depend on the associated events occurring on which the cockle depends, that is, presence of primary producers and spring blooms, which would facilitate conversion of this extended gametogenesis into successful recruitment.

AB  - The relationship of fish community composition to riparian cover and runoff potential was investigated in 20 streams in the agricultural Minnesota River Basin during the summer of 1997. Analysis of variance indicated significant differences in fish community composition due to both riparian cover (wooded versus open) and runoff potential (high or low). Streams with wooded riparian zones had higher index of biological integrity (IBI) scores, species richness, diversity, and percentages of benthic insectivores and herbivores than streams with open riparian zones. Streams with low runoff potential had higher IBI scores and species richness than streams with high runoff potential. The riparian cover and runoff potential interaction was marginally significant with respect to IBI scores and species richness, suggesting a weak interaction between the two factors. Although both factors were important, riparian cover influenced fish community composition more than runoff potential in these streams, indicating that local factors (close to the stream) dominated landscape- or basin-level factors.

TI  - Context-specific morphine withdrawal: Evidence that rearing reflects withdrawal, not exploration
T2  - PSYCHOBIOLOGY

KW  - TOLERANCE
KW  - RATS
AB  - Several studies have demonstrated that contextual cues previously paired with morphine elicit conditioned withdrawal in the absence of the drug. Conditioned withdrawal signs have included circling, jumping, rearing, and wet dog shakes. One of these signs, rearing, may in fact reflect exploration rather than withdrawal. In those studies, rats had morphine paired or unpaired with distinctive contextual cues for several sessions and then were tested in that environment. During conditioning, the rats that received the drug in that context may have explored it less because they were sedated by the morphine. In the withdrawal test, this environment would have been more novel for these rats, as compared with the rats for which the contextual cues had been paired with saline. In the present study, rats were given eight injections of morphine, spaced 48 h apart, either paired or unpaired with distinctive contextual cues. During these sessions, the rats were physically restrained. Although both groups were equated for exploration of this context, the paired group, which received morphine in this context, displayed more rearing during the test session. These results suggest that rearing is an index of conditioned withdrawal.

AB  - Human-induced changes of the environment, including landscape alteration and habitat loss, may affect wildlife disease dynamics and have important ramifications for wildlife conservation. Amphibians are among the vertebrate taxa most threatened by anthropogenic habitat change. The emerging fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has caused extinctions and population declines in hundreds of anuran species globally. We studied how the urban landscape is associated with the prevalence of Bd infections by sampling 655 anurans of 3 species (mainly the common toad Bufo bufo) in 42 ponds surrounded by different amounts of urban habitat (defined as towns, cities or villages). We also examined the association between Bd infections and a potential reservoir host species (the moor frog Rana arvalis). We found that 38% of the sites were positive for Bd with an infection prevalence of 4.4%. The extent of urban landscape was negatively correlated with Bd infection prevalence. However, the positive association of Bd with the presence of the possible reservoir species was substantially stronger than the urban effects. The body condition index of B. bufo was negatively associated with Bd infection. This Bd effect was stronger than the negative effect of urban landscape on body condition. Our results suggest that urban environments in Sweden have a negative impact on Bd infections, while the presence of the reservoir species has a positive impact on Bd prevalence. Our study also highlights the potential importance of Bd infection on host fitness, especially in rural landscapes.

AB  - We describe a general process for developing an index of fish assemblage integrity, using the Willamette Valley of Oregon, U.S.A., as an example. Such an index is useful for assessing the effects of humans on entire fish assemblages, and the general process can be applied to any biological assemblage and any region. First, a reference condition was determined from historical information, and then candidate metrics of ecological importance were Listed. The variability of the candidate metrics in time and space was estimated and their responsiveness to independent measures of riparian and stream habitat quality assessed. Metrics were scored continuously from 0 to IO, producing an index of biological integrity (IBI) that was weighted to range from 0 to 100 regardless of the number of metrics. The index, developed from a set of 35 sires, was then tested on an independent set of eight urban sites sampled by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. Thirteen of the 16 candidate metrics were appropriate and produced an IBI with among-site variance triple that of revisit variance. The method distinguished sites with acceptable fish assemblages from marginally and severely impaired sites.

KW  - QUALITY
AB  - An index of biotic integrity (IBI) was developed for use in the lower piedmont and upper coastal plain physiographic regions of west-central Georgia to investigate the relation between stream fish communities and land use. Fish samples and habitat data were collected at 507 sites in 340 first- to fifth-order tributary streams in the Chattahoochee, Flint, Ocmulgee, and Oconee river drainages during 1990-1993. Watershed cutouts upstream of sample sites were made from raster digital files based on LANDSAT thematic mapper satellite imagery from land use and land cover data collected during the winters of 1988-1990. Six of the 12 original IBI metrics were modified to take into account regional ichthyological differences between Georgia and the midwestern United States while maintaining the basic underlying ecological assumptions. The number of darter species metric was expanded to include madtoms (Noturus spp.) and sculpins (Cottus spp.), number of intolerant species metric was expanded to include moderately intolerant species, proportion piscivores was modified for small streams where proportion pioneer species was substituted, proportion hybrid metric was deleted and proportion of lithophilic spawners was substituted, proportion green sunfish Lepomis cyanellus was replaced with proportion tolerant species, and the proportion of diseased fish metric was replaced with proportion of individuals in a sample with deformities, eroded fins, lesions, or tumors. Nonpoint and point source runoff from low-density urban areas negatively influenced the number of fish species, number of darter species, number of individuals, proportion of insectivorous cyprinids, and proportion of lithophilic spawners. Proportions of tolerant species and proportions of species with deformities, eroded fins, lesions, or tumors were positively related to increased levels of turbidity-suspended solids. In addition, higher levels of turbidity-suspended solids generally had a negative influence on the number of sensitive species, number of individuals, proportion of lithophilic spawners, and proportion of omnivores. The relationship between IBI site scores and measures of relative habitat quality suggested that the derived IBI was effective in differentiating stream quality.

AB  - Wetland habitats currently cover about one-fifth of Georgia and have been reduced in acreage by as much as twenty-five percent over the past two centuries due to anthropogenic activities. Accurate identification and careful study of these areas arc crucial for their preservation and for compliance with federal and state environmental regulations. Several vegetation-based biological assessment methodologies have been developed to define wetlands and to assess their quality. One major wetland delineation system, mandated by federal law, incorporates the National Wetland Plant List (NWPL), a classification system ranking plant species in five indicator categories according to fidelity and preference for wetlands or uplands. These rankings were recently updated via a comprehensive and collaborative nationwide effort involving four government agencies and teams of wetland specialists. Another expert-based indicator system, coefficients of conservatism, is the foundation of the floristic quality index, a metric widely used in the United States for assessing ecological condition of wetlands (as well as other plant communities). The coefficients are based on breadth of habitat preference(s) and tolerance to disturbance, with exotic and ruderal species receiving the lowest scores and ecologically conservative species assigned the highest scores. A team of four botanists, proficient with the flora of Georgia, convened to assign coefficient of conservatism rankings to the 2262 NWPL species for the state. The resulting web-accessible database, which includes information such as regional wetland rankings and conservation status, is described here.

AB  - Oceanographic processes and ecological interactions can strongly influence recruitment success in marine fishes. Here, we develop an environmental index of sablefish recruitment with the goal of elucidating recruitment-environment relationships and informing stock assessment. We start with a conceptual life-history model for sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria on the US west coast to generate stage- and spatio-temporally-specific hypotheses regarding the oceanographic and biological variables likely influencing sablefish recruitment. Our model includes seven stages from pre-spawn female condition through benthic recruitment (age-0 fish) for the northern portion of the west coast U.S. sablefish stock (40 degrees N-50 degrees N). We then fit linear models and use model comparison to select predictors. We use residuals from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 sablefish assessment as the dependent variable (thus removing the effect of spawning stock biomass). Predictor variables were drawn primarily from ROMS model outputs for the California Current Ecosystem. We also include indices of prey and predator abundance and freshwater input. Five variables explained 57% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by the stock-recruitment relationship in the sablefish assessment. Recruitment deviations were positively correlated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage. This result suggests that multiple mechanisms likely affect sablefish recruitment at different points in their life history.

AB  - For the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, an obligatory shallow water inshore species, the degradation of coastal habitats can have major consequences for population persistence and distribution. Off Taiwan's west coast (TWC), these animals are predominantly seen in two areas separated by a stretch of coast with only sporadic sightings, suggesting that either (a) only two sectors of TWC offer sufficiently suitable habitat for the dolphins or (b) a recent environmental change limits the population connectivity. We measured the extent of habitat destruction due to land reclamation off TWC since 1972 using a habitat integrity index (HII) and applied general linear models (GLMs) to compare HII with sightings of dolphins per unit effort (SPUE). While early Landsat data reveal extensive continuity and diversity of coastal habitats, by 2013, a total area of over 222 km(2) was lost to land reclamation (23 % of dolphin habitat and 40 % of dolphin foraging habitat). GLM analysis showed a significant relationship between HII and SPUE; the lower HII the lower SPUE, indicating that off TWC, the current discontinuous distribution of humpback dolphins is likely due to a different extent of habitat degradation rather than natural patchiness of their environment. We emphasize that the history of coastal habitat alteration must be considered when interpreting cetacean distribution from survey data and formulating habitat management decisions, especially in areas experiencing extensive anthropogenic coastal change.

AB  - This study focused on the spatio-temporal variation in the host-parasite system, 0-group sole-digenean metacercariae, in nearshore coastal areas at relatively small spatial scale. 0-group soles were sampled using a standard beam trawl in April, May, June, August and October 2005 at nine different sites in the Pertuis Charentais area (Bay of Biscay, France). Sole density, size, Fulton's condition factor K and digenean metacercariae communities were analysed. 0-group sole concentrated in shallow and muddy areas where they accumulated digenean metacercariae. Parasite communities displayed strong spatial patterns tightly linked to the distribution of the first intermediate mollusc hosts. These parasitological data suggest that 0-group sole during their first period of growth are mainly sedentary with limited movements between the different parts of the habitat. Size and density data revealed spatial heterogeneity in terms of habitat quality so that a limited zone (Aiguillon Bay) within the study area could be identified as sensu stricto nursery habitat for 0-group sole. The use of digenean metacercariae as natural tags appears as a novel powerful tool to evaluate habitat use and movements of juvenile flatfish, which could find applications in fisheries and coastal zone management programs.

AB  - Regional waterlog disaster integrated risk system, affected by natural, social, and economic systems and its combination relationship, is a complex system with certain structure and function. Waterlog disaster integrated risk results from the combined effects of regional environment, impact factors, vulnerability, and disaster-reducing capability of flood hazards in the drainage area. Waterlog disaster integrated risk system can be divided into four subsystems of hazard, vulnerability, disaster-reducing capability, and disaster conditions. Evaluation indexes are selected using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method, and the evaluation index system is established. Then, the waterlog disaster integrated risk evaluation model is proposed based on set pair analysis method. Taking Huaihe river in Anhui Province of China as the typical area in this study, the results show that the proposed approach is able to obtain the spatial distribution characteristics of waterlog hazard, vulnerability, mitigation capabilities, and integrated disaster risk within the study area. From the quantitative point of view, identification of the areas with high flood risk can provide a scientific basis for the flood management and technical support.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical part of the global carbon cycle. Currently, it is understood that at least a portion of the chromophoric DOM (CDOM) character can be described through an electronic interaction of charge transfer (CT) complexes. While much work has been done to understand the influence of CT on soil and aquatic reference standard DOM, little is known about the influence of CT in fresh terrestrially derived DOM. In this study, leaf litter leachates from three tree species were treated (reduced) with sodium borohydride to determine the contribution of CT on a source of fresh terrestrial DOM. Leaf litter was sampled four times through decomposition under natural (field) conditions to determine the influence of degradation on response to borohydride treatment. Leaf litter CDOM displayed a unique loss of UVB absorption following borohydride treatment, as well as a homogenizing effect on fluorescence emission character. Humification index (HIX) differentiated Elliot Soil Humic Acid and Suwannee River Fulvic Acid from leaf litter leachates. However, biological index (BIX), and spectral slope metrics were not able to differentiate leaf leachates from these reference standards. Apparent quantum yields were similar in magnitude between leaf leachates and reference standards, although leaf leachate spectra displayed features not evident in reference standards. These results help understand the origins of DOM optical properties and associated quantitative indices in freshly sourced terrestrial material. Overall, these results suggest that even at the initial stages of decomposition, terrestrial CDOM exhibits optical characteristics and responses to removal of electron accepting ketones and aldehydes, through borohydride treatment, similar to more processed CDOM.

AB  - Blue mussels (Mytilus trossulus) were transplanted in cages for three months in two Swedish coastal areas in the Bothnian Sea (northern Baltic Sea) to investigate the interactions between analysed environmental chemicals and biological responses. A wide array of biological parameters (biomarkers) including antioxidant and biotransformation activity, geno-, cyto- and neurotoxic effects, phagocytosis, bioenergetic status and heart rate were measured to detect the possible effects of contaminants. Integrated Biomarker Response index and Principal Component Analysis performed on the individual biological response data were able to discriminate between the two study areas as well as the contaminated sites from their respective local reference sites. The two contaminated sites outside the cities of Sundsvall (station 51) and Gavle (station G1) were characterised by different biomarker response patterns. Mussels at station S1 showed a low condition index, increased heart rate recovery time and phagocytosis activity coinciding with the highest tissue concentrations of some trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and organotins. At station G1 the highest organochlorine pesticide concentration was recorded as well as elevations in glutathione S-transferase activity, thiamine content and low lysosomal membrane stability. Significant variability in the geno- and cytotoxic responses and bioenergetic status was also observed at the different caging stations. The results obtained suggest that different chemical mixtures present in the study areas cause variable biological response patterns in organisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organic farming (OF) is a management system that is closely linked with the quality of the natural environment since it should, besides producing organic food, constitutes a protective factor for all components of that natural environment. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to answer the following question: Does organic fanning (OF) protect the natural environment? In order to achieve this goal it Was essential to determine what kinds of natural and non-environmental factors have the largest influence on the development of OF in Poland, and to assess the significance of these factors in the spatial diversification of the regional density of organic farms. The analysis was carried out on the basis of data from 2012 comprising 2074 communes, including both rural communes (1563) and urban-rural ones (511). The research results indicated the weaknesses of the organic farming policy (OFP) with respect to the functioning of OF in Poland in the years 2007-2013. The results also show that the development of OF in Poland mainly depends on the system of financial support, i.e. one that either encourages fanners to change the manner of production to a more environmentally friendly one, or one that has an impact on their decision to resign from production using ecological methods. Moreover, as our research has proved, OF is not always developed in places where it should be a priority because of the suitable conditions of the natural environment.

AB  - The rapid rise of the industrial age has made air pollution a key factor affecting public health at this stage. The continuous stimulation of the cardiovascular and respiratory tract by particulate matter from the air will eventually lead to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Since air pollution is the key factor among the many factors affecting the cardiorespiratory tolerance of adolescents, this article investigates the cardiopulmonary function and limb exercises of the adolescents under different air pollution levels in Changchun City. Places with different air pollution levels in the atmospheric condition index reports issued by the relevant depai intents of Changchun City are selected. The areas with low pollution indexes are Shuangyang District and Erdao District, and the areas with high air pollution indexes are Chaoyang District and Nanguan District. We use progressive aerobic long-distance jogging to detect the maximum oxygen intake, use a pulmonary function tester to detect pulmonary ventilation, and use a comparative research method to comprehensively analyze the differences in the impact of air pollution on the cardiopulmonary function of adolescents. The results shows that the vital capacity of men in high pollution index areas is higher than that of men in low pollution index areas. The average FEV of 1.0% for males and female adolescents in areas with heavier air pollution shows a downward trend with age. Men decreased from 91.90 to 90.60 and women decreased from 90.57 to 89.38, indicating that there are differences in FEV1.0% index between men and women in different air pollution areas.

AB  - The synergistic effects of fishing, climate and internal dynamics on population fluctuations are poorly understood due to the complexity of these interactions. In this paper, we combine time series analysis and simulations to investigate the long-term dynamics of an overexploited population in the Mediterranean Sea, and its link with both fishing-induced demographic changes and hydroclimatic variability. We show that the cyclicity of the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of European hake Merluccius merluccius (EH) vanished in the 1980s, while the correlation between the CPUE and a local environmental index increased. Using simulations, we then show that the cyclicity observed in the EH biomass before the 1980s can have an internal origin, while that its disappearance could be due to the fishing-induced erosion of the age structure. Our results suggest that fishing can trigger a switch from internally generated to externally forced population fluctuations, the latter being characterised by an increasing dependency of the population on recruitment and ultimately on environmental variability. Hydroclimatic modifications occurring in the Mediterranean in the early 1980s could have enhanced these changes by leading to a mismatch between early life stages of EH and favorable environmental conditions. Our conclusions underline the key effect of the interaction between exploitation and climate on the dynamics of EH and its important consequences for management and conservation.

Forty animals were used, being ten individuals per genetic group; the groups were: 'Cariri', 'Morada Nova', 'Barriga Negra' and 'Cara Curta'. All of them females and randomly housed in four adequate installations. The environmental indexes inside the lodging, mainly from 11 a.m. to 13 p.m., remained above the thermal comfort zone for adult sheep, except for the relative humidity, that had a daily average of 67.5%. The rectal temperature of the animals was kept within the normal range, except for the genetic group 'Morada Nova' that presented the lowest values (38.6 degrees C). The respiration frequency for each of the genetic group was above the normal value; with the 'Morada Nova' once again presenting the lowest values (43.5 mov min(-1)); the 'Cariri' and 'Barriga Negra' showed the highest frequency (48.0 and 47.3 mov min(-1), respectively). Animals with darker hair color and larger size, such as those belonging to the genetic group 'Cariri', presented a higher thermal gradient between air and body surface temperatures. Animals showed high tolerance to heat, in other words, they are well adapted to the tropical environment, except for the genetic group 'Cariri' that was the least adapted. The genetic group 'Morada Nova' was considered the best adapted group for the experimental conditions.

AB  - Droughts have significant negative impacts on livelihoods and economy of Kazakhstan. In this study, we assessed and characterized drought hazard events in Kazakhstan using satellite Remote Sensing time series for the period between 2000 and 2016. First, we calculated Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Standardized Enhanced Vegetation Index anomalies (Z(EVI)) based on 250m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series. Second, we assessed vegetation cover changes for the observation period. Third, we analyzed different characteristics of the drought hazard as well as spatial distribution of the drought-affected areas within the country. The results confirmed that drought was one of the environmental challenges for Kazakhstan in 2000-2016. The obtained maps showed that drought hazard conditions were observed every year, though the areal coverage of the drought conditions largely varied between the analyzed years. The calculated drought indices indicated that in years 2000, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014, more than 50% of the area of the country were affected by drought conditions of different severity with the largest droughts in terms of the areal spread occurring in 2012 and 2014. We concluded that the pre-requisite of successful implementation of drought hazard and risk mitigation strategies is availability of spatially explicit, timely, and reliable information on drought hazard. This suggests the necessity of incorporation of remote sensing-based drought information, as was demonstrated in this paper, in the national drought monitoring system of Kazakhstan.

AB  - The risk of parasite infection grows with the size of host aggregations, which, in turn, may also depend on host sex and age and the quality of environmental resources. Herein, we studied the relationship between ectoparasitic infections with the wing mite (Spinturnix myoti) and the size of the breeding colonies, sex, age, and body condition index (BCI) of its host, the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis). The influence of environmental quality in the Carpathian Mountains (Poland) was also examined. We found significant differences in mite abundance and BCI between different breeding aggregations of the greater mouse-eared bat and also between the host sex/age categories. The most heavily infected bats were adult M. myotis females, while young males appeared to be the least infected. The BCI differed significantly between the sexes in young bats (males had a higher BCI than females) and also between colonies. No significant differences in the BCI were found for adult females. We did not find any relationship between the infestation rate of M. myotis, their colony size, the quality of environmental resources (percentage of forest cover around the colony), or the BCI. The prevalence of the various developmental stages of the mites did not differ between the host sex/age categories; however, differences were found in the sex ratios of deutonymphs and adult mites between adult M. myotis females. We predict that parasite load may not be dependent on colony size itself, but mainly on microclimatic factors, which are in turn directly correlated with colony size.

AB  - We examined the familial aggregation of lipids [total cholesterol (CH) and triglyceride (TG)] and lipoproteins [high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL)] in families ascertained through random and nonrandom probands in the Stanford Lipid Research Clinics Family Study.  Nonrandom probands were selected because their lipid levels at a prior screening visit exceeded a certain prespecified threshold.  The statistical method is based on selection through  indirect truncation on a correlated trait (in which the likelihood function is conditioned on the actual event that the proband's value is beyond the threshold).  This method allows for estimation of the path model parameters in randomly and nonrandomly ascertained families jointly and separately, thus enabling tests of heterogeneity between the two types of samples.  The results suggest that the multifactorial transmission is homogeneous in the random and hyperlipidemic samples for CH.  However, the evidence for heterogeneity is moderate for LDL, marked HDL, and mixed for TG.  The general pattern of observed results is for somewhat higher genetic heritabilities in the random than nonrandom samples, which is compatible with a higher prevalence in the random sample of certain dyslipoproteinemias associated with nonelevated lipids.  Substantial genetic heritability is found for CH, HDL, and LDL, with somewhat lower estimates for TG.  Cultural heritability is low but significant for all four traits.  Little or no spouse resemblance or nontransmitted shared sibship effects are seen.  In contrast to the findings from previous studies, little or no parental cultural transmission is seen.

AB  - The interaction between birds and haemosporidia blood parasites is a well-used system in the study of parasite biology. However, where, when and how parasites are transmitted is often unclear and defining parasite transmission dynamics is essential because of how they influence parasite-mediated costs to the host. In this study, we used cross-sectional and longitudinal data taken from a collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis population to investigate the temporal dynamics of haemosporidia parasite infection and parasite-mediated costs to host fitness. We investigated host-parasite interactions starting at the nestling stage of the bird's life-cycle and then followed their progress over three breeding attempts to quantify their fitness - measured as the number of offspring they produced that recruited back into the breeding population. We found that the majority of haemosporidia blood parasite infections occurred within the first year of life and that the most common parasite lineages that infected the breeding population also infected juvenile birds in the natal environment. Moreover, our findings suggest that collared flycatcher nestlings in poorer condition could be at a higher risk of haemosporidia blood parasite infection. In this study, only female and not male bird fitness was adversely affected by parasite infection and the cost of infection on female fitness depended on the timing of transmission. In conclusion, our study indicates that in collared flycatchers, early-life is potentially important for many of the interactions with haemosporidia parasite lineages, and evidence of parasite-mediated costs to fitness suggest that these parasites may have influenced the host population dynamics.

AB  - Inefficient feeding practices for producing fish in captivity create environmental problems. Therefore, the feed input should be reduced to a level that does not result in negative impacts of fish production. Reducing feed input can be done by periodic feed deprivation which does not necessarily decrease the fish production. This study was designed to investigate the effect of repeated unfed-fed cycles on the growth and feed utilization of the orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides raised in floating net cages in estuarine ponds. The trial was conducted in the north east of Segara Anakan, Java, Indonesia. The fish were purchased from local fishermen and mean fish body weight was 53.2 g. After acclimation in the cages for 2 weeks, 500 fish were randomly assigned to four feeding groups. The groups included: fish fed daily as a control (C); fish not fed every Monday and Thursday and fed on Tuesday and Wednesday, then on Friday, Saturday and Sunday (T1); fish unfed every Sunday, Monday and Thursday and fed on Tuesday and Wednesday, then on Friday and Saturday (T2). The experiment ran for 10 weeks. The results showed that reducing feed input by repeating unfed-fed cycles induced compensatory growth of the fish. Application of this feeding regime provides flexibility in feeding management and may reduce organic discharge into the environment. Reduction of organic pollution should help the sustainable use and conservation of the Segara Anakan ecosystem.

AB  - Multimetric indices (MMIs) are routinely used by federal, state, and tribal entities to assess the quality of aquatic resources. Because of their diversity, abundance, ubiquity, and sensitivity to environmental stress, benthic macroinvertebrates are well suited for MMIs. West Virginia has used a statewide family-level stream condition index (WVSCI) since 2002. We describe the development, validation, and application of a geographically- and seasonally partitioned genus-level index of most probable stream status (GLIMPSS) for West Virginia wadeable streams. Natural classification strata were evaluated with reference site communities using mean similarity analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination. Forty-one metrics spanning six ecological categories (richness, composition, tolerance, dominance, trophic groups, and habits) were evaluated for sensitivity, responsiveness, redundancy, range and variability across seasonal (spring and summer) and regional (mountains and plateau) strata. Through a step-wise metric selection process, 8-10 metrics were aggregated to comprise four stratum-specific GLIMPSS models (mountain/plateau and spring/summer). A comparison of GLIMPSS with WVSCI exhibited marked improvements where GLIMPSS detecting greater stream impacts. A variation of the GLIMPSS, which differs only in the family-level taxonomic identification of Chironomidae (GLIMPSS (CF)), was comparable to the full GLIMPSS. These MMIs are robust yet practical tools for evaluating impacts to water quality, instream and riparian habitat, and aquatic wildlife in wadeable riffle-run streams based on sensitivity, responsiveness, precision, and independent validation. These models may be used effectively to detect degradation of the naturally occurring benthic community, assess causes of biological degradation, and plan and evaluate remediation of damaged stream ecosystems.

AB  - This paper explores the physical and mechanical properties of interface transition zone between loess and paleosol. Four samples were collected from Jingyang in the southeast of the Chinese Loess Plateau, and subjected to site and lab shear tests, aiming to disclose the shear behavior of interface transition zone, which contains landslide hazards. The results show that the strength parameters of loess decreased by nearly 2/3 (a 18.8kPa drop in C value and an 8.7 degrees decrease in phi value), and the interfacial transition zone and paleosol decreased by less than 10% from the natural state to the saturated state. This means the interfacial transition zone is a natural slip bed of landslide.

AB  - The UK planning process has traditionally been separated from the licensing process as far as industry is concerned. Implementation of the Environmental Assessment Directive (85/337/EEC) has therefore been the responsibility of planners, not pollution regulators. This is one of the reasons why there are no formalized procedures for using dispersion models in the environmental assessment process. In the absence of centralized guidance, practitioners of environmental assessment have largely turned to the models made available by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). These models have proved to be very useful and able to provide a service to developers at an attractive price. It is likely that they will continue to be used in environmental assessment for the time being, unless compelling new economic or regulatory factors emerge.

AB  - Land-based aquaculture systems expose fish to elevated dissolved CO2 levels, a factor that is correlated with reduced growth, feed conversion efficiency and body condition index. The physiological basis underlying the pathological effects of environmental hypercapnia is poorly understood, in particular for marine fish species. We investigated whether changes in energy expenditure and the specific dynamic action (SDA) of digestion and assimilation could account for the lower growth of adult Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) under environmental hypercapnia. Fish acclimated to a partial pressure of 800 mu atm CO2 (0.6 mmHg, 1.5 mg/L) and 92001.Latm CO2 (7 mmHg, 18.7 mg/L) exhibited no difference in maintenance metabolic rates, which concurs with previous research for this species and other fish species. At 9200 ilatm CO2 Atlantic cod had a significantly diminished (14%) maximum aerobic capacity. While hypercapnia did not affect the amount of oxygen required for the SDA process, it did prolong the SDA duration by 23%. The longer SDA process time may offer an explanation for the observation of lower feed intake, growth and condition factor in long-term hypercapnia studies. Comparison of aerobic scope and cardiac performance during digestion suggested that reduced oxygen delivery capacity under hypercapnia could be one mechanism by which CO2 prolongs SDA, although our results could not definitively demonstrate this effect.

AB  - Knowledge of the gametogenic cycle and biochemical composition of commercially valuable species is important in aquaculture. Monthly variations in meat yield, gonadal development and biochemical composition of the bivalve Tapes decussatus were studied from January 2002 to December 2002 in the Sufa Lagoon in relation to environmental conditions. Histological evidence showed that gametogenesis began in January and major spawning started in July and appeared to continue into August and September. The majority of individuals were resorbing their gonad, or alternatively in a period of gonadal inactivity in October, November and December. When the gonad stage was ripe in April, the glycogen value was at the maximum level in contrast to protein which was at the minimum value. The glycogen value was at the minimal level during spawning and resting period. During the late gametogenesis the protein value was the highest in March and the following month when the gonad was ripe, protein was at the lowest. Lipid content fluctuated throughout the study. During the gametogenesis, the meat yield was observed to range between 12.7% and 26.8%. The results of this study showed that six stages of gonadal development of T decussatus were observed in transplanted area. Seawater temperature was the major factor rather than food availability on gametogenesis of carpet shell clam in the study area. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Economic developments in Alberta have resulted in widespread changes in land use that may deteriorate river conditions for fish. Fish assemblages were characterized with index of biological integrity metrics for the heavily-developed watershed of the Battle River, Alberta. Metric relationships with human stressors were quantified using regression and information theory methods. Although the fauna comprised 14 native species, 50% of the catch was white sucker (Catostomus commersoni Lacepede, 1803). Five statistically unrelated metrics were identified as being responsive to stressors: two trophic guilds, one habitat guild, one reproductive guild, and one measure of community structure. Regression showed that the cumulative effect of human developments, indexed as road density in the basin, was negatively linked to the relative abundance of lithophils and positively linked to the relative abundance of omnivores. Agriculture also threatened the integrity of fish assemblages. Stream sections with higher cattle densities in their basins had fewer lithophils and benthic invertivores; whereas stream sections with higher nutrient concentrations contained fewer species, as well as fewer top carnivores, but more true omnivores. Understanding effects of human footprints that are expanding in western Canada will be critical to the successful management of aquatic resources.

AB  - It is a relevant task for current agricultural research to predict and interpret the influence of climate change on the harmful organisms of crops and to adapt the phytosanitary management. Interpreting the bioclimatic scenarios of Phytophthora infestans, which is the causal agent of late blight of potato in the crops areas in Ciego de Avila during the period November - April for the years 2025 and 2030 under scenarios (SRES) A2 and B2 was the aim of this work. In the making of the bioclimatic scenarios, were used daily data of accumulated precipitation and the average temperature from the Regional Model PRECIS-CARIBE. In addition, the biological indexes required by the phytopathogen to develop epiphytics which are considered in the method of "threshold of rains" recommended by the technical instruction of the crop in Cuba were taken into account. The results agree on the existence of not favorable meteorological conditions for the development and evolution of late blight in both 2025 and 2030. Specifically, the scarce occurrence and the low cumulative of precipitations that do not exceed the levels indicated by the threshold line, as well as the incidence of average temperatures above 24 degrees C. The bioclimatic scenarios obtained for this Oomycetes provide information for future planning and phytosanitary management of the crop as well as for the selection of cultural inputs and services that favor the application of climate-smart agriculture that contributes to the sustainable production of the tuber.

AB  - Prompt assessment and management actions are required if we are to reduce the current rapid loss of habitat and biodiversity worldwide. Statistically valid quantification of the biota and habitat condition in water bodies are prerequisites for rigorous assessment of aquatic biodiversity and habitat. We assessed the ecological condition of streams in a southeastern Brazilian basin. We quantified the percentage of stream length in good, fair, and poor ecological condition according to benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage. We assessed the risk of finding degraded ecological condition associated with degraded aquatic riparian physical habitat condition, watershed condition, and water quality. We describe field sampling and implementation issues encountered in our survey and discuss design options to remedy them. Survey sample sites were selected using a spatially balanced, stratified random design, which enabled us to put confidence bounds on the ecological condition estimates derived from the stream survey. The benthic condition index indicated that 62 % of stream length in the basin was in poor ecological condition, and 13 % of stream length was in fair condition. The risk of finding degraded biological condition when the riparian vegetation and forests in upstream catchments were degraded was 2.5 and 4 times higher, compared to streams rated as good for the same stressors. We demonstrated that the GRTS statistical sampling method can be used routinely in Brazilian rain forests and other South American regions with similar conditions. This survey establishes an initial baseline for monitoring the condition and trends of streams in the region.

AB  - Under the warm and ice-rich nature of permafrost and the scenarios of climate warming on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, it will be necessary to employ new techniques of cooling the ground temperature in the construction of the proposed Qinghai-Tibet Express Highway. Research indicates that including of a coarsely crushed rock layer may produce enhanced cooling of the embankment and underlying foundation soils, due to natural convection during winter months. As compared with a railway embankment, a highway embankment has a much wider driving surface which consists of asphalt and cement-stabilized sand-gravel layers above the crushed rock layer, thus resulting in increasing of yearly mean surface temperatures and decreasing of temperature differences between the lower and upper boundaries of the crushed rock layer during winter months. For this type of the highway embankment, successful application of natural convection cooling concept to the crushed rock embankment of the proposed Qinghai-Tibet Express Highway still has many problems, such as thickness of the crushed rock layer filled in the embankment to trigger winter-time natural convection.
   Development of winter-time natural convection in the crushed rock highway embankment was studied by the numerical simulations. The results indicate that natural convection in the highway embankment begins to occur in the side slope regions and gradually develops from two side slope regions to the middle portion with lowering of yearly harmonic surface temperatures. The dependence of the natural convection index on thickness of the crushed rock layer in the highway embankment exhibits three regions, i.e., with increasing of the crushed rock layer thickness, a zero region in which there is no obvious development of winter-time natural convection, a rapid-increase region in which there is a significant increase in the cooling capability of winter-time natural convection and a no-appreciable-increase region in which there is no appreciable increase in the cooling capability of natural convection. Crushed rock layer thicknesses in the highway embankment, corresponding to the initial point and end point of the rapid-increase region, are defined as minimum and maximum thicknesses of the crushed rock layer, which would trigger winter-time natural convection. The choice of the temperature difference across the crushed rock layer is a key in applying the natural convection index successfully to evaluating critical thicknesses of the crushed rock layer in the highway embankment. Evaluation of crushed rock layer thicknesses, with various grain sizes, was also performed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Freshwater streams are critical resources that provide multiple benefits to humans and aquatic biota alike. As climate changes, it is projected that changes to the hydrological cycle and water temperatures will affect individual biota and aquatic ecosystems as a whole. The goal of this study was to determine the extent of climate change impacts on stream ecosystems as represented by four commonly used stream health indicators (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (EPT), Family Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI), Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), and fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI)). Seven watersheds in Michigan were selected based on stream thermal regimes. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to simulate streamflow and pollutant loads. Important variables for each thermal class were selected using a Bayesian variable selection method and used as inputs to adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems models of EFL FIBI, HBI, and IBI. Finally, an ensemble of climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 were used to determine the impacts of climate on the stream health in 2020-2040 compared to 1980-2000. The risk of declining stream health was determined using cumulative distribution functions. A stream temperature regression model was also developed to assess potential changes in stream thermal regimes, which could cause shifts in composition of aquatic communities. Several flow regime variables, including those related to flow variability;duration of extreme events, and timing were mainly affected by changing climate. At the watershed scale, most indicators were relatively insensitive to changing climate and the magnitude of stream health decline was low. However, at the reach scale, there are many instances of high risk and large magnitude of declines in the stream health indicators. At the same time, several streams experienced changes in thermal class, mostly transitioning from cold-transitional and cool streams to warm streams. This research demonstrated the applicability of the stream health modeling process in performing a climate change impacts assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The detection and prediction of lake ecosystem responses to environmental changes are pressing scientific challenge of major global relevance. Specifically, an understanding of lake ecosystem stability over long-term scales is urgently needed to identify impending ecosystem regime shifts induced by human activities and improve lake ecosystem protection. This study investigated regime shifts in cyanobacterial and eukaryotic algal communities in a large shallow lake over a century in response to nutrient enrichment and hydrologic regulation using evidence from empirical state indicators and ecological network analyses of sedimentary-inferred communities. The diversity and structure of cyanobacterial and eukaryotic algal communities were investigated from sedimentary DNA records and used, for the first time, as state variables of the lake ecosystem to detect lake stability. Two regime shifts were inferred in the 1970s and 2000s based on temporal analysis of empirical indicators. Co occurrence network analysis based on taxonomic abundance distributions and presence/absence patterns also supported the two regime shifts based on architectural features of the ecological networks. Moreover, the associations of cyanobacterial and eukaryotic algal taxa were observed to be non-random across time. The abrupt driver-mediated regime shift in the 1970s is characterized by the disappearance of submerged vegetation, significantly increased relative abundances of Microcystis and Chlorophyta taxa, and was primarily caused by sluice construction. The critical transition observed in the 2000s was manifested by the occurrence of serious cyanobacterial blooms and was triggered by increased nutrient loading with the development of urbanization and agricultural intensification. This study reveals the important roles of hydrologic regulation and nutrient loading in the temporal successional dynamics of a shallow lake ecosystem, providing new insights into regime shifts of lake ecosystems that can help inform future efforts to predict important lake ecosystem state changes.

AB  - Crustaceans are exposed to a range of environmental factors that can impact their condition, physiological function and growth. Condition indices are broadly defined as the extent to which stored nutrient reserves allow normal physiological function and growth, but can also represent more than nutrition alone. There is currently no reliable indicator to non-destructively measure shrimp physiological or nutritional condition. In this study, haemolymph and biochemical indices were benchmarked against a range of physiological status condition indicators, including haemolymph biochemistry parameters and carcass traits, in fed and unfed sub-adult black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and across the moult cycle. Results based on fluorescent marker injection and analysis of recovered amounts showed that haemolymph volume was elevated immediately after the moult, but decreased significantly within 2 days and remained stable for the remainder of the inter-moult period. Brix index (Brix) strongly correlated with haemolymph biochemical, shrimp condition and carcass composition indices. These included haemolymph volume, total protein and triglycerides, as well as gross energy, hepatosomatic index (HSI) and body weight gain per moult. Overall, results demonstrated that Brix was the simplest, fastest and most cost-effective indicator to accurately and non-destructively estimate physiological condition in P. monodon. Given the correlations with a broad range of indices, Brix may represent a more holistic estimate of condition, incorporating multifactorial aspects of shrimp condition including moult cycle and nutrition.

AB  - Animals subject to environmental stress often exhibit higher levels of developmental instability, frequently measured as Fluctuating Asymmetry (FA), small, random deviations from perfect left-right symmetry in bilaterally symmetrical animals. We used FA measurement as a means of determining the impact of a catastrophic ecosystem disturbance (a major Class F3 tornado) on populations of Schizocosa ocreata, a common forest-dwelling wolf spider. As FA in sexually selected ornamental traits in males has been shown in some (but not all) species studied to be a sensitive indicator of environmental stress, we measured FA of foreleg tufts in male S. ocreata. Spiders from the first post-disturbance generation were collected by pitfall trapping in the spring of 2000, and preserved specimens were photographed and measured using digital imaging. Spiders from disturbed and undisturbed areas within the forest did not differ significantly in body size parameters, although body condition varied significantly between sites. Signed (R-L) FA of male tuft area was normally distributed with a mean of zero, indicating "ideal" or "true" FA, a reflection of Developmental Instability (DI). Although tuft area was not significantly different between sites, tuft area FA in male S. ocreata was significantly higher in the disturbed site, suggesting that ecosystem-level stress may produce higher levels of developmental instability in arthropod populations. Results of our study indicate that FA in this secondary sexual character (male leg tufts) is a more sensitive indicator of putative environmental stress than a non-sexual trait (femur length). To our knowledge, this is the first study of FA in invertebrates associated with environmental stress from a catastrophic natural disturbance.

AB  - Red porgies (Pagrus pagrus) of 20.6 +/- 1.5 g mean weight were reared in tanks under four delayed self-feeding conditions (0 = control, 7, 30 and 90 s) after rod activation. The time intervals were chosen to simulate the time taken for a commercial pelleted feed to transit the tube linking a surface-mounted feed hopper and the depth at which a cage might be submerged. Daily feeding rate, growth, food conversion index and condition factor were quite similar but fish behaviour differed among conditions. Fish remained close to the feeding point in the first two treatments (0 and 7 s delay) but foraged more widely in the remaining treatments (30 and 90 s delay), only reconsolidating around the feeding point a few seconds before feed was released. Results are discussed in relation to learning capacity and adaptation of fish to feeding behaviour flexibility, in order to develop reliable self-feeding systems suitable for submerged cages.

AB  - In recent times many benthic indices have been proposed to assess the ecological quality of marine waters worldwide. In this study we compared single metrics and multi-metric methods to assess coastal and transitional benthic status along human pressure gradients in five distinct environments across Europe: Varna bay and lake (Bulgaria), Lesina lagoon (Italy), Mondego estuary (Portugal), Basque coast (Spain) and Oslofjord (Norway). Hence, 13 single metrics (abundance, number of taxa, and several diversity and sensitivity indices) and eight of the most common indices used within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) for benthic assessment were selected: index of size spectra (ISS), Benthic assessment tool (BAT), Norwegian quality index (NQI), Multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI), Benthic quality index (BQI), (Benthic ecosystem quality index (BEQI), Benthic index based on taxonomic sufficiency (BITS), and infaunal quality index (IQI). Within each system, sampling sites were ordered in an increasing pressure gradient according to a preliminary classification based on professional judgement. The different indices are largely consistent in their response to pressure gradient, except in some particular cases (i.e. BITS, in all cases, or ISS when a low number of individuals is present). Inconsistencies between indicator responses were most pronounced in transitional waters (i.e. IQI, BEQI), highlighting the difficulties of the generic application of indicators to all marine, estuarine and lagoonal environments. However, some of the single (i.e. ecological groups approach, diversity, richness) and multi-metric methods (i.e. BAT, M-AMBI, NQI) were able to detect such gradients both in transitional and coastal environments, being these multi-metric methods more consistent in the detection than single indices. This study highlights the importance of survey design and good reference conditions for some indicators. The agreement observed between different methodologies and their ability to detect quality trends across distinct environments constitutes a promising result for the implementation of the WFD's monitoring plans. Moreover, these results have management implications, regarding the dangers of misclassification, uncertainty in the assessment, use of conflicting indices, and testing and validation of indices.

AB  - This work was undertaken to assess the effects that different environmental conditions of tropical and temperate aquaculture sites have on growth, survival, and reproduction of diploid and triploid Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Diploid and triploid oysters were evaluated with the purpose of determining if the triploid condition results in any advantage on growth and survival that can be exploited for aquaculture of this species in tropical environments. The evaluations were performed by comparing three sites: two tropical sites in the Gulf of California and one temperate site in the Pacific Coast of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. When comparing tropical versus temperate sites, C. gigas growth and survival were less at the tropical sites regardless of ploidy. This can be attributed to environmental conditions, that is, high temperatures causing low productivity, in addition to an earlier-onset and sustained reproductive condition in the tropical sites when compared with the temperate site regardless of ploidy. Analyses of gonad maturation stages and number of oocytes among triploids indicated that a larger reproductive effort occurs at the tropical sites than at the temperate site. Regardless of the lower performance of both ploidy groups in the tropical environmental conditions, triploids grew significantly better than diploids in both tropical sites, and survival was the same for both ploidy groups. This contrasts with the marginal differences observed in growth between ploidies at the temperate site, where triploids showed lower survival than diploids. Possible causes for the lower triploid survival at this site are discussed.

AB  - There has been a significant increase in the literature regarding the effects of warming and acidification on the marine ecosystem. To our knowledge, there is. very little information on the potential effects of both combined stressors on marine grazer-seaweed interactions. Here, we evaluated, for the first time several phenotypic responses (e.g periwinkle survival, condition index, consumption rates, seaweed photosynthetic activity and oxidative stress) of the temperate periwinkle Littorina obtusata (grazer) and the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum (prey) to such climate change-related variables, for 15 days. Increased temperature (22 degrees C, pH 8.0) elicited a significant lethal effect on the periwinkle within a short-term period (mortality rate > 90%). Acidification condition (18 degrees C, pH 7.6) was the one that showed lower mortality rates (approximate to 20%) reflected by lower impact on periwinkle fitness and consumption rates. Under a scenario of increased temperature and lowered pH the antioxidant defences of L. obtusata seemed to be supressed increasing the risk of peroxidative damage. The seaweed evidenced signs of cellular damage under such conditions. These results suggest that: i) lower pH per se seems to benefit the interaction between grazer and seaweed while, ii) a combined scenario of increased temperature and lowered pH may be negative for the interaction, due to the unbalance between periwinkle mortality rates and consumption rates. But most importantly, since grazing often plays an important role on structuring natural communities, such predator-prey disturbances can elicit cascading effects on the remaining community structure and functioning of the temperate rocky-shore ecosystems.

AB  - The degree of developmental stability of individuals and populations is most often estimated by their level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) - the random deviations from perfect symmetry. In our previous work, we recorded high levels of FA (FAMI index: frequency of asymmetric manifestation of an individual) in Pelophylax ridibundus populations that inhabit biotopes at Sazliyka River, south Bulgaria with high levels of anthropogenic pollution (domestic sewage pollution). At the same time, in the biotopes located in the upper reaches of the river (less disrupted habitats), the populations showed low levels of FA. Currently, we present the results of the study of the values of several morphological parameters: snout-vent length (SVL), body weight (BW), and body condition factor (CF) in the same populations of P. ridibundus. In addition, we evaluate the correlation between the values of these morphological parameters and the values of fluctuating asymmetry (the FAMI index), using the Kendall rank correlation analysis. The analysis of the relationships between the parameters characterizing the physical fitness of frogs and the indicator of developmental stability - the FAMI index - did not establish statistically significant correlations in the analyses in the whole groups of P. ridibundus from each site and in the correlations between sexes. We believe that the approaches to the study of developmental stability (analysis of fluctuating asymmetry levels) and those related to the assessment of physical fitness (health status) of frogs should be applied independently of each other.

AB  - Generally, aquatic communities reflect the effects of anthropogenic changes such as deforestation or organic pollution. The Cerrado stands among the most threatened ecosystems by human activities in Brazil. In order to evaluate the ecological integrity of the streams in a preserved watershed in the Northern Cerrado biome corresponding to a mosaic of ecosystems in transition to the Amazonia biome in Brazil, biological metrics related to diversity, structure, and sensitivity of aquatic macroinvertebrates were calculated. Sampling included collections along stretches of 200 m of nine streams and measurements of abiotic variables (temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and discharge) and the Index of Habitat Integrity (HII). The values of the abiotic variables and the HII indicated that most of the streams have good ecological integrity, due to high oxygen levels and low concentrations of dissolved solids and electric conductivity. Two streams showed altered HII scores mainly related to small dams for recreational and domestic use, use of Cerrado natural pasture for cattle raising, and spot deforestation in bathing areas. However, this finding is not reflected in the biological metrics that were used. Considering all nine streams, only two showed satisfactory ecological quality (measured by Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP), total richness, and EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) richness), only one of which had a low HII score. These results indicate that punctual measures of abiotic parameters do not reveal the long-term impacts of anthropic activities in these streams, including related fire management of pasture that annually alters the vegetation matrix and may act as a disturbance for the macroinvertebrate communities. Due to this, biomonitoring of low order streams in Cerrado ecosystems of the Northern Central Brazil by different biotic metrics and also physical attributes of the riparian zone such as HII is recommended for the monitoring and control of anthropic impacts on aquatic communities.

AB  - On the basis of our collected material and historical information we assess phytoplankton dynamics in Kondopoga Bay, the Lake Onego in 1993-2011. The summer communities from continuously studied sampling stations contain 100 species belonging to eight divisions: Bacillariophyta, 40; Chlorophyta, 25; Cyanobacteria, 13; Chrysophyta, 12; Euglenophyta, 2; Dinophyta, 4; Cryptophyta, 3; and Xanthophyta, 1. Sample richness varied between 16 and 54 species, with a negative overall trend during the study period, but increases in Cyanobacteria and Dinophyta. Bioindication analysis shows that water acidification slowly rising from 1993 to 2011 with organic pollution (Index saprobity S) and the number of species with heterotrophic ability. In 1990s, the total abundance and biomass were on average 1.5 times higher than in 2000-2011, having similar fluctuation ranges (Pearson 0.74), with peaks in 1996 and 2006. At the same time, species richness decreased, showing a depletion of algal communities. Two critically impacted periods are revealed with the Shannon index in 1996 and 2007 and on the basis of the Aquatic Ecosystem State Index (WESI) calculation in 1995 and 2007, related to Kondopoga industrial wastewater influx enriched in nutrients and other contaminants. As a whole, the WESI was extremely high, reflecting a high self-purification capacity in respect to phosphate concentration in the bay. The canonical corresponded analysis (CCA) shows two different sets of taxa, those stimulated by temperature and nitric nitrogen (Anabaena scheremetievii Elenkin, Dolichospermum lemmermannii (Ricter) P. Wacklin, L. Hoffmann & J. Komarek, and Aulacoseira alpigena (Grunow) Krammer), and sensitive autotroph species inhabiting cool to temperate clear waters (Aulacoseira distans (Ehrenberg) Simonsen, Ankistrodesmus fusiformis Corda ex Korshikov, Mucidosphaerium pulchellum (H.C. Wood) C. Bock, Proschold & Krienitz). The comparative statistics with GRAPS program revealed two cores of species richness in years 1996 and 2011 that included most of species. The long-term dynamics of relative cell volume shows that phytoplankton communities were enriched with small-celled species, such as Cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutzing) Kutzing) and Cryptophyta (Cryptomonas sp. and Katablepharis ovalis Skuja) in the period between 1998 and 2006. Pearson correlation for Shannon index and relative cell biovolume is negative (-0.79), showing high stability of species rich communities under environmental impacts. Two periods of dinoflagellate blooms (1998, 2007) followed the peaks of total abundance and biomass (1996, 2006). Such correlation makes the Kondopoga Bay ecosystem comparable to those of large lakes in spite of a heavier anthropogenic impact from Kondopoga pulp and paper mill wastewater.

AB  - Synergistic effects of warming on bioconcentration and receptiveness of pollutants are still poorly unravelled in conjunction with cellular and molecular responses. The present study addressed the impact of an environmental relevant dose of chlorpyrifos (organophosphate pesticide), under control (25 degrees C) and elevated levels of temperature (30 degrees C, 35 degrees C) in Bellamya bengalensis, a freshwater gastropod for 60 days across various endpoints. Multiple levels of biomarkers were measured: growth conditions (organ to flesh weight ratio, condition index), oxidative stress status (SOD, CAT, GST, LPO) and DNA damage (Comet assay-3rd, 30th and 60th days only) after acute (24, 48 and 72 h) and long-term exposures (10th, 20th, 30th, 40th, 50th and 60th days). An integrated biomarker response (IBR) strategy was adapted to amalgamate results generated from various biomarkers to assess organism's vulnerability to pesticide pollution and how it may shift with warming climate. Significant changes were observed in growth conditions under longer exposure periods. Acute as well as long-term exposures enhanced the antioxidant and detoxification enzyme activity. DNA damage was extensive under longer exposure to stress howbeit was also significantly escalated under acute severe warming. Antioxidant and detoxification mechanisms fell short in counteracting cellular level damage. The IBR results indicated long-term acclimation of B. bengalensis to elevated temperatures and pesticide contamination lead to an improved tolerance level howbeit, acute stress was more detrimental. This study provided evidence for the efficiency of employing an integrated biomarker approach for B. bengalensis in future bio-monitoring studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Color aberration in birds is a common biological phenomenon relative to other vertebrates. To date, a large number of avian species with abnormally colored individuals have been documented. Although evidence has shown that color aberration may co-vary with morphological and physiological traits, little information is available on the variations of morphological and physiological traits of free-living aberrantly colored birds. Here we report a case of a free-living female Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) with bleached bill but normally pigmented plumage. We further compare the differences in 5 morphological indices including body mass, body condition index (BCI), length of the bill, tarsus, and wing, and 14 physiological indices including core temperature, hematocrit (Hct), baseline plasma glucose (GLU), total protein (TP), uric acid (UA), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), free fatty acid (FFA), beta-hydmxybutyrate (beta-HB), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and creatinine (CREA) between the aberrant individual and other normal birds. Our results show that the aberrant span low has significantly shorter tarsi, longer wings, and higher core temperature, lower levels of plasma TP, UA, LDL-C, ALP, and CREA than normal sparrows, while no significant differences were noted in other morphological and physiological indices between the 2 phenotypes. Our results indicate that bill-color aberration in the Eurasian Tree Sparrow may be associated with a few morphological and physiological alterations, especially in terms of thermoregulation and protein metabolism. However, these alterations do not result in dramatic changes in body condition, other plasma metabolites, or enzyme activities.

AB  - Water bodies located in urban areas are subject to enormous pressure from use and, in addition to their ecological function, must above all meet economic and social requirements. Although the European Water Framework Directive calls for the improvement of water bodies and defines the achievement of good ecological and chemical status as an objective, urban water bodies are often not considered as a priority due to the lack of a reporting obligation (catchment area < 10 km(2)) or the classification as heavily modified water bodies as well as the costly improvement of the ecological potential in the planning and implementation of measures. One reason for this are the conflicting objectives of urban planning and ecological requirements. In this area of conflict, the ecosystem services approach can be used as a decision-making and assessment tool. This article specifically examines the ecosystem services of urban watercourses and presents them with the help of the River Ecosystem Service Index (RESI), developed in Germany. The watercourse chosen to serve as an example in this article is the Darmbach, a small, settlement-dominated stream with an about 8-km section flowing through the city limits of Darmstadt. At the same time, the applicability of RESI for urban waters is thus tested and its transferability discussed. As part of the study, calculations are carried out for a total of seven ecosystem services in accordance with the specifications of the RESI application manual. It is shown that the calculated indicators can be transferred to urban waters, in some cases even without modification. Despite the fact that the RESI has so far only been applied to large water bodies, e.g. the Elbe and Danube, it is possible to map the ecosystem services provided by renaturing the Darmbach. Problems in applying the RESI to smaller water bodies result mainly from the partly insufficient measurement data stock and often insufficient transferability of the spatial reference. In order to be able to map all aspects of water bodies dominated by settlements, it is recommended that the indicators under consideration be extended to take account of the special conditions in settlement areas. In addition to considering individual urban biotopes as a contribution to biodiversity, this also includes the enhancement of the urban landscape through urban nature and the specific urban ecological quality for local recreation. The consideration of ecosystem services within urban planning and water development planning in urban areas enables an integrative assessment of planning projects and, from a current climate policy perspective, represents an important addition to previous assessments. Furthermore, the indicator-based approach to the assessment of ecosystem services is a way of presenting them objectively and reproducibly.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of remote sensing indices including the perpendicular drought index (PDI), modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) in drought monitoring in the northeast of Iran during 2003-2013. The mentioned indices were extracted from 254 atmospherically corrected MODIS images, and their accuracy was determined against soil moisture data and also standardized precipitation index (SPI) at monthly and yearly scales. The 1-, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month SPI was obtained from 42 weather stations. According to the results, although the MODIS-derived drought indices had different efficiencies at different time scales, they could generally better reflect drought conditions at the yearly scale compared to the monthly scale. At the monthly scale, the PDI, MPDI and TVDI had the greatest correlations with the SPI during the 6-, 9- and 3-month periods ending in February, September and April (-0.60, -0.69 and -0.43, respectively). At the yearly scale, the PDI, MPDI and TVDI had the strongest correlation coefficients with the 6-, 6-, 3-month SPI in 2012 (-0.95), 2012 (-0.96) and 2007 (-0.72), respectively. Moreover, the high correlations (> 80%) between the MODIS-derived drought indices and soil moisture data reflected their potential in the mapping of soil moisture in the study area. Considering the constant performance of the MPDI in different time scales, this index can be used as a suitable alternative to the SPI in agricultural drought mapping and monitoring in arid and semiarid areas where the SPI faces certain limitations.

AB  - Divergence in ecological niche offers organisms the opportunity of exploiting different food and habitat resources, scaling down competition and predation both among species, and within different age or size-classes of the same species. In harsh environments, where abiotic factors determine a clustering of resources during short timespans, competition and predation between organisms is likely to be enhanced. This is the case in tropical dry forests, where amphibians have limited opportunities to feed, their activity being restricted to the short rainy season. One way to maximize resource exploitation while avoiding predation risk is by adopting different diel activity patterns. We tested this hypothesis by comparing activity patterns in adults and recently metamorphosed juveniles of Pacific horned frogs (Ceratophrys stolzmanni) during field surveys and in an experimental study. Field surveys showed that the adults are strictly nocturnal, whereas freshly metamorphosed juveniles can be found active above ground at all hours, with a peak activity during daytime. The average body condition index of juveniles found active during the night was higher than that of juveniles found active during the day, suggesting that the weaker individuals may be constrained to being active during the day. On the other hand, in a laboratory experiment, juveniles that were visually exposed to adults moved less than those in the absence of adults. Both field and experimental observations indicate a temporal niche divergence between life stages. The results of the experiment offer support to the hypothesis that the juveniles in this species display an inverse activity pattern compared to adults, which can reduce competitive interactions and predation pressure from the larger conspecifics.

AB  - DROUGHT and heat stress are considered the most abiotic stresses that affecting crop production in desert areas. Accordingly, two field trials during the 2019 and 2020 were performed at the Agricultural Experiment Station of Desert Research Center, EL-Kharga Oasis, New Valley Governorate, Egypt, to investigate the response of pearl millet to three irrigation levels (100, 75, and 50 % of the water requirement) and five rates of soil mulch (0, 2.4, 4.8, 7.2 and 9.5ton ha(-1)) under predominant water-scarce and heat stress conditions. The findings showed that pearl millet yields and their traits, as well as grain protein content and water use efficiency (WUE), were significantly affected by mulching, irrigation levels, and their interaction in both seasons. Soil mulching by 9.5ton ha(-1) gave the highest values for plant height, panicle length, and WUE as compared with un-mulching in both seasons. Whereas, the highest values of grains number/panicle, grain weight/panicle, seed index, biological and grain yields as well as grain protein content were recorded with mulching by 7.2ton ha(-1) as compared to un-mulching in both seasons. Fully irrigated pearl millet recorded the highest values for all the studied attributes, except WUE, but statistically at par with 75% of the water requirement and each of was over 50% of the water requirement in both seasons. It can be inferred that adding 7.2ton ha(-1) soil mulch and 75% of the water requirement may be the optimal practice to improve the productivity of pearl millet in hyper-arid areas.

AB  - Communities of large copepods form an essential hub of matter and energy fluxes in Arctic marine food webs. Intraguild predation on eggs and early larval stages occurs among the different species of those communities and it has been hypothesized to impact its structure and function. In order to better understand the interactions between dominant copepod species in the Arctic, we conducted laboratory experiments that quantified intraguild predation between the conspicuous and omnivorous Metridia longa and the dominant Ca/anus hyperboreus. We recorded individual egg ingestion rates for several conditions of temperature, egg concentration, and alternative food presence. In each of these experiments, at least some females ingested eggs but individual ingestion rates were highly variable. The global mean ingestion rate of M. longa on C. hyperboreus eggs was 5.8 eggs ind(-1) d(-1), or an estimated 37% of M. longa daily metabolic need. Among the different factors tested and the various individual traits considered (prosome length, condition index), only the egg concentration had a significant and positive effect on ingestion rates. We further explored the potential ecological impacts of intraguild predation in a simple 1D numerical model of C. hyperboreus eggs vertical distribution in the Amundsen Gulf. Our modeling results showed an asymmetric relationship in that M. longa has little potential impact on the recruitment of C. hyperboreus (<3% egg standing stock removed by IGP at most) whereas the eggs intercepted by the former can account for a significant portion of its metabolic requirement during winter (up to a third).

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate how chemical gradients and physical habitats influence trophic dynamics and chemical tolerance in relation to ecological health, based on biological integrity model in the absence of cascading pressures (cascading theory) as a control mechanism of aquatic ecosystems. We conducted physical, chemical, and biological surveys from 76 national streams and rivers of four major watersheds during 20042005 along with surveys of 80 reference streams. Maximum species richness lines (MSRLs) in reference sites vs. regular sampling sites indicated that the third- to fifth-order streams were evidently impaired in the metrics of trophic and tolerant components. These trophic modifications were linked with land-use patterns, which resulted in differences of nutrients (N, P), organic matter contents and the N:P ratios on trophic structures. Overall, these trophic factors influenced ecological health, based on multimetric index of biological integrity model in these systems, so that trophic compositions and tolerance were regulated by bottom-up hypothesis.

AB  - Algae are among the key organisms of aquatic ecosystems. While there have been a large number of important algological studies on different river basins in Turkey, the use of algae in biomonitoring is a new approach. Epiphytic and epilithic algae in the Melen River were studied between May 2003 and April 2004. A total of 148 taxa, with 101 belonging to Bacillariophyta, 18 to Chlorophyta, 9 to Charophyta, 13 to Cyanobacteria, 5 to Euglenophyta, and 2 to Miozoa, were identified in this study. Members of Bacillariophyta were the dominant taxa at all sites, with oligohalobious-indifferents and alkaliphiles being the most common. Among the non-diatom taxa, there were more species with oligohalobious-indifferent and indifferent properties. The river water was alkaline and temperate, with low salinity characters. Bio-indications (autecology) of the river were studied. From the results, organic pollution indicators of Watanabe's classification (46 species, 31.1%) constituted three groups (saproxen, eurysaprobe and saprophile). Based on the classification (according to Watanabe's system) and RPI (River Polluted Index), the ecological conditions of Melen River were assessed as low, with a moderate level of organic pollution, and lightly to moderately polluted, respectively.

AB  - Bivalve shellfish aquaculture provides many benefits to society, beyond their traditional market value. This study collates the evidence available on the provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services provided by the bivalve species commonly used in aquaculture. For the first time, it synthesises this evidence to provide a global assessment of the potential market and non-market economic value of bivalve aquaculture. Bivalves are filter feeders, filtering water and particulates, creating substrates which provide habitat to act as nursery grounds for other species. Goods from provisioning services include meat, worth an estimated $23.9 billion as well as, pearls, shell and poultry grit, with oyster shell being the most important, with a global potential worth of $5.2 billion. The most important regulating services are nutrient remediation. Cultivated bivalves remove 49,000 tonnes of nitrogen and 6,000 tonnes of phosphorus, worth a potential $1.20 billion. Currently, there is little evidence on the cultural services per year of bivalve aquaculture, but we argue that these cultural values are broad ranging, although difficult to quantify. Our assessment indicates that the global, non-food bivalve aquaculture services are worth $6.47 billion ($2.95 billion-9.99 billion) per annum. However, this is likely to be an underestimate of the true value of bivalve aquaculture as there are significant gaps in evidence of the value for a number of key services. The analysis presented here can be used to indicate the likely scale of payments for ecosystem services provided by bivalve aquaculture, prior to more detailed assessments.

AB  - Species of the dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium produce phycotoxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning. Blooms of Alexandrium minutum reach very high concentrations of vegetative cells in the water column; and when these blooms occur, large numbers of toxic cysts can be produced and deposited on sediments becoming available to benthic species. The present study investigated the potential effect of exposure to toxic cysts of A. minutum on the periwinkle Littorina littorea. Snails were exposed for nine days to pellicle cysts of toxic and non-toxic dinoflagellates, A. minutum and Heterocapsa triquetra, respectively, followed by six days of depuration while they were fed only H. triquetra. Toxin accumulation, condition index, immune and histopathological responses were analyzed. Histological alterations were also monitored in snails exposed to a harmful A. minutum bloom, which naturally occurred in the Bay of Brest. Snails exposed to toxic cysts showed abnormal behavior that seems to be toxin-induced and possibly related to muscle paralysis. Periwinkles accumulated toxins by preying on toxic cysts and accumulation appeared dependent on the time of exposure, increasing during intoxication period but tending to stabilize during depuration period. Toxic exposure also seemed to negatively affect hemocyte viability and functions, as ROS production and phagocytosis. Histological analyses revealed that toxic exposure induced damages on digestive organs of snails, both in laboratory and natural systems. This study demonstrates that an exposure to the toxic dinoflagellate A. minutum leads to sublethal effects on L. littorea, which may alter individual fitness and increase the susceptibility of snails to pathogens and diseases.

AB  - Juvenile mussels (Mytilus edulis) were transplanted to Howe Sound, British Columbia, Canada, along an apparent pollution gradient of acid mine drainage (AMD) from an abandoned copper (Cu) mine. Cages containing 75 mussels each were placed at a total of 15 stations and were exposed to concentrations of dissolved Cu in surface waters ranging from 5 to 1009 mug/1 for a period of 41 days. Mussels located at stations closer to the source of AMD at the mouth of Britannia Creek bioaccumulated higher concentrations of Cu and zinc (Zn) in their tissues. Mussel growth was adversely affected by Cu tissue concentrations above 20 mug/g dry wt., while declines in survival and condition index occurred in mussels that bioaccumulated greater than 40 mug/g dry wt. Cu. Tissue Zn concentrations (117-192 mug/g dry wt.) were likely not high enough to have a direct impact on mussel health. Reduced survival of transplanted mussels was supported by an absence of natural mussels in contaminated areas. Phytoplankton was also severely reduced in areas contaminated by mine waters. Based on the weight of evidence, AMD from the Britannia mine had a deleterious impact on mussel survival in a zone extending at least 2.1 km to the north and 1.7 km to the south of Britannia Creek on the east shore of Howe Sound.

AB  - This paper presents a system-on-chip circuit architecture that enables the extraction of concentration information directly from a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) probe, independent of ambient fluctuations in the reference medium, temperature, and background light. Compensation for these baseline (bulk) interferences is embedded into the baseline integration state of the photodetectors in the optical path, creating a "flat line" for the baseline [no analyte present/bulk refractive index (RI)] condition and the characteristic SPR dips for the measurement (analyte present) condition. A resolution of 2 x 10(-4) RI units is possible with this system, comparable to the 5 X 10(-4) RI unit resolution of conventional signal processing (software-based) approaches to processing the same data using a similar framework. This approach demonstrates experimentally the capability of the dip-based SPR probe in a portable footprint for detecting RI at resolution levels suitable for practical applications of these probes to field environments.

AB  - With the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), the member states have to classify the ecological status of surface waters following standardised procedures. It was a matter of some surprise to lake ecologists that zooplankton were not included as a biological quality element (BQE) despite their being considered to be an important and integrated component of the pelagic food web. To the best of our knowledge, the decision of omitting zooplankton is not wise, and it has resulted in the withdrawal of zooplankton from many so-far-solid monitoring programmes. Using examples from particularly Danish, Estonian, and the UK lakes, we show that zooplankton (sampled from the water and the sediment) have a strong indicator value, which cannot be covered by sampling fish and phytoplankton without a very comprehensive and costly effort. When selecting the right metrics, zooplankton are cost-efficient indicators of the trophic state and ecological quality of lakes. Moreover, they are important indicators of the success/failure of measures taken to bring the lakes to at least good ecological status. Therefore, we strongly recommend the EU to include zooplankton as a central BQE in the WFD assessments, and undertake similar regional calibration exercises to obtain relevant and robust metrics also for zooplankton as is being done at present in the cases of fish, phytoplankton, macrophytes and benthic invertebrates.

AB  - Environmental security is the guarantee of human well-being. This paper discusses the dynamic change process of wetland landscape pattern in Shengjin Lake of Anhui Province and establishes the ecological security Press-state-response model of Shengjin Lake and its driving forces in order to provide a scientific basis for further research and restoration on wetland protection of Shengjin Lake. With the support of remote sensing and GIS technology, four TM images in 1986, 1995, 2008 and 2019 were used as the basic information sources for analysis. The landscape pattern in Shengjin Lake has changed greatly with the significant increasing area of woodland and reed beach as well as the remarkable increasing area of water area, paddy field and construction land. The diversity index show an upward trend whereas the dominance index is contrary. The fragmentation degree is intensifying and the plaque types showed a trend of diversity. The intensified degree of landscape fragmentation and the growing number of patches will make the fragmentation of wetland ecosystem increasingly serious and influence the storage capacity of wetland, it will also change the hydrological conditions of the whole wetland and weaken the ecological benefits of wetland. In addition, the wetland ecological security index under the change of landscape pattern is decreasing years by years, the wetland ecological security form is in a state of warning and the situation is not optimistic. Through Pearson correlation analysis, it was found that agricultural development and utilization have a great impact on the population of white-headed crane in Shengjin Lake. In recent years, the economy development, increasing human population and construction land, and the intensification of reclamation activities as well as the transformation of the study area caused by human activities all have relatively reduced the area of natural wetland and affected the habitat of organisms. The ecological function of Shengjin Lake wetland is also continuing to decline. Natural and human factors have become the main driving forces of wetland pattern change.

AB  - The advantages of quantitative ultramorphological (QUM) sperm analysis in the diagnosis and treatment of male infertility are presented. QUM methodology is based on three elements: (1) complementary SEM and TEM observations of 7 sperm cell subcellular organelles: acrosome, postacrosomal lamina, nucleus, neck, axoneme, mitochondrial sheath, and outer dense fibers; (2) systematic classification of the specific ultramorphological malformations into 4 pathological and the normal categories, which indicate the morphological state of each subcellular organelle; and (3) comparison between well-define deference groups with opposite fertility status or treatment conditions. QUM analysis has enabled the establishment of two indices that optimally express the in vivo and in vitro male fertility potential: The Natural Fertility Index (NFI), which allowed an accurate prediction (97% sensitivity and 90% specificity) of 80% of the naturally fertile and suspected infertile male patients, and the in vitro fertilization (IVF) score, which enabled prediction of;76% of the nonfertilizing and 90% of the fertilizing IVF groups. Validation tests confirmed these data. QUM also enabled assessment of ultramorphological indications for varicocele and radiation exposure: Both male factor etiologies indicated a persistent effect on the natural fertility potential, as expressed by structural changes in the nucleus. Varicocele was found to cause defects in the sperm head organelles related to early spermatid development, whereas ionizing radiation resulted in amorphous head shape. Criteria for specific non-in vitro therapeutic interventions such as varicocelectomy, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) administration, and acupuncture treatment were established. A varicocele index, which enabled the correct classification of 79 and 89% of the patients pre- and post-high ligation, respectively, was suggested to be a good indicator for varicocele which affects the fertility potential. Males exhibiting idiopathic impairment of sperm acrosome and nucleus were found to be potential responders to FSH treatment, whereas patients exhibiting low sperm activity;proved to be good candidates for acupuncture treatment. Indications for selecting the optimal appropriate assisted reproduction technique (ART) procedure were found: Patients with a low Natural Fertility Index should be recommended for ART. A first choice ART selection should be pet-formed according to an ART index based on the ultramorphological examination of the tail axoneme. The above index enabled correct prediction of 78% of the patients who achieved pregnancy following conventional ART (intrauterine insemination or IVF) and 74% of those whose wives conceived only following intracytoplasmic sperm injection. QUM sperm analysis is clinically informative, nontraumatic, and in the long run also cost-effective. This analysis should be performed when the male infertility factor cannot be clearly diagnosed by routine tests and prior to the first ART trial.

AB  - This paper deals with the free vibration of a skew functionally graded material (FGM) plate in the thermal environment. A higher-order shear deformation theory (HOSDT) is employed to develop a finite element model of the plate. The material properties are assumed to be temperature-dependent and are graded along the thickness direction as per simple power law distribution in terms of volume fraction of metal and ceramic constituent phases. The model is based on an eight-noded isoparametric element with seven degrees of freedom (DOFs) per node. The general displacement equation provides C-0 continuity. The transverse shear strain undergoes parabolic variation through the thickness of the plate. The governing equations are derived using the Hamilton's principle. The obtained results are compared with the published results to determine the accuracy of the method. The effects of various parameters like aspect ratio, side-thickness ratio, volume fraction index, boundary conditions and skew angle on the natural frequencies are investigated.

AB  - Salamanders are important biological indicators of freshwater aquatic ecosystems. The Eastern Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis, is found primarily in streams across the southeastern, midwestern, and eastern portions of the United States. However, this unique large aquatic salamander is facing numerous threats and declines across its geographic range, including in Appalachia. Moreover, little is known regarding the early life history stages (gilled larvae), particularly regarding food availability (aquatic insects present in streams) and body condition. In this study, we assessed the macroinvertebrate communities of streams sampled for larval C. alleganiensis and report on the body condition index within western North Carolina streams. We found varying levels of diversity across sample locations for macroinvertebrates (total sampled = 3,619, representing over 30 genera), with the most prevalent insects from Trichoptera order, with an overall high percent of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) in all streams, ranging from 68.5% to 90.7%. Functional Feeding Groups included 40.5% filterers, 24.3% predators, 17.6% gatherers, 10.7% shredders, and 6.9% scrapers. Shannon Diversity Index in sample streams ranged from 2.101 to 2.698. Body condition or SMI (scaled mass index) ranged from 1.5 to 3.3 across sites with a largely consistent and strong linear relationship between log mass and total length (r(2) = 0.910). Our results add to the body of knowledge on the larval ecology of this North American salamander and may aid in future management of future management of hellbender stream habitats.

AB  - Organisms exposed to suboptimal environments incur a cost of dealing with stress in terms of metabolic resources. The total amount of energy available for maintenance, growth and reproduction, based on the biochemical analysis of the energy budget, may provide a sensitive measure of stress in an organism. While the concept is clear, linking cellular or biochemical responses to the individual and population or community level remains difficult. The aim of this study was to validate, under field conditions, using cellular energy budgets [i.e. changes in glycogen-, lipid- and protein-content and mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS)] as an ecologically relevant measurement of stress by comparing these responses to physiological and organismal endpoints. Therefore, a 28-day in situ bioassay with zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) was performed in an effluent-dominated stream. Five locations were selected along the pollution gradient and compared with a nearby (reference) site. Cellular Energy Allocation (CEA) served as a biomarker of cellular energetics, while Scope for Growth (SFG) indicated effects on a physiological level and Tissue Condition Index and wet tissue weight/dry tissue weight ratio were used as endpoints of organismal effects. Results indicated that energy budgets at a cellular level of biological organization provided the fastest and most sensitive response and energy budgets are a relevant currency to extrapolate cellular effects to higher levels of biological organization within the exposed mussels.

AB  - Background: Natural M. chilensis populations dominate habitats with a steep environmental gradient, and that are characterized by abrupt changes in salinity and exposure to desiccation. Although these populations are the source of seed supplies for the Chilean mussel culture industry (annual production around 250 thousand Tons), knowledge about natural populations is scarce. Based on video transect recordings, this study carries out research into one of the principal mussel beds and its associated epibenthic community in the Reloncavi Fjord, both along cross-shore and along-shore distribution gradients.
   Results: Mytiluschilensis was observed between the middle intertidal zone and the upper subtidal zone (between approximately 9 and 26 psu), with a richer associated community towards the subtidal zone and the fjord mouth. The mussel Condition Index (total meat weight/shell length*100) in the intertidal zone was significantly greater than in the subtidal zone, which raises questions about the reproductive contribution of mussels along the intertidal mid-subtidal gradient.
   Conclusions: Salinity and tidal variations, together with biological interactions, would seem to be key factors for explaining M. chilensis spatial distribution in the Reloncavi fjord, where beds appear to be in a contraction stage, as evidenced by M. chilensis scarcity towards the subtidal zone. The importance of these populations and their persistence in environments with high perturbation frequency, suggests a monitoring program should be implemented that considers both population spatial distribution and the changing environmental conditions.

AB  - In this paper, a marine environmental sensitivity index system was constructed based on three factors: the marine biological species sensitivity, the marine ecological value sensitivity and the social and economic sensitivity. Combined with numerical simulations of Cs-137 in the Beibu Gulf under the condition of a level-7 nuclear accident, a comprehensive risk assessment of marine radioactivity under the simulated accident in the Beibu Gulf was carried out. The results show that the areas at high risk and medium-to-high risk to marine radioactivity are mainly concentrated within 30 km of the Fangchenggang Nuclear Power Plant. The medium-risk areas are mainly distributed in sea areas within 30-50 km of the nuclear power plant, and the other sea areas are low-risk areas. The distribution of the risk sources and the characteristics of the regional tidal currents are the main factors affecting the magnitude and distribution of the comprehensive risk of regional marine radioactivity.

AB  - The coming century is predicted to feature enhanced climatic variability, including increased frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme climatic events. Ecologists are faced with the critical challenge of anticipating potentially nonlinear ecosystem responses to these changes. High-resolution paleoecological data sets that capture past ecosystem responses to climate variability provide valuable long-term perspectives on the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate-forced state shifts. We used a suite of paleoecological analyses at Titus Bog in northwestern Pennsylvania, USA, to test the hypothesis that the development and expansion of floating peatlands in kettlehole basins represents a threshold response to hydroclimate variability. In contrast with expectations of gradual autogenic peat mat expansion, our results indicate that peat mat expansion at Titus Bog was highly episodic and occurred in three distinct pulses centered on 800, 650, and 400 cal yr BP. Each of these expansion events coincided with or immediately followed decadal-to-mutlidecadal droughts recorded in regional paleoclimate reconstructions. These patterns indicate that peatland development in kettlehole basins can follow nonlinear trajectories, with episodes of rapid advancement triggered by climatic forcing. Future climate changes may increase the likelihood of peatland expansion in kettlehole basins, potentially leading to abrupt changes in adjacent lake ecosystems.

AB  - According to the genic capture hypothesis, the maintenance of additive genetic variation in fitness-related traits is due to both condition-dependence of these traits and high genetic variation for condition. Evidence supporting this latter assumption is scarce. In this study, we investigated, using hemiclonal analysis, standing genetic variation for condition and relative adult fitness in male Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) (Diptera: Drosophilidae). The absolute fat and the relative fat content were used as indices of body condition and were measured along with adult relative fitness from males reared in high or low larval densities. The results did not demonstrate genetic variation for condition or adult relative fitness. However, the larval density encountered during development had a strong and significant effect on all traits. Surprisingly, although not significant, negative selection gradients acting on absolute fat and relative fat content were also found in both treatments. These findings challenge one of the main assumptions of the genic capture hypothesis and the use of fat content as an ideal index of condition.

AB  - The Selenga River is the main tributary of Lake Baikal (Siberian, Russia). In 2015/2016, the water quality at previously identified contaminated hotspot regions in the lower Selenga River basin was evaluated using resident aquatic macroinvertebrate communities as bioindicators. Benthic macroinvertebrate communities within the Selenga River were found to be relatively sensitive to water pollution as was highlighted by three evaluated biotic indices:Average Score per Taxon (ASPT); Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera density index (EFT); and Trent Biological Index (TIM). The human impact on the Selenga River basin water quality was evident due to the significant decrease of the biotic indices at several sample locations including downstream of the wastewater discharge point of Ulan-Ude city, in the Dzhida River downstream of the confluence of the Modonkul River, and especially in the Modonkul River near to the mining operations at Zakamensk. At the same time, our study revealed a high self-regeneration ability of the aquatic ecosystem throughout the basin; with resident benthic macroinvertebrate communities appearing to recover in both the Selenga River and the Dzhida River within two to five km downstream of the contamination source. The changes in the benthic communities at the Selenga delta sampling sites were shown to occur under the influence of natural factors such as hydrological conditions and benthic sediment type, which significantly changed from the upper to the lower regions of the delta. For the Selenga delta, a typology of benthic macroinvertebrate communities including a map of their spatial distribution is presented. (C) 2019 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

AB  - In order to assess the aquatic ecosystem health in Yongjiang River, 13 sites from were sampled annually for density of individual phytoplankton species and community composition. Box-plots and Pearson correlation of 21 pre-selected metrics were then analyzed based on annual sampling and statistics data of the phytoplankton community. These metrics represent the characteristics of the phytoplankton community. Five of them were then used independently to evaluate the health of the aquatic ecosystem. It was found that the aquatic ecosystems' health at all sampling sections in Yongjiang River was good. After calculating P-JET values at each section and then comparing the values with the corresponding evaluation criteria, we found that the health at the upstream sections was better than the downstream sections.

AB  - This paper analyzes the potential of organic agriculture to meet effectively the increasing demand for high-quality food, to increase its export potential, and to solve the country's import substitution problems. The article also reveals the importance of digital economy technologies for increasing the sustainability of organic production. Among the most significant are cloud computing and large databases that contribute to the development of precision farming, continuous online monitoring of the quality of various stages in technological chains, automation and robotization, etc. Following recommendations of the "Organic Agriculture 3.0" conception, the authors examine the appropriate environmental, economic, social, and institutional factors to elaborate complex development strategies for agriculture in Russia and its regions. A special environmental index is proposed to determine environmentally friendly regions that are mostly suitable for organic production. The authors discuss an economic indicator to assess the potential of unused agricultural land for organic farming. The proportion of unemployed working-age population in rural areas serves as a social indicator for the study. By analyzing these selected indicators, four groups of Russian regions with different conditions for developing organic agriculture are identified. With respect to varying potentials of the regions and the external institutional context, the authors qualify different regional competitive strategies and corresponding product niches. The study also provides guidelines for Russian agrarian and environmental policy to support effective development of organic production.

AB  - In aquaculture, acute infections may result in fish mortality, but in many cases the chronic effects of infections are not readily detected, and may result in a decrease in fish growth. Ligictaluridus floridanus is a gill monogenean parasite prevalent on channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) farms in Northeastern Mexico. In order to assess and evaluate the impact of the chronic infection with this monogenean, 400 six-month-old catfish fingerlings from a hatchery, with a fork length of 10-15 cm were used in this study. Catfish naturally infected with L. floridanus (parasite abundance was 18) were divided in two groups of 200 fish. One group was treated with formalin, and infection was eliminated during a week, while the other group was not treated, and was used as a control. In total, Ill fish of each group were selected, placed into aquaria, and observed for 12 weeks. Indicators of growth such as fork length, mean weight, condition index, specific growth rate, feed conversion index and feed consumed were assessed. Significant differences (P < 0.05) between the treated group and control were found in the mean weight (127.85 g and 107.63 g) and specific growth rate (1.79 and 1.58), respectively. No significant differences were found in the other growth indicators assessed. We proved that growth performance of channel catfish is affected by infection with L. floridanus, which influence the farm economy. This is the first report on the effect of L. floridanus on the growth performance of channel catfish.

AB  - Key environmental factors and the mechanisms of their influence on the physicochemical habitats and macroinvertebrate communities of streams may vary among ecoregions. We studied the differences in environmental (land use and physicochemical) factors and the mechanisms of their influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages between mountain and lowland ecoregions in central China. We applied generalized linear models to identify key environmental factors that influence macroinvertebrate metrics consisting of taxa richness, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa, percentages of EPT and intolerant individuals, and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Environmental factors and macroinvertebrate metrics significantly differed between the ecoregions. Mountain streams had significantly lower nutrients and %silt, but had twice higher total taxa richness than lowland streams. Watershed land uses were key drivers that influenced the physical habitat in the mountain ecoregion and were the main drivers that influenced both physical and chemical conditions in the lowland ecoregion. Correspondingly, watershed scale land uses, as well as physical and chemical variables, explained more variance in macroinvertebrate metrics than local-scale land uses in both mountain and lowland ecoregions. The overall biological variation was explained better by watershed-scale than by reach-scale land uses, whereas the spatial scale over which land use and physicochemical variables influence streams varied across ecoregions. Our results suggest that better landscape planning should be adopted for watershed management to improve water quality and physical habitat, and thus the conservation and restoration of macroinvertebrate biodiversity.

AB  - The objective of the article is to determine the relationship between citizen coexistence, care for the environment and cultural dimensions, based on a documentary study of secondary sources, among them, the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) of 2020 and the dimensions of the Hofstede cul-ture of 2020. The methodology is quantitative with correlational scopes; the sample includes coun-tries with high environmental performance, two with medium and low environmental performance, but with very high GDP, such as the United States and China, respectively, and countries of the Pacific Alliance. The results show the relationship between citizen coexistence, the institutions or cultural dimensions, and EPI. Although the variables are correlated, the changing dynamics of institutional aspects imply a diachronic analysis in specific contexts and the need of further deep research. Never-heless, while the literature on institutional and sustainability theory is prolific, the proposed correla-tion of variables is unedited. In conclusion, the environment is transversal to coexistence, and factors as individualism and long-term orientation promote it, while the power distance and the decrease of uncertainty, condition it.

AB  - CO2 enrichment in the marine environment caused by leakages from carbon capture and storage technologies may occur over operational procedures. An integrated approach using weight-of-evidence was applied to assess the environmental risk associated with the acidification caused by CO2 enrichment in coastal sediments from Santos (Brazil). Chemical analyses (metal(loid)s and organic contaminant (e.g., hydrocarbons), toxicity tests (amphipods mortality, sea-urchin embryo-larval development) and macro-benthic community structure alteration assessment were performed with different acidified scenarios (pH 8.0-6.0) for two stations with different contamination degrees. These lines of evidence were statistically analyzed and integrated (multivariate analysis and ANOVA). Results of toxicity showed significant chronic effects starting at pH 7.0 while acute effects were observed starting at pH 6.5. The macro-benthic community integrity showed significant differences for all treatments at the Piacaguera channel station, considered to be moderately contaminated. Results from the multivariate analysis correlated toxic effects and increase in the mobility of some elements with acidification. Also, the biological indexes were correlated with concentrations of dissolved Zn in seawater. The pH of 6.0 was extremely toxic for marine life due to its high acidification and metal bioavailability. The approach herein identified and discriminated the origin of the degradation caused by the acidification related to the enrichment of CO2.

AB  - When metal nanoparticles are arranged in an ordered array, they may scatter light to produce diffracted waves. If one of the diffracted waves then propagates in the plane of the array, it may couple the localized plasmon resonances associated with individual nanoparticles together, leading to an exciting phenomenon, the drastic narrowing of plasmon resonances, down to 1-2 nm in spectral width. This presents a dramatic improvement compared to a typical single particle resonance line width of >80 nm. The very high quality factors of these diffractively coupled plasmon resonances, often referred to as plasmonic surface lattice resonances, and related effects have made this topic a very active and exciting field for fundamental research, and increasingly, these resonances have been investigated for their potential in the development of practical devices for communications, optoelectronics, photovoltaics, data storage, biosensing, and other applications. In the present review article, we describe the basic physical principles and properties of plasmonic surface lattice resonances: the width and quality of the resonances, singularities of the light phase, electric field enhancement, etc. We pay special attention to the conditions of their excitation in different experimental architectures by considering the following: in-plane and out-of-plane polarizations of the incident light, symmetric and asymmetric optical (refractive index) environments, the presence of substrate conductivity, and the presence of an active or magnetic medium. Finally, we review recent progress in applications of plasmonic surface lattice resonances in various fields.

AB  - Comfort index and environmental variables are indicators of thermal stress conditions inside a livestock facility. The environmental conditions of ten different constructive typologies of swine-production facilities with natural ventilation were characterized in a tropical country (Antioquia, Colombia). Temperature and humidity index (THI), enthalpy (H), animal surface temperature (ST), light intensity, and noise level were measured and computed for each typology, which were located at heights above sea levels between 8:00-23:00. Data was analyzed as a function of each typology, geographical altitude, and time of the day. It was employed descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and contour maps to analyze the data. It was found that more than 80% of the typologies presented moderate or critical stress conditions associated with the construction typology, not suitable THI and light intensity values, especially in warm and mild-mild climates. Showing high special variability inside the facilities. New typological designs and bioclimatic conditioning for swine facilities need to be studied To be implemented in these climatic conditions.

AB  - Indicators of trends in environmental conditions have been touted as ways to inform the public and provide a "report card" on environmental agency performance, but no quantitative analysis of such claims has been done. A small study of New Jersey residents' reactions to indicators as presented by the state environmental agency found that these indicators were deemed understandable, credible, and useful. However, actual comprehension was not related to perceived understanding, and many in this well-educated sample exhibited the ecological fallacy of inferring local environmental conditions or priority-setting uses that these indicators could not possibly provide. Prior beliefs about statewide trends in environmental quality, accuracy in extracting information from the indicator presentations, and demographic variables had varying but significant effects on reactions to and interpretations of the indicators. These findings have implications for preparation and evaluation of institutional communications about science in general.

Decrease of these values is the highest in those samples, where the analyses proved high values of mobile iron and aluminium. At the same time, C-hws is increasing. We consider, that the unusually high resistance to microbial decomposition of the carbon source fraction, characterized with C-hws, is caused by mummification of soil organic matter of soils of Sumava with iron and aluminium sols. Shortage of decomposable energetic substratum and low pH lead to decrease of biomass of micro-organisms C-MB and that is why the Hendrix's index of biological activity of soil H-BAP is not a reliable parameter in conditions of soils of Sumava.

AB  - Incidence of black spot disease was measured qualitatively in fish collections from 10 stream systems around Toronto, Ontario. Individuals in 18 of 49 fish species were found with black spot infections; they included representatives of Salmonidae, Catostomidae, Cyprinidae, Centrarchidae, and Percidae. Fishes in the families Petromyzontidae, Umbridae, Ictaluridae, Gasterosteidae, and Cottidae were all collected in substantial numbers but were never observed with black spot. Measures of stream size, gradient, riparian forest, and urbanization were each significantly correlated with black spot incidence for at least four fish species. These data suggest that in southern Ontario streams, habitat degradation accompanying agricultural and urban development is associated with increased incidence of black spot in a variety of fish species. The data also support informed and cautious use of measures of black spot incidence in multivariate indices of stream health, such as the index of biotic integrity.

AB  - A comprehensive list of freshwater fishes from south-eastern Australia is classified into five major reproductive guilds, based on numerical analysis of 13 life history or reproductive characteristics. The guilds defined generally support previously proposed, subjective life history-based classifications of freshwater fish species in this region. The majority of species fell into two groups, with 18 and 19 species, and the remaining guilds each contained from 1 to 12 species. The most important biological characteristics that separated the major groups of species included: care of the eggs or young, the presence of adhesive or non-adhesive eggs, serial or single spawning, and viviparity. Two of the main guilds could each be divided into two sub-guilds mainly based upon the requirement for a spawning migration. The objective definition of reproductive guilds allows river and natural resource managers to consider the effects of changes in environmental management on groups of species that are likely to respond in similar ways.

AB  - Some of the modern criteria for assessing ecosystem health are compared with current understanding of ecosystem function in rivers. Owing to the predominance of catchment imports over autochthonous primary production, most rivers are naturally heterotrophic. This does not make them unhealthy but,the pristine condition is that much harder to determine. The case is put for an index of ecosystem health and sustainability that takes into account the system's capacity for processing its resources, the species richness and its interdependence and its resilience to external forcing. Although these are not easily quantified, the qualitative indicators of healthy ecosystem function are easily checked. The sensitivity of organisms in suspension to fluvial flow may seem to counter the suitability of plankton as a reliable state indicator of river health. On the other hand, the rules governing the assembly of planktic communities in rivers are often strict and quantifiable: this makes them attractive candidates to act as indicators of the ecological condition of rivers.

AB  - Flat oysters (Ostrea edulis) were reared for a year both in integrated experimental conditions-close to a gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) farm-and in an open-sea reference location in the SW Mediterranean to ascertain whether their development could be enhanced in the vicinity of a fish farm as a consequence of the use of associated wastes. Some biometric data including size and weight measures, condition index (CI), lipid content, N-15 signature, and fatty acid (FA) composition were compared in oysters raised in both conditions. Some water column descriptors were measured: temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a content, total particulate matter flux, particulate organic matter, total nitrogen content, and delta N-15 signaling. FA and delta N-15 in fish feed were also analyzed. Development of integrated oysters was significantly improved, induced by the greater availability of potential feed sources, and the CI and lipid content of oysters were also higher. Some specific FA of terrestrial origin such as oleic and linoleic acids were slightly higher in integrated oysters, while typical FA of the marine food web, such as eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaeonic acids, showed similar levels in both groups of oysters. The oyster FA profile and its correlation with environmental conditions revealed that a direct contribution on the part of fish farm-derived wastes occurred, but of minor relevance. Nevertheless, the enrichment in N-15 observed in integrated oysters suggests that they might use some fish farm-derived wastes indirectly, probably through the phytoplankton which would have used the dissolved wastes.

AB  - The effects of the wettability and solubility of natural gas in formation water on the electrical properties of natural gas reservoir rocks are studied using the finite element method based on digital cores. The results show that the resistivity index of gas-wet reservoir rocks is significantly higher than that of water-wet reservoir rocks in the entire range of water saturation. The difference between them increases with decreasing water saturation. The resistivity index of natural gas reservoir rocks decreases with increasing additional conduction of water film. The solubility of natural gas in formation water has a dramatic effect on the electrical properties of reservoir rocks. The resistivity index of reservoir rocks increases as the solubility of natural gas increases. The effect of the solubility of natural gas on the resistivity index is very obvious under conditions of low water saturation, and it becomes weaker with increasing water saturation. Therefore, the reservoir wettability and the solubility of natural gas in formation water should be considered in defining the saturation exponent.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) has been found to increase the release of free Cu2+ in seawater. However, only a handful of studies have investigated the influence of OA on Cu accumulation and cellular toxicity in bivalve species. In this study, Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, were exposed to 25 mu g/L Cu2+ at three pH levels (8.1, 7.8 and 7.6) for 14 and 28 days. Physiological and histopathological parameters [(clearance rate (CR), respiration rate (RR), histopathological damage and condition index (CI)), oxidative stress and neurotoxicity biomarkers [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione transferase (GST) activities, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity], combined with glycolytic enzyme activities [pyruvate kinase (PK) and hexokinase (HK)] were investigated in C. gigas. The bioconcentration of Cu was increased in soft tissues of Cuexposed oysters under OA. Our results suggest that both OA and Cu could lead to physiological disturbance, oxidative stress, cellular damage, disturbance in energy metabolism and neurotoxicity in oysters. The inhibited CR, increased glycolytic enzymes activities and decreased CI suggested that the energy metabolism strategy adopted by oysters was not sustainable in the long term. Furthermore, integrated biomarker response (IBR) results found that OA and Cu exposure lead to severe stress to oysters, and co-exposure was the most stressful condition. Results from this study highlight the need to include OA in future environmental assessments of pollutants and hazardous materials to better elucidate the risks of those environmental perturbations.

AB  - Mangrove wetlands are being altered by human impacts throughout the Caribbean and Bahamas at an alarming rate. There is a pressing need for a set of criteria that can be used to identify the degree of anthropogenic impact, as well as to identify those areas most suitable for conservation and/or restoration initiatives. We provide a set of taxa that can be used as indicators in mangrove-dominated tidal creek ecosystems. The analysis was based on gradients of human impact measured at both local (tidal creek fragmentation) and regional (human threat indices) spatial scales. Such indicator taxa provide a simple tool for local resource managers, policy makers, and educators, and can be used for rapid assessments of human impacts on floral and faunal assemblages in tidal creeks.

AB  - This study evaluates the link between the recruitment process of European hake (Merluccius merluccius L.) of the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean) and the environmental and physiological conditions. Spatio-ternporal variation of abundance and condition of fish were evaluated at two locations each with different oceanographic conditions, one in the north (Soller, SO) and another in the south (Cabrera, CA) of Mallorca Island. Environmental variables explored were hydrography, sediment characteristics, phytoplankton pigment concentration (ppc) and the trophic resources of hake. Individuals were divided in three life stages: recruits, post-recruits and young adults. Hepatosomatic index (HSI), relative condition index (K-n), gonadosomatic index (GSI) and fullness index (FI) were analysed for the three life stages. Recruitment starts in February with the incorporation of smaller hakes, and it can be followed through spring and early summer with a peak in April. However, some spatial heterogeneity in the recruitment process has been found between north and south of the Island. The main pulse of recruitment occurred at a different time in the two areas. Spatial heterogeneity was also consistent with the condition of hake recruits, with higher values of K, and HSI at SO than at CA. Maximum values of K-n were found in February at SO and in April at CA, coinciding with the start of the different recruitment pulses to the fishing grounds. Post-recruits and young adults also showed higher condition at SO than at CA. The arrival in spring of the Western Winter Intermediate Waters (WIW) drives the spatial-temporal variation in abundance and condition of hake. Ppc was highly correlated with recruit abundance with a time lag of two months, while for post-recruits the time lag was three months. The observed differences in the condition of hake between areas could be a consequence of the fact that the waters to the north of Mallorca are comparatively more under the seasonal influence of WIW which is formed in more productive areas. Thus, this study characterises the short temporal and spatial variability in the hake recruitment process off the Balearic Islands, both in terms of abundance and fish condition. This pattern is explained on the basis of the mesoscale environmental variability observed between north and south of Mallorca and the ecological adaptive strategy of recruiting in the optimal environmental season.

AB  - This study evaluated integrative river ecosystem health using stressor-based models of physical habitat health, chemical water health, and biological health of fish and identified multiple-stressor indicators influencing the ecosystem health. Integrated health responses (IHRs), based on star-plot approach, were calculated from qualitative habitat evaluation index (QHEI), nutrient pollution index (NPI), and index of biological integrity (IBI) in four different longitudinal regions (Groups I-IV). For the calculations of IHRs values, multi-metric QHEI, NPI, and IBI models were developed and their criteria for the diagnosis of the health were determined. The longitudinal patterns of the river were analyzed by a self-organizing map (SOM) model and the key major stressors in the river were identified by principal component analysis (PCA). Our model scores of integrated health responses (IHRs) suggested that mid-stream and downstream regions were impaired, and the key stressors were closely associated with nutrient enrichment (N and P) and organic matter pollutions from domestic wastewater disposal plants and urban sewage. This modeling approach of IHRs may be used as an effective tool for evaluations of integrative ecological river health.

AB  - Worldwide, scientists have headstarted threatened and endangered reptiles to augment depleted populations. Not all efforts have been successful. For the threatened Agassiz's desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), one challenge to recovery is poor recruitment of juveniles into adult populations, and this is being addressed through headstart programs. We evaluated 8 cohorts of juvenile desert tortoises from 1 to 8 yrs old in a headstart program at Edwards Air Force Base, California, for health, behavior, and growth. We also examined capacities of the headstart pens. Of 148 juveniles evaluated for health, 99.3% were below a prime condition index; 14.9% were lethargic and unresponsive; 59.5% had protruding spinal columns and associated concave scutes; 29.1% had evidence of ant bites; and 14.2% had moderate to severe injuries to limbs or shell. Lifetime growth rates for juveniles 1-8 yrs of age were approximately two times less than growth rates reported for wild populations. Tortoises in older cohorts had higher growth rates, and models indicated that high density in pens and burrow sharing negatively affected growth rates. Densities of tortoises in pens (205-2042/ha) were 350-3500 times higher than the average density recorded in the wild (< 1/ha) for tortoises of similar sizes. The predominant forage species available to juveniles were alien annual grasses, which are nutritionally inadequate for growth. We conclude that the headstart pens were of inadequate size, likely contained too few shelters, and lacked the necessary biomass of preferred forbs to sustain the existing population. Additional factors to consider for future reptilian headstart pens include vegetative cover, food sources, soil seed banks, and soil composition.

AB  - We investigated the site level relationships between fish condition and environmental variables in Sclater's barbel, Barbus sclateri, from semi-arid streams in the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula. These freshwater ecosystems are characterized by strong seasonal fluctuations in flow levels ( droughts and floods) as a consequence of their irregular hydrological regime on both an annual and pluriannual scale. We analysed the relationships between 11 ecosystem variables [ conductivity, oxygen concentration, water temperature, pH, seasonal water flow, dominant substrate, submerged vegetation, QBR ( Riparian Ecosystems Quality Index), BMWP' ( Spanish version of the Biological Monitoring Working Party), fish refuge index and fish density] and fish condition by comparing mass - length relationships of nine populations of Sclater's barbel located in five sub-basins with different environmental conditions. Fish condition differed between the populations studied and was mainly dependent on the ecological variables related with water flow and, consequently, the physical structure of the streams, which is directly related to substrate and fish refuge.

AB  - Nannofossil assemblages from core MD02-2510 provide a similar to 22 ka record of past oceanographic variability in Alfonso Basin (Gulf of California, east subtropical Pacific). In this area, environmental conditions depend on a monsoonal system heavily influenced by changes in the location of the ITCZ and nearby atmospheric pressure centers. To reconstruct nutricline depth and ENSO-like variability, two ecological indexes were calculated based on the relative abundance of the three dominant coccolith species. The late glacial period is characterized by intensified wind-driven upwelling, high primary productivity and La Nina-like conditions. An environmental shift occurs during the glacial-interglacial transition, El Nino-like conditions intensify, nutricline deepens and surface productivity declines. The late Holocene is characterized by a persistent increase in nutricline depth and dominance of El Nino-like conditions. The fluctuations in the composition of the coccolith assemblages can be related to orbital-scale fluctuations in the average position of the ITCZ. However, while the ENSO-like signal that overprints the record varies in response to orbital forcing, on suborbital time scales the relation between ENSO-like conditions and the average position of the ITCZ and the North Pacific High changes, suggesting that the development of persistent El Nino-like conditions is strongly dependent on the specific climatic background.

AB  - Thailand currently lacks formal bioassessment approaches and protocols to assist management decisions for water quality. The aim of this research is to develop a practical method of rapid bioassessment for a professional level by using benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages for streams in Thailand. Eleven reference and nine test sites were sampled in the headwater streams of the Loei River and adjacent areas to explore the development of a practical protocol. Specific physico-chemical parameters were selected to provide ecological information supplemental to the biological indicators. The biological research was designed around the USEPA Rapid Bioassessment Protocols (RBPs) using the multi-habitat approach. Four fixed-count subsamplings (100, 200, 300 and 500 organisms) were randomly conducted using a standardized gridded pan to evaluate an appropriate level for bioassessment in Thai streams. A 300 organism subsample is adequate for bioassessment purposes in Thai stream (evaluated by calculating dissimilarity values and ordination techniques). A systematic selection of candidate reference sites, metric selection, and index calibration was part of this research. Multimetric and multivariate analyses were examined as a foundation for bioassessment in Thailand. The multimetric approach appears to be more practical for a rapid bioassessment technique. Nine core metrics were identified for biological index score including number of total taxa, Diptera taxa, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Coleoptera taxa, (%) Plecoptera, (%) Tolerant organisms, Beck's Biotic Index, (%) Intolerant organisms, Shredders taxa and Clingers taxa were calibrated for the final index. As a result of multimetric and multivariate analyses, family level identification data effectively discriminated reference condition and broad-scale environmental gradients. Hampered by incomplete taxonomic knowledge of benthic macroinvertebrates in Thailand, family-level identification may be sufficient taxonomic resolution for rapid bioassessment in Thailand.

AB  - When considering the geotecnology innovations come enhancing new studies in contemporary times, It notes that the geoinformation of precepts have an effective application in addressing watershed. Thus, the study aims to map the socio-environmental vulnerability in coastal watersheds of rivers Catu, Cabure, Caponga Funda, Caponga Roseira and Mal Cozinhado, located in the eastern sector of the metropolitan area of Fortaleza, state of Ceara. The theoretical-methodological foundation lies in the systemic studies, based on the bias of the indivisible conception of nature and society. The Environmental Vulnerability Index was structured from the integrated analysis of the ecodynamics conditions (Environmental Vulnerability), together with the Socio-Economic Vulnerability (Municipal Human Development Index). The results achieved in this study portray that 82.27% of the area is classified in the low zone or medium-low Environmental Vulnerability and 17.73% are in the medium-high or high vulnerability zone. We conclude that in the area referred is very intense the anthropogenic pressure on environmental systems, with special emphasis on the river, lake and coastal plains.

AB  - An experiment was conducted for 90 days (from April to June 2018) in 6 tanks of size 5 x 5 ft. Five different experimental diets were formulated containing 60% of protein in a combination of soya bean meal and ground nut oil cake along with rice bran, Indian millet, sama (Panicum sumatrense) as carbohydrate ingredients, vitamins and minerals mixture, astaxanthin (in the form of dried powder and liquid extract of grass varieties), binder (wheat flour) and attractant (seaweed Ulva sp. powder). Prawn juveniles of PL30 were stocked in the 6 tanks in duplicate filled with natural water @ 4/m(2) and feeding was done at the rate 40:60 twice a day. The results showed that prawns fed with diet 6 with 45% soya bean meal and 15% groundnut oil cake had highest SR and CI respectively followed by diets 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 (control). Two-way ANOVA analysis without replication computed for proximate composition of diets, water quality parameters and CI has proved significant difference at p < .05 which proved that the formulated diets have also been successful in maintaining the water quality of the culture tanks and has shown better growth of prawns. However, post-hoc analysis proved there is significant difference between chlorophyll a and survival rate % between ponds. Regression analysis of length and weight of prawns fed with different diets have also showed significant growth at 1% level of significance proving the replacement of fish meal with plant sources as effective ingredients for the growth of M. rosenbergii juveniles.

AB  - Primary consumers play a key role in coastal ecosystems by transferring organic matter from primary producers to predators. Among them, suspension-feeders, like bivalve molluscs are widely used in trophic web studies. The main goal of this study was to investigate variations of C and N elemental and isotopic ratios in common bivalves (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis, and C. gigas) at large spatial (i.e. among three coastal regions) and different temporal (i.e. from seasonal to multi-decadal) scales in France, in order to identify potential general or specific patterns and speculate on their drivers. The observed spatial variability was related to the trophic status of the coastal regions (oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea versus meso- to eutrophic English Channel and Atlantic ocean), but not to ecosystem typology (estuaries, versus lagoons versus bays versus littoral systems). Furthermore, it highlighted local specificities in terms of the origin of the POM assimilated by bivalves (e.g., mainly continental POM vs. marine phytoplankton vs. microphytobenthic algae). Likewise, seasonal variabilitywas related both to the reproduction cycle for C/N ratios of Mytilus spp. and to changes in trophic resources for delta C-13 of species located close to river mouth. Multi-decadal evolution exhibited shifts and trends for part of the 30-year series with decreases in delta C-13 and delta N-15. Specifically, shifts appeared in the early 2000' s, likely linking bivalve isotopic ratios to a cascade of processes affected by local drivers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wetlands in East Africa harbor a large biodiversity and provide diverse ecosystem services. Also, wetlands are highly suitable for crop production due to generally fertile soils and water availability. As a result of rising demand for cropland that is driven by population growth, degradation of upland areas and changing food demand patterns, wetlands are increasingly used for agricultural production. Such land use changes can negatively affect biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services, especially when formerly little-disturbed wetlands are converted into croplands. For evaluating wetlands and developing land use or conservation strategies, we require methods to assess disturbance and degradation of wetlands. For instance, many indices of biological integrity for wetlands using vegetation attributes have been developed especially in the USA, but to date, no comparable assessment schemes are available for East Africa. To develop such a scheme, we sampled four different wetland localities, covering both floodplain and inland valley wetlands in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. A total of 198 wetland plots were characterized regarding land use and evaluated in terms of geomorphology, hydrology, vegetation and water quality regarding their deviation from a theoretical natural reference state without human disturbances and given respective impact scores using the WET-Health approach. Additionally, nine variables characterizing vegetation attributes were recorded. The impact scores were rescaled from 0 to 1 and used as response variables in multiple linear regression models. The predictor variables were selected for each regression model out of the nine vegetation attributes in a stepwise process. The regression models for the different response variables differed strongly regarding their accuracy. The root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) ranged between 0.14 for the "vegetation disturbance" and 0.27 for the "hydrological modification" regression model. However, we conclude that vegetation attributes such as "absolute cover of perennial species" or "average height of vegetation" are generally useful to estimate anthropogenic impacts on East African wetlands as assessed with the WET-Health approach. The presented approach can hence be a pragmatic addition to the WET-Health approach as a cost-efficient and rapidly applicable method. Furthermore, it may also be useful for ex post application to historic data and vegetation surveys.

AB  - European countries are far from the 15% restoration target to be reached by 2020, partly due to the lack of large-scale studies at the national level that would help prioritise restoration efforts. We investigated the regeneration capacity and the determining environmental fac-tors at the national level for three Pannonian sandy habitat types. The analysis was based on the Hungarian Vegetation Mapping database that includes a three-level regeneration capa-city estimate of semi-natural habitats based on expert judgments after local vegetation mapping. We have selected fifteen environmental predictors that could possibly influence regeneration, including proxies for landscape naturalness, landscape context and abiotic factors. Using the decision tree method, we found that the local regeneration of open and closed steppes is primarily determined by habitat naturalness. For juniper-poplar stands the seasonality of the precipitation is the most important predictor and Natural Capital Index of sandy habitats, as a proxy for landscape naturalness, is the second. In case of neighbouring areas and abandoned fields, the regeneration is primarily affected by the sand content of the soil and the total local extent of habitats. Furthermore, grasslands and agricultural areas represent a potential for regeneration after abandonment. Our results show that in addition to habitat adequacy, proxies for landscape naturalness are the most important predictors of regeneration capacity. This implies that the future dynamics of habitats - and consequently ecosystem health and integrity - are determined primarily by the conservation of remnant natural and semi-natural areas and active restoration to increase the area or improve the state of semi-natural habitats.

AB  - This data article provides indicators of Ecosystem Service (ES) supply for coral reefs, sandy beaches and coastal lagoons in different ecological states regarding eutrophication. 14 ES are considered: food through fisheries; material; molecules; coastal protection; nutrient regulation; pathogen regulation; climate regulation; support of recreational and leisure activities; contribution to a pleasant landscape; contribution to culture and territorial identity; emblematic biodiversity; habitat; trophic networks; recruitment. For each ecosystem 3 to 4 eutrophication states are described. Indicators of ES supply are filled on the basis of a literature review supplemented with expert-knowledge. A semi-quantification of the indicator value is finally provided. Tendencies and trade-offs between ES are analyzed in How does eutrophication impact bundles of ecosystem services in multiple coastal habitats using state-and-transition models [1].

AB  - This study reports the basic nutritional requirement of subtropical Modiolus capax broodstock conditioned under nine diet-temperature treatments. The value of carbohydrate-rich diets was not only assessed to ensure maturation outside of the main breeding season but also to understand the interaction between diet-temperature over conditioning periods larger than the 30 days usually recommended for tropical bivalves. The experimental design included a natural diet prepared with a blend of the microalgae Tisochrysis lutea and Chaetoceros calcitrans (Micro100) and two carbohydrate-enriched diets composed of Micro100 + wheat flour (MicroW) at 7% total dry weight of body tissues and Micro100 + cornstarch (MicroC) at 7% total dry weight of body tissues. Maximum gonad development occurred in mussels fed MicroC at higher temperatures (26 degrees C) where the highest frequency of partial spawning accompanied the highest lipid content in gonad and lower carbohydrate content in somatic tissues. This result reflects an early maturation compared with brood stock fed the natural Micro100 diet at 24 degrees C. Lower temperatures (22 degrees C) delayed maturation in all treatments and favored accumulation of carbohydrate reserves in somatic tissues with the MicroC diet. Natural diets supplemented with carbohydrate-rich sources by cereal flours are reliable alternatives to fuel and sustain gametogenesis in M. capax broodstock at high temperatures and to increase carbohydrate reserves in somatic tissues at low temperatures.

AB  - In this article, we analyzed economic surroundings as a precondition for the development of the tax environment in the context of alterglobal development. We admitted that economic globalization is harmful to the environment because it depends on its own viability: the constant increase in commodity consumption, the increased use of resources and the growing disposition to pollute waste in the ocean, on the ground, and in the air So, we proposed considering and analyzing alterglobalization as a process oriented towards self-determination for peoples, communities and nations. In this context, we developed the idea about Environmental Fiscal Reform, including increasing green taxation and the phase-out of environmentally harmful subsidies as well as financial incentives, VAT reductions and tax breaks for green initiatives - providing the perfect conditions for the transition to a circular economy. As the new economy is developing at a rapid pace today - 10% per year, more than three times the global economic growth rate - it has a significant impact on competitiveness.

AB  - The present work was performed in a deteriorated mountain ecosystem in a peasant community from the Cordillera Blanca, Huaraz - Peru. The objective of the experiment was to develop a study proposal based on the integrated application of pasture condition indexes (C), soil humidity (H), ecohydrological characterization (EH) and improved water performance (RH) using "furrows" and "pits". The C was studied with the Parker method (Parker, 1951), the H with a completely randomized experimental design with a factorial arrangement (3 x 6 times techniques by study parameter) and the RH with the HEC-HMS applicative. The study lasted two years, period in which the improvement of C and H were studied, which constituted base attributes for the ecohydrological mapping (Vulnerability, conservation, hydrological function, water retention) and RH. A very poor C did not show changes but H did (P = 0.000 <0.05). "Furrows" were higher (14.66%) than "pits" (12.95%) and control (10.95%). Ecohydrological mapping of the area (2 449 ha) identified medium (49%), high (29%) and poor (22%) qualities. "Furrows" lost less water flow (1.17 m(3). s(-1)) than "pits" (1.19 m(3). s(-1)) and control (1.20 m(3). s(-1)). It is concluded that ecohydrological characterization provided appropriate indicators for designing conservation plans, restoration and monitoring of micro watersheds; C and H indexes are of high confidence. "Furrows" and "pits" are effective techniques for the restoration of the water function of the pasture.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate seasonal changes in the energy density of age-0 and age-1 muskellunge Esox masquinongy and to compare energy density to various estimates of condition. Three treatment groups of muskellunge were evaluated to determine temporal changes in energy density (J/g wet weight [ww]), water content, condition factor (K-TL; K = W/L(3), where W = weight and L = total length in centimeters), and relative weight (W-r; ratio of actual to ''standard'' weight) through the first year following hatching. Treatment groups were (1) hatchery (muskellunge reared and maintained in hatchery ponds), (2) stocked (hatchery-reared muskellunge stocked in lakes), and (3) natural (muskellunge naturally produced in lakes). Energy levels and relative condition were compared for fish 3 and 11 months old. Differences in energy density were observed between all three treatment groups. An average overwinter reduction of 494 +/- 192 J/g WW in energy density was observed over all treatment groups combined. Natural fish lost less energy (8%) over winter than either hatchery (12%) or stocked fish (15%). A simple linear model effectively relates energy to indices of condition for muskellunge. A weak positive relation (P < 0.0001, r(2) = 0.39, 0.40, and 0.43) was observed between dry weight energy density and three indicators of fish condition (percent water, K, and W-r). Our results show that condition indices may not be the best indicators of seasonal fluctuations in total energy within and between fish populations. Seasonal fluctuations in energetic values for a population can be more accurately determined through assessment of percent water in individual fish.

AB  - Tackling environmental problems not only requires the detection of harmful agents or the drivers that induce changes in ecosystems and their effects, but also knowledge of their action mechanisms and the processes involved in order to design solutions, recover the damaged systems and, above all, prevent any deterioration before it occurs. In recent years conservation physiology has been proposed as a discipline that could play an important role in this context. However, the main problem in generalizing physiological indicators in order to assess ecological status is the leap in scale from the internal physiology of an individual to its relevance for ecosystem functioning. In this paper, we propose that the study of the physiological bases and epigenetic mechanisms that determine the allocation of energy resources, in the context of Dynamic Energy Budget theory, can be the hinge that allows us to pass from the physiology of the individual to the scale of population dynamics, the structure of populations and ecosystems. This proposal is based on the strong relationship shown by the parameters of the life story of individuals, such as body growth rate, maximum size, life expectancy or generation time, with the parameters that determine population growth and the ecological strategies of the species. There is growing evidence that the relationship between these parameters is not completely fixed and does not only respond to evolutionary scales, but may be flexible within certain limits throughout ontogeny and the life of individuals, producing consequences in populations in response to environmental conditions, environmental stress and, in the case of fish, the effects of fishing.
   Lay summary: Biological index to detect environmental impacts can be applied from cell to ecosystem scale. However, at lower levels, although they give important information on the mechanisms involved it is difficult to infer the real consequences of the detected changes on the ecosystems. The review of the regularities existing in ecological guilds relationships of fishes suggests that the study of the physiological and epigenetic bases that determine the allocation of energy resources in the context of Dynamic Energy Budget theory can be the hinge that allows us to pass from the effects on the physiology of the individual to the scale of population dynamics and ecosystems when modelling the consequences of changes in environmental stress.

AB  - Many methods in freshwater biomonitoring tend to be restricted to a few levels of biological organization, limiting the potential spectrum of measurable of cause-effect responses to different anthropogenic impacts. We combined distinct organisational levels, covering biological biomarkers (histopathological and biochemical reactions in liver and fish gills), community based bioindicators (fish guilds, invertebrate metrics/traits and chironomid pupal exuviae) and ecosystem functional indicators (decomposition rates) to assess ecological status at designated Water Framework Directive monitoring sites, covering a gradient of human impact across several rivers in northern Portugal. We used Random Forest to rank the variables that contributed more significantly to successfully predict the different classes of ecological status and also to provide specific cut levels to discriminate each WFD class based on reference condition. A total of 59 Biological Quality Elements and functional indicators were determined using this procedure and subsequently applied to develop the integrated Multiple Ecological Level Index (MELI Index), a potentially powerful bioassessment tool.

AB  - The paper presents the use of indicators in a site-specific assessment method for strategic environmental assessment in regional land use planning (here: SEA-REP). It is explained with the example of the state of environment indicator 'LUCCA 4 Urban Areas at Risk of Flooding', how SEA as a decision-aiding instrument can contribute to the prevention of conflicts with policy for adaptation to climate change.
   The method begins with the determination of impact factors for SEA. In the presented study, the physical impact factors of land consumption, land use change, and directed flooding were recognised. A core problem during the selection of indicators for land uses for the adaptation to climate change (here: LUCCA) and the derivation of assessment thresholds was a lack of region-wide policy objectives for the protection of land and resources. Therefore, in a second step, regional environmental orientation objectives were derived from national and EU environmental policy. A standard method for the selection of LUCCA indicators and the derivation of assessment thresholds for conflict analysis is described. Three classes of conflict classification for regional plan designations on the individual site are proposed. It is recommended that future adaptation measures of regional land use planning should be designations of specific land uses as priority areas for urban areas prone to flood risk.

Reproductive traits of this species were investigated over the course of 67 months, based on samples collected at two localities (eastern and western shorelines) of the Bay of Antofagasta. The study period included years with different oceanic and atmospheric conditions: a warm event, El Nino (June 1997 to July 1998); a cold event, La Nina (August 1998 to December 2000); and post-La Nina (January 2000 to December 2002). We compared two common indices (condition and gonadosomatic) and histological sections to evaluate the maximum reproduction index of this introduced species that dominates a large part of the rocky intertidal habitat in the Bay of Antofagasta. We found sexually mature individuals all year-round and a decrease in both reproductive indices matching the reduction in the sea surface temperature during the austral autumn and winter months. The results suggest that gonad development in this species is sensitive to sea surface temperature and thermal anomalies. We conclude that future thermal anomalies or projected global average sea surface warming associated with climate change might have no negative consequences on these reproductive traits of P. praeputialis. This suggests this species is ecologically resilient and that the ecosystem services that this species provides for other invertebrate and algal species will be maintained.

AB  - Ecological indicators are used extensively as tools to manage environmental resources. In the oceans, indicators of plankton can be measured using a variety of observing systems including: mooring stations, ships, autonomous floats and ocean colour remote sensing. Given the broad range of temporal and spatial sampling resolutions of these different observing systems, as well as discrepancies in measurements obtained from different sensors, the estimation and interpretation of plankton indicators can present significant challenges. To provide support to the assessment of the state of the marine ecosystem, we propose a suite of plankton indicators and subsequently classify them in an ecological framework that characterizes key attributes of the ecosystem. We present two case studies dealing with plankton indicators of biomass, size structure and phenology, estimated using the most spatially extensive and longest in situ and remote-sensing observations. Discussion of these studies illustrates how some of the challenges in estimating and interpreting plankton indicators may be addressed by using for example relative measurement thresholds, interpolation procedures and delineation of biogeochemical provinces. We demonstrate that one of the benefits attained, when analyzing a suite of plankton indicators classified in an ecological framework, is the elucidation of non-trivial changes in composition, structure and functioning of the marine ecosystem.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to assess the conservation status of coastal dune systems in Tuscany (Italy). Emphasis was given to the presence and abundance of plant communities identified as habitat in accordance with the Directive 92/43/EEC. Twenty transects perpendicular to the shoreline were randomly positioned on the whole coastal area (30 km in length) in order to sample the full spectrum of plant communities. Vegetation zonation and relationships with the most frequent disturbance factors in the study area-beach cleaning, coastline erosion, presence of paths and roads, bathing settlements and trampling-were investigated through principal coordinate analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. Natural factors, such as distance from the sea and total length, were also considered. Differences in the conservation status of the sites were found, ranging from the total disappearance of the foredune habitats to the presence of the complete psammophilous (sand-loving) plant communities. Erosion, trampling, and paths were found to be closely correlated with degradation and habitat loss. Furthermore, the overall plant species diversity of dunes was measured with NHDune, a modified version of the Shannon index; while the incidence of invasive taxa was calculated using N, a naturalness index. However, these diversity indices proved to be a weaker bioindicator of ecosystem integrity than habitat composition along transects. A possible strategy for the conservation and management of these coastal areas could be to protect the foredunes from erosion and limit trampling through the installation of footbridges or the use of appropriate fences.

AB  - Mealworm larva (Tenebrio molitor), the most promising edible insect species with low cost and less environmental pollution, can fulfill the flavor and nutrition which are deficient in soy-based meat analog. Consumers who might have the sensitivity and reluctance to the intact form of edible insect could be offered the high-quality extruded meat analog. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of different mealworm larva contents and extrusion process parameters using twin-screw extruder on the physicochemical properties of the extruded meat analog. Mealworm larva was added to the base formulation at the rate of 0, 15, and 30%. Extrusion process parameters were varied as die temperature (140 degrees C and 150 degrees C) and moisture content (40% and 50%). The integrity index, texture profile analysis, and oxidation activity (TBARS) of extruded meat analog decreased with increase in mealworm larva content. However, water holding capacity, nitrogen solubility index, protein digestibility, and DPPH radical scavenging activity significantly increased (p < .05) as the mealworm content increased. Lower die temperature and higher moisture content enhanced the textural properties, but reduced nitrogen solubility index and protein digestibility. At higher die temperature, DPPH activity increased but TBARS showed the opposite result. After extrusion cooking, the total amino acid levels of extruded meat analog were 585.21 g/kg in 30% mealworm larva content that level was lower than 591.43 g/kg in raw mixture while the sulfur-containing amino acids and glutamic acid were higher than that of raw mixture. In conclusion, addition of mealworm larva could improve the nutritional value, antioxidant functionality, and taste of extruded meat analog under controlled extrusion process conditions.

AB  - A Weight of Evidence approach was applied to define three integrated effect indexes estimating the impairment on terrestrial ecosystems caused by the stressor(s) of concern. According to a Triad approach, the integrated effect indexes combined the information provided by the measurement endpoints of each line of evidence (chemistry/bioavailability, ecology and ecotoxicology) and allowed to analyse the impairment degree highlighted by each measurement endpoint as difference from the reference condition. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was used for the aggregation of the complementary Triad information, including expert judgement and a weighted procedure based on the endpoint sensitivity and the sensitivity of the test for ecosystem effects. The developed methodology was implemented in the DSS-ERAMANIA, Module 2, and is presented in this paper as '' Integrated Effect Indexes '' (IEI) sub-module. The latter has been preliminary applied to the Acna di Cengio (Italy) contaminated site; the results of this application are presented and discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Predation and starvation are inter-related processes that are considered primary sources of mortality in the early life stages of fish. In this sense, determining the environmental variables affecting the condition of fish larvae is essential to understanding recruitment variability and subsequent success of the adult stock. The present study investigated that variability for the Argentine menhaden (Brevoortia pectinata), the condition of this species' larvae, is related to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), local hydrological variability, and food availability. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to explore the association between the residual condition index (RCI), ENSO, and environmental variables, at monthly and annual scales. ENSO phases did not show significant effects on RCI. In contrast, monthly and annual variability of river discharge, salinity, and chlorophyll a concentration showed significant effects on menhaden larval condition. Optimal values of salinity (20 to 27) and chlorophyll a concentration (10 to 18 mu g/l) led to larvae with good body condition in the adjacent coastal zone (ACZ). The RCI of larvae captured in the Patos Lagoon Estuary (PLE) had no significant association with these variables. Larvae with good body condition correlated to river discharge values of below 1000m(3)/s and above 2500m(3)/s. When river discharge reached values of 1000 to 2000m(3)/s, menhaden larvae presented a critical drop in RCI. This study suggests that the variability of local hydrology and its effects on estuarine and coastal productivity are the main factors associated with the body condition variability of menhaden larvae, and suggests hydrology may substantially impact their survival and recruitment.

AB  - Winter snowfall is an important factor in the growth and development of biological soil crusts (BSCs) in temperate desert regions of China. In this study, intact algae, lichen, and moss crusts from the Gurbantunggut Desert were collected and exposed to five experimental treatments-snow removal (0S), snow decrease to half that of ambient conditions (1/2S), ambient snow (S), snow increase to 1.5 times that of ambient conditions (3/2S), and snow increase to twice that of ambient conditions (2S)-to evaluate the effect of snowfall on the ecophysiological parameters of the BSCs during the melt and at the end of the growing period. The results clearly identified differences in physiological and ecological indexes between snowfall manipulation treatments in March, and further found that the values of most of the ecophysiological indexes were influenced by snow removal/reduction treatments, the type of BSC and their interaction effect. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, chlorophyll content, and the rates of photosynthesis and respiration of all three types of crust declined because of decreased soil water content with decreased snow cover, and this effect would likely be even greater under conditions of decreased precipitation. The rates of photosynthesis and respiration of the main types of BSC were changed by variations in the winter snowfall, and confirmed the existence of long-term snowfall impacts on photosynthetic carbon fixation and biomass accumulation. These results provide a foundation for future studies to assess the potential effects of snowfall on the carbon sequestration of BSCs from arid and semi-arid regions.

AB  - The growth and health of cultured blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) are affected by environmental conditions. Typically, culture sites are situated in sheltered areas near shore (i.e., < 1 km distance from land, < 20 m depth); however, land runoff, user conflicts and environmental impact in coastal areas are concerns and interest in developing deep water ( > 20 m depth) mussel culture has been growing. This study evaluated the effect of culture depth on blue mussels in a cold water coastal environment (Newfoundland, Canada). Culture depth was examined over two years from September 2012 to September 2014; mussels from three shallow water (5 m) and three deep water (15 m) sites were compared for growth and biochemical composition; culture depths were compared for temperature and chlorophyll a. Differences between the two years examined were noted, possibly due to harsh winter conditions in the second year of the experiment. In both years shallow and deep water mussels presented similar condition; in year 2 deep water mussels had a significantly better biochemical profile. Lipid and glycogen analyses showed seasonal variations, but no significant differences between shallow and deep water were noted. Fatty acid profiles showed a significantly higher content of omega-3 s (20:5 omega 3; EPA) and lower content of bacterial fatty acids in deep water sites in year 2. Everything considered, deep water appeared to provide a more favorable environment for mussel growth than shallow water under harsher weather conditions.

AB  - Study region: This study focuses on the Lower Limpopo River basin (LLRB) in Mozambique, Africa.
   Study focus: Maintaining environmental flows necessary for ecosystem sustainability represents a significant challenge to water resource management. In this study the sustainability of LLRB was evaluated by comparing hydrologic availability with ecological and anthropogenic needs. Current river ecological status was scored with a habitat integrity index verified through ground-truthing field surveys and aerial imagery data. Local stakeholder interviews were used to further evaluate the habitat index scores. Deficiencies between water availability and ecological-human requirements were assessed with a water scarcity index.
   New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Four environmental flow categories defined as "Excellent", "Fair", "Poor", and "Degraded" coincided to approximately 50 %, 39 %, 27 %, and 14 % of the natural mean annual flow, respectively. Stakeholder interview responses indicated annual water shortages currently occur between August and November and coincide with "Poor" and "Degraded" environmental flow conditions. Water supplies appear to meet consumption needs when calculated on an annual basis with the water scarcity index. However, when calculated monthly, there is not enough to meet human water demand between August and October. This deficit period will likely expand from June to November due to projected increases in future water demands. As the greatest water use in the basin is agricultural irrigation, long-term environmental flows sustainability will likely depend upon effective irrigation management.

AB  - Biotic stress may operate in concert with physical environmental conditions to limit or facilitate invasion processes while altering competitive interactions between invaders and native species. Here, we examine how endolithic parasitism of an invasive and an indigenous mussel species acts in synergy with abiotic conditions of the habitat. Our results show that the invasive Mytilus galloprovincialis is more infested than the native Perna perna and this difference is probably due to the greater thickness of the protective outer-layer of the shell of the indigenous species. Higher abrasion due to waves on the open coast could account for dissimilarities in degree of infestation between bays and the more wave-exposed open coast. Also micro-scale variations of light affected the level of endolithic parasitism, which was more intense at non-shaded sites. The higher levels of endolithic parasitism in Mytilus mirrored greater mortality rates attributed to parasitism in this species. Condition index, attachment strength and shell strength of both species were negatively affected by the parasites suggesting an energy trade-off between the need to repair the damaged shell and the other physiological parameters. We suggest that, because it has a lower attachment strength and a thinner shell, the invasiveness of M. galloprovincialis will be limited at sun and wave exposed locations where endolithic activity, shell scouring and risk of dislodgement are high. These results underline the crucial role of physical environment in regulating biotic stress, and how these physical-biological interactions may explain site-to-site variability of competitive balances between invasive and indigenous species.

AB  - We describe stopover ecology for 132 migrant radiomarked Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) relocated repeatedly along the Pacific Flyway of North America. Eighty-eight percent of radiomarked birds were detected at 1-5 sites north of their banding sites, at distances ranging from 240-4,000 km away. We compare length of stay and physical indices of Western Sandpipers banded at coastal sites (San Francisco Bay, California and Grays Harbor, Washington), and an interior, western Great Basin site (Honey Lake, California). Western Sandpipers radiomarked at the interior site had significantly shorter length of stays than birds radiomarked at coastal sites, and they had significantly lower fat scores. The ephemeral nature of Great Basin stopover sites and an increased risk of predation may explain some of this variation. Fat and body condition indexes explained little of the observed variation in length of stay of Western Sandpipers at banding and other stopover sites. Length of stay of birds radiomarked at Grays Harbor were significantly longer compared to birds radiomarked to the south that also stopped at Grays Harbor, suggesting a potential capture effect on length of stay of birds at banding sites. Mean length of stays at seven sites other than banding sites ranged from 1.1-3.3 days and were not significantly affected by sex of bird, year of study, or banding location. Length of stay of male Western Sandpipers at the Copper River Delta, Alaska became significantly shorter later in the migration period, but not for females. Coastal sites along the Pacific Flyway from San Francisco to the breeding grounds generally function as stopovers for Western Sandpipers instead of staging areas.

AB  - Growth and survival of Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) juveniles, from natural spatfall, were compared at three earthen fishponds in the northwestern Portuguese coast, from June 1990 to October 1991. Station Marinha was located at Ria de Aveiro, a seawater lagoon with little incoming freshwater. Stations INIP and Gil, located at Mondego River estuary, experienced an important influence from freshwater, particularly Station Gil. Oysters were sampled at 45-day intervals for their growth, condition index, and biochemical composition. Temperature, salinity, and particulate organic and inorganic matter in the water at the rest sites were monitored at the same time. Juveniles initially with 0.4 g reached the end of the experimental period with an average of 53, 50, and 38 g at Stations Marinha, INIP and Gil, respectively. In general, oysters from Station Gil showed the worst condition, especially during the second growing season. Oysters from both Mondego stations presented shells infested by Polydora sp. Apparently, the high mortalities observed at the same stations had nothing to do with the worm infestation. Mortality at Station Marinha was negligible. Variations observed in dry meat weight and lipid and carbohydrate levels are probably associated with gonad growth and spawning activity at Stations Marinha and INIP. Several factors that map have been responsible for the observed differences in oyster performance are discussed. In particular, the water movement is thought to have played a key role in dictating oyster performance. Fish farm earthen ponds, with controlled water circulation, seem to be suitable sites for intermediary oysters growth.

AB  - In relation to climate change, a common finding from long-term studies on marine ecosystems is earlier annual peaks of abundance for many organisms. Here, we test the hypothesis of unidirectional change in the seasonal abundance of pelagic seabirds in association with change in marine climate and primary productivity in the Alaska Gyre. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data on hydrographic conditions and seasonal at-sea abundance of seabirds along a 1425 km transect (Line P) over 11 yr, 1996 to 2006. Long-term sea surface temperature (SST) data show warming in the study region, advanced and delayed temperature peaks and northwestward isotherm displacement. Using negative binomial regression, we tested seasonal trends in the relative abundance of 15 seabird species and compared abundances to a multivariate ocean climate index we developed with principal component analysis from in situ measurements of water temperature, salinity, density and nitrate concentrations. Overall, 5 species showed no change, 1 declined, and 9 species as well as all species combined showed increasing abundance. By season, 3 species increased in winter, 7 in late spring, and 6 in late summer. Eight of 15 species showed relationships with our environmental index. Increases in seasonal seabird abundance may be related to lengthening of the 'growing season', as demonstrated by temporal temperature shifts and expansion of peak chlorophyll concentrations. Seabirds of the Alaska Gyre are probably responding to changes in forage nekton that are related to this extended growing season by shifting their migration to later dates.

AB  - Thermal buckling and vibration of functionally graded (FG) sinusoidal microbeams with temperature-dependent properties and three kinds of temperature distributions are investigated in this article. As one material length scale is introduced, the modified couple stress theory is capable of predicting the small-scale effects. Material properties of FG microbeams are calculated using the Mori-Tanaka method. Furthermore, temperature-dependent properties are taken into account to investigate the mechanical characteristics of FG microbeams in high-thermal-gradient environment. Motion equations and the associated boundary conditions are obtained simultaneously through variational principle. Then Navier procedure and the differential quadrature method incorporating an iterative procedure are used to solve the governing differential equations with temperature-dependent properties and general boundary conditions. Numerical examples are performed for demonstrating the influences of temperature distribution, beam thickness, material length scale, slenderness ratio, shear deformation, functionally graded index, boundary conditions, and temperature-dependent/independent properties on thermal buckling and free vibration behaviors of FG microbeams.

AB  - Parental care in long-lived bird species involves a trade-off between the benefits of increasing the effort expended on current offspring and the costs that this represents for future reproductive output. Under regimes of high environmental variability, long-lived seabirds can adjust their breeding effort to buffer the negative effects of this variability on their offspring. However, the potential impacts of variation in breeding effort on offspring physiology in the short term and on longer-term survival are poorly understood. In this study, we manipulated brood age through a cross-fostering experiment to assess whether increasing or decreasing parental reproductive expenditure led to costs in Blue-footed Booby Sula nebouxii chicks. Specifically, we tested the consequences of altered parental reproductive expenditure on the offspring's physiological condition (plasma metabolites, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (H/L) and body condition index (BCI)) and survival. Offspring from broods in which parental investment was experimentally increased showed a lower BCI and lower alkaline phosphatase levels and higher H/L ratios than controls. Conversely, offspring showed the opposite pattern when reproductive expenditure was experimentally decreased. We observed no effects of manipulation of parental investment on triglyceride levels or on survival rates. Although our findings suggest that Blue-footed Booby parents have the ability to adjust their breeding effort according to the demands of their offspring, parental effort could influence the effect of hatching order by suppressing the aggressive tendency of the senior chick.

AB  - Drought is a wide-spread problem seriously influencing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production and quality, but development of resistant cultivars is hampered by the lack of effective selection criteria. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of several selection indices to identify drought resistant cultivars under a variety of environmental conditions. Eleven bread wheat cultivars differing in yield performance were grown in separate experiments under rain-fed (non-irrigated) and irrigated conditions at two locations in 2001-2003. Nonirrigated experiments experienced different levels of water stress due to variable rainfall over the years and locations. Nine selection indices including stress susceptibility index (SSI), stress tolerance index (STI), tolerance (TOL), regression coefficient of cultivar yield on environmental index (b), yield index (YI), yield stability index (YSI), mean productivity (MP), geometric mean productivity (GMP), and superiority measure (P) were calculated based on grain yield under drought-stressed and irrigated conditions. The results showed that under moderate stress, MP, GMP and STI were more effective in identifying high yielding cultivars in both drought-stressed and irrigated conditions (group A cultivars). Under severe stress, none of the indices used were able to identify group A cultivars, although regression coefficient (b) and SSI were found to be more useful in discriminating resistant cultivars. It is concluded that the effectiveness of selection indices in differentiating resistant cultivars varies with the stress severity. Wheat breeders should, therefore, take the stress severity of the environment into account in choosing an index. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since the relative role of local and regional abiotic factors on the Odonata diversity in rainforest streams is still poorly understood, we evaluated the effects of these factors on adult Odonata (Insecta) from preserved and altered streams in the Amazonian region. Adult Odonata were sampled in 98 streams in the Eastern Amazon, Para, Brazil. Six variables were used to measure local environmental factors: habitat integrity index; mean canopy over the channel; and four physical and chemical descriptors of the water. To measure regional environmental factors, six variables were also used: altitude gradient, three bioclimatic variables and two percentage forest variables. In partial redundancy analysis, both abiotic factors (local and regional) were important to explain the variation in the Odonata community. The Odonata community can be influenced by regional and local factors. The relationship between Odonata and the local (e.g., integrity, canopy cover, and physical and chemical descriptors of the water) and regional (e.g., bioclimatic and forest cover variables) environmental variables recorded in this study has important implications for the use of these organisms to monitor small streams of the Eastern Amazon. The scale at which habitat is measured is an important issue in community structuring studies considering the rapid environmental changes. It is of great importance to consider the different scales in studies assessing community structure, once an adequate habitat must meet the ecological needs of all stages of the life of the Odonata.

AB  - In the present investigation, the feasibility of detecting the 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane gas molecule on the outer surface of pristine single-walled boron nitride nanotube, as well as its aluminium- and gallium-doped structures, was carefully evaluated. For achieving this goal, a periodic boundary condition density functional theory level of study using both HSE06 and B3LYP-D3 functionals together with a 6-311G(d) basis set has been used. Subsequently, the CAM-B3LYP, xB97XD, and M06-2X functionals with a 6-311G(d) basis set were also employed to consider the single point energies. Natural bond orbital and quantum theory of atoms in molecules were implemented by using the HSE06/6-311G(d) method and the results were compatible with the electronic properties. In this regard, the total density of state, the Wiberg bond index, natural charge, natural electron configuration, donor-acceptor natural bond orbital interactions, and the second-order perturbation energies are performed to explore the nature of the intermolecular interactions. All of the energy calculations and population analyses show that by adsorbing of the gas molecule onto the surface of the considered nanostructures, the intermolecular interactions are of the type of strong chemical adsorption. Between the doped nanotubes, aluminium-doped nanotube has very high adsorption energy compared with gallium. Generally, it was revealed that the sensitivity of the adsorption will be increased when the gas molecule interacts with decorated nanotubes and decrease the HOMO-LUMO band gap; therefore, the change of electronic properties can be used to design suitable nanosensors.

AB  - Habitat disturbance is an important cause of global amphibian declines, with especially strong effects in areas of high agricultural use. Determining the influence of site characteristics on amphibian presence and success is vital to developing effective conservation strategies. We used occupancy analysis to estimate presence of four anuran species at wetlands in northern Iowa as a function of eight environmental covariates hypothesized to affect occupancy: fish and salamander abundance, invertebrate density, aquatic vegetative cover, wetland area, atrazine concentration in water, surrounding agricultural land use, and an overall wetland health score (wetland condition index [WCI]). We surveyed 27 wetlands multiple times in 2015 and 2016. Leopard Frogs (Lithobates pipiens) and American Toads (Anaxyrus americans) were observed at 100% of the sites, Boreal Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris maculate) at 96%, and Gray Treefrogs (Hyla spp.) at 81%. Wetland site occupancy for all species in our study ranged from 0.23 (Hyla spp. tadpoles) to 0.95 (L. pipiens adults), indicating that agricultural wetlands can provide refuge or habitat for amphibians. Fish abundance, percentage of cropland cover within 500 m of the wetland, and salamander abundance were among the variables best supported by our models although their estimated effects were weak. Wetland area, atrazine concentration, vegetative cover, and WCI also influenced occupancy probability, but for only a small number of species and life stages. The direction of predicted effects varied by species and life stage. Despite only weak evidence that the environmental factors we measured influenced anuran occupancy, our results provide insights for managers seeking to understand how amphibians use landscapes modified by agriculture.

AB  - In this study, we analysed the variability of reserve storage in juvenile European hake (Merluccius merluccius) off the western coasts of Italy (Central Mediterranean Sea). Reserve storage was measured by the hepatosomatic index (HSI), in relation to environmental and population covariates. HSI has been proved to be a consistent measure of energy storage in gadoids, thus reflecting quantity and quality of food availability for growth. Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) were used to model the effect of depth, bottom temperature, bottom currents, fish density and fish body size on HSI of juvenile European hake. The results revealed that reserve storage in the liver appears to be maximized for juveniles living on the shelf break, between 120 and 170 m depth, with bottom temperature and current speed not exceeding 14 degrees C and 0.04 m s(-1) respectively. Furthermore, HSI significantly increased with fish density up to about 6000 individuals per km(-2) and decreased at higher densities indicating that reserve accumulation in the liver might be subject to density dependent mechanisms (e.g. competition for food) as well. These findings suggest that the use of density as measure of nursery importance need to be further investigated. Finally, we found that HSI increased with fish size up to about 14 cm total length. Based on these results, HSI appears a reasonable index to indirectly measure the quality of habitats where juvenile European hake aggregate after their settlement on the bottom, and to potentially monitor habitat suitability as nursery across the spatial-temporal gradient.

AB  - Anecdotal reports from mussel growers suggest that increased stocking density decreases the settlement and growth of the fouling organisms Styela clava (clubbed tunicate) and Ciona intestinalis (vase tunicate). To evaluate this hypothesis, 15 mussel socks of low (90 mussels per 30 cm), medium (250 mussels per 30 cm) and high (500 mussels per 30 cm) densities were placed on three longlines in the Brudenell estuary in the fall 2005 and in the spring 2006. Sampling was conducted in June, August and October of 2006 to determine the effect of different stocking densities and socking time on mussel productivity and C intestinalis recruitment and growth. Mussel Condition Index and shell length were not significantly different between the three stocking densities by the end of the field trial in October. In August, the mean length of C. intestinalis was significantly lower on the medium and high density socks and C. intestinalis weight was less on medium and high density socks from the fall socking period (no difference within spring socked densities), however, by the October sampling there was no biologically significant difference in the weight of C intestinalis between stocking density treatments. Time of socking did not appear to have any significant effect on the results, although the abundance of C intestinalis was marginally higher in August on the socks deployed in December, 2005. Mussel loss was between 50 and 60% for all treatments, with no clear pattern being evident. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Improving terminal heat tolerance is an issue of top priority in wheat breeding in the present era of climate change. Present study was carried out to identify the association among traits of economic importance under terminal heat stress environment. The grain yield/sq. meter under terminal heat stress environment recorded highly significant positive correlation both at genotypic and phenotypic level with grain weight/spike, number of spike/sq. meter, harvest index and 1000-grain weight in both the crop seasons. Path coefficient analysis carried out using genotypic correlation coefficients revealed that days to heading contributing maximum positive direct effect towards grain yield under terminal heat stress environment followed by grain filling duration. Other characters contributing positive direct effects towards grain yield were grain weight/spike, number of spike/sq. meter, harvest index and biological yield/sq. meter under both the crop season. Thus, for improving the wheat grain yield under terminal heat stresses conditions, breeder should aim for selecting genotypes with bold grains or high grain weight /spike, more number of tillers/sq. meter, higher harvest index and longer grain filling duration.

AB  - Protected areas serve as reserves of biological diversity and conserve the naturalness of characteristic regional ecosystems. Numerous approaches have been applied to estimate the level of transformation of ecosystems and to compare trends inside and outside of protected areas. In this study, we apply aggregate indicators of anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity in a fine-scale spatial analysis to compare the level of human influence within protected and unprotected areas. The actual state of ecosystems is compared to a natural baseline that is intact or potential natural state. The results show that in a non-protected Central-European landscape, humans appropriate a considerable share of natural ecosystem productivity and carbon stocks, and significantly reduce natural biodiversity and ecosystem services. Human appropriation of net primary production reached more than 60% in total, humans reduced original biodiversity levels by 69%, and net carbon storage was considerably decreased by intensive types of land use. All three indicators significantly differed between protected areas and unprotected areas, suggesting that protected areas maintain higher biodiversity levels, store more carbon and are in total less influenced by human exploitation than average non-protected landscape. Furthermore, we bring evidence that human appropriation of net primary production is negatively related both to biodiversity and ecosystem services indicated by mean species abundance and net carbon storage at the national level. Our results contribute to the quantitative evidence of the impacts of anthropogenic transformation of natural ecosystems on the ecosystem condition, supporting the hypothesis that protected areas significantly reduce anthropogenic pressures and contribute to maintaining critical ecosystem services and biodiversity.

AB  - Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were transplanted from a reference site (Syracuse harbour) to an impacted site (Augusta Bay) from January to July 2013 to assess the biochemical response of caged mussels to high trace element and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination, using lipid and fatty acid (FA) biomarkers. Sediment and mussels were analysed to assess contaminant bioavailability in the study sites and bioaccumulation in mussel tissue. Trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) and PAHs were significantly higher in mussels from Augusta than in those from Syracuse, mirroring the different environmental contamination. The biological impact quotient (BIQs), which indicates the potential biological impact of mussel-accumulated contaminants, reflected the highest contaminant concentrations found in Augusta and their temporal trend, which increased from the start of the experiment to 3-4 months after transplanting, followed by a decrease, as indication of mussel detoxification processes. Lower condition index (Cl) and phospholipids (PL), as well as higher total (TL) and neutral lipids (NL) in mussels from Augusta, indicated the occurrence of a physiological and biochemical stress response to pollutant exposure and accumulation. Differences in FA composition, especially polyunsaturated (PUFA), essential (EFA) and non-methylene interrupted dienoic (NMID) FAs between the study sites revealed the occurrence of stress-induced lipid peroxidation, followed by compensatory/adaptive processes in Augusta mussels. The marked increase in bacterial biomarkers, mainly cyclopropyl (CV) FAs, reflecting the greater bioaccumulation of chemicals in the Augusta mussels, may be the result of bacterial infections or symbiosis with bacteria involved in detoxification processes.

AB  - River restoration projects are increasingly common, but assessments of ecological responses and overall success of the vast majority of efforts are lacking. Information on potential positive ecological effects of restoration efforts can be used to justify further projects and refine methods. We examined responses of multiple trophic levels, aquatic insects and riparian birds, to a series of rock weirs installed in an Illinois river to stabilize the channel. We quantified adult insect emergence and performed weekly point counts of birds in spring at four weir and four non-weir (control) sites. Emerging insect abundance was higher at control sites, but species richness and diversity were higher at weir sites. Total insect emergence production did not differ between site types, but emergence production of larger-bodied taxa was higher at weir sites. Ordinations and analysis of similarity indicated differences in insect and bird assemblages between site types. Birds showed a positive numerical response to large-bodied emerging insects, and total bird abundance was higher at weir sites. Clutch size and feeding rates of a focal bird species, Prothonotaria citrea (Prothonotary Warbler), did not differ between sites, but the number of hatchlings and fledglings was higher at control sites. Molothrus ater (cowbird) parasitism was higher at weir sites, likely because of increased edge habitat associated with weir construction activities. Results show positive ecological impacts of in-stream restoration and provide justification for further efforts. However, forest disturbance associated with construction could offset some benefits to some species, and thus refinements to procedures may be necessary.

AB  - The study was carried out from 2007 to 2010 in two ecoregions: the Carpathians and the Central Highlands. The objectives of our survey were to test the existing biological index metric based on benthic macroinvertebrates at reference conditions in the high- and mid-altitude mountain streams of two ecoregions according to the requirements of the EU WFD and to determine which environmental factors influence the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates. Our results revealed statistically significant differences in the values of the physical and chemical parameters of water as well as the mean values of metrics between the types of streams at the sampling sites. RDA analysis showed that the temperature of the water, pH, conductivity, the stream gradient, values of the HQA index, and altitude were the parameters most associated with the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa and the values of the metrics. The values of biological indices should be considered according to the stream typology including altitude and geology. At the reference conditions, the suggested border values of biological indices are very harsh. The values of the biological indices of most sampling sites did not correspond to the requirements of the high status in rivers. The streams at altitudes above 1,200 m a.s.l. should be treated as another river type and new reference values should be established.

AB  - A Structures Assessment Methodology is presented, complementary to the Visual Inspection, which allows, through on-site non-destructive testing (NDT), to deliver as a result a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the "Structural Health" of the different elements. This allows essential information to adjust maintenance cycles or make timely based decisions in critical situations, in order to guarantee future performance. The proposed methodology considers the execution of NDT to determine the state of the reinforcement, the characteristics of the concrete cover, and the presence of cracks. By means of the extraction of cores of smaller size (1") the ingress of carbonation or chlorides is determined. The results measured on-site are weighted to determine a Deterioration Index DI. The aggressiveness of the environment is included through an Environmental Exposure Index EEI. The incorporation of the results to the CTK-ConDiagO Model allows the combination of both indices, obtaining a Structure Global Deterioration Level SGDL, which measures the degree of damage determined at 6 levels. The proposed methodology is presented with the results of the study carried out on two specific bridges in Chile under different climatic conditions.

AB  - Biofouling can pose a significant threat to shellfish aquaculture, as fouling organisms are often strong spatial competitors that are able to reach high densities or biomass in relatively short time frames. This study investigated the potential impacts of the colonial ascidian Didemnum vexillum on cultured New Zealand green-lipped mussels Perna canaliculus at one farm in the Marlborough Sounds region. Three size classes of mussels were examined: small (20 to 40 mm shell length at deployment), medium (40 to 60 mm), and large (60 to 70 mm). Replicate 4 m mussel lines were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) ambient fouling, (2) fouling enhanced by D. vexillum fragment inoculation (in addition to ambient fouling), or (3) control lines that were kept free of D. vexillum. After 15 mo, subsections of lines (0.5 m length) were processed to determine the effects of fouling cover on mussel density within lines, as well as on individual mussel size and condition. A highly significant negative relationship was shown between D. vexillum biomass and mussel density for small mussels, and to a lesser extent for medium mussels. Values of mussel condition indices were similar across size classes and across fouling treatments within each size class. These results indicate that mussels may only be vulnerable to direct D. vexillum fouling impacts at early stages of production, and that impacts may be restricted to displacement of mussels as opposed to reduced size and condition. This information will assist in the implementation of management procedures through increased understanding of D. vexillum effects at different stages of mussel production.

AB  - The health of cultivated blue mussels from an offshore and a nearshore sites was compared by assessing lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) and accumulations of lipofuscin and neutral lipids in the digestive glands. In addition, the condition index, parasite infestation rates, growth performance and energy status of the mussels were assessed during 10 months of sampling. Abiotic and biotic site characteristics were investigated by water analysis for each sampling cycle. Further, data of contaminant loads of the softbody and pollutant concentration of the water column, suspended particles and sediments from both sites were analysed. Results show that positive offshore effects due to dilution of contamination were not evident for all parameters analysed. Condition indices were high, and parasites were not present in offshore mussels. In contrast, the integrative health parameter LMS and growth performance were slightly, but not significantly, better in the nearshore cultivated mussels. These findings correspond with the higher contaminant concentrations in the softbodies of mussels and the water column from the offshore testing site. Both sites showed low LMS values and high accumulations of lipofuscin and neutral lipids, indicating that environmental conditions in the German Bight are generating stress for blue mussels even in the offshore areas. Exposure to fluvial transport points to a comparable probability for high contamination loads similar to nearshore areas. We therefore recommend adding a minimum salinity threshold to the definition of offshore aquaculture to exclude areas under fluvial influence.

FX  - The authors are grateful to the Water and Shipping Authority (WSA) of Bremerhaven, Germany, the State Fishery Authority of Bremerhaven, Germany, and the Fishermen of Lower Saxony, Germany, who generously allowed use of the offshore test field in the Weser estuary near the lighthouse Roter Sand for the mussel cultivation experiments in the years 2006 and 2007. The authors are especially thankful to the WSA, who organised modification, shipping and anchoring of the buoyancy in the testing area. Further, we would like to thank the Niedersachsen Port Authorities (NPorts) of Wilhelmshaven, Germany, who generously allowed us to use the cargo bridge at Jade Bay for cultivating nearshore mussels on collector ropes. Special thanks go also to Captain Charly Lurs and his crew of the AWI research vessel FK Uthorn who guided and supported us during every ship excursion. The sampling at the offshore site Roter Sand would not have been possible without the help of the AWI research diving group who spent much time and energy to obtain the mussels for all the analyses. Further, the authors would like to thank the colleagues from the BSH and the DWD in Hamburg and from the NLWKN in Brake-Oldenburg for providing additional data of the sampling sites.

AB  - Alpine rockwalls with warm permafrost (near 0 degrees C) are the most active rockfall detachment zones in the Mont Blanc massif (MBM, French Alps) with more than 380 recent events. Near-vertical rockwall permafrost is spatially controlled by variations in rock fractures, snow cover, and microtopography. A reliable method to validate the distribution of permafrost in critical and unstable areas does not yet exist. We present seven electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys measured on five near-vertical rockwalls in the MBM from 2012 and 2013 that have been calibrated with measurements on a granite sample in the laboratory. ERT shows consistent measurements of remaining sensitive permafrost relating to inferred temperatures from 0 to -1.5 degrees C. ERT results demonstrate evidence of topographic controls on permafrost distribution and resistivity gradients that appear to reflect crest width. ERT results are compared to two permafrost index maps that use topoclimatic factors and combine effects of thin snow and fractures, where index model spatial resolution is crucial for the validation with ERT. In cryospheric environments, index maps seem to overestimate permafrost conditions in glacial environments. As a consequence, the sensitive areas of permafrost may slightly deviate from the results from distributed models that are only constrained by topoclimatic factors and interpreted with consideration of local fracture and snow conditions. This study demonstrates (i) that the sensitive and hazardous areas of permafrost in near-vertical rock faces can be assessed and monitored by the means of temperature-calibrated ERT and (ii) that ERT can be used for distributed model validation.

AB  - A unified approach is presented for the establishment of design conditions and acceptance criteria for performance objectives associated with different return intervals. A life-cycle optimization analysis is adopted for this purpose. Reliability and expected damage functions are defined both for individual seismic events and for a long-term framework. System reliability functions are determined by Monte Carlo simulation for a number of multistory frames, designed for different base-shear ratios and subjected to earthquakes of different intensities. Systematic trends are identified about the variation of the reliability index with the natural logarithm of the expected ductility demand of a reference system. These trends lead to the definition of seismic reliability functions that can easily be adapted for applications to reliability-based design. The problem of transforming the results of the optimization studies into codified rules for practical design is briefly discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Through the analysis of benthic foraminifera in the soft bottom sediments of the Laizhou Bay-Yellow River Delta system, this study characterized the foraminiferal biotopes and explored the possibility of obtaining an index of ecological quality comparable with other estuarine and coastal environments of the world. Five foraminiferal biotopes have been identified and their distribution patterns highlight the ecological stress from the marine-fluvial water mixing and pollution. The foraminiferal species were analyzed as a function of organic carbon gradients, and the main species were assigned to four ecological groups based on their sensitivity/ tolerance towards an increasing stress gradient. Finally, the relative proportions of the species assigned to the four different ecological groups were used for the definition of a marine biotic index based on foraminifera, i.e. the Foram-AMBI, and thus the assessment of the ecological quality status of marine soft-bottom habitats.

AB  - The native Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, is under increasing threat from QX disease competition with normative Crassostrea g gas and coastal development Knowledge of the distribution and population structure of S. glomerata and C. gigas is essential if oysters and their ecosystem services are to be successfully managed. We determined spatial patterns of abundance, condition. and size-structure of'S. glomerata and C. gigas across two key habitats. mangroves. and rocky shores of the Hawkesbury River. I highly modified estuary 50 kill north of Sydney. Sampling of five sites per habitat, spanning a 15 kill stretch of river, revealed abundant populations of S. glomerata, averaging 514 +/- 185 m(-2). ill mangroves and oil rocky shores. The native Oyster accounted for 99% of all oysters sampled. with C. gigas found Only at two Of the five sites sampled within each habitat. Overall, rocky shores supported over eight times the oyster cover as mangroves. Among rock sites, live oyster cover and condition generally decreased with distance Upstream. Although, at present. the Hawkesbury River estuary supports abundant, of oyster population is required to ensure that wild oyster populations, ongoing monitoring appropriate management strategies are established to ensure the persistence of this important component of the ecosystem. Our sampling of two key oyster habitats provides an important baseline against which future studies can assess change.

AB  - Fluctuation asymmetries (FA) are random on the bilateral symmetry plan of paired morphological characters, and other types of symmetry, such as: for instance, translational or rotational symmetry, in response to environmental, and genetic stress. The relationship of FA with gonadossomatic (GSI), hepatosomatic (HSI), and fullness (RI) indexes and condition factor (K) for juveniles (n=8), adults (n=32), males (n=9), and females (n=26) of Corocoro grunt Orthopristis ruber were evaluated in this paper. The composite fluctuating asymmetry (CFA) was used to calculate the combined effects of FA over these four organosomatic indexes of 66 Corocoro grunt caught during 2011 in Guanabara Bay, Brazil, one of the most eutrophic coastal bays in the world. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) confirmed a significant relationship between CFA and the physiological descriptors (HSI, RI, K), but without clear differences among juveniles, adults, and sexes. Our results support the potential of CFA to be used as a proxy of environmental effects over reef-associated fish species in a tropical bay, but the relationship between CFA and physiological descriptors is complex, and further studies, such as experimental trials, are needed.

AB  - Change-vector analysis in multi-temporal space is a powerful tool to analyse the nature and magnitude of land-cover change. The change vector compares the difference in the time-trajectory of a biophysical indicator for ve time periods. This change detection method is applied to three remotely-sensed indicators of land-surface conditions-vegetation index, surface temperature and spatial structure-in order to improve the capability to detect and categorize subtle forms of land-cover change. It is tested in a region of West Africa, using multi-temporal Local Area Coverage imagery obtained by the Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer on NOAA-9 and NOAA- 11 orbiting platforms. The three indicators show a low degree of redundancy and detect different land-cover change processes, which operate at different time scales. Change vector analysis is being developed for application to the land-cover change product to be produced using NASA's Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instrument, scheduled for flight in 1998 and 2000 on EOS-AM and -PM

AB  - Data collected out of the breeding season suggest that House sparrows (Passer domesticus) from the urban populations are characterized by a smaller body size and poorer body condition compared to birds from rural populations. Considering an urbanized Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and other potential predators, a new predator-prey dependency is developing that can also be a reason for the House sparrow's poorer condition. This study was aimed at comparing the multivariate biometrical characteristics and few body condition indices of adult birds from urban and rural populations during the breeding season. It was hypothesized that a higher predation risk during the breeding season concerns mainly males, thus affecting their poorer condition. Most of the condition indices of males were significantly lower in the urban population. Males from the urban populations had lower body mass, shorter tarsus, longer alula, greater Kipp's distance and higher wing pointedness index in comparison to the birds from rural populations, whereas these differences were not found between females. We suggest that the lower body condition and biometric differences in the analyzed birds are a means of adapting to the new predator-prey scheme in accordance to the tradeoff theory between starvation and predation risks. A lower condition of birds in poor foraging urban habitats and higher predation risk may be indicative of a declining population.

AB  - The oasis-desert transition zone, the boundary between the desert and oasis, has special significance in maintaining oasis stability and indicating ecosystem health. The width of the boundary is one of the critical indicators to determine the sampling design and restrict findings scaling in the study of the desert oasis transition zone. Buffer analyze and focal analyze were conducted to determine the width among oasis-desert transition zone and oasis artificial sand fixation zone in Hexi corridor China. Focal analyses indicate that TCImax and TCImin can constrain NDVI of trend variation, and the effect increases with the analysis scale. On the same spatial scale, NDVI and TCI have opposite trends and have intersections. The intersection of the sandy desert transition zone is between 30-90 m, and the oasis artificial sand-fixaion zone is between 90-150 m. The width of the sandy desert transition zone is between 220-300 m, and the width increases with the increase of analysis scale. The oasis artificial sand-fixation zone is between 420 and 540 m, which decreases with the increase of the analysis scale. NDVI shows a trend of decreasing from the oasis boundary to the desert, the trend of TCI is different from that of NDVI, showing an increase from the edge of oasis to the interior of desert. The differences in the spatial distribution of NDVI and TCI can be clearly expressed, and different types of transition zones and analysis scales have their own characteristics.

AB  - The oceanic uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) is increasing and changing the seawater chemistry, a phenomenon known as ocean acidification (OA). Besides the expected physiological impairments, there is an increasing evidence of detrimental OA effects on the behavioral ecology of certain marine taxa, including cephalopods. Within this context, the main goal of this study was to investigate, for the first time, the OA effects (similar to 1000 mu atm; Delta pH = 0.4) in the development and behavioral ecology (namely shelter-seeking, hunting and response to a visual alarm cue) of the common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) early life stages, throughout the entire embryogenesis until 20 days after hatching. There was no evidence that OA conditions compromised the cuttlefish embryogenesis - namely development time, hatching success, survival rate and biometric data (length, weight and Fulton's condition index) of newly hatched cuttlefish were similar between the normocapnic and hypercapnic treatments. The present findings also suggest a certain behavioral resilience of the cuttlefish hatchlings toward near-future OA conditions. Shelter-seeking, hunting and response to a visual alarm cue did not show significant differences between treatments. Thus, we argue that cuttlefishes' nekton-benthic (and active) lifestyle, their adaptability to highly dynamic coastal and estuarine zones, and the already harsh conditions (hypoxia and hypercapnia) inside their eggs provide a degree of phenotypic plasticity that may favor the odds of the recruits in a future acidified ocean. Nonetheless, the interacting effects of multiple stressors should be further addressed, to accurately predict the resilience of this ecologically and economically important species in the oceans of tomorrow.

AB  - Biomarkers are generally applied to detect pollution in environmental monitoring. Such biological responses should accurately reflect the stress over time in a quantitative manner. As such, the initial and maximum responses induced by stress, as well as adaptation and recovery of these biomarkers, need to be fully understood or else erroneous false-negative or false-positive may be arrived. However, most of the biomarker studies only provided information on initially induced responses under different concentrations of toxicants, while biological adaptation and recovery were poorly known. In this study, the time required for induction, adaptation and recovery of lysosomal integrity in green-lipped mussel Perna viridis upon exposure to benzo[a]pyrene was investigated over a period of 62 days. Maximum induction occurred on day 6 when lysosomal integrity was significantly reduced by 51%, and no further change or adaptation was detected thereafter. When mussels were depurated in clean seawater after 18 days of exposure to benzo[a]pyrene, a gradual recovery was observed, with lysosomal integrity returning to its background level and showing a complete recovery after 20 days of deputation. Lysosomal integrity was significantly correlated with the body burden concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene and condition index of the mussels. The relatively fast induction (6 days) and recovery (20 days) without apparent adaptation suggested that lysosomal integrity in A viridis can serve as a good biomarker in biomonitoring, as its response is not likely to generate both false-negative and false-positive results.

AB  - The feasibility of detecting a Chlorofluoromethane (CFM) gas molecule on the outer surface of a pristine single-walled boron nitride nanotube as well as Al-, Ga-, P-, and As-doped structures. A periodic boundary condition (PBC), within a density functional theory (DFT) method, using the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof exchange-correlation (PBE0) functional, together with a 6-311G(d) basis set was used. Subsequently, the B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, omega B97XD, and M06-2X functionals were also employed to consider the single point energies. Natural bond orbital (NBO) and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) were implemented by using the PBE0/6-311G(d). To explore the nature of the intermolecular interactions, density of state (DOS), Wiberg bond index (WBI), natural charge, natural electron configuration, donor-acceptor natural bond orbital interactions, the second-order perturbation energies tests, and noncovalent interaction (NCI) analysis are performed. The sensitivity of the adsorption will be increased when the gas molecule interacts with decorated nanotubes; therefore, the change of electronic properties can be used to design suitable nanosensors.

AB  - Bivalve molluscs are characterized by high morphological plasticity in response to variations in local environmental conditions. In the present study, we evaluate this capacity in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis with regard to intra-specific competition caused by cultivation density. Suspended cultivation ropes at different initial densities (220, 370, 500, 570, 800 and 1150 individuals per meter of rope) were placed on a raft in the Ria Ares-Betanzos, following standard cultivation techniques. From May to October, covering the period from thinning out to harvest, various morphological indicators (length/width, length/height and height/width ratios) and allometric relationships (Volume-Length and Projected area-Length) in addition to energy distribution (dry tissue weight/dry valve weight) were analyzed. Differences in morphological indicators due to cultivation density were observed while no influence on the energy distribution was detected. From the second cultivation month (June), a decrease was recorded in the length/height ratio of individuals due to cultivation density. Similarly, there was also a decrease in the length/width ratio, although this decrease only became statistically significant from September. In addition, the allometric relationships studied (Volume-Length and Projected area-Length) suggested asymmetric competition processes. Differences in volume or projected area between densities were only detected at the end of the experimental culture (October) and only in the smaller individuals. These morphological adaptations can be understood as a strategy to mitigate the effects of intra-specific competition, palliating the consequences of physical interference at high densities.

AB  - One of the predicted consequences of climate change is an increase in the occurrence of extreme rainfall and a subsequent increase in frequency of high flow events in rivers. High flow events have the potential to impact estuarine communities like mussel assemblages due to decreased salinity and/or the transport of sediments, organic matter and nutrients from the terrestrial environment to the estuary. The impact of two high flow events was investigated using mussels located within the Conwy estuary, North Wales, using the 'Beyond BACI' approach. Three study sites were chosen, the potentially impacted site (Conwy) and two control sites located outside the estuary. Sampling took place over 18 months with samples being collected before and after each event. On each sampling occasion, the following data were collected: the total haemocyte count (THC) and condition index (CI) of the mussels and the diversity (Hlog(e)) of their associated macrofauna. A significant effect of the first event (22nd October 2004) was found on the CI of the Conwy mussels, whereas a significant effect of the second event (10th October 2005) was found on mussel THC. No effect of either event was found on the diversity of the associated fauna. The results of this study suggest that any increase in the number or intensity of heavy precipitation or high flow events have potential implications for the health and resilience of estuarine mussel populations.

AB  - We tested whether macrobenthic community condition varies significantly with water depth in a variety of regions of Chesapeake Bay, USA. Benthic community condition was characterized using the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) previously developed for the Bay. We applied two water depth thresholds intended to emphasize the ecological importance and/or anthropogenic impacts upon shallow-water regions. The first threshold of 2 in emphasizes restoring and supporting submerged aquatic vegetation while the second threshold of 4 in emphasizes the zone of maximum anthropogenic impact upon natural ecosystem functions. An a priori expectation is that benthic community condition may worsen with increasing depth, specifically in regions (1) where water column stratification at depth results in prolonged low dissolved oxygen levels or (2) where net deposition at depth results in higher levels of hydrophobic, sediment-bound contaminants. Samples collected from a major tributary of Chesapeake Bay, the York River estuary, spanned the entire salinity range from tidal freshwater to polyhaline. We also tested the shallow-water depth thresholds using data from the Virginia Mainstem of Chesapeake Bay and the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River. These two polyhaline regions are characterized as having the best and worst benthic community condition in Chesapeake Bay. At the scale of the entire tidal York River system, there were no significant differences in benthic community condition with water depth. However, two salinity regions, low mesohaline and polyhaline, had significant depth effects with the shallowest water depth zone significantly different from the other two depth regions. For the low mesohaline region benthic community condition was worse at the shallowest depth and for the polyhaline region the shallowest depth was better comparing the three depth regions. No depth-related differences in the B-IBI were found for the two additional Chesapeake Bay strata, the Virginia Mainstem characterized with the lowest levels of benthic community degradation and for the Southern branch of the Elizabeth River, characterized by the highest levels of benthic community degradation. We conclude that the ecological state of Chesapeake Bay subtidal benthic communities is adequately characterized by randomly sampling all depths without further stratification into shallow and deeper regions.

AB  - An index has been elaborated to define the ecological status of rivers in Bulgaria, using the fish as indicator for human impact. The index is based on classical approach for biological integrity, employing nine biotic variables and more than 70 freshwater fish species. The main purpose is intended to determine ecological status of Bulgarian rivers according the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive. The method is fast, simplified and adapted to fishing methods that do not require colecting of specimens. The advantages are that BRI has been especially elaborated for Bulgarian rivers and its sensitivity directed to indication of antropogenic pressures to which the other biological elements are not so sensitive. The methods of the index elaboration have been explained and hints for its practical implementation given.

AB  - At present, farmland-controlled drainage is of great significance for water-logging control, water conservation, and emissions reduction. This paper focused on the water level of farmland to study the changes of root-zone soil environment in a flooded paddy field. Such technical indexes included the soil nutrient index of rapid available phosphorus (RAP) and rapid available nitrogen (RAN) in the 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm soil layers, the soil aeration condition index Eh value in the 15 cm soil layer, and soil temperature (ST), respectively, in the 5 cm and 20 cm soil layers. Additionally, this paper presented an analysis on the impact of water flooding in a paddy field on the soil's microenvironment using the principal component factor method. Influence analysis results showed that different water level controls between CK (shallow and wetting irrigation) and F1 and F2 (controlled drainage) had a significant effect on the changes of RAN content in the 0-10cm layer, Eh value in the 15 cm layer, and ST value in the 5 cm layer, but different leakage intensities had no significant effect on the change of RAN, RAP, Eh, and ST. The results showed that water-flooding can improve the RAP content, reduce the RAN content of every soil layer, deteriorate the soil aeration status, and increase the soil temperature; additionally, the water-flooding had an adverse impact on the soil's RAP, RAN, Eh, and ST at the tillering and milking stages. Water-flooding also had an adverse impact on the soil's RAN and Eh at the jointing-booting and heading-flowering stages.

AB  - White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a new disease of bats that has devastated populations in eastern North America. Infection with the fungus, Geomyces destructans, is thought to increase the time bats spend out of torpor during hibernation, leading to starvation. Little is known about hibernation in healthy, free-ranging bats and more data are needed to help predict consequences of WNS. Trade-offs presumably exist between the energetic benefits and physiological/ecological costs of torpor, leading to the prediction that the relative importance of spring energy reserves should affect an individual's use of torpor and depletion of energy reserves during winter. Myotis lucifugus mate during fall and winter but females do not become pregnant until after spring emergence. Thus, female reproductive success depends on spring fat reserves while male reproductive success does not. Consequently, females should be "thrifty" in their use of fat compared to males. We measured body condition index (BCI; mass/forearm length) of 432 M. lucifugus in Manitoba, Canada during the winter of 2009/2010. Bats were captured during the fall mating period (n = 200), early hibernation (n = 125), and late hibernation (n = 128). Adult females entered hibernation with greater fat reserves and consumed those reserves more slowly than adult males and young of the year. Consequently, adult females may be more likely than males or young of the year to survive the disruption of energy balance associated with WNS, although surviving females may not have sufficient reserves to support reproduction.

AB  - Estimates of genetic components are important for our understanding of how individual characteristics are transferred between generations. We show that the level of heritability varies between 0.12 and 0.68 in six morphological traits in house sparrows (Passer domesticus L.) in northern Norway. Positive and negative genetic correlations were present among traits, suggesting evolutionary constraints on the evolution of some of these characters. A sexual difference in the amount of heritable genetic variation was found in tarsus length, wing length, bill depth and body condition index, with generally higher heritability in females. In addition, the structure of the genetic variance-covariance matrix for the traits differed between the sexes. Genetic correlations between males and females for the morphological traits were however large and not significantly different from one, indicating that sex-specific responses to selection will be influenced by intersexual differences in selection differentials. Despite this, some traits had heritability above 0.1 in females, even after conditioning on the additive genetic covariance between sexes and the additive genetic variances in males. Moreover, a meta-analysis indicated that higher heritability in females than in males may be common in birds. Thus, this indicates sexual differences in the genetic architecture of birds. Consequently, as in house sparrows, the evolutionary responses to selection will often be larger in females than males. Hence, our results suggest that sex-specific additive genetic variances and covariances, although ignored in most studies, should be included when making predictions of evolutionary changes from standard quantitative genetic models.

T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA  - English
AB  - Yield being a polygenic character is influenced by genotypes, environments and genotype x environment (G x E) interactions. Ten wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes developed at Nuclear Institute of Agriculture Tando Jam viz. SD-4085/3, SD-4047, SD-66, SD-1200/11, SD-1200/19/1, SD-1200/51, 7-03, 15-10, RWM-9313, ESW-9525 were evaluated along with two local checks Kiran-95 and Sarsabz in multi-environmental trials (METs) over 11 locations having different agroclimatic conditions of Sindh province. Normal agronomic practices were followed at each location. Grain yield data were recorded on 6 m(2) plots and subjected to statistical analysis. Stability parameters measured were regression coefficient (b) and variance due to deviation from regression (S(2)d). Genotype SD-4047 produced the highest grain yield (2.64 kg) with unit regression (b=1.09) and lowest standard error of regression s.e (b) = 0.09 and S(2)d (0.024) confirming wide adaptability and stability. SD-4085/3 proved to be the second highest yielding (2.59 kg) genotype but had high regression (b=1.187 and s.e.(b) = 0.262 and variance due to deviation from regression (S(2)d = 0.22) value suggesting specific adaptation particularly in high yielding environments. Regression values on environmental index ranged from 0.763 in genotype 7-03 to 1.187 in SD-4085/3. Pooled analysis of variance overall environments indicates that the genotype, environment and genotype x environment (GxE) interaction mean squares were highly significant (P <= 0.01) for grain yield. Therefore, an understanding of G x E interaction provides a valid insights into the selection of new stable genotypes in the diversified environmental conditions prevailing in a region.

AB  - The ecological quality status of the NE region of the Guanabara Bay (SE Brazil), one of the most important Brazilian embayments, is evaluated. For this purpose, sediment samples from in the inner of the Guanabara Bay (GB) were collected and analyzed (grain-size, mineralogy, geochemistry and living foraminifera). In this study, it is hypothesized that the potentially toxic elements (PTEs) concentrations, in solution and associated with organic matter (OMPTEs, potential nutrient source), may represent two potential pathways to impact benthic foraminifers A multiproxy approach applied to complex statistical analyses and ecological indexes shows that the study area is, in general, eutrophic (with high organic matter and low oxygen content), polluted by PTEs and oil. As a consequence, foraminifera are not abundant and their assemblages are poorly diversified and dominated by some stress-tolerant species (i.e., Ammonia tepida, Quinqueloculina seminula, Cribroelphidium excavatum). The results allow us to identify a set of species sensitive to eutrophication and omPTEs. Factors such as the increase of organic matter contents and OMPTEs and, in particular of Zn, Cd and Pb, the oxygen depletion and the presence of oil, altogether contribute to a marked reduction in the abundance and diversity of foraminifera. Ammonia-Elphidium Index and the Foram Stress Index confirm that the NE zone of GB is, in general, "heavily polluted", with "poor ecological quality status" and experiences suboxic to anoxic conditions. In light of it, special attention from public authorities and policymakers is required in order to take immediate actions to enable its environmental recovery.

AB  - 1. Macroinvertebrate communities were studied from 1994 to 2001/2002 (except 1997) in six streams in Denali National Park, interior Alaska. All six streams were potential reference streams with no known impairment.
   2. Abundance of individual taxa varied markedly from year to year. Overall, abundance decreased over the study period, particularly with respect to mayflies. Stonefly taxa showed lower persistence and were sometimes absent from a stream in any particular year.
   3. Mean community persistence for the six streams, as measured by Jaccard's similarity coefficients between years, varied from 0.48 in the year pair 1999-2000 to 0.78 in 1998-99. Tattler Creek (a small stable stream) supported the most persistent macroinvertebrate community and Highway Pass Creek (a small, unstable creek) the least. Mean community persistence showed a significant relationship with mean winter snowfall (November to March) for the six streams.
   4. The highest community compositional stability was found in Tattler Creek and the lowest in Highway Pass Creek, but stability varied markedly over time for the six streams, peaking in 1994-95 and reaching a minimum in 2000-01. Compositional stability was significantly related to the Pfankuch Index of channel stability.
   5. The composition metrics % Chironomidae, % dominant taxa, % EPT, % Ephemeroptera and % Plecoptera, employed as part of the Alaska Stream Condition Index, varied over almost their entire range in these pristine streams across the 9 years of the study.
   6. This study demonstrates the wide range of natural variation that occurs in benthic macroinvertebrate communities in these pristine central Alaskan streams, potentially limiting the applicability of composition metrics for the biological monitoring of water quality in these systems.

AB  - The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis postulates that higher-quality males may be able to balance potential conflicts between resource-demanding activities, such as courtship behavior and immune responses, whereas lower-quality males suffer from immunosuppression or lower reproductive output. In this study, we examined the immune response of the brush-legged wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata to infection with pathogenic bacteria as juveniles (penultimate), and its impact on development of adult male secondary sexual signaling traits. After oral ingestion of a bacterial pathogen, active bacteria were found in the hemolymph for up to 5 h. We found that immune activation (ingestion of bacteria) at the juvenile stage resulted in higher immune response as an adult than control individuals, but also led to lower body condition index values and a higher degree of asymmetry in secondary sexual signaling traits (foreleg tufts). Infected males also had relatively smaller tufts than control males when penultimate body condition was added as a covariate and tuft size was appropriately scaled. Additionally, males infected as juveniles had significantly lower mating success than control males, although this difference was not due to courtship vigor. These results suggest that during development, juvenile males may be allocating more resources into immune function during infection, potentially at the cost of reduced sexual signaling and mating success as adults, and that there is the potential for complex trade-offs between immunity and sexual signaling in this species.

AB  - The freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera is one of the most threatened freshwater bivalves worldwide. In this study, we aimed (i) to study the processes by which water quality might affect freshwater mussels in situ and (ii) to provide insights into the ecotoxicological significance of water pollution to natural populations in order to provide necessary information to enhance conservation strategies. M. margaritifera specimens were sampled in two close sites located upstream or downstream from an illegal dumping site. The renal transcriptome of these animals was assembled and gene transcription determined by RNA-seq. Correlations between transcription levels of each single transcript and the bioaccumulation of nine trace metals, age (estimated by sclerochronology), and condition index were determined in order to identify genes likely to respond to a specific factor. Amongst the studied metals, Cr, Zn, Cd, and Ni were the main factors correlated with transcription levels, with effects on translation, apoptosis, immune response, response to stimulus, and transport pathways. However, the main factor explaining changes in gene transcription appeared to be the age of individuals with a negative correlation with the transcription of retrotransposon-related genes. To investigate this effect further, mussels were classified into three age classes. In young, middle-aged and old animals, transcription levels were mainly explained by Cu, Zn and age, respectively. This suggests differences in the molecular responses of this species to metals during its lifetime that must be better assessed in future ecotoxicology studies.

AB  - The present medium term (21 d) study was performed to evaluate the effects of HCl or CO2-induced acidified seawater (pH 7.7, 7.1 or 6.5; control: pH 8.1) on the physiological responses of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, at different levels of biological organization. The results demonstrate that: (1) either HCl or CO2 enrichment had significant impacts on physiological changes in M. edulis: the mortality increased while condition index (Cl) decreased steadily as the pH decreased, those indexes indicate the metabolic activities (e.g. filtering rate, oxygen consumption rate, etc.) underwent similar changes; moreover, the decrease of calcification rate and carbonic anhydrase activity indicate that the carbon sink ability of the mussels was significantly affected. We hypothesize that acidification induced intracellular energy crisis and a decrease in enzyme activities could be a potential explanation for our findings. (2) Comparatively, CO2 enrichment had more severe effects on mortality but caused less stress to the metabolic and carbon sink indexes than HCl adjustment at the same pH level. Apoptosis caused by the 'intracellular acidification' in the CO2 group and difference in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration between two groups are suggested to be responsible for these results. (3) An integrated biomarker response (IBR) was set up on the basis of the estimated indexes; it was determined that the IBR decreased steadily with the decrease of pH, and a positive relationship was observed between them, inferring that the IBR might be a potential biological monitoring method in evaluating the effects of seawater acidification.

AB  - Multimetric indices are often used to monitor aquatic-resource conditions. We used existing fish-collection data from streams to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), which is a multimetric index, for the Ouachita Mountains ecoregion in Arkansas, U. S. A. Each fish-collection site was categorized as reference or non-reference. We examined 62 candidate IBI metrics, and selected 12 non-redundant metrics that differentiated best between reference and non-reference sites. The selected metrics were: Percent (of individuals) as Black Bass; Percent as Benthic Feeders; Percent as Centrarchids; Percent as Cyprinids; Percent as Ictalurids; Percent as Mineral, Site-Prep Spawners; Percent as Mineral, Site-Prep, Parental-Care Spawners; Percent as Simple, Mineral Substrate Spawners; Percent as Miscellaneous, Site-Prep, Parental-Care Spawners; Total Number of Centrarchid Species; Total Number of Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) Ouachita Mountains Indicator Species; and Total Number of ADEQ Ouachita Mountains Key Species. We standardized each metric to score from 0 to 10 by using linear equations and threshold limits. Some selected IBI metrics had their scoring criteria adjusted to account for watershed size (i.e., stream size). We standardized the IBI to score from 0 to 100. In addition, we determined that our Percent as Black Bass and Percent as Benthic Feeders metrics contributed most to IBI scores in reference conditions, but their contributions decreased with decreasing stream conditions. Reproductive metrics contributed most in degraded stream conditions. Furthermore, we identified relations between IBI metrics and water-quality and land-use variables; some relations were counterintuitive. Unexpected relations may be random observations explained by limited ranges of land-use and water-quality variables. When select water-quality and land-use variables were included in a principal component analysis, a composite Land Use Intensity variable explained most of the model variance. Although the IBI has not been independently validated, the PCA, as well as other superficial analyses, indicated that the IBI should be able to differentiate stream conditions.

AB  - In this study the environmental balance of the industrial district of the Potenza town (Southern Italy) is presented. This study represents the first attempt of analytically evaluating the relationships between the industrial activities, their impacts and environmental quality, setting up a reference document for analysing the monitoring trends and for describing the state of the environment over a chosen time horizon. A careful and appropriate choice of environmental indicators was made, according to the guidelines of the European Environmental Agency and to the Driving Forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response model (DPSIR). In particular, data on the economic assessment, raw materials, water and energy consumptions, air emissions, waste disposal are presented. These results provide a useful baseline for the evaluation of the state of the environment and its variations over the time horizon and to define the feasibility of environmental policy targets as well as the effectiveness of recovery strategies.

AB  - We used a retrospective approach to identify hydrologic metrics with the greatest potential for ecological relevance for use as resource management tools (i.e., hydrologic indicators) in rapidly urbanizing basins of the Puget Lowland. We proposed four criteria for identifying useful hydrologic indicators: (1) sensitive to urbanization consistent with expected hydrologic response, (2) demonstrate statistically significant trends in urbanizing basins (and not in undeveloped basins), (3) be correlated with measures of biological response to urbanization, and (4) be relatively insensitive to potentially confounding variables like basin area. Data utilized in the analysis included gauged flow and benthic macroinvertebrate data collected at 16 locations in 11 King County stream basins. Fifteen hydrologic metrics were calculated from daily average flow data and the Pacific Northwest Benthic Index of Biological Integrity (B-IBI) was used to represent the gradient of response of stream macroinvertebrates to urbanization. Urbanization was represented by percent Total Impervious Area(%TIA) and percent urban land cover (% Urban). We found eight hydrologic metrics that were significantly correlated with B-IBI scores (Low Pulse Count and Duration; High Pulse Count, Duration, and Range; Flow Reversals, T-Qmean,and R-B Index). Although there appeared to be a great deal of redundancy among these metrics with respect to their response to urbanization, only two of the metrics tested - High Pulse Count and High Pulse Range - best met all four criteria we established for selecting hydrologic indicators. The increase in these high pulse metrics with respect to urbanization is the result of an increase in winter high pulses and the occurrence of high pulse events during summer (increasing the frequency and range of high pulses), when practically none would have occurred prior to development. We performed an initial evaluation of the usefulness of our hydrologic indicators by calculating and comparing hydrologic metrics derived from continuous hydrologic simulations of selected basin management alternatives for Miller Creek, one of the most highly urbanized basins used in our study. We found that the preferred basin management alternative appeared to be effective in restoring some flow metrics close to simulated fully forested conditions (e. g., T-Qmean), but less effective in restoring other metrics such as High Pulse Count and Range. If future research continues to support our hypothesis that the flow regime, particularly High Pulse Count and Range, is an important control of biotic integrity in Puget Lowland streams, it would have significant implications for stormwater management.

AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization and population migration, since the 20th century, the natural and eco-environment of coastal areas have been under tremendous pressure due to the strong interference of human response. To objectively evaluate the coastal eco-environment condition and explore the impact from the urbanization process, this paper, by integrating daytime remote sensing and nighttime remote sensing, carried out a quantitative assessment of the coastal zone of China in 2000-2019 based on Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) and Comprehensive Nighttime Light Index (CNLI) respectively. The results showed that 1) the overall eco-environmental conditions in China's coastal zone have shown a trend of improvement, but regional differences still exist; 2) during the study period, the urbanization process of cities continued to advance, especially in seaside cities and prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu and Shandong, which were much higher than the average growth rate; 3) the Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD) between the urbanization and eco-environment in coastal cities is constantly increasing, but the main contribution of environmental improvement comes from nonurbanized areas, and the eco-environment pressure in urbanized areas is still not optimistic. As a large-scale, long-term series of eco-environment and urbanization process change analysis, this study can provide theoretical support for mesoscale development planning, eco-environment condition monitoring and environmental protection policies from decision-makers.

AB  - Climate models predict that shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns are likely to occur across the globe. Changing climate will likely have strong effects on arid environments as a result of increased temperatures, increasing frequency and intensity of droughts, and less consistent pulses of rainfall. Therefore, understanding the link between patterns of precipitation, temperature, and population performance of species occupying these environments will continue to increase in importance as climatic shifts occur within these natural ecosystems. We sought to evaluate how individual, maternal, population, and environmental, particularly temperature and precipitation, level factors influence population performance of a large herbivore in an arid environment. We used mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) as a representative species and quantified juvenile survival to test hypotheses about effects of environmental factors on population performance. Precipitation events occurring in mid- to late-pregnancy (January-April) leading to spring green-up, as indexed by normalized difference in vegetation index, had the strongest positive effect on juvenile survival and recruitment. In addition, larger neonates had an increased probability of survival. Our findings indicate that timing and amount of precipitation prior to parturition have strong influences on maternal nutritional condition, which was passed on to young. These results have important implications for understanding how animal populations may benefit from timing of precipitation during spring and prior to parturition, especially in arid environments.

AB  - The analysis of metal concentrations in bird feathers and genotoxicity tests are tools used to evaluate anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems. We investigated the response of birds, used as bioindicators, to disturbances observed in three areas with distinctive environmental characteristics (natural, agricultural, and urban) in southern Brazil. For this purpose, we quantified metals (Mn, Cu, Cr, and Zn) in feathers and determined the number of micronuclei (MN) and other nuclear abnormalities (NA) in 108 birds from 25 species and 17 families captured in the study area. No significant differences was found in the metal concentrations and the number of MN and NA between the sampling areas. Zn and Cu concentrations were significantly higher in insectivorous than those in omnivorous birds. The Zn concentration was significantly different between some species, and the Cu concentration was significantly higher in juveniles than that in adults. The best generalized linear models showed that omnivorous birds had more MN and NA and that juveniles and birds with better body condition index had increased NA numbers. This study demonstrates that the analyzed variables contribute in different ways to the result of each biomarker, mainly due to particular ecological and physiological characteristics of each species. We conclude that wild birds have the potential to be used as environmental bioindicators in the study area, but future studies should focus on one or a few species whose ecological and physiological habits are well known.

AB  - In otariids, the condition and growth of offspring are linked to prey availability be cause females show a strong dependence on local food availability. Thus, it is expected that body condition of sea lion pups will vary spatially and/or temporally as a response to variations in the abundance of prey species on which females feed. The objective of this study was to analyze the geographic and temporal variation in the body condition of South American sea lion Otaria flavescens pups in Chile, and to relate it to spatio-temporal variations in prey availability. We captured 340 live pups in 2 distant colonies, Punta Patache/Punta Negra and Cobquecura, along the Chilean coast during consecutive breeding seasons. A morphometric index of pup body condition was estimated by comparing pups in all years using least-squares linear regression of the log(10)-transformed measurements of standard length vs. body mass. We analyzed the relationship between this index and estimates of fish biomass (as a proxy of prey availability) at each locality. We found that body condition was significantly different between years and between colonies, suggesting that animals of the central-south area were in better condition than those in the north. A positive relationship between body condition and fish biomass was found, suggesting that differences in body condition may be explained by spatial and temporal differences in prey availability.

AB  - The Secu Lake (in Caras Severin County) main use is the city drinking water supply. Therefore, to evaluate the water quality, there were analyzed the general chemical indicators monthly average values. Qualitative analyzes were performed in SC Aquacaras SA Central Laboratory, indicators monitoring being recorded within three years. The lake raw water assessment provides information in order to establish the required treatment methods for drinking water. From this study, it can be observed that the lake water satisfies the conditions stipulated by Romanian legislation on surface water quality (chlorides, sulfates, dissolved iron, and ammonia). However, if the recommendations and limits imposed by the World Health Organization are analyzed, for some indicators corrections must be made to ensure the human health protection.

AB  - Assessing ecosystem states quantitatively or qualitatively is important for ecosystem management. Currently, Traditional Comprehensive Assessment (TCA), including ecosystem health, risk, and service assessment is used most often. Ecosystem stability theory (EST) and ecosystem regime shift theory (RST) from mathematical ecology have not been widely used. In this paper, we compare TCA and EST and RST result using two lakes, Onondaga Lake and Poyang Lake, as case studies. We find that biological oxygen demand (BOD) could be a suitable variable to calculate temporal stability and variance indexes in EST and RST, and trend in general. The result could replace TCA when the key lake driver is not too extreme. This recommendation is preliminary, needing validated with data.

AB  - Several marine ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure have experienced shifts from one ecological state to another. In the central Baltic Sea, the regime shift of the 1980s has been associated with food-web reorganization and redirection of energy flow pathways. These long-term dynamics from 1974 to 2006 have been simulated here using a food-web model forced by climate and fishing. Ecological network analysis was performed to calculate indices of ecosystem change. The model replicated the regime shift. The analyses of indicators suggested that the system's resilience was higher prior to 1988 and lower thereafter. The ecosystem topology also changed from a web-like structure to a linearized food-web.

AB  - The large estuary that the River Po forms at its confluence into the Adriatic Sea comprises a multitude of transitional environments, including coastal lagoons. This complex system receives the nutrients transported by the River Po but also its load of chemical contaminants, which may pose a substantial (eco)toxicological risk. Despite the high ecological and economic importance of these vulnerable environments, there is a substantial lack of information on this risk. In light of the recent amendments of the European Water Framework Directive (2013/39/EU), the present study investigated the sediment contamination of six coastal lagoons of the Po delta and its effects on Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum), exposed in situ for 3 months. Sediment contamination and clam bioaccumulation of a wide range of chemicals, i.e. trace metals (Cd, Cr, Ni, Hg, Pb, As), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), alkylphenols (APs), organochlorine compounds (PCBs, DDTs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organotins (TPhT, TBT), suggested a southward increase related to the riverine transports. Where the River Po influence was more direct, the concentrations of contaminants were higher, with nonylphenol and BDE-209 exceeding sediment quality guidelines. Biometric indicators suggested the influence of contamination on organism health; an inverse relationship between PBDEs in sediments and clam condition index has been found, as well as different biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) in the lagoons.

AB  - Body condition indices (BCI - mass scaled by size) are widely used in ecological studies. They presumably reflect variations of endogenous fat reserves in free-ranging animals. In the field, however, accurately quantifying internal body reserves is a difficult task. This is especially true in armoured animals where convenient clues that may guide BCI assessment (e.g. visible subcutaneous fat deposits) remain inaccessible. Alternatively, inclusive dissections may provide anatomical abacuses to estimate body reserves in living individuals. Sacrificing animals for this purpose is not acceptable. We opportunistically tested the ability of BCI to estimate body reserves in 13 free-ranging Hermann's tortoises (Gmelin, 1789) dissected soon after they died from natural causes. On average, BCI values were lower in dissected tortoises relative to living individuals (N > 10,000 measurements), but they remained within the range of variation of the studied populations. Shell mass relative to body mass was high and showed considerable inter-individual variation (33.5% to 52.3%). Stomach and digestive tract content represented another important and variable part of total body mass (4.4% to 14.5%). The contribution of fat bodies was negligible (0.0% to 0.5%). Overall, in the studied tortoises, variations of body condition are weakly determined by variations of fat stores. Other endogenous (e.g. muscles, visceral tissues, liver) and "exogenous" (e.g. digestive tract content, clutch) elements should be considered to better understand age and sex specific life-history trade-offs faced by chelonians.

AB  - Understanding variability in reproductive schedules is essential to the management of recruitment limited fisheries such as that of Pecten maximus. Small scale (<5 km) variation in gonad condition and the onset of spawning of P. maximus were found among commercial scallop grounds in Isle of Man waters. Environmental and fishing drivers of these spatial patterns were investigated using a generalised additive model. Rate of change in temperature over the month prior to sampling was identified as the short term driver of gonad weight associated with the autumn spawning event. Long term drivers were average annual chlorophyll a concentration, scallop density, stratification index and shell size. The model explained 42.8% of deviance in gonad weight. Within site variation in gonad condition was high, indicating a "bet hedging" reproductive strategy which may decrease the chance of fertilisation especially at low densities. Therefore, areas protected from fishing, where scallop densities can increase may help buffer against reproductive failure. An increase in shell length from 100 mm to 110 mm equated to an increase of approximately 20% in gonad weight. Protecting scallops from fishing mortality until 110 mm (age four) compared to 100 mm (age three) may lead to an overall increase in lifetime reproductive output by a factor of 3.4.

AB  - An observer-based finite-time L-2-L-infinity control law is devised for a class of positive Markov jump systems in a complex environment. The complex environment parameters include bounded uncertainties, unknown nonlinearities, and external disturbances. The objective is to devise an appropriate observer-based control law that makes the corresponding augment error dynamic Markov jump systems be positive and finite-time stabilizable and satisfy the given L-2-L-infinity disturbance attenuation index. A sufficient condition is initially established on the existence of the observer-based finite-time controller by using proper stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. The design criteria are presented by means of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the feasibility and validity of the main results can be illustrated through a numerical example.

AB  - Energy state and environmental impacts of production systems are of main criteria to reach sustainability. In the present research, ostrich was compared with a broiler production system based on the criteria. The required data was gathered in Boukan Township, West Azerbaijan, Iran, by a questioner method. The total input energy in ostrich and broiler systems was calculated as 150,419.81 MJ (1 ton of bird year)(-1) and 344,579.58 MJ (1 ton of bird year)(-1), respectively. Diesel fuel and feed (41.39% and 36.95%, respectively) in broiler and electricity (45.87%) in the ostrich production system had the highest energy shares. Eleven impact categories were estimated by SimaPro software in the studied systems. Except for human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity, the amounts of other environmental impacts in the ostrich production system were lower than those of the poultry production system. The amount of global warming indicator for the production of 1 ton of broiler chicken was 17,400 kg CO2 eq year(-1) that was equal to 4350 kg CO2 eq period(-1). This value was obtained as 1.68 x 10(4) kg CO2 eq year(-1) for the production of ostrich meat. In both production systems, feed was the main factor responsible for almost all studied environmental impacts.

AB  - The entire Laguna Madre of Tamaulipas is a natural protected area and a Priority Marine Region of Mexico. However, its important biodiversity and high levels of endemism are threatened by the discharge of different pollutants and activities related to the ocean oil and gas industry. Therefore, the assessment of these effects on this marine ecosystem is of paramount importance. At present, the joint approach of monitoring chemical contaminant levels, alongside the use of pollution biomarkers as surrogate measures of biological impact within the environment, provides the better evaluation of the environmental hazard. Within this context, a biomonitoring study using native Chione elevata mussels sampled from four locations along the Mexican Laguna Madre coasts evaluated whether a battery of select biomarkers was suitable for identifying and quantifying pollution-induced stress in mussels. The levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutathione s-transferase (GST), and the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) were measured in soft tissues samples. Different metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, and Fe) as well as total heavy hydrocarbons were also determined in sediments. Higher concentrations of metals were observed in sampling localities with marine influence possibly related to the presence of marine grass. The concentration of total heavy hydrocarbons, as expected, was higher in sites with intensive fishing activity. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) and the condition index of mussels allowed discriminating between localities of continental and marine influence, revealing that the sampling stations with continental influence were subjected to a greater stress as a result of anthropogenic effects.

AB  - The herbicide atrazine is one of the most heavily used pesticides in the United States. The effects of atrazine on the clam Mercenaria mercenaria were evaluated in aqueous and sediment laboratory assays. Juvenile clams of approximately I mm in size were used for all experiments. An acute aqueous bio-assay was used to determine the 96-h LC50 for the juvenile clams. A chronic aqueous bioassay was conducted at lower atrazine concentrations over a 10-day exposure period to examine both lethal and sublethal (dry mass, shell size, and condition index) endpoints. A chronic sediment bioassay examined mortality and sublethal endpoints in a 10-day exposure. The acute 96-h LC50 was 5608 mu g/L with 95% confidence intervals ranging from 5003 to 6287 mu g/L. Results of the chronic aqueous assay indicated both lethal and sublethal (reduced shell size) effects at high atrazine concentrations. In the 10-day chronic aqueous assay, the no observable effect concentration was 500 mu g/L, the lowest observable effect concentration was 1000 mu g/L, and the maximum allowable toxicant concentration (MATC) was 707 mu g/L. There were no significant effects of atrazine in the chronic sediment exposure. Safe concentrations for the aqueous experiments were estimated by applying an uncertainty factor of 10 to the calculated MATC values. While there were adverse effects of atrazine at high concentrations, these results suggest that atrazine is not directly toxic to M. mercenaria at environmentally relevant concentrations.

AB  - The conditions of globalization put forward new threats to the existence of the traditional way of life. At present, poverty of the population, considerable property differentiation, lack of middle class, and low level and quality of life in the Ukrainian society are especially dangerous and threatening crisis phenomena of socioeconomic character in Ukrainian society. This fact confirms the statistics of criminal offenses in the sphere of providing the basis of state security, as well as in the field of providing public services, economic activities, and property crimes. Thus, all this, undoubtedly, actualizes the study of the issue of ensuring Ukraine's state security from threats of socio-economic nature. Providing state security is in the sight of a large number of leading scientists. Note that in this case, the study of the crisis phenomena of the socio-economic nature itself and their impact on the provision of state security has not been given sufficient attention. Therefore, the subject of the study is the definition of the methodology of the impact of crisis phenomena of a socio-economic nature on the state of ensuring the state security of Ukraine to develop a model for the emergence and impact of crisis phenomena of a socio-economic nature on the state of state security. Let's mention that sufficient attention is not paid to the research of crisis phenomena of socio-economic nature and their impact on the maintenance of state security. Methodology. To determine the theoretical and methodological principles of crisis phenomena in Ukrainian society, to study the state of ensuring the state security of Ukraine, and to develop a model of the emergence and impact of crisis phenomena of a socio-economic nature on the state of security, functional provisions of the theory of state administration, social economics, economic theory, system analysis, and also a collection of other general scientific and special methods are used, namely: systematization of legal acts, structural analysis, historical method, method of comparative analysis, welfare theory, hypothesis, induction and deduction, analysis and synthesis, structuring and organizational modelling. Practical implications. The emergence of crisis phenomena with a socio-economic component requires governments to make timely and effective management decisions. Such phenomena take central place among the threats to society in the system of ensuring state security. The main crisis phenomena of socio-economic character in Ukraine are identified as high levels of corruption, high levels of poverty, significant property differentiation of the population, social inequality, and lack of a middle class. The analysis of crisis phenomena shows that the most acute, mass, and socially dangerous crisis phenomena are caused by low living standards and unresolved social problems. They are the basis of grave social conflicts between the people and the authorities. There is a developed model of the emergence and impact of the crisis phenomena of a socio-economic nature on the state and shows that today the study of threats to state security, which arose on the socio-economic basis, deserves special attention.The most expedient and relevant is the study of the crisis phenomena of the socioeconomic nature and the development of mechanisms for state regulation of these phenomena.

AB  - The invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) has become an accepted biomonitor organism for trace elements, but it has yet to be studied along the Lake Michigan shoreline. Likewise, the relationships between tissue concentrations of elements, organism size, and sediment concentrations of elements have not been fully explained. The present study found that a variety of allometric variables such as length, dry tissue mass, shell mass, organism condition indices, and shell thickness index were useful in explaining intrasite variability in elemental concentrations. The flesh condition index (grams of tissue dry mass per gram of shell mass) explained variability at the most sites for most elements. Once allometric intrasite variability was taken into account, additional significant differences were found between sites, although the net effect was small. Significant positive relationships between sediment and tissue concentrations were found for Pb and Zn, with a significant negative relationship for Cd. It was also found that Cu and Zn concentrations in tissues increased significantly along the shoreline in the southeasterly direction, whereas Hg increased in a northwesterly direction. Opportunistic sampling found that zebra mussels accumulate significantly higher concentrations of nearly all elements analyzed compared to Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) at the same site. The present study demonstrates the need to fully explain natural sources of variability before using biomonitors to explain spatial distributions of trace elements.

AB  - Eurasian permafrost serves as an important carbon pool and water resource for linked aquatic ecosystems. To investigate the effects of expected warmer climate under climate change, and also to fill the data gaps in the south margin of the Eurasian permafrost, the seasonal runoff and the associated dissolved carbon fluxes in a pair of catchments in the Great Khingan Mountains of northeast China were investigated in 2018-2019. Two similar small catchments, a south-facing (SF) and a north-facing (NF), were used to check the effects of warmer climate on the dynamics of runoff and dissolved carbon yields. The SF catchment, with a warmer condition compared to the NF catchment, presented much larger snowmelt runoff during spring and more gentle rainfall flood peaks in the summer-autumn period, but similar concentrations of dissolved carbons during both the periods. As a result, the dissolved carbon fluxes were greatly elevated during the snowmelt period. However, the runoff and carbon yield in the two catchments showed no significant difference during the summer rainfall periods, in spite of a much deeper active layer of permafrost in the SF. As indicated by two fluorescence indices, the humification (HIX) and biological index (BIX), the chemical characteristics of dissolved carbon were similar in both the snowmelt and rainfall runoff periods in the two catchments. These results emphasize that warmer climate would largely alter the seasonal runoff patterns and promote dissolved carbon export in the snowmelt period, which would lead to more unexpected ecological impacts on the aquatic systems in the south Eurasian permafrost.

AB  - Despite the importance of iteroparity (i.e. repeated spawning) for the viability of Atlantic salmon populations, little is known about the factors influencing the migratory behaviour and survival prospect of post-spawned individuals (kelts). To test the hypothesis that post-spawning nutritional condition underlies differences in spatiotemporal aspects of the habitat use and survival of migrating Atlantic salmon kelts, we physiologically sampled and acoustically tagged 25 individuals from the Middle River, Nova Scotia in autumn 2015. Kelts were subsequently tracked within their natal river during the winter months, and as far as 650 km away along known migration pathways towards the Labrador Sea and Greenland. Some kelts were detected nearly 2 years later, upon their return to the natal river for repeat spawning. Overall, kelts in poor or depleted post-spawning nutritional state (i.e. low body condition index or plasma triglyceride level): (i) initiated down-river migration earlier than higher condition kelts; (ii) experienced higher overwinter mortality in the natal river; (iii) tended to spend greater time in the estuary before moving to sea and (iv) did not progress as far in the marine environment, with a reduced probability of future, repeat spawning. Our findings suggest that initial differences in post-spawning condition are carried through subsequent migratory stages, which can ultimately affect repeat-spawning potential. These results point to the importance of lipid storage and mobilisation in Atlantic salmon kelts for mediating post-spawning migratory behaviour and survival.

AB  - Grain yield and seed size are key breeding objectives for the chickpea breeding program in Morocco. Six winter-type chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) varieties released between 1992 and 2015, and two candidate lines, were evaluated under different environments in order to study the stubility of grain yield and seed size across locations and to assess the genetic gain.. The varieties and candidates lines were evaluated in field experiments using a randomized complete block design with four replications in 9 different environments. The results showed that in 27 years of breeding, the average value of hundred seed weight improved from 33 to 47 g. Greater genetic progress was made for seed size than for grain yield. Average yearly genetic gains of 1.30 were recorded for seed size. Most varieties had wide adaptation and responded positively to the increase in environmental index. However, differences between varieties in terms of adaptation and stability were observed. A clear increase in seed size, an important market trait for chickpea in Morocco, is observed in the more recent improved genotypes. The improvement in seed size had limited penalty on yield as shown by a joint stable to slightly increasing or decreasing in grain yield thought years of breeding. These results could help draw more attention to the importance of winter-sown chickpea and enhance its adoption in Morocco. The end results could be the enhancement of national food production and security.

AB  - Variation in monthly values of dry tissue mass (DTM) and two different types of condition indices of the bivalve Egeria radiata (Lamarck, 1804) was studied for 32 consecutive months. To quantify the seasonal trajectory of variation these data were fitted to one- and two-compartment sinusoidal models; and also to a quadratic, cubic and quartic models. The cyclic events in the variation of the DTM and both indices of condition were adequately described by the one-compartment sinusoidal model whose parameters are biologically interpretable. The fit of the data is progressively improved as one moves from the quadratic through the cubic to the quartic model whose fit was best. Although biological meaning could be found for the one-compartment sinusoidal model, the biological meaning of the coefficients of the parabolic-based models are obscure. Multiple regression analysis shows that of all the four environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, pH and phytoplankton) tested, temperature has the greatest effect on DTM and one of the condition indices, while pH has the greatest impact on the other condition index. This implies that the two indices are not only intrinsically different, but that they respond to different sets of factors. Inter- and intra-specific comparison of the many recommended 'standard' indices of condition found in the literature, especially with regard to their innate sensitivity to seasonal variation in internal (e.g. stare of gravidity) and external (physicochemical parameters of water) factors is necessary.

AB  - In this study the effect of lead on condition indices of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) together with the accumulation of lead in the soft tissue of mussels, were investigated. Studies showed no significant differences in condition indices (TCI and SCI) among the mussels in control and lead treatments. Mussels condition indices decreased during the experimental period, that it caused by function of time, not by metal accumulation. Besides the metal pollution, other environmental factors, such as food availability, could affect the mussel's condition. In our experiment we removed the effect of food by providing same food availability for mussels in control and lead treatments during the experiment. Therefore lead is the main effective factor on mussel's condition indices. Lead accumulation only observed in the soft tissue of mussels. Significant differences in lead accumulation in each treatment (based on time) and among treatments were observed. Our results suggest that the accumulation of lead in the soft tissue of mussels was affected by exposure time and lead concentration in the ambient water. In each treatment highest accumulation at longest exposure time (15 days) and lowest accumulation at shortest exposure time (5 days) were observed. Besides, among treatments, most accumulation of lead in the soil tissue of mussels at concentration of (455 mu g L-1) and lowest accumulation were observed at concentration of (2 mu g L-1).

AB  - A comparative analysis of the biological activity has been performed in the soils of Transural Bashkiria developing under natural perennial grasses and under sown herbs. It is shown that the structure of the microbial community in the soils under natural perennial grasses (fescue, brome grass, and couch grass) prevents the removal of nitrogen from the ecosystem and favors nitrogen fixation in the microbial pool of the trophic chain. The method of multisubstrate testing points to certain differences between the metabolic potentials of the microbial communities of the soils under natural grasses and sown herbs. The high values of the integral index of health of the microbial system in the soils under natural perennial grasses attests to their efficiency in sustaining the soil fertility.

AB  - To assess the biological effects of the Prestige oil spill (November 2002) on coastal ecosystems, mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were sampled in 22 locations along the coast of Galicia and the Bay of Biscay in April, July and September 2003 and in February, April, July and October 2004. Several cell and tissue-level biomarkers were measured in digestive gland. Flesh condition index and gamete development stages were assessed as supporting parameters. AOX activity, a marker of exposure to peroxisome proliferating compounds including PAHs, was particularly low in Galicia in 2003 and further was markedly increased in several localities in 2004. Values of the labilization period (LP) of the lysosomal membrane were low in all the studied localities, especially in Galicia in 2003. In 2004, LP values raised, evidencing a certain recovery in mussel's health. In agreement, the volume density of basophilic cells was markedly high in 2003 and showed a decreasing trend throughout 2004. Parameters defining the structure of digestive alveoli showed few variations between 2003 and 2004. Significant correlations between several biomarkers and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were found. In conclusion, employed biomarkers detected highest degree of disturbance in areas most impacted by the oil spill (Galicia) and were able to evidence a recovery trend during 2004, related to a decrease in total PAH concentrations in mussels.

AB  - This paper carries out the static bending analysis of symmetric three-layer functionally graded sandwich beams, in which each layer is made from different functionally graded materials, and they are connected by shear connectors due to sliding movement. The finite element formulations are based on Timoshenko's first-order shear deformation beam theory (FSDT) and the finite element method to establish the equilibrium equation of beams. The calculation program is coded in the MATLAB environment, and then verification examples are given out to compare the numerical data of present work with those of exact open sources. The impact of several geometrical and material parameters on the mechanical response of the structure, such as the height-to-length ratio, boundary conditions, volume fraction index, and especially the shear coefficient of connectors, is being explored. When designing and using these types of structures in engineering practice, the computed results can be utilized as a valid reference.

AB  - We observed the behavior and ecology of Chaetodon capistratus infected and uninfected with the ectoparasitic isopod Anilocra chaetadontis to assess whether there may be parasite induced alterations in host biology, host defenses against infection, and/or pathology related to infection. We also examined habitat related differences in infection rates. Infected fish had higher rates of interaction with conspecifics and spent more time in low flow environments (which might improve transmission of juvenile parasites to new hosts). Butterflyfish without isopods were chased more frequently by damselfishes, fed more, and had larger territories. Time spent near conspecifics, and fish condition and gonadosomatic index did not vary between infected and uninfected fish. These results suggest that foureye butterflyfish behavior is altered by the isopod parasite in order for the isopods to more easily gain mates or transmit offspring to new hosts.

AB  - In 2011, the US Environmental Protection Agency and its partners conducted the first National Wetland Condition Assessment at the continental-scale of the conterminous United States. A probability design for site selection was used to allow an unbiased assessment of wetland condition. We developed a vegetation multimetric index (VMMI) as a parsimonious biological indicator of ecological condition applicable to diverse wetland types at national and regional scales. Vegetation data (species presence and cover) were collected from 1138 sites that represented seven broad estuarine intertidal and inland wetland types. Using field collected data and plant species trait information, we developed 405 candidate metrics with potential for distinguishing least disturbed (reference) from most disturbed sites. Thirty-five of the metrics passed range, repeatability, and responsiveness screens and were considered as potential component metrics for the VMMI. A permutation approach was used to calculate thousands of randomly constructed potential national-scale VMMIs with 4, 6, 8, or 10 metrics. The best performing VMMI was identified based on limited redundancy among constituent metrics, sensitivity, repeatability, and precision. This final VMMI had four broadly applicable metrics (floristic quality index, relative importance of native species, richness of disturbance-tolerant species, and relative cover of native monocots). VMMI values and weights from the survey design for probability sites (n=967) were used to estimate wetland area in good, fair, and poor condition, nationally and for each of 10 ecoregion by wetland type reporting groups. Strengths and limitations of the national VMMI for describing ecological condition are highlighted.

AB  - This paper analyzes the influence of mussel physiological conditions on bioaccumulation of organochlorine pollutants. A direct relationship between reproductive stage, lipid content and accumulation of PCBs, DDTs and HCHs was observed. The organochlorine compounds accumulated by mussels cultured in the Ria of Vigo show levels below the limits set by the European legislation for human consumption, ranging between 12.50-58, 2.21-10.80 and 0.50-2.69 mu g kg(-1) dry weight for PCBs, DDTs and HCHs, respectively. Other organochlorine pesticides normally present in estuarine areas, such as hexachlorobenzene (HCB), aldrin, chlordane and nonachlor were not detected. The proportion of PCBs, between 2 and 7 times higher than OCPs, indicates a pollution of predominantly industrial origin in the sampling area. Several molecular indices were used to identify the source of accumulated OCPs by Mytilus, showing recent inputs of technical DDT, mainly in summer-autumn, and continued discharges of lindane. On the other hand, other pesticides containing DDT impurities, such as dicofol, can contribute to DDT pollution in the Ria of Vigo.
   Multivariate analysis suggests the usefulness of including physiological parameters such as the gonad condition index and lipid content of sentinel organisms in environmental biomonitoring of lipophilic pollutants, as well as in the determination of their origin.

AB  - Theoretical bases are offered for the ecological soil standardization presuming the scientific substantiating of the allowable ecological state (quality) of the soil and the allowable anthropogenic impact on it. The modern experience of these bases' application in regulatory-methodological, nature-control, and managerial practices is presented. The criteria are found for determining the levels of the allowable ecological quality of soil and the anthropogenic impact on it. The sources of the anthropogenic impact on the soil are characterized. A unified system of indices of soil quality and anthropogenic impacts and a mechanism for determining the range of the allowable values of these parameters have been developed taking into account the natural conditions and types of land use. Scientific-methodological approaches are proposed that support a certain balance between the allowable ecological status of the soil and the effects on it in connection with the mechanisms of the soil quality control in particular land plots.

AB  - Variability in body condition and energy storage has important implications for fish recruitment and ecosystem structure. Understanding strategies for energy allocation to maintenance, reproduction and growth is essential to evaluate the state of the fish stocks. In this study, we address the energetics dynamics of the annual cycle of anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardines (Sardina pilchardus) in the north-western Mediterranean Sea using indirect and direct condition indices. We assessed and validated the use of morphometric, biochemical and energetic indices for both species. Annual patterns of the relative condition index (Kn), gonadosomatic index (GSI), lipid content (% lipids) and energy density (ED) were linked to the energy allocation strategy. Our results highlight that anchovy mainly rely on income energy to reproduce, while sardine accumulate the energy during the resting period to be used in the reproduction period. Consequently, variability in the lipid content and ED between seasons was lower in anchovy than in sardine. In both species, we observed an early decline in energy reserves in late summer-early fall, which may be related to unfavourable environmental conditions during spring and summer. Regarding the use of different condition indices, both direct indices, lipid content and ED, were highly correlated with Kn for sardine. ED was better correlated with Kn than lipid content for anchovy. For the first time, a relationship between ED of gonads and GSI for sardine and anchovy was provided, highlighting the importance of the energy invested in reproduction. This work provides new insights into the energy dynamics of sardine and anchovy. We also demonstrate which are the most suitable indices to measure changes in the physiological condition of both species, providing tools for the future monitoring of the populations of these two commercially and ecologically important fish species.

AB  - Chromis chromis is a key species in the Mediterranean marine coastal ecosystems where, in summer, recreational boating and its associated noise overlap. Anthropogenic noise could induce behavioural modifications in marine organisms, thereby affecting population dynamics. In the case of an important species for the ecosystem like C. chromis, this could rebound on the community structure. Here, we measured nautical traffic during the summer of 2007 in a Southern Mediterranean Marine Protected Area (MPA) and simultaneously the feeding behaviour of C. chromis was video-recorded, within both the no-take A-zone and the B-zone where recreational use is allowed. Feeding frequencies, escape reaction and school density were analysed. C. chromis specimens were also collected from 2007 to 2008 to evaluate their physiological state using the Body Condition Index as a proxy of feeding efficiency. The MPA was more exploited by nautical tourism during holidays than on weekdays, particularly in the middle of the day. Greater traffic volume corresponded with lower feeding frequencies. The escape reaction was longer in duration (>1 min) when boat passed nearby, while moored boats did not induce an escape response. We found no differences in density between schools in the A-and B-zones and worse body conditions among those individuals inhabiting the B-zone in one area only. Overall, our findings revealed a significant modification of the daily foraging habits of C. chromis due to boat noise, which was slightly buffered by no-take zones established within the MPA.

AB  - Sand was added to the mudflat in a small bay on the southern coast of Korea in,in attempt to create a new habitat for the Manila clam (Tapes philippinarum) in the muddy in tertidal zone. To evaluate whether the newly created sandy habitat was functionally similar to natural ones, seasonal variations in condition. reproductive activity, and biochemical composition of clams in created and natural conditions were compared from May 2000 to October 2001. Clams reared in the newly created and natural habitats had similar patterns and levels with respect to condition and tissue dry weight. Standardized animal condition and tissue dry weight of clams peaked in spring. when protein and carbohydrate reserves were at maximum levels. and declined progressively throughout the summer-autumn period to October, as a result of continuous spawning. Condition and tissue weight were quickly restored during tire winter-spring period. concurrently with accmulation of protein and carbohydrate reserves. Similar biochemical compositions and reproductive Cycles for the clam stocks in the two habitats are likely to be related to their similar environmental conditions. in particular food availability. Comparison of the isotopic signatures of T. philippinarum tissues and potential food resources suggested that food availability in the study area was mostly dependent on resuspension of mcrophytobenthos, along with seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton. These observations clearly show that newly created sandy habitats may provide habitat functions that enable Manila clams to have similar biological cycles to those in natural habitats.

AB  - The land use and land cover pattern of landscapes are key elements of basic landscape structure; accordingly, this pattern has an important role in landscape management, nature conservation and preservation. In Hungary, the naturalness of the vegetation was surveyed between 2003 and 2006, and the vegetation-based Natural Capital Index (NCI) was calculated for almost the entire area of the country. This field-based database gave us the unique opportunity to analyse the statistical connection between the naturalness of the vegetation and the landscape (land cover) pattern on a regional scale. In our study, we analysed the efficiency of the regional-level CORINE Land Cover (CLC) database for the estimation of the naturalness of the vegetation. This connection was analysed at the country scale using every (2272) Flora Mapping Unit (FMU), or 5.5 x 6.5 km quadrate, of Hungary: We calculated the shape-, edge- and size-related landscape indices for all FMUs on a landscape level (including all CLC patches) and a class level (the land cover polygons were classified according to their land cover characteristics and their level of hemeroby). We determined the Spearman's correlations to reveal the statistical connections between the landscape metric parameters and the NCI values. All of the investigated area weighted landscape indices: Main Patch Size, (MPS), Main Fractal Dimension Index, (MFDI), Total Edge (TE), Main Shape Index (MSI) and Number of Shape Characteristic Points (NSCP) on the landscape level showed a significant statistical connection with the NCI, but the sign of its correlation with the NCI contrasted with the findings from previous studies on a larger scale. Our study shows that scale has a strong impact on the sign of the correlation between the naturalness of the vegetation and the landscape structure. On a class level, particularly the shape-related landscape indices of the "Forest and semi-natural areas" showed statistically significant correlations with the NCI. The correlation strongly depended on the method of classification of the CLC polygons. Furthermore, the spatial pattern of the land-cover-type-based CLC polygon categories showed higher correlation values with the NCI than CLC polygon classes, which were categorized according to their hemeroby state. These results show that although the sign of the spatial pattern change in the main land cover classes is scale-dependent, they can be used to estimate the increase or decrease in the naturalness of the vegetation better than the spatial changes of the hemeroby-level-based landscape pattern. We can predict the change in the naturalness of vegetation based on the spatial changes in the land cover pattern.

AB  - Investigating urban environmental conditions, informs us about the unsustainability and excessive degradation of ecological context, which result in rising environmental concerns among the society. Classified information about the status and trends of environmental components is needed as a rational tool to help urban sustainable planning and SOER reports can help provide such information. Preparing the state of environment report (SOER) for cities around the world has become a pervasive action and fortunately Tehran is among pioneer cities in this aspect. This research is based on the results of Tehran's second state of environment report, in which different aspects of environmental problems are investigated in city of Tehran. The results show an increase in environmental loads, which is evident from the rate of land cover change, water consumption and waste production. Degradation of ecological environment in Tehran is severe for soil pollution, biodiversity loss and climate change which can be the result of other environmental factors degradation such as air and water. In the end, according to components of DPSIR causal chain, different responses are proposed that can serve as a framework to develop strategies and action plans for a more efficient environmental planning of city of Tehran. We conclude that DPSIR model can link different aspects and depict the interaction and interconnectedness of different components of environmental issues in urban areas.

AB  - The ongoing encroachment of agricultural activities into natural areas is a growing problem for the ecological condition of streams. Stream ecological condition is best measured using both biotic and abiotic parameters that reflect different channel, riparian zone and catchment aspects. Multiple physical-chemical measures of water quality have long been widely used to represent the environmental conditions of water bodies. More recently, physical habitat structure, catchment land use and land cover have been employed to better understand water body conditions. Both water quality and physical habitat structure metrics are usually measured in the field and often have strong predictive power to analyze biological assemblage conditions. On the other hand, remote sensing of catchment land use and land cover provide relatively low-cost environmental information at large spatial extents, minimizing the need for fieldwork and reducing analytical time. Given these considerations, our aim in the present study was to evaluate the degree to which stream environmental conditions could be measured reliably via remote sensing. In particular, we assessed whether a remote sensing index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and land use can be used as reliable surrogates for site habitat condition, channel dimensions, and water quality. We found that our remote sensing variables were not sufficient for predicting stream water quality or habitat structure. Therefore, we recommend using remote sensing indicators only when it is impossible to measure water quality and habitat structure in the field directly. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the trophic structure and composition of the ichthyofauna in streams from non-urbanized and urbanized areas in two municipalities with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. We sampled fish fauna in nine pool-run stretches, four located in urban and five in non-urban areas. We adapted a physical habitat index (PHI) that summarized the physical attributes of the habitat, and a fish-based biotic integrity index (IBI) for the trophic structure of fish assemblage. Higher median scores of habitat parameters characterized non-urban stretches owing to better riparian vegetation and shading, bank stability and larger substrates. Diversity, richness and evenness indexes, as well as the abundance and biomass comparison (ABC), did not differ between urban and non-urban areas. The PHI was significantly correlated with the IBI and a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis showed differences in the composition of the ichthyofauna. These results illustrated a common process in fish assemblages subjected to environmental impact, in which the generalist species replaced more specialist species, altering the species composition but maintaining a similar community structure. In general, the species responses were dependent on their trophic plasticity and foraging habitats. We showed that in a gradient of habitat alteration, species composition and thophic structure are better indicators of degradation than simple diversity indexes. We also discuss the implications of the urbanization in small towns toward changes in the species composition of freshwater fish, and the utilization of biotic and abiotic characteristics to document these changes.

AB  - This study aims to develop a road safety index that combines selected road environmental characteristics in Malaysia. Firstly, 14 indicators that generally portray the Malaysian road environments were selected. Then, the final list of specific indicators for each road network was developed. The indicators were derived based on the specific criteria such as the objectives, method of measurement, quality, and expected outcomes of the indicators that may improve the overall road safety of the Malaysian trunk roads. The Malaysian Federal Road 12 was selected as the study area to assess the applicability of the theory. By employing the principal component analysis, four components were obtained and from the statistical weightage of the indicator in each component, the composite indexes were calculated. The results showed that the sections with low number of reported crashes were not necessarily safe for road users. Instead, poor road environment conditions may be highly hazardous to road users. The presence of heavy vehicles and motorcycles was found to be the main risk factor of crash occurrences on this road. Overall, the crash data may be supplemented with another proactive method in order to get a broader picture of the poor road sections.

AB  - We compared watershed land-use and fish community data between the 1970s and 1990s in 47 small streams in southeastern Wisconsin. Our goal was to quantify effects of increasing urbanization on stream fishes in what had been a predominantly agricultural region. In the 43 test watersheds, mean surface coverage by agricultural lands decreased from 54 percent to 43 percent and urban lands increased from 24 percent to 31 percent between 1970 and 1990. Agriculture dominated the four reference watersheds, but neither agriculture (65-59 percent) nor urban (4.4-4.8 percent) land-uses changed significantly in those watersheds during the study period. From the 1970s to the 1990s the mean number of fish species for the test stream sites decreased 15 percent, fish density decreased 41 percent, and the index of biotic integrity (IBI) score dropped 32 percent. Fish community attributes at the four reference sites did not change significantly during the same period, although density was substantially lower in the 1990s. For both the 1970s and 1990s test sites, numbers of fish species and IBI scores were positively correlated with watershed percent agricultural land coverage and negatively correlated with watershed urban land uses, as indexed by percent effective connected imperviousness. Numbers of fish species per site and IBI scores were highly variable below 10 percent imperviousness, but consistently low above 10 percent. Sites that had less than 10 percent imperviousness and fewer than 10 fish species in the 1970s suffered the greatest relative increase in imperviousness and decline in species number over the study period. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that have found strong negative effects of urban land uses on stream ecosystems and a threshold of environmental dam age at about 10 percent imperviousness. We conclude that although agricultural land uses often degrade stream fish communities, agricultural land impacts are generally less severe than those from urbanization on a per-unit-area basis.

AB  - Migratory birds are exposed to a diverse pathogen fauna by virtue of their long-distance travels. Although the immune system is an organism's primary defense against pathogenic microorganisms, few studies have investigated avian immune function during migration, much less shown seasonal differences in immune function. We describe the immunological condition of three intercontinental migratory species, Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Veery (C. fuscescens), and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) during spring migration. In addition, we compare their immunological condition with conspecifics captured during fall migration and during the breeding season to provide a frame of reference for the spring immunological data. Measures of immunological condition presented include total leukocyte count heterophil:lymphocyte (H:L) ratio, heterophil and lymphocyte counts, hematocrit and IgG titers. In addition, we assessed each bird's energetic condition by measuring body mass and calculating a size-corrected condition index. Migrating birds had lower leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, lower hematocrit, reduced fat stores, and higher H:L ratios relative to nonmigrating individuals sampled during the breeding season. We also found that birds sampled during spring migration had lower lymphocyte counts and reduced fat stores, and higher heterophil counts and H:L ratios than fall migrants. Our results suggest that migrating birds are immunocompromised compared with conspecifics during the breeding season. Furthermore, compared with conspecifics sampled after a shorter overland flight, migrants sampled after crossing the Gulf of Mexico exhibited higher H:L ratios, which is indicative of heightened energetic stress.

AB  - During the last years, ingestion of microplastics (MPs) has been quantified in marine species both with an ecological and commercial interest at sea and under experimental conditions, highlighting the importance to assess MP ingestion in commercially and aquaculture important species such as gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) fish. In order to study the ingestion of MPs in a commercially valuable species, gilthead seabreams were exposed to an enriched diet with virgin and weathered low-density polyethylene (LDPE) pellets for three months followed by a detoxification period of one month of no exposure to MP enriched diets. Our results indicate that MP ingestion in these fishes increased with exposure time, and differences were found between treatments, showing the highest ingestion values after three months of exposure to MP enriched diets and in the weathered treatment. However, after one month of detoxification, no MPs were found in the gastrointestinal tracts of fish, reflecting no long-term retention of MPs in Sparus aurata digestive system. According to results from this study, exposure of fish to MP enriched diets does not affect fish size neither the Fulton's condition index as both parameters increased with time in all treatments (control, virgin and weathered). Both carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures decreased with fish size in all treatments which could be related to an increase of nitrogen deposition efficiency in fish muscle with a high protein assimilation during the first months of Sparus aurata. 0 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is recognized as an important index of ecosystem conditions and a key variable of the terrestrial carbon cycle. It also represents the comprehensive effects of climate change and anthropogenic activity on terrestrial vegetation. In this study, the temporal-spatial pattern of NPP for the period 2001-2012 was analyzed using a remote sensing-based carbon model (i.e., the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach, CASA) in addition to other methods, such as linear trend analysis, standard deviation, and the Hurst index. Temporally, NPP showed a significant increasing trend for the arid region of Northwest China (ARNC), with an annual increase of 2.327 g C. Maximum and minimum productivity values appeared in July and December, respectively. Spatially, the NPP was relatively stable in the temperate and warm-temperate desert regions of Northwest China, while temporally, it showed an increasing trend. However, some attention should be given to the northwestern warm-temperate desert region, where there is severe continuous degradation and only a slight improvement trend.

AB  - Fecundity of marine fish species is highly variable, but trade-offs between fecundity and egg quality have rarely been observed at the individual level. We investigated spatial differences in reproductive investment of individual European sprat Sprattus sprattus (Linnaeus 1758) females by determining batch fecundity, condition indices (somatic condition index and gonadosomatic index) as well as oocyte dry weight, protein content, lipid content, spawning batch energy content, and fatty acid composition. Sampling was conducted in five different spawning areas within the Baltic Sea between March and May 2012. Spawning sprat from the Kiel Bight were in a better nutritional condition compared to sprat from the Arkona Basin, Bornholm Basin, and the Gdansk Deep. These females were also producing up to twice as many oocytes, and invested significantly more energy in reproduction, than their counterparts sampled in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea. Still, oocytes produced by Kiel Bight sprat contained significantly lower fractions of the essential fatty acids 20:4 (n-6) and 22:6 (n-3). A seasonal trade-off between oocyte weight/lipid content and fecundity was found for Baltic sprat, albeit the gross energy invested into spawning remained constant. Observed spatial and seasonal differences in sprat reproductive investment may be linked to hydrographic conditions and food availability and will impact the survival probability of yolk-sac and first feeding larvae. These findings indicate that Baltic sprat is able to adapt its reproductive tactics to the highly variable pelagic habitat of the Baltic Sea.

AB  - The family Chironomidae (Diptera) is the most widely distributed, most diverse, and often the most abundant of all families of benthic macroinvertebrates in aquatic ecosystems, including estuaries and other coastal marine ecosystems. Chironomid assemblages are likely to provide a useful measure of biotic integrity in estuaries of Costa Rica, which lack an intensive estuarine bioassessment tool to support environmental monitoring and regulatory programs. We characterized the taxonomic composition of Chironomidae, tested a Chironomidae Index of Biotic Integrity (CIBI) developed from extrinsic pollution tolerance values for its efficacy in evaluating the surface water quality and physical habitat, and made recommendations for increasing the sensitivity of the CIBI to detect differing degrees of stress across a range of estuaries in Costa Rica. Specifically, we selected nine estuaries within six different watersheds across a land use gradient located on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and collected Chironomidae surface-floating pupal exuviae (SFPE) samples biannually for two consecutive years (July 2012, Jan. 2013, July 2013, Jan. 2014). We identified 228 morphospecies and 70 genera from 17 071 Chironomidae pupal exuviae collected from nine estuaries, which ranked in the following order from lowest to highest biotic integrity based on CIBI scores: Estero Negro, Laguna Cuatro, Laguna Jalova, Laguna del Tortuguero, Rio Parismina, Laguna Barra del Colorado, Rio Pacuare, Rio Bananito, and Rio Estrella. The CIBI successfully differentiated between estuaries with poor versus good biotic integrity, indicating that CIBI could be used to evaluate the surface water quality and physical habitat of Costa Rican estuaries. We recommend that future studies refine our approach by developing regionally accurate genus and corresponding species-level tolerance values to improve the sensitivity of the CIBI for biological monitoring of Costa Rican estuaries.

AB  - As amphibians with pronounced biphasic lifestyle, crested newts are dependent on available ponds throughout their breeding season, but data on parameters that influence their abundance and activity is largely lacking. In the present study, we tested the possible effects of five parameters (air and water temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, acidity and oxidative reduction potential) on newt populations from adjacent ponds across two years. Although pond size was different (small vs large), both ponds were temporary, and funnel traps were set each week from the beginning of March until the drying of the ponds. Parameters were measured twice per week (i.e., in the evening and in the following morning) and were checked against the total number of captured newts. A portion of the captured newts was measured and weighted in order to compare newts from both ponds by body condition index (BCI). In addition, cotton swabs were used to collect skin secretion from some of the captured newts, which were tested for the presence of alkaloids. Expectedly, temperature had a pronounced effect on newt activity in both ponds, but levels of dissolved oxygen and oxidative reduction potential had no effect. Acidity was only relevant when higher daily amplitudes were registered, and in that case, it had a negative effect on newt activity. Overall, the large pond presented more stable conditions with male and female newts having a higher BCI compared to those from the small ponds. Although no alkaloids were found in the skin secretions, some of their possible precursors (sterol compounds) were detected.

AB  - How well seabirds compensate for variability in prey abundance and composition near their breeding colonies influences their distribution and reproductive success. We used tufted puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) as forage fish samplers to study marine food webs from the western Aleutian Islands (53 degrees N, 173 degrees E) to Kodiak Island (57 degrees N, 153 degrees W), Alaska, during August 2012-2014. Around each colony we obtained data on: environmental characteristics (sea surface temperature and salinity, seafloor depth and slope, tidal range, and chlorophyll-a), relative forage fish biomass (hydroacoustic backscatter), and seabird community composition and density at-sea. On colonies, we collected puffin chick-meals to characterize forage communities and determine meal energy density, and measured chicks to obtain a body condition index. There were distinct environmental gradients from west to east, and environmental variables differed by ecoregions: the (1) Western-Central Aleutians, (2) Eastern Aleutians, and, (3) Alaska Peninsula. Forage fish biomass, species richness, and community composition all differed markedly between ecoregions. Forage biomass was strongly correlated with environmental gradients, and environmental gradients and forage biomass accounted for similar to 50% of the variability in at-sea density of tufted puffins and all seabird taxa combined. Despite the local and regional variability in marine environments and forage, the mean biomass of prey delivered to puffin chicks did not differ significantly between ecoregions, nor did chick condition or puffin density at-sea. We conclude that puffins can adjust their foraging behavior to produce healthy chicks across a wide range of environmental conditions. This extraordinary flexibility enables their overall success and wide distribution across the North Pacific Ocean.

AB  - Marine invertebrate microbiota has a key function in host physiology and health. To date, knowledge about bivalve microbiota is poorly documented except public health concerns. This study used a molecular approach to characterize the microbiota associated with the bivalve Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) by determining (1) the difference among organs either or not under the influence of host habitat, (2) small-scale variability of microbiota, and (3) the experimental response of the Manila clam microbiota submitted to different lateral transmissions. These questions were investigated by sampling two groups of individuals living in contrasting habitats and carrying out a transplant experiment. Manila clam microbiota (i.e., bacterial community structure) was determined at organ-scale (gills, gut, and a pool of remaining tissues) by capillary electrophoresis DNA fingerprinting (CE fingerprinting). The Manila clam microbiota structure differed among organs indicating a selection of Manila clam microbiota at organ scale. Habitat strongly influenced gill and gut microbiota. In contrast, microbiota associated with remaining tissues was similar between group individuals suggesting that these communities are mostly autochthonous, i.e., Manila clam specific. Transplant experiment showed that improving living condition did not induce any change in microbiota associated with remaining tissues. In contrast, the reduction in individual habitat quality led to individuals in declining health as strongly suggested by the increase in phagocytosis activity and decrease in condition index together with the change in internal organ microbiota. This study provides a first description of the Manila clam holobiont which can withstand disturbance and respond opportunistically to improved environmental conditions.

AB  - Soil physical condition following tillage influences crop yield, but the desired condition cannot be adequately evaluated with current techniques. This study was conducted to determine a soil condition index (SCI) that could be used to select the type of implement needed to achieve an optimal seedbed with minimum energy input. Effects of bulk density, moisture content, and penetration resistance resulting from three tillage systems (no-till, chisel plow and moldboard plow), on the growth of corn (Zea mays L.) were studied. The experiment was conducted in Boone County, Ames, IA, on soils that are mostly Aquic Hapludolls, Typic Haplaquolls and Typic Hapludolls with slopes ranging from 0 to 5%. The results are from the 2000 season, which had normal weather conditions and yield levels for the Iowa state. The average corn grain yield at this site was 9.36 Mg/ha. At the V2 cor growth stage, the average dry biomass was 1.34 g per plant. The soil physical properties were normalized with respect to reference values and combined via multiple regression analysis against corn biomass at V2 stage into the SCI. Mean SCI values for the no-till, chisel and moldboard plow treatments were 0.86, 0.76, and 0,73, respectively, all with a standard error of 0.0127. The lower the SCI, the more optimum the soil physical conditions. An analysis of variance showed significant differences among mean SCI for each treatment (p-value = 0.001). The use of the SO could improve the tillage decision-making process in environments similar the one studied. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The egg, three larval instars and pupa of Hesperus rufipennis (Gravenhorst) are described for the first time, with the illustrations of structural features provided. Differences in the morphological structure of its larval instars (L1-3) cover: the number of setae on profemur and protibia, number of setae on tarsungulus, chaetotaxy of abdominal tergites, the structure of antenna and urogomphi, body colour and measurements. Diagnostic characters of immature stages of H. rufipennis are listed. Modifications of the keys to known eggs, larvae and pupa of the European Staphylininae species are proposed. Some data on its biology (life cycle, duration of immature stages, ecological preferences) are also given. It is a univoltine species with summer larvae and wintering imagines. Considering its environmental preferences and biology, this rove beetle may be of essential importance as a good umbrella species and environmental state indicator as well.

AB  - The decadal variability of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies, as well as the response of global land vegetation and marine fisheries, are investigated for three periods: 1982-1988, 1989-1998, and 1999-2008, separated by the 1988-89 and 1998-99 regime shifts. The goal is to develop a global-scale ecosystem concept to support an improved understanding of the corresponding changes in atmospheric, oceanic, and biological responses. The analysis is based on global SST, SLP, precipitable water content (PWC), land vegetation condition index (VCI), and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) fish capture data. The results show that SST and SLP displayed significant decadal variability. The decadal variability of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) associated with sea level pressure anomalies (SLPA) has an influence on the land vegetation moisture condition (VCI). Positive SSTA tends to be associated with negative SLPA, and vice versa, in the corresponding ocean areas and most land areas. Consequently, clearly opposing distributions of SSTA and SLPA are observed in the periods 1982-1988 and 1999-2008. With positive SSTA and negative SLPA, VCI tends to increase in value representing more favourable vegetation conditions. Negative SSTA and positive SLPA is generally unfavourable for global vegetation development. The decadal variability of SSTA is closely related to the number of fish species (NFS) doing better or worse based on normalized fish landing data. However, the fishery responses show different yet consistent trends in the three ocean basins. When SSTA is negative, it appears more beneficial for the number of fish species with improved landings in the Atlantic Ocean. However, positive SSTA leads to more fish species with improved landings in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

AB  - Streams and rivers are globally threatened ecosystems because of increasing levels of exploitation, habitat degradation and other anthropogenic pressures. In the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) in East Africa, these threats are mostly caused by unsustainable land use; however, the monitoring of ecological integrity of river systems has been hampered by a lack of locally developed indices. This study assessed the health of four rivers (Nzoia, Nyando, Sondu-Miriu and Mara) on the Kenyan side of the LVB using physicochemical water quality parameters and a fish-based index of biotic integrity (IBI). Fish tolerance ranking was derived from principal component analysis of water quality parameters, and the concept of niche breadth (NB). The relationship between fish species and water quality parameters was examined with canonical correspondence analysis, whereas community metrics and stressors were evaluated through Pearson network correlation analysis. Fish species richness, trophic structures, taxonomic composition and species tolerance were used to generate the metrics for fish-based IBI. NB showed that most of the fish species were moderately tolerant to poor water. Moderately tolerant and intolerant fish species were negatively correlated with a high level of organic loading in the Mara River. Fish-based IBI scores for the rivers ranged from 26 to 34, with Sondu-Miriu scoring the lowest. Our results show that the cumulative effect of stressors can adequately rank fish species tolerance according to the disturbance gradients and further develop regional metrics to assess river health. Despite the fact that fish communities are declining, continual management and enforcement of environmental regulations are important, with conservation and management of headwaters and low-order streams being essential while they are still species rich.

AB  - The objective of the present study is to examine the growth and energetic performance of juvenile turbot after exposure to contaminated sediment and during the subsequent recovery period with or without food limitation. We designed a two- step experiment by first exposing juvenile turbot to harbour sediment for 26 days and then transferring them to clean sea water with different frequencies of feeding for 35 days. Without food limitation, fish previously exposed to contaminated sediment compensated for weight, length and lipid reserve losses; we did not record any differences in size, Fulton's K condition index and triacylglycerol/sterol (TAG/ST) ratio after the 35-day depuration period compared to the reference fish. This result could be related to the compensatory growth mechanism observed in a wide range of fish species following a period of growth depression. With food limitation during the 35-day depuration period, recovery growth was not sufficient to restore length and weight values similar to the reference fish. Moreover, turbot previously exposed to contaminated sediment and subsequently fed twice or once a week exhibited extremely low TAG/ST ratios, but the reference fish submitted to the same restrictive feeding conditions did not. This study indicates that juvenile fish affected by chemical pollution can improve their biological performance if pollution events are followed by a period of abundant food. However, if pollution events occur during periods of food scarcity, e.g. in winter, storage of energy reserves will be compromised.

AB  - The present manuscript surveys the validity of economic performance per capita - Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions equivalent relationship covering the sector of agriculture for three Mediterranean countries, (France, Portugal and Spain). The value added generated by agriculture as index for economic performance, along with an index of environmental degradation (carbon emissions equivalent/1000 ha of utilized agricultural area) are the data on which the methodology of Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing is employed. According to our findings the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is validated in the case of all sample countries, while conflict results are taken for the short run. The conflict results derived may well be attributed to different socio - economic conditions confronted by domestic farmers including the greenhouse gas emissions mitigation cost. Therefore, the policy measures already implemented in the sample countries may lead to limitation of carbon emissions generated by agriculture but still a lot have to be done in order the objectives set by Kyoto protocol to be fulfilled.

AB  - High antifeedancy and low toxicity of the plant preparation Neem (azadirachtin), on the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L. larvae were proved under laboratory conditions. A high index of Neem antifeedancy was confirmed in all tested concentrations.
   Under laboratory conditions the Neem had satisfying antifeedancy on Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say third instar larvae too. Field experiments also proved that the foliage protective effect of Neem was very significant.
   Experiments showed that some antifeedants or repellents, such as Neem, should control olygophagous (L. decemlineata, Coleoptera) insects as well as very polyphagous insects such as L. dispar (Lepidoptera).
   As a biological, plant-derived preparation, Neem could be suitable for integrated pest management (IPM) programs, especially in small orchards, parks, and tree rows in urban environments and on small private gardens.

AB  - The Ria Formosa lagoon is an ecosystem whose water quality reflects the anthropogenic influence upon the surrounding areas. In this lagoon, the clam Ruditapes decussatus has a great economical importance and has been widely used as a biomonitor. A multibiomarker approach (delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, metallothionein, lipid peroxidation, acetylcholinesterase, alkali-labile phosphates, DNA damage) was applied to assess the environmental quality of this ecosystem and the accumulation of contaminants and their potential adverse effects on clams. Clams were sampled in different shellfish beds in the period between July 2007 and December 2008 and abiotic parameters (temperature, salinity, pH and dissolved oxygen of seawater and organic matter in the sediment), condition index, metals (Cd, Cu, Zn, Ni, Pb), TBTs and PAHs concentrations were measured in clam tissues. Data was integrated using Principal Component Analyses and biomarker indices: IBR (Integrated Biomarker Response) and HSI (Health Status Index). This multibiomarker approach enabled discrimination of a time and space trend between sites with different degrees of anthropogenic contamination, identifying one of them (site 2) as the most stressful and summer months as the most critical period for clams due to an increase of environmental stress (anthropogenic pressure along with extreme environmental conditions, e.g. temperature, dissolved oxygen, organic matter in the sediments, etc). The selected biomarkers provided an integrated response to assess the environmental quality of the system, proving to be a useful approach when complex mixtures of contaminants occur.

AB  - Changes in oceanic circulation and productivity patterns near Central America have been explained using numerous different tools, such as tectonics, geochemistry and micropaleontology. This paper aims to contribute to this discussion through the study of dinoflagellates and palynofacies in the drill core from DSDP Site 153. Based on foraminiferal data, the studied section is divided into the middle and upper Miocene, and our dinoflagellate events also support an age model of similar to 15 to 8 Ma. IndVal, ecological indexes, and the (P/G) dinoflagellate ratios were used to develop paleoenvironmental inferences. The indicator species are Operculodinium centrocarpum and Tectatodinium pellitum for the MM1 interval, Spiniferites spp. and Impagidinium strialatum for MM2, and Selenopemphix armageddonensis, Lejeunecysta spp. and L. tenella for UM3. Intervals MM1 and MM2 are characterized by a dominance of gonyaulacoids, and inner to outer neritic environments. The UM3 interval is interpreted as an outer neritic environment in the base/middle portion, and inner neritic in the uppermost part, with a shift from gonyaulacoid to peridinioid dominance, suggesting an increase in productivity. During the middle Miocene, productivity is low due to intermittent marine circulation restrictions in the Caribbean Sea, and there is a slight increase during the upper Miocene following reestablishment of the global oceanic circulation. This is directly connected to the occurrence of geotectonic and paleoceanographic events in the region during the Miocene, mainly by mass movements such as the Panama gateway and the opening of the Pedro Channel to the north, changing the surface conditions in the Caribbean Sea.

AB  - The endobenthic bivalves are widely used as a bioindicators since they inhabit the sediment-water interface and are able to accumulate a different kind of contaminants. In the present work, we evaluated wild Corbicula largillierti (Phillippi, 1844) as a bioindicator of water quality in the central region of Argentina. The responses at different levels of the biological organization were used. We measured organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) levels in water and clams tissues. The biomarkers selected were enzymatic activities (Glutathione S-Transferase, Catalase, Acetyl-, Butytyl-cholinesterase, and Carboxyleste rase) morphometry of the digestive gland, condition index and morphology of valves. In order to integrate all the responses a multivariate analysis and integrated stress index were applied. Our results showed the presence of contaminants along the studied river and the ability of C. largillierti to bioaccumulate them. All the biomarkers selected varied according to the water quality gradient, although there was no specific:correlation with OCPs and PCBs levels. At the most polluted sites, the detoxification and oxidative stress enzymes, the morphometric analysis of the digestive gland and the variation in the morphology of the valves indicated the water quality degradation. The multivariate analyses allowed to discriminate the sites according to the different biomarker responses. The IBR index also showed a variation pattern according to the environmental quality gradient along the basin. According to the responses shown by C. largillierti we suggest this species as an useful bioindicator of aquatic pollution. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Qehan Lake Basin is located in the north of the Otindag Sandy Land, where the fragile eco-environment is sensitive to climate change and human activity. We analyzed land cover change and the concomitant processes of ecological change based on multispectral scanning (MSS), thematic mapper (TM), and enhanced TM (ETM+) images. The results showed that from 1977 to 2000, the area of dune sand increased significantly by 840.2 km(2), while the area of high cover grassland (HCGL), medium cover grassland (MCGL), and low cover grassland (LCGL) reduced by 140.6, 207.3, and 463.3 km(2), respectively. Additionally, the area of wetland decreased by 112.9 km(2). During the period of 1977 to 2000, the land cover condition index (LCCI) reached a low of 27.7, which indicated serious eco-environmental challenges in the Qehan Lake watershed. However, the process of desertification was reversed, and vegetation cover was gradually restored after 2000. From 2000 to 2013, the area of LCGL increased by 369.2 km(2) (13.4%), while the area of dune sand decreased by 560.1 km(2) (29.4%). The LCCI improved to reach 29.18 in 2013, demonstrating a significant eco-environmental improvement. Although climate change, human activity, and ecological policies have together determined the scope and extent of desertification in the watershed, the most fundamental factor in the restoration of vegetation was precipitation.

AB  - Most Andean mountain streams of the Orinoco Basin in Venezuela, had been suffering various disturbances. In spite of this, fish communities have been poorly evaluated in terms of spatial and temporal gradients. Thus, the generation of information about these communities is a priority, since it may support conservation of regional hydrobiological resources. For this, six sites were monthly evaluated in tributaries of upper Turbio River in Sierra de Portuguese (770-1 305msnm), during the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season (January-April 2012); we characterized stream dimensions, substrate and water physicochemical variables. Electrofishing was used to determine the number and abundance of fish species. The fish communities and their stability were evaluated by exploring the changes in richness and abundance, coefficients of variation, hierarchical classification and non-metrical multidimensional scaling analysis. The sites conservation status was estimated with a habitat integrity index. Our results showed that richness of the 12 species found varied according to the mountain elevation, the tributaries and the conservation status of the sites. Chaetostoma dorsale, Creagrutus taphorni and Chaetostoma milesi comprised 90.8% of the relative abundance, and maintained the first ranks during the study period. The communities had little spatio-temporal variation which was associated with a gradient signed principally by the amount of shadow, rocks and gravel cover, water temperature and conductivity. Stability was moderate but varied with elevation and according to site conservation status. The tributaries in upper Turbio River were found to be under severe impacts and their fishes were found impoverished and at risk.

AB  - The competence of reservoir hosts of vector-borne pathogens is directly linked to its capacity to infect the vector. Domestic dogs and cats are major domestic reservoir hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi, and exhibit a much higher infectiousness to triatomines than seropositive humans. We quantified the concentration of T. cruzi DNA in the peripheral blood of naturally-infected dogs and cats (a surrogate of intensity of parasitemia), and evaluated its association with infectiousness to the vector in a high-risk area of the Argentinean Chaco. To measure infectiousness, 44 infected dogs and 15 infected cats were each exposed to xenodiagnosis with 10-20 uninfected, laboratory-reared Triatoma infestans that blood-fed to repletion and were later individually examined for infection by optical microscopy. Parasite DNA concentration (expressed as equivalent amounts of parasite DNA per mL, Pe/mL) was estimated by real-time PCR amplification of the nuclear satellite DNA. Infectiousness increased steeply with parasite DNA concentration both in dogs and cats. Neither the median parasite load nor the mean infectiousness differed significantly between dogs (8.1 Pe/mL and 48%) and cats (9.7 Pe/mL and 44%), respectively. The infectiousness of dogs was positively and significantly associated with parasite load and an index of the host's body condition, but not with dog's age, parasite discrete typing unit and exposure to infected bugs in a random-effects multiple logistic regression model. Real-time PCR was more sensitive and less time-consuming than xenodiagnosis, and in conjunction with the body condition index, may be used to identify highly infectious hosts and implement novel control strategies.

AB  - It is not known whether and by what factors spatial heterogeneity in mussels (Mytilus edulis L.) affects mussel production in human-created mussel beds. In a field experiment, the same number of mussels was relayed on four different areas within plots of the same size, resulting in four treatments with different mussel densities. Density, individual weight and spatial structure of mussels were followed per treatment. The uniformly placed mussels on different areas redistributed into new patches, but mussels did not spread out over a larger area. Initial mussel density affected redistribution and mussel survival. At high densities mussels redistributed into a uniform matrix or in a few larger patches, that showed larger losses than at low densities, where mussels redistributed into a high number of patches. Growth rate and condition index of the mussels did not differ between treatments and no relation was found between treatment and number of foraging shore crabs, which was the major predator of mussels in this experiment. We hypothesise that the relation between initial mussel density and mussel loss after relaying is associated with redistribution, with less competition for space when mussels are positioned at the edge of a mussel patch. The very high mussel losses that we observed in the experiment within four weeks after relaying were the major factor in biomass development. Mussel bed formation concerns mussel growers and managers involved in natural mussel bed restoration. Initial mussel survival determines the success of these activities. The present study shows the effects of mussel relaying on spatial redistribution for the first time under field conditions, and underlines the importance of edge effects in understanding mussel loss in redistribution. Mussel survival after relaying will be higher when the mussels are distributed homogeneously and in relatively low density. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Genetic variation and phenotypic stability in Norway spruce were studied based on provenances, families, and clones planted in trials at 12 sites in four Nordic countries. The families were generated in a factorial cross between 10 parents of Norwegian origin and 10 parents of Eastern European origin, and the clones were propagated from seedlings within 20 of the same families. Traits analyzed were survival, proportion of trees with stem defects, and tree heights. Stability was analyzed by regression analyses with the genetic entries' annual shoot increment as the dependent variable and the total site mean as an environmental index. Information about growth and phenology traits were available from short-term tests. For tree heights, significant variance components were present both among female and male parents, but not for their interactions, indicating that non-additive genetic effects are small. Genotype x environment interactions were significant at all three genetic levels, but their variance components had considerably lower values than the variance components estimated for the effects of families and clones. For the set of families of Norwegian origin, strong relationships were observed between the timing of annual shot elongation, mortality, and height growth. Large variation was found at all three genetic levels for phenotypic stability measured by regression coefficients. A positive relationship was present between the regression coefficient and the timing of annual shoot growth for families, indicating that later flushing families responded more to a high site index. The regression coefficient can be a useful supplement to the breeding value when selecting for superior and stable genotypes.

AB  - In order to test the habitat harshness hypothesis (HHH) the reproductive biology of Donax hanleyanus was studied histologically, comparing populations from three beaches with contrasting morphodynamics (dissipative, intermediate and reflective) over 25 months. The reproductive phase of D. hanleyanus was extended at the reflective beach compared to the other two. Males and females from the dissipative and intermediate beaches were significantly smaller and had lower biomass at maturity than those at the reflective beach. Recruits were significantly more abundant and the recruitment period was extended significantly at the dissipative beach. Spawning events took place twice each year at the dissipative (early spring and spring-summer) and the intermediate beach (winter and summer), whereas continuous gamete releases were noted at the reflective beach. Size and biomass at first maturity were lower at the dissipative beach, whereas monthly mean abundance of D. hanleyanus was higher at the reflective beach. The gametogenic cycle correlated significantly with sea-surface temperature, relative spermatozoon abundance, condition index, ash-free shell-free dry mass, and mean size and abundance of oocytes, for all three populations. At the population level, many of these reproductive responses to physical variables were opposite to those predicted by the HHH, including: greater abundance, extended reproductive cycle, extended period with spawning individuals, and larger size and higher biomass at first maturity at the reflective beach. This suggested that the hypothesis of habitat safety (HHS), originally proposed for supralittoral species, may be extended to intertidal species; a combination of narrow swashes and steep slopes makes reflective beaches a safer and more stable environment for intertidal species such as D. hanleyanus.

AB  - Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is an invasive species that has proliferated in European and North American rivers and lakes during the last century. In this study, D. polymorpha has been used to provide information on contamination levels and biological effects in the Seine Estuary (France). The bivalves accumulated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to a high degree with values reaching 800 ng/g dry weight for PCBs (sum of 20 congeners), and 1,000 ng/g dry weight of PAHs (sum of 14 compounds) in the whole body. These values are among the highest reported of PCBs and, to a lesser extent, of PAHs in other contaminated areas in the world. Toxic equivalent quantities of PCBs and PAHs detected in zebra mussels varied from 20 to 40 pg dioxin equivalents/g dry weight for PCBs and up to 120 ng benzo[alpha]pyrene equivalents/g dry weight for PAHs, indicating a high potential risk for animals feeding on them. Biological impacts, such as altered condition index, decreased lysosomal stability, and high levels of multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) proteins also were detected in mussels living downstream of Rouen, the main city of the Seine Estuary. Taken together, these results indicate that the Seine Estuary is a heavily polluted area with the potential to cause deleterious health effects in some endogenous living organisms. This study also shows that chemical and biological measurements bring different but complementary results that can help diagnose environmental health.

AB  - Commercial fishing generally removes large and old individuals from fish stocks, reducing mean age and age diversity among spawners. It is feared that these demographic changes lead to lower and more variable recruitment to the stocks. A key proposed pathway is that juvenation and reduced size distribution causes reduced ranges in spawning period, spawning location, and egg buoyancy; this is proposed to lead to reduced spatial distribution of fish eggs and larvae, more homogeneous ambient environmental conditions within each year-class, and reduced buffering against negative environmental influences. However, few, if any, studies have confirmed a causal link from spawning stock demographic structure through egg and larval distribution to year class strength at recruitment. We here show that high mean age and size in the spawning stock of Barents Sea cod (Gadus morhua) is positively associated with high abundance and wide spatiotemporal distribution of cod eggs. We find, however, no support for the hypothesis that a wide egg distribution leads to higher recruitment or a weaker recruitment-temperature correlation. These results are based on statistical analyses of a spatially resolved data set on cod eggs covering a period (1959-1993) with large changes in biomass and demographic structure of spawners. The analyses also account for significant effects of spawning stock biomass and a liver condition index on egg abundance and distribution. Our results suggest that the buffering effect of a geographically wide distribution of eggs and larvae on fish recruitment may be insignificant compared with other impacts.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to document and interpret urban-rural differences in mortality in the past. To this end, we used data on mortality in Wielko-polska, Poland, in the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century. The data on mortality in rural areas (N = 1,173,910 deceased), small towns (N = 573,903 deceased), and Poznan, the capital of the Wielkopolska region (N = 86,352 deceased), were gathered from original Prussian statistical yearbooks (Preussische Statistik). Causes of death were also analyzed (rural areas, N = 449,576 deceased; small towns, N = 238,365 deceased; Poznan, N = 61,512 deceased). Mortality measures such as crude death rate (CDR), infant death rate (IDR), and neonatal and postneonatal death rates were calculated. Life tables were constructed for both stationary and stable population models and measures of the opportunity for natural selection calculated (Crow's index I-m, potential gross reproduction rate R-pot, and biological state index I-bs). Relative frequencies of leading causes of death were computed. Stratification depending on the place of residence was evident in all mortality measures as well as in the values of the life tables and the measures of the opportunity for natural selection, but it was reverse of what is observed today in developed countries. In Poznan (a large industrial city), the mortality situation was the least favorable. It was caused by large population density, lack of water supply and sewage systems (up to 1896), and bad working conditions. The values of CDR ranged between 26.89-31.46, and IDR between 190.6-280.5. Newborn life expectancy (for ka stable population model) was 31.6 years, I-m = 0.79, R-pot = 0.85, and I-bs = 0.47. The most common causes of death were tuberculosis, other diseases of the respiratory and circulatory systems, dysentery and diarrhea, and cancer. These diseases were less common in rural areas, so they had the most favorable values of mortality measures (CDR between 22.87-27.32, IDR between 181.8-219.4, life expectancy of newborn e(o) = 42.12, I-m = 0.55, R-pot = 0.93, I-bs = 0.60). Infectious diseases (other than tuberculosis), frailty at birth, and frailty in old age were the most frequent causes of death in rural areas. Small towns (population < 20,000) had a mortality intermediate between city and rural areas. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The use of biomarkers as early-warning signals to assess the impact of pollutants and other environmental stressors in coastal habitats has been internationally recognized as a useful tool in marine coastal monitoring. We propose a similar approach to verify the welfare of edible shellfish, Ruditapes philippinarum, thus exploiting its possible application as an effective tool to verify the origin of fishing/aquaculture products. A selected battery of biomarkers was chosen and applied to organisms from two different habitats in the Lagoon of Venice (a farming site and a natural area where fishing is currently banned, because of pollution problems) and from a local market. Biological responses were evaluated physiologically (survival in air test and condition index), behaviourally (reburrowing rate), and histochemically (quantification of neutral lipids and lipofuscin). Micropollutants (heavy metals, PCBs, and PAHs) were also determined in the soft tissues. Results indicated clams from the farming site were in the best condition with regard to both chemical and biological measurements. In contrast, the market sample contained the highest concentrations of PAHs. PCBs and heavy metals varied slightly and quite irregularly among the three samples. The worst values of the biomarkers were observed for clams collected at the polluted site, where, in particular, the lowest physiological and behavioural indexes and the highest accumulation of lipofuscin in the digestive tissue were recorded.

AB  - The goal of biological monitoring programs is to determine impairment classification and identify local stressors. Biological monitoring performs well at detecting impairment but when used alone falls short of determining the cause of the impairment. Following detection a more thorough survey is often conducted using extensive biological, chemical, and physical analysis coupled with exhaustive statistical treatments. These methods can be prohibitive for small programs that are limited by time and budget. The objective of this study was to develop a simple and useful model to predict the probability of biological impairment based on routinely collected habitat assessments. Biological communities were assessed with the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), and habitat was assessed with the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index. Two models were constructed from a validation dataset. The first predicted a binary outcome of impaired (IBI < 35) or non-impaired (IBI a parts per thousand yen 35) and the second predicted a categorical gradient of impairment. Categories include very poor, poor, fair, good, and excellent. The models were then validated with an independently collected dataset. Both models successfully predicted biological integrity of the validation dataset with an accuracy of 0.84 (binary) and 0.75 (categorical). Based on the binary outcome model, 22 sites were observed to be impaired while the model predicted them to not be impaired. The categorical model misclassified 47 samples while only seven of those were misclassified by two or more categories. The impairment source was subsequently identified by known stressors. The models developed here can be easily applied to other datasets from the Eastern Corn Belt Plain to aid in stressor identification by predicting the probability of observing an impaired fish community based on habitat. Predicted probabilities from the models can also be used to support conclusions that have already been determined.

AB  - Over 3 years, 32,444 age-0 group Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr tagged with passive integrated transponder tags throughout the River Frome catchment were assigned to one of three groups, nonmigrants, autumn migrants and spring smolts, depending on the detection and the timing of detection at downstream tag readers (situated 8.6 km above the tidal limit). We examined the effect of density at the time of tagging (n center dot m-2), distance upstream from the tidal limit (km), fish length (mm), Fulton condition index, habitat type (divided into two types, main river and carrier), days after 1 September that each fish was tagged and year (replication) on the proportions of fish in each of the migration groups. Distance upstream from tidal limit was strongly negatively related to the proportion of autumn migrants and positively related to the proportion of spring smolts. Nonmigrants had a lower average body size than migrants, although there were no differences in the sizes of autumn migrants and spring smolts in September prior to migration. Fish density had no effect on migration strategy. A lower proportion of fish migrated as autumn migrants from the smaller carrier habitats than the main river channel. There is some evidence that those parr destined to become autumn migrants underwent a lower mortality rate during September before tagging than those destined to become spring migrants indicating possible physiological or behavioural differences between these two groups of fish at that time. More research into the factors responsible for initiating the autumn migration is required.

AB  - There are few data on Crassostrea virginica physiological rates across the range of salinities and temperatures to which they are regularly exposed, and this limits the applicability of growth and production models using these data. The objectives of this study were to quantify, in winter (17 degrees C) and summer (27 degrees C), the clearance and oxygen consumption rates of C. virginica from Louisiana across a range of salinities typical of the region (3, 6, 9, 15 and 25). Salinity and season (temperature and reproduction) affected C. virginica physiology differently; salinity impacted clearance rates with reduced feeding rates at low salinities, while season had a strong effect on respiration rates. Highest clearance rates were found at salinities of 9-25, with reductions ranging from 50 to 80 and 90 to 95% at salinities of 6 and 3, respectively. Oxygen consumption rates in summer were four times higher than in winter. Oxygen consumption rates were within a narrow range and similar among salinities in winter, but varied greatly among individuals and salinities in summer. This likely reflected varying stages of gonad development. Valve movements measured at the five salinities indicated oysters were open 50-60% of the time in the 6-25 salinity range and similar to 30% at a salinity of 3. Reduced opening periods, concomitant with narrower valve gap amplitudes, are in accord with the limited feeding at the lowest salinity (3). These data indicate the need for increased focus on experimental determination of optimal ranges and thresholds to better quantify oyster population responses to environmental changes.

AB  - The well-to-wheels assessment is widely used in the automotive sector to analyze the efficiency and competitiveness of different powertrain/fuel options. The paper proposes a global index that takes into account both the energy and environmental aspects on an uniform basis, through the assignment of the costs associated to the energy and to the pollutant emissions. The European market is analyzed and other pollutants (NO,,. PM and SON) are added to the traditional well-to-wheels evaluations (energy and GHG). The proposed well-to-wheels global index offers a useful place-list that takes into account both energy and environmental aspects and, at the current market conditions, it results that the energy cost prevails (70-85%) over the environmental costs, and among the analyzed external costs, the main contribution is due to the GHG emissions. Natural gas-derived fuels seem to be the most promising. The global index for battery electric vehicle from a European mix are closely linked to the driving range. Conventional biofuels are very critical at present, while significant improvement of the well-to-wheels global index is foreseen for when new generation biofuels will be mature (2030 forecast). In short, even though the proposed global index is not an exhaustive index, it could be a useful tool for decision makers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present, study carried out in Haryana, explores potential of MODIS data for scaling constant light use efficiency (epsilon(star)) for computing the net primary productivity (NPP) of wheat crop following Monteith's concept. We compared three scaling approaches epsilon(star) in time and space by using three different MODIS derived surface wetness indices, i.e. vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI), water deficit index (WDI) and land surface wetness index (LSWI). The approach using MODIS observations allows estimation of temporal evolution and geographical distribution of NPP of wheat in Haryana. High levels of seasonal NPP in wheat were observed in northern districts of Kaithal, Kurushretra and Fatehabad compared to districts in southern and western Haryana. Among three water stress scalars, the seasonal NPP simulated with LUE (LSWI) was higher in the magnitude (950-1200 g DM m(-2)) and mean NPP (1030 g DM m(-2)). Further, simulated NPP of wheat with LUE (LSWI) had good agreement with observed crop NPP of wheat (R-2=0.39, RMSE=64.9 g DM m(-2)) compared to simulated NPP with LUE (VTCI) and LUE (WDI). Statistical analysis revealed that the dynamics and magnitude of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) over wheat growing season mainly determined the spatio-temporal dynamics of NPP. The LUE estimates from LWSI were within range of experimental LUE of wheat but did not show significant differences that cause variability in NPP.

AB  - Reproduction in many organisms can be disrupted by changes to the physical environment, such as those predicted to occur during climate change. Marine organisms face the dual climate change threats of increasing temperature and ocean acidification, yet no studies have examined the potential interactive effects of these stressors on reproduction in marine fishes. We used a long-term experiment to test the interactive effects of increased temperature and CO2 on the reproductive performance of the anemonefish, Amphiprion melanopus. Adult breeding pairs were kept for 10 months at three temperatures (28.5 degrees C [+0.0 degrees C], 30.0 degrees C [+1.5 degrees C] and 31.5 degrees C [+3.0 degrees C]) cross-factored with three CO2 levels (a current-day control [417 mu atm] and moderate [644 mu atm] and high [1134 mu atm]) treatments consistent with the range of CO2 projections for the year 2100. We recorded each egg clutch produced during the breeding season, the number of eggs laid per clutch, average egg size, fertilization success, survival to hatching, hatchling length, and yolk provisioning. Adult body condition, hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index, and plasma 17 beta-estradiol concentrations were measured at the end of the breeding season to determine the effect of prolonged exposure to increased temperature and elevated CO2 on adults, and to examine potential physiological mechanisms for changes in reproduction. Temperature had by far the stronger influence on reproduction, with clear declines in reproduction occurring in the +1.5 degrees C treatment and ceasing altogether in the +3.0 degrees C treatment. In contrast, CO2 had a minimal effect on the majority of reproductive traits measured, but caused a decline in offspring quality in combination with elevated temperature. We detected no significant effect of temperature or CO2 on adult body condition or hepatosomatic index. Elevated temperature had a significant negative effect on plasma 17 beta-estradiol concentrations, suggesting that declines in reproduction with increasing temperature were due to the thermal sensitivity of reproductive hormones rather than a reduction in energy available for reproduction. Our results show that elevated temperature exerts a stronger influence than high CO2 on reproduction in A. melanopus. Understanding how these two environmental variables interact to affect the reproductive performance of marine organisms will be important for predicting the future impacts of climate change.

AB  - New forms of urban sprawl alter the morphological structure. As a result, the development of new territories is marked by socio-spatial fragmentation, an increase of the population's vulnerability and segregation. The main objective of this research is to uncover deep territorial imbalances within the northern rururban system of the city of Santa Fe by means of designing and applying a synthetic index of socio-environmental vulnerability, as well as identifying contrasting morphological patterns. A. er applying a mixed methodological design based, on one hand, on simple multivariate analysis and spatial analysis through GIS tools, and on the other hand, on the interpretation of satellite images, interviews to key informants and other instruments; it has been possible to obtain an approach to economic, social and life conditions transformations.

AB  - The ability to observe and predict trawling-induced patterns at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to inform realistic management strategies is a challenge which scientists have consistently faced in recent decades. Here, we use fish feeding behaviour, a biological trait easily impaired by trawling disturbance, to depict alterations in fish condition (i.e. individual fitness) and feeding opportunities. The benthivorous fish Mullus barbatus barbatus was selected as a model species. The observed trends of responses to trawling in prey species confirmed the effectiveness of a non-trawled zone in sustaining higher levels of diet diversity (e.g. quantity and quality of ingested prey) and fish condition values (e.g. morphometric and physiological Condition Index). Changes observed in fish prey selection confirmed the role of trawling disturbance in modifying the local soft bottoms community, producing alterations of prey availability that trigger shifts in fish diet. Trawling-induced feeding patterns, mirrored through stomach contents, can positively or negatively affect fish condition, the main driver of population dynamics in maintaining carrying capacity levels. Due to the widespread socio-economic value of the red mullet fishery, and the current exploitation status, evidence gathered by the proposed bottom-up trait based approach might inform future trawling adaptation strategies, and tailor spatial conservation measures supporting an Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management.

AB  - We sampled 41 sites on 34 nonwadeable rivers that represent the types of rivers in Wisconsin, and the kinds and intensities of nutrient and other anthropogenic stressors upon each river type. Sites covered much of United States Environmental Protection Agency national nutrient ecoregions VII-Mostly Glaciated Dairy Region, and VIII-Nutrient Poor, Largely Glaciated upper Midwest. Fish, macroinvertebrates, and three categories of environmental variables including nutrients, other water chemistry, and watershed features were collected using standard protocols. We summarized fish assemblages by index of biotic integrity (IBI) and its 10 component measures, and macroinvertebrates by 2 organic pollution tolerance and 12 proportional richness measures. All biotic and environmental variables represented a wide range of conditions, with biotic measures ranging from poor to excellent status, despite nutrient concentrations being consistently higher than reference concentrations reported for the regions. Regression tree analyses of nutrients on a suite of biotic measures identified breakpoints in total phosphorus (-0.06 mg/l) and total nitrogen (-0.64 mg/l) concentrations at which biotic assemblages were consistently impaired. Redundancy analyses (RDA) were used to identify the most important variables within each of the three environmental variable categories, which were then used to determine the relative influence of each variable category on the biota. Nutrient measures, suspended chlorophyll a, water clarity, and watershed land cover type (forest or row-crop agriculture) were the most important variables and they explained significant amounts of variation within the macroinvertebrate (R-2 stop = 60.6%) and fish (R-2 = 43.6%) assemblages. The environmental variables selected in the macroinvertebrate model were correlated to such an extent that partial RDA analyses could not attribute variation explained to individual environmental categories, assigning 89% of the explained variation to interactions among the categories. In contrast, partial RDA attributed much of the explained variation to the nutrient (25%) and other water chemistry (38%) categories for the fish model. Our analyses suggest that it would be beneficial to develop criteria based upon a suite of biotic and nutrient variables simultaneously to deem waters as not meeting their designated uses.

AB  - Understanding the susceptibility of coastal ecosystems to nutrient loads from anthropogenic sources and the extent of eutrophication in subtropical and tropical estuaries is still a challenge. This study assessed eutrophication in Guaymas Bay, a subtropical lagoon that receives nutrient-rich urban wastewater discharges. Eutrophication was evaluated by means of the Assessment of Estuarine Trophic Status model. Our results showed that the trophic status of Guaymas Bay was good. It is important to consider that: (1) the dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a levels observed are indicative of a healthy ecosystem, and (2) the key factors explaining this finding are the high susceptibility to eutrophication of the lagoon and the dominance of macroalgae species that respond to nutrient enrichment. This implies that the Overall Eutrophic Condition Index of the Assessment of Estuarine Trophic Status model is a valuable tool for use as an eutrophication indicator based on the abundance of primary producers (macroalgae and phytoplankton). One source of uncertainty in the application of the model to this semi-arid coastal lagoon deals with estimating its susceptibility to eutrophication. The model showed that the lagoon is a highly sensitive ecosystem; however, significant factors are in place, such as an adequate water exchange, that reduce its susceptibility to eutrophication. In conclusion, the trophic status observed at Guaymas Bay is acceptable; however, an environmental management plan is necessary to prevent any adverse effects of eutrophication.

AB  - The results of ecological condition assessments of ecosystems are related to key decisions taken for the purpose of remedial measures or maintaining their current state. In the assessment process, experts come across extensive datasets, the quality, and completeness of which do not always allow for a reliable evaluation, especially if a single empirical approach is used. In this paper, results of machine learning algorithms are presented, with a focus on Self-Organizing Maps. In this context, measurements of component parameters for the assessment of the ecological state of lake ecosystems were subjected to the process of unsupervised machine learning with the aim to create an alternative assessment approach based on the capabilities of neural networks. Results are mapped and compared with expert evaluations, allowing to extend knowledge about sub-clusters present in the data. The primary target of this paper is the ecological assessment expert. At an early stage, information was obtained about the presence of ecological outliers that may be subject to separate monitoring or verification of environmental activities and objectives. In the back-mapping process, the presented technique of map construction and clustering with various versions of the division was referenced to a set of expert classification findings, revealing the underlying structure of the results when addressed with an unsupervised data comprehension. The approach introduced here does not intend to interfere with the format of an original assessment methodology. Rather it aims at obtaining useful additional information which may help in making better decisions.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are vulnerable to many pressures, including pollution. However, environmental quality monitoring in these areas traditionally relies on only water chemistry and microbiological parameters. The goal of the current study was to investigate the role of a set of biomarkers in different target organs (liver, kidney, and gills) of fish in order to assess the environmental quality of an MPA (MTs, GPx, GST, GSH, DNA damage, LPO, AChE, and condition index). Chemical analyses were also performed on liver and muscle tissues to evaluate metal body burdens, and PAHs were identified in bile. A demersal fish (Cathorops spixii) that is widely consumed by the local population was used as bioindicator species, and the results were integrated using multivariate analysis. The use of the biomarker approach allowed for the identification of both seasonal and spatial variations in pollution sources around the Environmental Protected Area of Canan,ia-Iguape-Peruibe (APA-CIP). Higher metal body burdens associated with biological responses were found in the sites under the influence of urban areas during the dry season, and they were found in the sites under the influence of the Ribeira de Iguape River (RIR) during the rainy season. The liver was found to be more responsive in terms of its antioxidant responses, whereas gills were found to be more responsive to biomarkers of effect. These results show that this set of biomarker analyses in different organs of fish is a useful tool for assessing chemical pollution in an MPA.

AB  - The influence of nutritional regime and water temperature on depuration rates of OA-group toxins in the wedge shell Donax trunculus was examined by exposing naturally contaminated specimens to three nutritional regimes (microalgae, commercial paste of microalgae, and starvation) for 14 days at 16 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Total OA was quantified in the whole soft tissues of the individuals collected in days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14. Mortality, dry weight, condition index, gross biochemical composition and gametogenic stages were surveyed. Low variation of glycogen and carbohydrates during the experiments suggest that wedge shells were under non-dramatic stress conditions. Wedge shells fed with non-toxic diets showed similar depuration rates being 15 and 38% higher than in starvation, at 16 and 20 degrees C, respectively. Depuration rates under non-toxic diets at 20 degrees C were 71% higher than at 16 degrees C. These results highlight the influence of water temperature on the depuration rate of total OA accumulated by D. trunculus, even when the increase is of only 4 degrees C, as commonly observed in week time scales in the southern Portuguese coastal waters. These results open the possibility of a faster release of OA in harvested wedge shells translocated to depuration systems when under a slight increase of water temperature.

AB  - Amphibians play a key role in structuring biological assemblages of agricultural landscapes, but they are threatened by global agricultural intensification. Landscape structure is an important variable influencing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. However, in the Yangtze River Delta, where a "farmland-orchard-fishpond" agricultural pattern is common, the effects of landscape construction on anuran populations are unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of agricultural landscape parameters on the abundance and body condition of the rice frog (Fejervarya multistriata), which is a dominant anuran species in farmland in China. Employing a visual encounter method, we surveyed rice frog abundance for 3years across 20 agricultural landscapes. We also calculated the body condition index (BCI) of 188 male frog individuals from these agricultural landscapes. Landscape variables, comprising landscape compositional heterogeneity (using the Shannon diversity index of all land cover types except buildings and roads), landscape configurational heterogeneity (using landscape edge density), breeding habitat diversity (using the number of 5 waterbody types available as breeding habitats), and areas of forest were also measured for each 1-km radius landscape. We found that the amount of forest in each agricultural landscape had a significant positive relationship with rice frog abundance, and breeding habitat diversity was positively related to the BCI of male rice frogs. However, body condition was negatively impacted by landscape configurational heterogeneity. Our results suggested the importance of nonagricultural habitats in agricultural landscapes, such as waterbodies and forest, to benefit rice frog population persistence.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of short-term starvation on biological condition indices, hematological parameters and blood biochemical composition of reared spotted rose snapper Lutjanus guttatus. Triplicate groups of juvenile fish were subjected to different feeding treatments: fed for 14 days (Group A or control); fed for seven days followed by seven days of starvation (Group B) and starved for 14 days (Group C). At the end of the experiment, body, liver, and viscera were randomly sampled for proximate composition, and biological condition indices were assessed. Blood was also collected and analyzed by standard clinical methods. Body composition, liver lipid content, hepatosomatic index, condition factor, and relative intestine length were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in starved compared to fed fish. A statistically significant (P < 0.05) reduction in hematocrit (12%), haemoglobin (33%), glucose (18%) and calcium (9%) levels were assessed in the blood of starved fish for 14 days, while triacylglyceride levels decreased (36%) in fish starved for 7 days, subsequently returning to values similar to control by the end of the trial. No statistically significant differences were observed in total protein, inorganic phosphorus and magnesium levels in starved fish. These hematological blood and biometric parameters seem to have potential as a predictive tool for establishing the nutritional status or physiological condition during short-term starvation of L. guttatus, which may be useful to manage and monitor feeding practices during culture of this species.

AB  - This is the first comprehensive study of sources of variation in metal concentrations within the whole tissues of a shallow burrowing, filter-feeding intertidal clam, Austrovenus stutchburyi. Samples were collected from 12 sites in April, August, November and February in 1993-1994 in the vicinity of Otago Harbour and Peninsula, New Zealand. Total tissue trace metal concentrations (mu g g(-1) dry weight) were measured in individual animals for the essential metals : Mn, Cu, Zn, Ni and the non-essential Cr using trace-metal clean acid-digestion and ICP-OAES techniques. Average metal concentrations were 3-60 mu g g(-1) for Cu, 40-118 mu g g(-1) for Zn, 2-12 mu g g(-1) for Mn, 5-35 mu g g(-1) for Ni and 1-44 mu g g(-1) for Cr. These levels decreased with body weight and differed amongst sites except for Cr in February (mid-summer). Highest concentrations occurred at sites close to a city (Dunedin) and within the central harbour region although the Cu, Zn, Ni and Cr concentrations did not correlate with the environmental gradient or season. At one coastal site, samples of both the blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and cockles gave similar trends in trace metal levels. These results suggest that the cockle could be a useful trace metal biomonitor within NZ estuaries.

AB  - There is growing interest to restore oyster populations and develop oyster reefs for their role in ecosystem health and delivery of ecosystem services. Successful and sustainable oyster restoration efforts largely depend on the availability and selection of suitable sites that can support long-term growth and survival of oysters. Hence, in the present study a habitat suitability index (HSI) model was developed for the intertidal rock oyster (Saccostrea cucullata), with special attention: (1) to the role of the monsoon in the suitability of oyster habitats, and (2) to identify potential suitable sites along the south-eastern Bangladesh coast. Seven habitat factors were used as input variables for the HSI model: (1) water temperature; (2) salinity; (3) dissolved oxygen; (4) particulate inorganic matter (PIM); (5) pH; (6) Chlorophyll-a; and (7) water flow velocity. Seven field surveys were conducted at 80 locations to collect geospatial environmental data, which were then used to determine HSI scores using habitat suitability functions. The model results showed that the areas suitable (HSI >0.50) for oyster settlement and growth were characterized by relatively high salinities, Chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen and pH values. In contrast, freshwater dominated estuaries and nearby coastal areas with high suspended sediment were found less suitable (HSI <0.50) for oysters. HSI model results were validated with observed oyster distribution data. There was strong correlation between the HSI calculated by the model and observed oyster densities (r = 0.87; n = 53), shell height (r = 0.95; n = 53) and their condition index (r = 0.98; n = 53). The good correspondence with field data enhances the applicability of the HSI model as a quantitative tool for evaluating the quality of a site for oyster restoration and culture.

AB  - Among environmental contaminants, heavy metals are currently considered to be some of the most toxic ones present worldwide due to their harmful effects on organisms and ability to bioaccumulate in aquatic systems. In this work, the concentration of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni and Cr) in Brachidontes rodriguezii and in the fine sediments of several coastal sites at the southwest of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina is analyzed. The Bahia Blanca Estuary and Pehuen-Co beach are located in a highly complex oceanographic and ecological regional system, which creates the basis of one of the most valuable Argentinean habitats for fishing commercial species. An assessment, which involved analyzing distribution pattern of trace metals, comparative studies with sediment and ecological quality guidelines; and a sequential and integrated index analyses approach (containing Metal Pollution Index, Biosediment Accumulation Factor, Geo-accumulation Index (Igeo), Pollution Load Index and the mean Probable Effect Level quotients), was followed to estimate enrichment and risks of heavy metals in the sediments and in the mussels from these study areas. The results showed higher concentrations of some heavy metals (e.g., Cd, Cr and Ni) in mussels collected at Pehuen-Co, while no spatial differences in sediments were observed. According to the international environmental regulations, mean values of trace metals in mussels allowed to place both sites between "unpolluted and moderately polluted" and between the "low and medium category" of pollution. Furthermore, the mean concentrations found were within the detected ranges in other coastal sites worldwide.

AB  - Biomarkers are indicators of a specific biological state. Their detection in pathological conditions, such as cancer, is important for clinical disease management. One of their greatest values could be in early diagnosis and detection of neoplasms when the cancer is more manageable. Protein biomarkers are expected to be reliable predictors of pathological conditions, as they represent the endpoint of biological processes.
   The proteomic methodology has rapidly evolved in the past ten years, thus enabling discovery of a vast amount of potential biomarker candidates. However, the majority of novel candidates have not yet reached the integration into clinical environment. To do that, well-constructed large population validation studies are necessary as well as development of new algorithms for deciphering complex biological interactions and their involvement in pathological processes.
   This review focuses on advances in classical proteomic approaches and emerging high-throughput proteomic technologies for identifying cancer biomarkers.

AB  - The last remaining population of European sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) lives in the Gironde-Garonne-Dordogne (France) catchment (GGD). Captive young individuals are released into the GGD hydrosystem each year, as part of a restocking programme. This study aims to assess the health status of juveniles A. sturio to current conditions in the GGD hydrosystem, to evaluate their capacity to survive and grow in a moderately anthropized ecosystems. 3-month-old farmed sturgeons were exposed for one month in experimental conditions that mimic the environmental conditions in the Garonne and Dordogne rivers, followed by five months of depuration. After one month of exposure, fish exposed to Dordogne and Garonne waters bioaccumulated higher levels of metals and persistent organic pollutants, displayed a reduced hepato-somatic index, and had depleted levels of lipids and glycogen content in their liver, when compared with the Reference group. However, metabolic and swimming performance, as well as the costs of swimming were not impaired. After the 5 months depuration, a significant decrease of K was observed for all exposure conditions. HSI also decreased with time. The overall health status and adaptive capacity of juvenile A. sturio appeared to be maintained over the experimental 6 months' period. Juveniles of A. sturio seem to have the adaptive capacity to survive and grow in the GGD hydrosystem, after being released as part of a restocking programme.

AB  - Agricultural drought seriously affects the economies of developing countries due to heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture. The present study aimed to assess agricultural drought based on vegetation condition index (VCI) and vegetation health index (VHI) using geospatial techniques, the case of Gilgel Gibe sub-basin southern Ethiopia. Landsat images of TM 1990, ETM+ of 2000 and OLI/TIRS of 2020 were used to calculate VCI and VHI for assessing agricultural drought. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) were used to estimate agricultural drought through VCI and VHI. The result revealed that NDVI declined from 1990 to 2020 due to expansion of agricultural lands and other socioeconomic activities. The output of VCI values indicates that extreme drought was increased from 0.3 km(2) in 1990 to.4 km(2) and 0.7 km(2) in 2000 and 2020, respectively. In addition, severe drought occurred in 2020 on an area of 6 km (2) (0.1%). Consequently, moderate drought was increased by area of 3.3 km(2) , 22.2 km(2) and 1051.1 km(2) in 1990, 2000 and 2020, respectively, based on VHI in the study area. Thus, to minimize the negative effects of agricultural drought on socioeconomic and well-being of the society in the Gilgel Gibe sub-basin forest and other natural resources conservations are essentials not optional. To alleviate the detrimental consequences of agricultural drought on socioeconomic and well-being, forest and other natural resources conservation is necessary. Moreover, detailed research should be conducted in the study area by using high-resolution satellite data with ground control points.

AB  - Hormonally active chemical pollution threatens human and wildlife populations globally. However, despite the well-established capacity of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) to alter reproductive traits, relatively few studies have examined the impacts of EDCs on mechanisms of sexual selection. This study investigated the effects of short-term exposure to an environmentally realistic level of 17 beta-trenbolone-a potent anabolic steroid used in livestock production worldwide-on male mate preference, reproductive behavior, and morphology in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Male guppies prefer to mate with larger females because such females are generally more fecund. Hence, males gain direct fitness benefits by being choosy. Here, we found no significant effect of 17 beta-trenbolone exposure on male courting behavior, with both unexposed and exposed males courting larger females more often. However, exposure to 17 beta-trenbolone significantly altered the amount of coercive copulatory behavior ("sneak" matings) performed. Specifically, while both unexposed and exposed males demonstrated a preference for larger females by conducting more sneaking attempts toward these females, exposed males carried out a greater number of sneaks toward large females than did unexposed males. Further, exposure resulted in increased male condition index (i.e., mass relative to length). Together, our results show for the first time that 17 beta-trenbolone can alter reproductive behavior and morphology in male fish at concentrations as low as 4 ng/L, highlighting the potential for disruption of reproductive processes in wildlife exposed to this potent agricultural contaminant.

KW  - STRESS
AB  - The evaluation of crop genotypes for their adaptability is often performed by means of regression techniques of yields against some hind of an environmental index as independent variable, The weakness of these techniques lies in the lack of a direct assessment of a given environment by specific environmental factors. In this work, a new index, the water potential index (WPI), is suggested as a measure of the total water stress experienced by any crop in a given environment for a specific time interval. The index is derived from the integral of the course of leaf water potential over time. Its usefulness is demonstrated in evaluations of field-grown bread wheat [Triticum aestivum (L.) em. Thell] and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) genotypes of contrasting characteristics by yield vs. WPI linear regression analysis, In these regressions, the intercept represents the "potential" yield at no stress conditions and the slope represents the "adaptability'' of each genotype It was found that the dwarf wheat cultivars Yecora and Siette Cerros exhibited higher potential yields and lower adaptability in comparison with the tall cultivar Generoso, In faba beans, the smaller the seed size of a cultivar, the lower was the potential yield and the better the adaptability. On the basis of this regression analysis, different response scenarios of hypothetical crop genotypes are described. Furthermore, the "relative adaptability" concept is presented, in which the potential yield effect is removed from the adaptability of any genotype, Examples of the the use of WPI for obtaining information on the involvement of water shortage in specific growth stages of the wheat crop or for assessing the sensitivity of faba bean yield components to water shortage are presented.

AB  - Suspension-feeding bivalves are often included in environmental monitoring because of their trophic position, widespread occurrence and sensitivity to a wide range of environmental factors. Therefore various indices of bivalve condition and growth have been developed, including morphometric condition indices (CI), scope for growth (SFG) and nucleic acid ratios (RNA:DNA ratio, RNA:protein ratio or RNA concentration). The sensitivity of these 3 indices has not previously been compared in the same individual bivalves, yet they are likely to have different temporal scales of detectable response to environmental processes. In 2 laboratory experiments (10 and 24 d duration) we investigated the combined effect of food availability and sublethal hypoxia on RNA concentration, Cl and SFG in juvenile clams Paphies australis. RNA and Cl increased rapidly (5 d) following exposure to high food treatment, but only CI showed a negative influence of hypoxia. Although SFG was affected by both food availability and hypoxia, the patterns were opposite to those of RNA and CI. This anomaly could be explained by the instantaneous change in feeding rates and a slower response in respiration rate (which was correlated with CI) to the uniform conditions under which SFG was determined. Our results emphasise the importance of combined effects of environmental factors on bivalve growth, highlighting the overriding influence of food availability, and imply that a combination of measures will give a more accurate representation of growth rate.

AB  - Shellfish culture, based on ecological and market assessment, is considered a driving force for socio-economic change in ecologically complex coastal systems such as lagoons throughout the Mediterranean area. To diversify fish production, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas was cultured at commercial farms in the Varano Lagoon (SE Italy). The aims of this study were to evaluate through four condition indices (CI, CICG, CIE and AFNOR index), the Polydora index (PI), lipid content, quality and market aspects of oysters reared at two different sites (FO and LA) of the Varano Lagoon, which are characterized by different hydrodynamic conditions. The results of this study highlighted the potential economic benefits associated with sustainable aquaculture development in the Varano Lagoon, proving that the area surrounding the LA site was more suitable for oyster culture, reaching commercial size (60 mm) in a shorter time (6-8 months). Higher growth performance of oysters was observed in the spring, when the nutrient availability positively affected the feeding response of suspension feeders. The opposite was found in winter and in summer, when the decrease in growth could be due to the reduction of nutrient and to the increase of salinity, TSM and ISM. The presence of the mud blister worm (Polydora sp.) during rearing could be a real problem, as it damages oyster market value and threatens serious financial loss to the local farmers.

AB  - Contamination of water bodies is a result of anthropogenic activities. An investigation of the degree of metal contamination in water, sediment and fish species (Puntius sarana and Labeo rohita) of two sampling sites of the Damodar River, situated in close vicinity to fly ash dump site, in India was performed. Bioaccumulation of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Fe and Cd) in liver, gills and muscles of fishes were analyzed by Flame Atomic Absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS). The concentrations of Cu, Mn and Fe in water samples of Site 1 (1.04 mg/L Cu; 0.74 mg/L Mn; 1.13 mg/L Fe) and Site 2 (0.64 mg/L Cu; 0.56 mg/L Mn; 0.90 mg/L Fe) were found above permissible limits (Indian Standards, IS: 10500) of drinking water. Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in sediments of Site 1 ranged from 541.08-552.92 mg/kg and 744.68-754.76 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. Sediments of Site 1 had higher Cu and Zn levels as compared to Site 2 but both the sites had Cu and Zn concentrations above the prescribed sediment limits of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) 1986. Risk Index (RI) for sediments of Site 1 was 102.2, while, for Site 2 was 59.59. The trend for chromium (Cr) concentration in tissues of P. sarana from Site 1 was: muscles > liver > gills and for Lead (Pb) in P. sarana was: liver > gills > muscles. In Site 2, the trend for Zn concentration in L. rohita was: liver > gills > muscles. Concentrations of Cu and Iron (Fe) in muscles of P. sarana of Site 1 were found to be 18.64 mg/kg and 14.26 mg/kg, wet weight, respectively, and were above permissible limits as prescribed by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) 1983 while, at Site 2, Fe (13.91 mg/kg) was above FAO limits for muscles of L. rohita. Highest bioaccumulation factor (BAF) value was observed for Pb (145.18) in liver of L. rohita of Site 2. Target hazard quotient (THQ) values for all the metals were below 1, indicating no risk relating to the consumption of fish on human health.

AB  - Contamination of aquatic habitats with pharmaceuticals is a major environmental concern. Recent studies have detected pharmaceutical pollutants in a wide array of ecosystems and organisms, with many of these contaminants being highly resistant to biodegradation and capable of eliciting sub-lethal effects in non-target species. One such pollutant is fluoxetine, a widely prescribed antidepressant, which is frequently detected in surface waters globally and can alter physiology and behaviour in aquatic organisms. Despite this, relatively little is known about the potential for fluoxetine to disrupt mechanisms of sexual selection. Here, we investigate the impacts of 30-day exposure to two environmentally realistic levels of fluoxetine (low and high) on mechanisms of pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection in the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We tested 1) male mating behaviour in the absence or presence of a competitor male, and 2) sperm quality and quantity. We found that high-fluoxetine exposure increased male copulatory behaviour in the absence of a competitor, while no effect was detected under male-male competition. Further, fluoxetine exposure at both concentrations increased total sperm count relative to males from the control group, while no significant change in sperm quality was observed. Lastly, low-fluoxetine males showed a significant reduction in condition index (mass relative to length). Our study is the first to show altered mechanisms of both pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection in an aquatic species resulting from environmentally realistic fluoxetine exposure, highlighting the capacity of pharmaceutical pollution to interfere with sensitive reproductive processes in wildlife.

AB  - Microfauna, comprising protists and little metazoan, has proved to be a useful tool for assessing the occurrence of pollution in wastewater treatment systems, namely on activated-sludge plants. In the present work, the response of the microfauna communities of activated sludge to three toxicants-copper, zinc, and cycloheximide-was studied by means of a series of assays using a bench-scale plant. Along with the community descriptive parameters such as density, taxonomic richness, and the use of biological indexes-the Shannon-Wiener Index and the Sludge Biotic Index-several operating parameters were determined in order to allow for the comparison and possible correlations between the biological and the physical-chemical parameters. The results emphasize the ability of activated sludge communities, both bacteria and microfauna, to survive and to react to toxicants. High concentrations of copper and zinc (20 and 50 mg/L) prevented the satisfactory plant efficiency and the healthy state of the microfauna, including its survival. Cycloheximide did not have important and lasting effects below 5 mg/L. Among physical-chemical parameters, removal of soluble chemical oxygen demand seems to be the only one that presents patterns revealing a cause-effect relation along toxicological assays. Biological parameters were much more sensitive and coherent. The Sludge Biotic Index was, by far, the best tool in detecting intoxicant effects in the microfauna communities. Considering all parameters studied, copper was more toxic than zinc. Cycloheximide, in the range of concentration tested, was less toxic than these metals. The work highlights the role of microfauna as an indicator of toxicants entrance, besides the well-documented indicator value of plant operation conditions and efficiency.

AB  - This paper examines the structure and dynamics of the marine ecosystem surrounding Haida Gwaii (an archipelago in the southeastern Gulf of Alaska). Based on previous research, a set of improved mass-balanced models was constructed in Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) to represent ecosystem states existing circa 1900, 1950, and currently. These models feature increased taxonomic and ecological resolution relative to their predecessors across trophic levels and size classes from zooplankton to whales. A more detailed representation of Pacific herring (Clupea pallash), including its age structure, predators, and prey, was introduced to permit modeling of the ecosystem role of herring as a forage fish, as well as the ecological impacts of herring fisheries. Gross ecosystem structure and herring trophodynamics were compared across ecosystem states using size spectra and ecological indicators, including mixed trophic impacts (MTIs). The 1950 model was fitted to a comprehensive set of biomass and catch time series. Dynamic ecosystem simulations evaluated the influence of fishing, predation, other natural mortality, and primary productivity trends on ecosystem behavior since 1950, as well as the relative importance of top-down versus bottom-up forcing. Size spectra and ecosystem indicators suggest that the Haida Gwaii ecosystem has not undergone a radical structural shift since 1900, despite heavy exploitation of numerous marine mammals and fish. Moreover, MTIs show that herring constitutes an important mid-trophic level node in the food web, participating in complex interactions with many predators, prey, and competitors. Dynamic ecosystem simulations demonstrate that trends in fishing mortality, trophic interactions, and primary productivity (correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) are all necessary to explain historical Haida Gwaii ecosystem behavior. These interacting drivers yield a mosaic of top-down and bottom-up trophic control for trophic interactions involving herring and throughout the food web. Simulation results also suggest that production of several herring, salmon, and groundfish stocks may have recently become partially decoupled from primary productivity, perhaps due to changes in copepod guild composition. These results also indicate that a biodiversity decline and "fishing down the food web" occurred off Haida Gwaii since 1950. Finally, the fitted 1950 model provides a robust platform for dynamic ecosystem simulations.

AB  - The brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) is listed as vulnerable on the International Union for-Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Parasitic diseases have been proposed as possible contributing factors to the decline of the species, but very little is known about the effects of parasites oil this host. This study determined the antibody prevalence of the protist Toxoplasma gondii in a wild brush-tailed rock-wallaby population from, three neighboring colonies in southeast Queensland, Australia. Fecal egg and oocyst count, tick count, severity of skin rash, and presence of lice and microfilariae were also monitored during four or five trapping periods over 1 yr. Antibodies against T. gondii were detected in 5% of animals (3/64). Fecal egg and oocyst counts were highly variable, but fecal egg counts were lower in subadult animals relative to adults. Neither fecal egg count nor oocyst count was associated with variation in blood variables or condition index, but a negative association between fecal egg count and oocyst count was observed. Microfilariae (Breinlia spelaea), lice (Heterodoxus octoseriatus), and skin lesions were seen more frequently during the November trapping period. A mite, Thadeua sp., was more likely to be detected in these skin lesions than in skin of unaffected wallabies. Tick (Ixodes holocyclus and Haemaphysalis bancrofti) counts also varied between trapping periods and were lowest in the April/May trapping period. This study provides the most detailed account to date of parasite burdens in a vulnerable macropodid, but no clear evidence emerged linking parasites to adverse impact oil the host.

AB  - The emergence of organic biophysics of ecosystems (OBEC: an interdisciplinary approach supported by thirteen previous articles in order to get a non-contingent explanation of ecosystem dynamics) may close the gap between the foundation of ecosystem ecology in classical thermodynamics and the paradoxical fact that conventional thermostatistics is currently regarded as useless to explain ecosystem functioning. The measurement of eco-kinetic energy (Eep) was the first step of OBEC. However, Eep assesses trophic energy as a stock rather than a flow. In order to normalize the above-mentioned situation, this article proposes a model to assess the average trophodynamic power (Pt,avg: flow of eco-kinetic energy per space-time unit) of ecosystems by extrapolating the equation of average power for an oscillating string. With such a goal, we quantified the power associated to oscillations of the difference between the standardized values of species richness and evenness per value class of several species diversity distributions. In order to validate if Pt, avg has a reliable meaning, Pt, avg was correlated with a wide spectrum of biotic and abiotic environmental factors, every of them with a well-known independent meaning. We herein use field data from three databases (inland water zooplankton, leaf litter invertebrates, and ruderal vegetation) to test the reliability of this model. Our results showed that Pt,avg is correlated in a significant way, either positively or negatively, with important environmental factors. As a result, it is feasible to use the proposed equation as a reliable tool to measure the intensity of eco-kinetic energy flow under stationary and non-stationary conditions. This proposal has advantages in comparison with conventional methods (e.g.: standing biomass, carbon fixation), and it is useful for monitoring anthropogenic impacts on ecosystem metabolism.

AB  - Escapes of farmed fish into the ecosystem have recently received a marked interest from scientists for their competition with wild populations or the risk of genetic contamination. Fatty acid profiles have been proposed as bioindicators due to the inclusion of terrestrial oils in aquafeed ingredients. This study evaluated 1) the effect of wasted food on the fatty acid content of a farm-associated fish and 2) the suitability of fatty acid profiles as a bioindicator of aquaculture-ecosystem interactions, using the bogue (Boops boops) as a model. This species is an opportunistic fish usually associated with-or even found in-sea farms, and with a high natural occurrence along the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. The results showed that fish farms had a direct effect on the condition index, muscle and whole lipid content of bogue inside or around the sea cage, and this effect disappeared completely at 3 km from the cages. Despite the fact that aquafeeds also affected the bogue fatty acid profiles by increasing linoleic and oleic acids and reducing DHA, these profiles were very similar to those of bogue sampled close to a sewage outfall, denoting that these fatty acids are not exclusively influenced by aquaculture and therefore should not be considered as good biomarkers for escapees. However, bogues influenced by aquaculture were higher in linolenic acid than those found further than 3 km from the farm or close to the sewage, suggesting this fatty acid as a better indicator of aquaculture influence.

KW  - INCREASES
AB  - Reference values define the natural state with respect to environmental stressors and are commonly used for assessments of ecological impacts and to set restoration targets. These reference values are often treated as constants, whereas in reality they can be highly variable. Here, we study the significance of this variability for assessments of human impact on the environment, by using almost two decades of observations from 95 acid-sensitive Swedish lakes. Our approach was to first estimate the preindustrial, steady-state reference level of acid neutralization capacity (ANC) for each lake with the hydro-geochemical model MAGIC. Then the variability in pH around this "baseline" was reconstructed from the contemporary, "natural" variability in the ANC, total organic carbon (TOC) and Al-concentrations, and partial CO2 pressure. The variability in reference pH was then examined for the period 1990-2004, on seasonal (single measurements), interannual (1-year median), and decadal (5-year median) scales. On the seasonal scale, the variability in reference pH ranged between 0.40 and 1.7. The range on the interannual time scale was up to 1.3 units and for the decadal scale up to 0.76 units. Since an anthropogenic pH decline of more than 0.4 units is deemed significant according to the Swedish Environmental Quality Criteria, this natural variability clearly needs to be accounted for when assessing acidification.

AB  - The objective of this study is to detect the current land cover classes of a representative area in the coastal agricultural land of Egypt, where changes have been observed recently due to the urban sprawl. This has been achieved after the production of different vegetation indices, and the comparison between them and their sensitivity to the environmental conditions of the area under study. This was followed by the production of profiles of different Vegetation Index (VI) images, and supervised Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), for the assessment of land cover classes and their cover percentage.
   It was found that different greenness levels were best estimated by the Environmental Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The MLC resulted in classifying the study area into 10 classes with an accuracy above 90 per cent. Agriculture lands cover about 46 per cent only of the total area, which was estimated to cover at least 80 per cent 15 years ago. Land transformation is proceeding by a rate of about 1.47 per cent every year. This means that if such a rate continues in the same pattern, all agricultural land in the area will be lost to urbanization and other activities within less than 70 years.

AB  - The effectiveness of exergy and specific exergy indices as ecological indicators of the trophic state of lake ecosystems is here tested on a small homogeneous set of shallow lakes which. in spite of their similar nutrient concentrations, morphology and hydrology, show a different trophic state and structure, species composition and abundance. The findings reveal that exergy and specific exergy indices have good negative correlation with phytoplankton biomass and Carlson's trophic state index (TSI) and strong positive correlation to water transparency (the relationship between exergy and eutrophication is clearer if the exergy refers to surface units, rather than volume units) and, hence, that they may be used as ecological indicators of the trophic state of lake ecosystems. The relationship between the responses of the thermodynamic approach and other conventional trophic classification methods (Vollenweider's eutrophication model based on phosphorus loading. the Hillbrich-Ilkowska method and the Vollenweider-OECD classification criterion) previously applied to Lake Trasimeno, was also investigated. The decreasing trend of exergy and specific exergy indices with eutrophication increase appears to be essentially due to the change in species composition and trophic structure, rather than to a different trophic potentiality of the ecosystems investigated. Concerning the identification of the environmental factors responsible for exergy and specific exergy trends, the coherence of the correlation structure between water depth. TSI, exergy and specific exergy indices, suggests that the lake's mean water depth plays a significant role in determining the changes in trophic structure and state (and consequently in exergetic indices) within the set of lakes examined and emphasises the importance of lake morphology in the development and ageing of lake ecosystems.

AB  - Cootes Paradise Marsh is a large urban wetland of western Lake Ontario that has undergone major restoration as part of the Hamilton Harbour Remedial Action Plan. A key component of the restoration plan is exclusion of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) via construction of the Cootes Paradise Fishway that became operational in 1997. Here, we evaluate the response of the marsh community to carp exclusion using three approaches. First of all we analyze changes in water quality parameters and the community composition of zooplankton, macrophytes and fish. Secondly, we use ecological indices based on water quality, zooplankton, macrophytes and fish communities to track changes in quality. Lastly, we evaluate changes in the wetland quality of Cootes Paradise over the past decade in comparison with two other coastal wetlands of the Laurentian Great Lakes for which long-term data exist (Matchedash Bay of Lake Huron and Long Point Marsh of Lake Erie). Our results show that there has been variable improvement in wetland quality at Cootes Paradise, but compared to the two other wetlands, it is still the most degraded in all aspects studied. The overall trend towards moderately better water quality conditions in Cootes Paradise over the past decade is not directly reflected in the zooplankton, macrophyte and fish communities. We believe that high nutrient levels and high turbidity are preventing the progression to a clear-water macrophyte dominated system. This is one of few long-term studies that tracks the progress of restoration in a degraded marsh. It underscores the difficulty in trying to restore a 'novel ecosystem' to its original biotic and abiotic characteristics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The free-flowing Clinch and Powell River Basin, located in southwestern Virginia, United States, historically had one of the richest assemblages of native fish and freshwater mussels in the world. Nearly half of the species once residing here are now extinct, threatened, or endangered. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's framework for conducting an ecological risk assessment was used to structure a watershed-scale analysis of human land use, in-stream habitat quality, and their relationship to native fish and mussel populations in order to develop future management strategies and prioritize areas in need of enhanced protection. Our analyses indicate that agricultural and urban land uses as well as proximity to mining activities and transportation corridors are inversely related to fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) and mussel species diversity. Forward stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that coal mining had the most impact on fish IBI followed by percent cropland and urban area in the riparian corridor (R-2 = 0.55, p = 0.02); however, these analyses suggest that other site-specific factors are important. Habitat quality measures accounted for as much as approximately half of the variability in fish IBI values if the analysis was limited to sites within a relatively narrow elevation range. These results, in addition to other data collected in this watershed, suggest that nonhabitat-related stressors (e.g., accidental chemical spills) also have significant effects on biota in this basin. The number of cooccurring human land uses was inversely related to fish IBI (r= -0.49, p < 0.01). Sites with greater than or equal to2 co-occurring land uses had > 90% probability of having <2 mussel species present. Our findings predict that many mussel concentration sites are vulnerable to future extirpation. In addition, our results suggest that protection and enhancement of naturally vegetated riparian corridors, better controls of mine effluents and urban runoff, and increased safeguards against accidental chemical spills, as well as reintroduction or augmentation of threatened and endangered species, may help sustain native fish and mussel populations in this watershed.

AB  - In most coastal countries the fisheries sector satisfies multiple socioeconomic needs. This is especially the case in many coastal developing countries where fisheries represent a substantial source of food, jobs, and income. However, fisheries exert strong pressures on marine resources with threats to their sustainability. The context of overexploitation of marine resources is combined with a great diversity of stakeholders intervening in the governance of the fisheries. Thus, a better understanding of the challenges fisheries face is essential to enact management policies to ensure sustainability Through a case study of the Senegalese fisheries, this article develops quantitative indicators of social, economic, and ecological states of the fisheries. Standardized principal components analysis combined with the Hodrick-Prescott filter is used to assess trendy in the indicators. These indicators can contribute to an adaptive management framework in a context of multiple management objectives with diverse stakeholders and uncertainty.

AB  - This paper presents a simple dynamic model dealing with the management of a marine renewable resource. But instead of studying the ecological and economic interactions in terms of equilibrium or optimal control, we pay much attention to the viability of the system or, in a symmetric way, to crisis situations. These viability/crisis situations are defined by a set of economic and biological state constraints. The analytical study focuses on the compatibility between the state constraints and the controlled dynamics. Using the mathematical concept of viability kernel, we reveal the situations and, if possible, management options to guarantee a perennial system. Going further, we define 'overexploitation' indicators by the time of crisis function. In particular, we point out irreversible overexploitation configurations related to the resource extinction.

AB  - An index based on the digestive gland (DGI) of transplanted (Gaspe, Havre-St-Pierre and Grande-Riviere) and indigenous (Gaspe and Magdalen Islands) 1-year-old blue mussels (Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus) from eastern Quebec (Canada) was used to assess the nutritional quality of mussel farm sites. To understand variations of this index, the effects of temperature and phytoplankton concentrations were examined on growth, gametogenesis, and immunocompetence of transplanted (M. trossulus, Gould 1850) and cultivated mussels (M. trossulus and M edulis, Linnaeus 1758) in Eastern Quebec mussel farm sites. DGI was influenced by the gametogenic cycle and was decreased before spawning with the utilization of the lipids and glycogen reserves stocked in the digestive gland. DGI patterns from all sites showed variations linked to food supply that contributed to the storage of energy reserves. Protein concentrations showed an inverse relationship with DGI, suggesting that structural proteins were not used as an energy source during spawning. Indigenous mussels from the Magdalen Islands site showed a stable DGI, suggesting both the utilization of energy reserves for reproduction and storage of energy reserves due to the abundant food supply in the Magdalen Islands. Transplanted mussels showed a clear seasonal pattern of the condition index closely related to the gametogenic cycle. Differences in soft tissue and shell growths were observed suggesting a nonsynchronous growth. In all sites, phytoplankton cells <2 mum were more abundant than the larger-size classes, and concentrations seemed sufficient for mussel growth. Phagocytosis varied according to gametogenesis and decreased during spawning. Due to the high energetic cost of spawning, which mainly influenced DGI, a direct influence of environmental parameters could not be clearly detected. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Study of local environmental knowledge has led to a general critique of state epistemology, positing a controlling, official knowledge that crushes competing accounts of nature. Skeptical of that claim, in this paper I assess the differences between state and local knowledge empirically, using a case study of the Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary in Rajasthan, India, to explore the way knowledge varies across class, caste, gender, and affiliation within the state forest bureaucracy. The results show that state versus local knowing is not the most meaningful division in epistemology, and that it is the daily struggle over resources in local political economy that gives rise to contending accounts of nature and environmental change. The conclusions further point to knowledge alliances between state and local actors that render certain claims powerful and so determine natural resource management policy and direct landscape change.

On the basis of physical and chemical characteristics of water quality and the results of a study of hydrobiont communities, the degree of the river pollution has been determined and a conclusion about the rehabilitation of communities as a result of the complex effect of recultivation measures and self-purification processes has been made. Criteria for recultivation activity completion have been defined according to hydrobiological indicators (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and zoobenthos).

AB  - The quantity of environment contaminators (pollutants) and their combinations cannot be counted and specified. Consequently, the current situation needs a change of principles of ecological control. In our case, the indicators of functional health of child population and levels of its vegetative disorders appear as integral bioindicators of individual health (dynamic stability of functional-vegetative homeostasis) and characterize the ecological dynamics in regions of compact settlement. Environmental certification of children functional health could define the region with a pre-crisis or crisis state of the environment. Vegetative levels (vegetative coefficients, k-V of functional-vegetative homeostasis testify to vegetative health (norm), or prevalence of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Permanent functional voltage distorts the pathogenesis of functional-vegetative adaptation and requires specific monitoring in the form of "Functional-ecological expertise" (FEE) of selected staff. The basis of the FEE methodology developed by us is "Functional-vegetative diagnostics" (FVD) by the method of V.G. Makats. The diagnostic complex "BIOTEST-12M" (Diagnostic complexes VITA-01-M and computerized system VITA-01-Biotest) serves as the technical tool of the FVD. Indicators of - vegetative coefficients (k-V = Sigma SA: Sigma PSA; (levels of vegetative balance, sympathetic, or parasympathetic activity) act as integral bioindicators of internal homeostasis and its dependence on the conditions of the environment. The criterion of FEE is a systemically dependent comparison of inhibition of the functional activity of the organism (parasympathetic activity (PA), vegetative equilibrium (VE) and sympathetic activity (SA) and can be calculated for children in particular region. This, we suggested the integral characteristic of territorial ecological state and the levels (zones) of ecological pressure.

AB  - Microorganisms are the most numerous organisms in the soil biological fraction. Their population and metabolic relations are affected by environmental changes, such as pollutant deposition on and movement into the soil. The aim of this work was to assess the soil microbial activity in a Pb mining and metallurgy plant, in Adrianopolis (PR), to determine soil biological quality indicators. The soil (layers 0 to 5 and 5 to 10 cm) was sampled once at five locations four times (May, September, November and January),approximately, 62 years after mining activity and 12 after the activity was stopped. The total Pb and Zn content in the soil was determined through inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES), after microwave digestion of the soil samples with concentrated HF, HNO3 and 30 % (v/v) H2O2. To extract the heavy metals in bioavailable form, a boiling HNO3 0.5 mol L-1 solution was used. The following soil microbial parameters were estimated: Total Bacteria (TB); Sporulating Bacteria (SB); percentage of Sporulating Bacteria comparing to TB; Fungi; correlation between fungi and TB; Microbial respiration; Microbial Biomass; Microbial Carbon percentage compared to the soil total organic C; Metabolic quotient. Three methods were used to the statistical data analysis: (a) differentiation of the sites trough Principal Component Analysis (PCA); (b) establishment of an Environmental Quality Index (EQMI) based on microbiological parameters; and (c) simple correlation analysis. The the heavy metal effect microorganisms was minimized by the high soil fertility. However, in the month with the most unfavorable climatic conditions for the microorganisms (May-lowest temperatures), soils with the highest Pb showed reduced microorganism population and microbial activity, which means that under these conditions bacteria and fungi were good soil quality indicators. The highest SB proportion in the most Pb contaminated soils in the coldest month (0.95* correlation to May) can be interpreted as a resistance mechanism of these organisms. The environment microbial quality index (EMQI) in the 0 to 5 cm layer was more efficient than PCA in distinguishing locations with heavy metal contamination: the values decreased in the opposite sense to the increase in the soil Pb. However, in the 5 to 10 cm layer PCA was more efficient to this purpose.

AB  - Pollution transfer is widespread in various countries. If differences in environmental regulation intensity exist across different regions in a country, pollution transfer may occur. Based on data from Chinese enterprises, this study constructs a comprehensive index of environmental regulation and the degree of environmental co-governance at the enterprise level and uses a panel probit model, the two-stage least squares method, and an interaction regression model to assess the effect of environmental regulation and environmental co-governance on pollution transfer. The probability of enterprise migration increases as environmental regulation intensity increases, confirming the pollution transfer effect of environmental regulation. The analysis of the influencing mechanism shows that environmental regulation can reduce the probability of pollution transfer through the "innovation compensation effect" and improve the probability of enterprise migration through the "compliance cost effect". In addition, under the condition of established environmental regulation, environmental co-governance can reduce the probability of enterprise migration, inhibit the transfer of pollution to nearby areas, and improve the efficiency of environmental governance. This study is conducive to assessing the policy effectiveness of environmental regulation and provides a reference for other countries regarding pollution transfer.

AB  - Present study is concerned with three dimensional natural frequency analysis of functionally graded sandwich rectangular plates using Mesh less Local Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) method and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The plate consists of two homogeneous face sheets and a power-law FGM core. Natural frequencies of the plate are obtained by 3D MLPG method and are verified with available references. Convergence study of the first four natural frequencies for different node numbers is the next step. Also, effects of two parameters of "FG core to plate thickness ratio" and "volume fraction index" on natural frequencies of plate are investigated. Then, four distinct ANNs are used to predict the first four natural frequencies of the plate. Back-Error Propagation (BEP) method is used to train the ANNs. The predicted data shows a good agreement with respect to the actual data. Finally, the trained ANNs are used for prediction of natural frequencies of some conditions where MLPG data are not available.

AB  - Devolution of tasks to local levels of government has recently become a popular agenda item within certain political factions in the US. While one expects the local policymaker to tailor policies to match the preferences of his constituents, critics of local policymaking claim that externalities are ignored and inefficiencies thus arise under local control of certain policies. A primary example concerns the control of pollution, which is known to have adverse effects on neighbouring jurisdictions. Whether localities actually 'race to the bottom' and enact lax environmental policies when given the chance remains an open issue. In this study, we make use of sothcastic dominance tests to examine if President Reagan's policy of 'New Federalism' in the early 1980s induced states to lower environmental standards. Among the several environmental measures analysed, we do not find any evidence that the 'race to the bottom' materialized. Indeed, the evidence shows that even during these lean years of federal intervention several indicators of environmental quality at the state level continued to improve.

AB  - Hydraulic fracturing (fracking) poses significant threats to freshwater resources and stream ecosystems. Little research exists to quantify the ecological impact and in Pennsylvania alone over 10,000 wells have been permitted. This study aimed to determine if hydraulic fracturing is having any impacts on stream ecosystem health by measuring stream pH and temperature, macroinvertebrate index of biological integrity (IBI), and the gill morphology of individuals in the Hydropsychidae Diplectrona taxa. Six streams in northwestern Pennsylvania were selected as study sites (three with fracking occurring in their watershed and three without fracking). IBI scores were significantly higher at non-fracked sites and were also correlated with stream pH. Macroinvertebrate gill width did not vary between fracked and non-fracked sites but was correlated with percent hydric soils, suggesting that hydric soils may be a good long-term indicator of stream dissolved oxygen. While our results did not indicate differences in Hydropsychidae Diplectrona gill widths between fracked and non-fracked sites, we did observe that fracked sites had more acidic stream water and lower IBI scores. These results indicate the need for further study to assess the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on stream ecosystems.

AB  - The presence of a multitude of bioactive organic pollutants collectively classified as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in freshwaters is of concern, considering that ecological assessments of their potential impacts on natural systems are still scarce. In this field experiment we tested whether a single pulse exposure to a mixture of 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products, which are commonly found in European inland waters, can influence the size distributions of natural lake phytoplankton communities. Size is one of the most influential determinants of community structure and functioning, particularly in planktonic communities and food webs. Using an in-situ microcosm approach, phytoplankton communities in two lakes with different nutrient levels (mesotrophic and eutrophic) were exposed to a concentration gradient of the PPCPs mixture at five levels. We tested whether sub-lethal PPCPs doses affect the scaling of organisms' abundances with their size, and the slope of these size spectra, which describe changes in the abundances of small relative to large phytoplankton. Our results showed that a large proportion (approximately 80%) of the dataset followed a power-law distribution, thus suggesting evidence of scale invariance of abundances, as expected in steady state ecosystems. PPCPs were however found to induce significant changes in the size spectra and community structure of natural phytoplankton assemblages. The two highest treatment levels of PPCPs were associated with decreased abundance of the most dominant size class (nano-phytoplankton: 2-5 mu m), leading to a flattening of the size spectra slope. These results suggest that a pulse exposure to PPCPs induce changes that potentially lead to unsteady ecosystem states and cascading effects in the aquatic food webs, by favoring larger non-edible algae at the expense of small edible species. We propose higher susceptibility due to higher surface to volume ratio in small species as the likely cause of these structural changes. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Variable selection is a critical step in development of empirical stream health prediction models. This study develops a framework for selecting important in-stream variables to predict four measures of biological integrity: total number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa, family index of biotic integrity (FIBI), Hilsenhoff biotic integrity (HBI), and fish index of biotic integrity (IBI). Over 200 flow regime and water quality variables were calculated using the Hydrologic Index Tool (HIT) and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Streams of the River Raisin watershed in Michigan were grouped using the Strahler stream classification system (orders 1-3 and orders 4-6), k-means clustering technique (two clusters: C1 and C2), and all streams ( one grouping). For each grouping, variable selection was performed using Bayesian variable selection, principal component analysis, and Spearman's rank correlation. Following selection of best variable sets, models were developed to predict the measures of biological integrity using adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), a technique well-suited to complex, nonlinear ecological problems. Multiple unique variable sets were identified, all which differed by selection method and stream grouping. Final best models were mostly built using the Bayesian variable selection method. The most effective stream grouping method varied by health measure, although k-means clustering and grouping by stream order were always superior to models built without grouping. Commonly selected variables were related to streamflow magnitude, rate of change, and seasonal nitrate concentration. Each best model was effective in simulating stream health observations, with EPT taxa validation R-2 ranging from 0.67 to 0.92, FIBI ranging from 0.49 to 0.85, HBI from 0.56 to 0.75, and fish IBI at 0.99 for all best models. The comprehensive variable selection and modeling process proposed here is a robust method that extends our understanding of watershed scale stream health beyond sparse monitoring points.

AB  - The degraded ecosystem in the Loess Plateau region of China is very vulnerable, which has a great impact on regional sustainable development. Taking the Loess Plateau of Yan'an, Shaanxi province, China, as the study area, this study quantitatively evaluated conditions of the ecological environment. Based on natural factors, environmental factors, and socio-economic factors of Yan'an in 1997, 2004, and 2011, the dynamic changes in ecological vulnerability are analyzed with the application software for geographic information systems (GIS). The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model was used and it contains variables for land use, soil erosion, topography, climate, vegetation, and socio-economic data. The evaluation results are divided into five categories: potential, slight, light, medium, and heavy. The results show that the ecological vulnerability in the study is light level, and the ecological vulnerability index of the southern four counties is lower than that of the northern four counties. Ecological environment quality gradually improved in most areas in 1997 similar to 2011.

CP  - Workshop on Quality Assurance in Environmental Data
AB  - The community of running water macroinvertebrates has proved to be one of key subjects for fluvial ecology and bioindication studies, thanks both to the different trophic roles within the range of taxa and to the ease with which they may be collected and identified. However, the complex nature of this community creates problems concerning the complete identification of the full range of taxa, even when restricting the taxonomic classification to families and genera. Even so, the need to use the community for the implementation of indexes of Ecological Status of freshwaters and for the detection of reference conditions, necessarily means a deeper knowledge of this structure. Hence, a standard methodology of the capture effort is required to identify not only the ecological quality but also a reference community for each selected fluvial typology and for each section examined. Starting from the processing of data collected during intercalibration exercises of the IBE method, the authors analyse the results underlining the share given by the size of the sample collected (catchment effort), and by the distribution models of different taxa within the community, in order to give a contribution to the evaluation of the reliability level of standard samples. The results confirm the models already described in previous publications and lead us to accept the presence of marginal degrees of uncertainty in standard samples.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of the paper is to contribute to the understanding of regional entrepreneurial development by constructing an institutional environment index in India, where high heterogeneity is found in the economic development and entrepreneurial activities across its states. It tries to fill the gap of research which hampers the effectiveness of policy efforts to promote job growth through entrepreneurship development in India and contributes in understanding the phenomenon why the relative contribution of entrepreneurship varies across states.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper uses a composite index of institutional quality based on the Penalty for Bottleneck (PFB) methodology to capture the institutional environment differences across the states of India. The relationship between the institutional environment and the measures of entrepreneurship is established through various statistical and econometric techniques such as correlation and regression.
   Findings The paper finds the regional and contextual institutional environment differences in India starker and more varied than is generally viewed. The empirical evidence suggests that the differences in institutional quality scores can play a significant role in explaining the variations in the extent of entrepreneurial activities across the Indian states. The findings of this paper demonstrate a differential influence of the local institutional environment on the entrepreneurial activities at a regional level in a developing economy like India.
   Research limitations/implications This study is limited by the data sources and index design; therefore, it cannot completely specify all institutional factors and their combined influences on entrepreneurial activities at the regional level. However, it makes a significant contribution to expanding the current body literature of institutional environment reform and entrepreneurship development in developing countries.
   Practical implications The policy implication of the paper highlights the need of policymakers to think outside the individual policy silos and consider the institutional environment as a whole. Priority attention of the policymakers should be on the institutional reform for any type of entrepreneurship development. A corollary implication of the O-ring theory of development and the PFB methodology is that the policy effort is allocated most effectively when it seeks to alleviate bottlenecks.
   Social implications The main implication of this paper for the policymaking is that it is necessary to focus more on the weak institutional factors (bottlenecks) and on the general environment improvement for any entrepreneurship development.
   Originality/value The study contributes to study the problem of entrepreneurship discrepancy in India through the lens of institutions and institutional environment. This study is an improvement over the previous studies by testing the statistical significance of the institutional environment on the entrepreneurship.

AB  - Tests with binary outcomes (e.g., positive versus negative) to indicate a binary state of nature (e.g., disease agent present versus absent) are common. These tests are rarely perfect: chances of a false positive and a false negative always exist. Imperfect results cannot be directly used to infer the true state of the nature; information about the method's uncertainty (i.e., the two error rates and our knowledge of the subject) must be properly accounted for before an imperfect result can be made informative. We discuss statistical methods for incorporating the uncertain information under two scenarios, based on the purpose of conducting a test: inference about the subject under test and inference about the population represented by test subjects. The results are applicable to almost all tests. The importance of properly interpreting results from imperfect tests is universal, although how to handle the uncertainty is inevitably case-specific. The statistical considerations not only will change the way we interpret test results, but also how we plan and carry out tests that are known to be imperfect. Using a numerical example, we illustrate the post-test steps necessary for making the imperfect test results meaningful.

AB  - In this study, ontogenetic variations in diet of invasive bighead goby Ponticola kessleri and round goby Neogobius melanostomus from the middle Danube were analysed. Index of stomach fullness, Fulton's condition factor, index of food importance, frequency of occurrence, biomass, electivity, and proportions of invasive organisms in their diet were examined. Changes in the diet during ontogeny of both species emphasise the differences in their trophic niches. Our results combined with literary data suggest that bighead goby may threaten small native benthic fish species as a predator (especially in the invasion front), whereas round goby can potentially impact native fish species of all ontogenetic phases by competing for food. Round goby appear to have strong impact on bivalves, especially in the invasion front. High consumption of invasive organisms by bighead goby may help the native macroinvertebrate community. Thus, in contrast to round goby, bighead goby does not seem to be a hot candidate for being a nuisance invader. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ocean surface pH levels are predicted to fall by 0.3-0.4 pH units by the end of the century and are likely to coincide with an increase in sea surface temperature of 2-4 degrees C. The combined effect of ocean acidification and warming on the functional properties of bivalve shells is largely unknown and of growing concern as the shell provides protection from mechanical and environmental challenges. We examined the effects of near-future pH (ambient pH -0.4 pH units) and warming (ambient temperature +4 degrees C) on the shells of the commercially important bivalve, Mytilus edulis when fed for a limited period (4-6 h day(-1)). After six months exposure, warming, but not acidification, significantly reduced shell strength determined as reductions in the maximum load endured by the shells. However, acidification resulted in a reduction in shell flex before failure. Reductions in shell strength with warming could not be explained by alterations in morphology, or shell composition but were accompanied by reductions in shell surface area, and by a fall in whole-body condition index. It appears that warming has an indirect effect on shell strength by re-allocating energy from shell formation to support temperature-related increases in maintenance costs, especially as food supply was limited and the mussels were probably relying on internal energy reserves. The maintenance of shell strength despite seawater acidification suggests that biomineralisation processes are unaffected by the associated changes in CaCO3 saturation levels. We conclude that under near-future climate change conditions, ocean warming will pose a greater risk to shell integrity in M. edulis than ocean acidification when food availability is limited.

AB  - The article presents a review of the current state of the Glis glis population in the Zhiguli State Nature Reserve (Russia) and adjacent territories. We present a comparative analysis of biology and ecology of the species with other populations. The Zhiguli G. glis population is the most eastern through the range. It is characterised by numerous peculiarities. Morphometric indicators of G. glis have minimal values here. The average body length of G. glis in the Zhiguli Mts. is 143.8 +/- 0.9 mm, length of the tail is 119.6 +/- 0.8 mm, length of the rear foot is 28.7 mm (median 29), length of the ear is 18.6 mm (median 18). The body mass of adult individuals is 72.9 g (median 72.3). The lifespan of G. glis is also minimal in the Zhiguli State Nature Reserve. Usually it does not exceed four years. The maximum registered lifespan was 11 years. No significant deviations from 1 : 1 were found in the sexual structure of the G. glis population. The hibernation duration is nine months or more. Juveniles begin hibernating a month or two later than adults. In the study area, G. glis inhabits biotopes with a predominance of Quercus robur, Tilia cordata, Populus tremula, Acer platanoides, with a dense undergrowth formed by Corylus avellana. Glis glis reaches a higher abundance in forests with a predominance of Betula pendula, which is not typical for this species in most of the species range. In accordance, a significant proportion of Betula pendula seeds was found in the nutrition ratio. It increased during the mast years for the Quercus robur, and decreases in non-mast years. The ectoparasite fauna of G. glis is represented by nine species. The main feature of the reproductive cycle of G. glis is mass resorption of embryos at the lack of basic fattening forages. As a result, in most individuals, mating and pregnancy are observed annually, while the birth of pups most often occurs one time per two years. Accordingly, an increase in the population number is observed the next year after a mass reproduction. In reproductively successful years, the litter size ranges from one to eight pups (median 4). The period of postembryonic development is more extended than in other parts of the species range. In litters, there is a very dynamic hierarchical structure based on soft agonistic contacts. There are no clearly defined dominants. We described data on main behaviour types of adults and results of pairings. Identification contacts were the most frequent, followed by agonistic contacts. Benevolent contacts were the rarest. During the activity season, we observed a gradual increase in the level of aggression. However, the aggressiveness of the females sharply decreases after the resorption. An increase in the proportion of benevolent contacts was noted immediately before the hibernation. Thus, the results of the study allowed identifying the interrelated features of biology characteristics in the Zhiguli population of G. glis. To establish its conservation status, comparative studies of other G. glis populations are necessary in European Russia, where the species range has undergone significant anthropogenic transformation.s

AB  - Multivariable indices of environmental conditions summarize the information provided by several biotic or abiotic variables into a single value of immediate interpretability. Thus they are important instruments for monitoring. Developing new indices that combine different variables is not a trivial task: variables may be qualitative, or measured in different units, and the relationship between primitive components and quality may be ambiguous. Fuzzy logic has been repeatedly proposed as an effective technique to cope with such problems; however, the variety of choices that exist at each stage of the development of fuzzy models may present a problem for the index designer. In this paper we present F-IND, a framework to create fuzzy indices by means of a simplified and intuitive procedure. It allows to capture the expert knowledge of the system under study (air, soil, water) to easily generate a multivariable index of environmental conditions. F-IND is implemented in Java, to achieve an optimal portability on any operating system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social factors are one of the most important causes of vulnerability of exposed communities to disasters. Until now, however, most studies have been done in the developed countries. Thus, the aim of this paper is to review the social vulnerability indices and their validity in disasters within the period 1985-2015 and to develop a suitable classification to make sense of social vulnerability indices in the Iranian context. This study took place in 2015. It used bibliographies, citation databases, and other available records to find an answer to the question of what are the valid social vulnerability indicators in disasters. It examined 43 peer-reviewed English and Persian language journals. Initially, it found 32 indicators and 150 variables, but it was possible to subsume them into a few valid social vulnerability indicators. These were gender, public health condition, public infrastructures and migration. They are the five top categories of social vulnerability that are most useful in the Iranian context. Most studies have been limited to measure social vulnerability index in natural disasters settings. Consequently, additional research is needed to develop the indices of social vulnerability in man-made disasters and to develop appropriate variable weighting schemes and valid indices.

AB  - On the basis of long-term (1964-2011) research, we tested the hypothesis that the zooplankton community has a highly indicative value in assessing the ecosystem and trophic state of water bodies. Basing on the results of our study and taking into account relevant data from numerous zooplankton studies, we can conclude that the zooplankton measures deserving to be used as indicators in the monitoring of Lake Vortsjarv (and other similar eutrophic water bodies) could be the following: i) indicatory species of eutrophic waters [Anuraeopsis fissa (Gosse), Keratella tecta (Gosse), Trichocerca rousseleti (Voigt), Chydorus sphaericus (O.F. Muller), Bosmina longirostris (O.F. Muller)]; ii) indicatory species of oligo-mesotrophic waters [Conochilus unicornis Rousselet, Kellicottia longispina (Kellicott), Ploesoma hudsoni (Imhof), Bosmina berolinensis Imhof, Eudiaptomus gracilis (Sars)]; iii) number and diversity of species; iv) mean zooplankter weight, mean cladoceran weight, mean rotifer weight and mean copepod weight; v) rotifer abundance; vi) the share (%) of rotifers in total zooplankton abundance; vii) the ratio of abundance of large cladocerans to abundance of all cladocerans (NLarge-Clad/N-Clad); viii) the ratio of calanoid copepod abundance to cyclopoid copepod abundance (N-Cal/N-Cycl); ix) the ratio of crustacean abundance to rotifer abundance (N-Crust/N-Rot). The results of our study show that several zooplankton parameters are among the biological quality elements (BQE) deserving to be included in the Water Frame Directive system.

AB  - This paper is devoted to numerical investigations on mechanical behavior of cracked composite functionally graded (FG) plates. We thus develop an efficient adaptive approach in terms of the extended isogeometric analysis (XIGA) enhanced by locally refined non-uniform rational B-spline (LR NURBS) for natural frequency and buckling analysis of cracked FG Mindlin-Reissner plates. In this setting, the crack geometries, which are described by the level sets, are independent of the computational mesh; and the LR NURBS basis functions, which have the abilities of local refinement and modeling the complex shape, are used as the shape functions of XIGA. According to the recovered stresses of the first buckling or free vibration mode, a posteriori error estimator for driving the adaptive process is defined. The accuracy can be effectively improved through adaptive local refinements, demonstrated through numerical experiments with complex geometries. Compared with uniform global refinement, XIGA based on adaptive local refinement has the characteristics of high precision at low cost and fast convergence rate. The effects of some factors such as crack length and location, plate thickness, gradient index, boundary condition, loading type, etc. on critical buckling loads and natural frequencies are investigated.

KW  - GROWTH
AB  - The range of adaptation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emmend. Thell.) is influenced by temperature variation.  This study was aimed at determining phenotypic characters that are associated with yield adaptation of wheat to a range of temperature conditions experienced in Zimbabwe.  Thirty genetically diverse lines of wheat were grown in a field experiment from 1984 to 1986 at seven locations that ranged in altitude from 421 to 1506 m, providing different temperature conditions.  Analysis of variance, correlation matrices and regression analysis of grain yield using the mean maximum temperature during pre-anthesis at the locations in each year as the environmental index, were done.  The lines were divided into four classes of adaptation to temperature environments based on linear regression slopes and intercept, mean yield and estimated yield at the warmest environment.  The regression slopes were negatively related (P < 0.001) with grain filling duration and positively (P < 0.01) with duration to anthesis.  Differences in grain filling rate and grain weight per ear significantly (P < 0.01) explained line variation of yield across all temperature conditions.  Lines classified as well adapted to all temperature conditions had the highest mean yield, grain filling rate and grain weight per ear.  The improvement of grain filling rate and grain weight per ear would appear to lead to increased grain yield of lines in all classes of adaptation, and wide adaptation to a range of temperature conditions.  However, knowledge about the genetic basis of grain filling rate and/or grain weight per ear variation among lines is necessary for an effective and efficient use of these characters in breeding and selection for high yield across all temperature conditions.

AB  - Seasonal size variation of marine copepods has long been noted in the literature. Such variation is thought to be mostly determined by temperature and food availability throughout the year. Monthly samples of Calanus chilensis Brodsky, obtained at a fixed station in Bay of San Jorge, Antofagasta, along with vertical profiles of temperature, were used to analyze seasonal variation of prosome length, ''structural dry weight'' (SW) (lipid-discounted) and nutritional condition of adult females, copepodites CV and CIV. Previous studies suggest that body length may be more affected by temperature than food. Individual weight, on the other hand, seems to be more affected by food condition, although this weight may show a certain stability despite growing condition if lipids are discounted, i.e. SW. In this study body length of adults ''females'' and stage CV were negatively correlated to mean temperature of the water colunm, although length of CIV did not show such correlation. SW and a condition index (Ci) show a seasonal pattern not associated with temperature. Therefore we found no support for the hypothesis of stability of SW. However, this species appears to continuously reproduce through the year, so that there is a possibility that a seasonal pattern of SW estimates in adult ''females'' may result from differences in amounts of reproductive material, even although SW might still remain stable in nature. Measured and estimated mean SW were plotted against stages of development resulting an exponential-like curve. This suggests that growth may be exponential and hence not limited by food conditions. However such conclusion needs to be rested by having estimates of stage durations, or the time required to reach these values of SW.

AB  - Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of coastal waters is changing the habitat and food resources of bay scallops, Argopecten irradians. As land-derived nitrogen (N) enters estuaries, phytoplankton abundance, particulate organic matter, and nitrogen content of seston may increase, providing a higher quantity and quality of food. Understanding these changes is important for monitoring declining populations or developing field aquaculture systems. To examine if changes in food resources due to nutrient enrichment will affect growth, condition, reproductive potential, and mortality, we conducted a field experiment in seven estuaries each having a different land-derived N load. We placed juvenile bay scallops within these estuaries for approximately 12 weeks while monitoring food quantity and quality. Stable isotopic signatures suggested that scallops assimilated food from the specific estuaries in which we placed them. Growth rates were relatively high and did not increase with higher phytoplankton concentrations, suggesting that at the densities we deployed, ambient phytoplankton concentrations were in excess of consumption ability. Growth rates decreased at sites with lower salinities, and where high densities of competitors (barnacles and slipper shells) fortuitously settled on the scallops. Condition index significantly increased with higher growth rates. Gonad index and mortality were not related to food resources, but mortality increased with lower salinities. Land-derived N load seems unlikely to directly alter condition, reproductive potential, or mortality. These results suggest that estuaries undergoing anthropogenic nutrient additions may provide food concentrations above the maximum ration assimilable, resulting in high bay scallop growth rates.

AB  - The short term variability of Cd and Pb in Mytilus californianus in relation to upwelling events was studied. Sea water and mussel samples were taken daily for 4 weeks during the upwelling season (late summer) on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Upwelling indicators (PO4, T and S) were measured and related to the variations in dissolved Cd and Pb in sea water. High variability in Cd and Pb mussel concentrations were detected, with significant differences found from one day to another. After normalizing, to account for the variability due to the condition of the mussel, significant differences among samples were still detected. The differences in mussel Cd were associated with the variations in dissolved Cd due to upwelling. Mussel Bb, however, was not related to variations in dissolved Pb. Principal component analysis was used to unravel patterns of variation among all variables measured. Parallel to the sampling of natural mussel beds, a transplant experiment was performed to compare the variability of intertidal vs. subtidal mussels. The transplanted mussels exhibited a less variable condition index and revealed more clearly the relation of dissolved Cd with the concentrations in the mussels. Lead in mussels, again, did not show a relationship with dissolved Pb. In addition, the mantle edge (from 3 days with highest and lowest Cd concentrations) was analyzed as an alternative indicator which could exhibit less variability. The Cd variability in the mantle edge was compared with that of the gills and the remainder. The mantle edge, even though it showed less variability than the gills and the remainder, still exhibited significant differences between days. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The Asian green mussel Perna viridis is tolerant to environmental stress, but its robustness varies between populations from habitats that differ in quality. So far, it is unclear whether local adaptations through stress-induced selection or phenotypic plasticity are responsible for these inter- population differences. We tested for the relevance of both mechanisms by comparing survival under hypoxia in mussels that were transplanted from an anthropogenically impacted (Jakarta Bay, Indonesia) to a natural habitat (Lada Bay, Indonesia) and vice versa. Mussels were retrieved 8 weeks after transplantation and exposed to hypoxia in the laboratory. Additional hypoxia tests were conducted with juvenile mussels collected directly from both sites. To elucidate possible relationships between habitat quality and mussel tolerance, we monitored concentrations of inorganic nutrients, temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, phytoplankton density and the mussels' body condition index (BCI) for 20 months before, during and after the experiments. Survival under hypoxia depended mainly on the quality of the habitat where the mussels lived before the hypoxia tests and only to a small degree on their site of origin. Furthermore, stress tolerance was only higher in Jakarta than in Lada Bay mussels when the BCIs were substantially higher, which in turn correlated with the phytoplankton densities. We explain why phenotypic plasticity and high BCIs are more likely the causes of population-specific differences in hypoxia tolerance in P. viridis than stress-induced selection for robust genotypes. This is relevant to understanding the role of P. viridis as mariculture organism in eutrophic ecosystems and invasive species in the (sub)tropical world.

AB  - Across the globe, restoration efforts are stemming the loss of native oyster reefs and the ecosystem services they provide, but these efforts will need to consider climate change in order to be sustainable. South-eastern Australia is the focus of restoring the once abundant oyster Ostrea angasi. This region is also a climate change 'hot spot' where the ocean is warming rapidly, with the potential to be exacerbated by marine heatwaves and coastal acidification. In this study, the impact of near-future (similar to 2050) elevated temperature and pCO(2) on O. angasi was determined and considered in context with concerns for the long-term sustainability of oyster reef restoration efforts. Oysters were exposed to ambient and elevated pCO(2) concentrations (mean +/- SE: 408 +/- 19.8 and 1070 +/- 53.4 mu atm) and ambient and elevated temperatures (22.78 +/- 0.17 and 25.73 +/- 0.21 degrees C) for 10 wk in outdoor flow-through mesocosms. Shell growth, condition index, standard metabolic rate (SMR), extracellular pH and survival were measured. Elevated temperature caused high mortality (36 %) and decreased the condition of oysters (33 %). Elevated pCO(2) increased SMR almost 4-fold and lowered the extracellular pH of O. angasi by a mean 0.29 pH units. In combination, elevated pCO(2) and temperature ameliorated effects on SMR and survivorship of oysters. O. angasi appears to be living near the limits of its thermal tolerance. Restoration projects will need to account for the temperature sensitivity of this species and its changing habitat to 'climate proof' long-term restoration efforts.

AB  - A natural river system is organized as a nested hierarchy of interconnected habitats with specific environmental conditions to which the biological community has adapted. Due to this hierarchical structure, identifying the role of different stressors on the biological community is a formidable task. Efforts trying to link stressors to biological integrity have always been bound to the geographic scale of the selected study area, leading to scale-specific results. In this research, an attempt is made to lift this limitation and develop a hierarchical, scale-sensitive methodology that can identify the significant environmental stressors to the biological community at different scales. Sites with similar background environmental conditions are clustered using self-organizing maps (SOM). This is used to identify stressors which affect the biological community throughout the area of study - called environmental gradients or large-scale stressors. Subsequently, these clusters of similar observations (sampling sites) are progressively sub-divided using environmental variables with a significant but localized effect on the biological community - called small-scale stressors. A parent group of sites is split only when the resulting sub-groups have significantly different biological responses. At the end of this recursive sites decomposition procedure, the original set of observations is organized as a tree of environmentally homogeneous groups of observations characterized by unique biological responses to multiple stressors with different geographic extents. The developed hierarchical analysis methodology has been validated using a large-size dataset of environmental observations from the State of Ohio. Our results show that habitat degradation and increased nutrient loading are the large-scale stressors with a widespread impact in Ohio. Other stressors, such as heavy metals, pH or nitrate concentrations have significant albeit localized effects on biological integrity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This is the first in a series of three articles designed to establish empirically defined biological indicators and thresholds for impairment for urbanized catchments, and to describe a process by which the biological condition of waterbodies in urbanized catchments can be applied. This article describes alternative gradients of urbanization for assessing and selecting a nationally applicable biological index (article 2 Purcell et al., this issue) and defining the potential of biological communities within a gradient of cumulative stressors (article 3 -Paul et al. this issue). Gradients were designed to represent the most prominent mosaic of stressors found in urban settings. A primary urban gradient was assembled based on readily obtained information of urbanization to include three broad-scale parameters: percent urban land use/land cover, population density, and road density. This gradient was used as the standard by which alternative urban gradients, which included fine-scale instream chemical and hydrologic parameters, were assessed. Five alternative gradients were developed to provide numerous environmental management options based on availability of data from water program resources. The urban gradients were developed with the intent that they be applied throughout the country; therefore, data from three different regions of the United States (Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Pacific Coast) were used to validate the urban gradient model. Our study showed that a relatively straightforward stressor gradient consisting of human population density, road density, and urban land use is useful in providing a framework for developing relevant biological indicators and evaluating the potential of biological communities as a basis for assessing attainment of designated aquatic life use.

AB  - The concentration, distribution and pollution status caused by toxic metals, i.e. (Hg, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Cd and Zn) were measured in sediments from two water reservoir (Tong reservoir and Yang reservoir) in southeast coastal area in China by using enrichment factor (EF), potential ecological risk index , total potential ecological risk (PER) and principal component analysis. Results showed that most of the sediment samples collected from both water reservoirs were moderately to heavily polluted by Cu, Cr, Cd, Hg, Pb and Zn. In Tong reservoir mean concentrations of the various toxic metals, i.e. (Hg, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn) were 0.26, 1.64, 81.04, 46.68, 208.81, 88.43 and 165.27 mg kg(-1), respectively while in Yang reservoir mean concentrations of the various toxic metals, i.e. (Hg, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn) were 0.28, 0.51, 21.38, 24.44, 322.37, 47.72 and 70.84 mg kg(-1), respectively. Results of EF showed that in Tong reservoir Cu, Hg and Pb ranged from moderately enrichment to moderately severe enrichment while Cr and Zn were in the range of moderately enrichment. Similarly, cadmium (Cd) was found in the range of severe enrichment. While in Yang reservoir; Cu, Cr, Pb and Zn has no enrichment but Cd and Hg were characterised as moderately enriched. Moreover, PER in Tong reservoir was ranged, 142.71-415.07 with an average of 234.67 in all the core sediments, which showed that PER of Tong reservoir is in the range of considerable risk. While total PER of Yang reservoir was in the range of moderate risk to considerable risk. Among both water reservoirs, sediments samples collected from the Tong reservoir were more contaminated than Yang reservoir. The extent of pollution caused by toxic metals in both water reservoirs indicates that condition is much alarming for biota and for residents in surrounding area of both reservoirs. Sediments samples of both reservoirs were extensively polluted by mainly two toxic metals, i.e. (Cd and Hg) while moderately less polluted by other toxic metals. Accumulation of Cd and Hg in both reservoirs was predominantly influenced by agricultural practices, human activities, residential run-off and soil erosion.

AB  - Recent comparisons of benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) sampling protocols have shown that samples collected from different habitat types generally produce consistent stream classifications and assessments. However, these comparisons usually have not included biological endpoints used by monitoring agencies, such as multimetric indices (e.g., benthic index of biotic integrity [B-IBI]) or observed-to-expected (O/E) indices of taxonomic completeness, as target variables, and estimates of method precision are rarely provided. Targeted-riffle (TR) and reach-wide (RW) benthic samples have been collected at thousands of sites across the western USA, but little guidance is available for understanding: 1) the extent to which raw data sets can be combined in regional or large-scale analyses, 2) the degree of precision afforded by each method, or 3) the efficacy of cross-application of biological indicators derived from one sample type to the other. To address these issues, we used data from 193 sites in California where the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) collected the 2 samples side by side. We also conducted a separate study wherein 3 replicates of each sample type were collected from 15 streams to estimate minimum detectable difference (MDD) as a measure of each method's precision. Metrics calculated from TR and RW samples showed similar dose-response relationships to stressor gradients and similar raw scoring ranges. Biological indices (B-IBI, O/E-0, and O/E-50) derived from RW samples were more precise than those derived from TR samples, but precision differences were not substantial. On average, pairwise differences in any index between TR and RW sample types were much less than the MDD associated with either sampling method. We observed a weak but consistent bias toward higher O/E-50 scores from TR samples than from RW samples at the highest elevations and in the largest watersheds. Broad-scale condition assessments were nearly identical when B-IBI and O/E-0 were used as endpoints, and assessments based on O/E-50 were only slightly less similar. Our analyses indicate that raw data sets and biological indicators derived from TR and RW samples may be generally interchangeable when used in ambient biomonitoring programs.

AB  - The whitemouth croaker, Micropogonias furnieri, which is exploited off the state of Maranhao, Brazil, reinforces the need for maintenance programs of natural stocks of this species to assist in the management of this exploited resource. The aim of the present study was to describe aspects regarding its reproductive characteristics (gonadosomatic index and condition factor) and also the length distribution and weight-length relationships. The fish were caught in Lencois Bay in the state of Maranhao (eastern Amazon) between June 2010 and July 2011. A total of 570 individuals were caught (318 males and 252 females). Differences in length were found between the sexes, with females larger than males. The sex ratio indicated a tendency for females to be more abundant in the rainy season (first semester), whereas males predominated in the dry season (second semester). The weight-length relationship indicated negative allometric growth for both sexes. The analysis of the variation in the condition factor suggests that lower values coincided with higher gonadosomatic index values and that this factor is a good reproductive indicator for M. furnieri in the region.

AB  - Sediments from 33 sampling stations were collected and analyzed to characterize the benthic community and the sedimentology of a shallow coast sector of Bagnoli, Naples Bay (Italy). Multibeam bathymetry was also used to properly fit the morphology of the environment with the spatial arrangement of the benthic community. For each station, a number of ecological indicators were computed and a hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out to identify groups of stations that were similar in terms of species composition. Results showed well-structured benthic communities and provided a first biocenothic map of the area, allowing a first step toward a better understanding of the true environmental state of Bagnoli coastal sector.

AB  - Four indices of body condition: visual body condition (VBC), packed cell volume (PCV), marrow dry weight (MDW), and kidney fat index (KFI) were examined in impala over a 12-month period in a managed area and an unmanaged, overpopulated area in the Mlawula-Mbuluzi-Simunye Nature Reserve and Protected Area complex in north-eastern Swaziland. All of the body condition indices were significantly (p < 0,05) higher in adults (> 24 months of age) than in lambs (less than or equal to 12 months) and yearlings (13 to 24 months), There was a significant seasonal variation in PCV and MDW in lambs, but not in the yearlings and adults. KFI varied with the reproductive status of adults, but there was only a slight seasonal variation in lambs and yearlings (p approximate to 0,1). VBC was poor in lambs, yearlings and adult males in the winter and spring, and good in the summer. In adult females VBC was fair/good in the winter and poor in the summer when they were nursing. VBC and PCV were lower in lambs in the unmanaged area than the managed area, and VBC, PCV, MDW and KFI were lower in yearlings in the unmanaged area. Only a combined index, MDW < 85% and KFI < 20%, differed significantly between areas in the adults. Despite significant differences between areas, the body condition indices were not sensitive indicators of habitat condition. The indices may provide information on the relative condition of individuals, but habitat effects may be restricted to small segments of the population, and can only be assessed when there is a proper control group.

AB  - Recruitment of marine fishes is largely determined by biological and environmental factors acting on early-life stages. Subtle changes in larval condition in response to their environment can result in order-of-magnitude differences in year-class-strength. Overlap of larval production and favorable feeding conditions drives recruitment for many temperate marine fishes, but challenges associated with studying marine larvae have made it difficult to assess how environmental processes act on individual larvae to affect their growth and survival. We conducted a 2-yr study in an upwelling system to assess the influence of regional productivity, temperature, and larval condition in explaining growth in rockfishes (Sebastes spp.). We employed otolith microstructure and satellite imagery to measure initial larval growth and estimate the productivity and temperature experienced by individuals to determine their relative importance in subsequent growth at metamorphosis. We compared model performance using indexed environmental conditions scaled over three different regions. In both years, net primary productivity explained the most variation in pre-metamorphic growth relative to temperature and initial growth. This relationship was consistent across spatial regions, although model fit was highest using indices scaled to the south continental shelf region. Recent settlement, juvenile recruitment, and individual growth were significantly higher in a year when productivity bloomed earlier and individual larvae experienced higher levels of productivity. Thus, this link between regional scale productivity, growth, and subsequent year-class strength supports the hypothesis that large-scale oceanographic processes stimulating upwelling and secondary production are primary drivers of larval growth and recruitment in rockfishes.

AB  - At present, most estuarine ecological risk studies are based on terrestrial ecosystem models, which ignore spatial heterogeneity. The Daliao River estuary has representative characteristics of many estuaries in China, and we used this estuary as the study area to formulate an estuarine ecological risk evaluation model. Targeting the estuary's special hydrodynamic condition, this model incorporated variables that were under the influence of human activities and used them as the major factors for partitioning sections of the river according to risk values. It also explored the spatial and temporal distribution laws of estuarine ecological risk. The results showed that, on the whole, the ecological risk of the Daliao River estuary area was relatively high. At a temporal level, runoff was the main factor resulting in differences in ecological risk, while at the spatial level, the ecological risk index was affected by pollutants carried by runoff from upstream, as well as downstream pollution emissions and dilution by seawater at the mouth of the sea. The characteristics of this model make it possible to simulate the spatial and temporal risk distribution in different regions and under different rainfall regimes. This model can thus be applied in other estuarine areas and provides some technical support for analysis and control of ecological destruction in estuary areas.

AB  - Data on the composition of organic compounds in the sediments of freshwater lakes Kirek and Murashka and salt lakes Tus and Mormyshanskoe (Southern Siberia) have been obtained for the first time. The identified compounds include acyclic, alicyclic, and aromatic hydrocarbons; aliphatic acids of normal structure and their esters; acyclic aldehydes; acyclic and alicyclic ketones; acyclic, alicyclic, and aromatic spirits; triphenylphosphates; furans; and thiophenes. Also identified were specific organic compounds intrinsic in lakes with different degree of mineralization and the main sources of organic compounds in sediments. The characteristics of the environmental state of the examined lakes were determined. The maximum set of organic compounds of anthropogenic origin was found in the sediments of Lake Mormyshanskoe.

AB  - The Gulf of Mexico (GOM) is the primary spawning ground for western Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus). In this work, information reported by previous studies about the preferred environmental conditions for the occurrence of bluefin tuna larvae in the GOM is integrated into a dimensionless index, the BFT_Index. This index is used to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of areas with favorable environmental conditions for larvae within the GOM during 1993-2011. The main findings of this work are that: (i) the proposed index successfully captures the spatial and temporal variability in the insitu occurrence of bluefin tuna larvae; (ii) areas with favorable environmental conditions for larvae in the GOM exhibit year-to-year spatial and temporal variability linked with mesoscale ocean features and sea surface temperature; and (iii) comparison of the BFT_Index-derived variability with recruitment of age-0 fish estimated from recent stock assessment indicates that changes in environmental conditions may drive a relevant component (similar to 58%) of the recruitment variability. The comparison with the recruitment dataset further revealed the existence of key regions linked with recruitment in the central/northern GOM, and that the Loop Current may function as a trap for larvae, possibly leading to low survival rates. Above (below) average conditions for occurrence of larvae in the GOM during spring were observed in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2006-2008, and 2011 (1994, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2003 and 2010). Results reported here have potential applications to assessment of bluefin tuna.

AB  - In the arid and semiarid environments of the world, microhabitats serve as models for the structure of vegetation communities. The goal of this study was to identify differences in the structures of the herbaceous communities growing on a crystalline substrate and those growing on a sedimentary substrate in a semiarid region of northeastern Brazil. One hundred 1 x 1 m plots were established in each area for quantitative sampling, with 69 species recorded in the crystalline area and 76 in the sedimentary area. The average plant density was higher in the sedimentary area, and average diameters and heights were greater in the crystalline area. The families and species with a high Importance Value Index (IVI) and a high Mixed Ecological Value Index (MEVI) differed between the areas. Of the species with high densities, only four were found in both areas. Shannon-Weiner diversity index values in the crystalline (2.96 nats/ind.(-1)) and sedimentary (2.89 nats/ind.(-1)) areas were similar. Evenness values on both substrates were also similar (0.72 and 0.71 in the crystalline and sedimentary areas, respectively). This study shows that variations in plant establishment conditions between crystalline and sedimentary areas in a semiarid region of northeastern Brazil should be considered as structure-modeling factors for the herbaceous community.

AB  - The causes of moss rarity were analysed in three neighbouring countries. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, situated along the coast of the Baltic Sea, cover together 175,000 km(2). They belong to the same vegetation zone, and have similar economic and natural history, but there are still certain differences in climate, bedrock, soil and land use.
   Three frequency groups of mosses, altogether 184 species, were compared in this study: (1) mosses present in all three countries and frequent in every country, (2) mosses present in all three countries, but rare in every country and (3) mosses present in only one country and rare in this country, i.e. very rare mosses. The distribution of moss species according to families, life history characters (sexuality, spore size and life span) and ecological characters (substrate and community type preferences) were compared among these three groups.
   There were differences in the distribution of species according to families between the three frequency groups. Frequent and rare moss species groups were also characterised by different life historical (life span) and ecological characteristics (substrate pH and community type). Comparison of ecological indexes in the group of country specific mosses revealed that species preferences regarding soil alkalinity follow the pattern of the distribution of alkaline soils in the three countries. Species occurring in the most southern country - Lithuania - are characterised by highest temperature indexes.
   On the basis of the studied species we can conclude that taxonomical and life historical trends explain one part of rarity in the studied region, while local ecological conditions in connection with land use are responsible for the other part. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Application of probabilistic risk analysis to human health and ecological risk assessment is a young science. Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA), as exemplified by Monte Carlo Analysis (MCA), is more suitable to quantify the confidence or level of uncertainty in risk estimates compared with the traditional point estimate approach. Within the United States Environmental protection Agency (USEPA) the Office of Emergency and Remedial Response (OERR) is implementing PRA as part of the Superfund administrative reform activities. The OERR is completing a guidance document accompanied by a workbook. OERR is continuing its outreach effort to present PRA to the public and USEPA staff, and is organizing a training course. This paper presents an overview of the OERR's PRA implementation effort to date.

AB  - Drought as a natural disaster impresses people living. The main tool in better management of such phenomena is to explain its characteristics, using drought indices. The indices use precipitation, temperature, streamflow, and other hydrological variables to explain such events. In this study, standardized precipitation index (SPI) and stream-flow drought index (SDI) were used to develop a new combined drought index (CDI) based on copula functions. The proposed index function was evaluated in Khuzestan, Yazd and Golestan provinces of Iran from 1982 to 2012. These areas introduce different climate conditions. The index was analyzed temporally and spatially. In the temporal analysis, CDI was calculated separately for each station and the finest index was chosen by Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Chi-squared tests. In the spatial analysis, CDI was computed for two main scenarios and twenty sub-scenarios for the whole area of Golestan Province. The optimum index was chosen based on comparison with initial SPI and SDI. The results showed that CDI is more meticulous than both singular SPI and SDI, as it can trace a drought onset earlier and drought duration more accurate than the two individual indices and obviously display extreme states.

AB  - Eight years of fire weather data from sixteen representative weather stations within the Boreal Forest Natural Region of Alberta were used to compile reference weather streams for low, moderate, high, very high and extreme Fire Weather Index (FWI) conditions. These reference weather streams were adjusted to create daily weather streams for input into Prometheus - the Canadian Wildland Fire Growth Model. Similar fire weather analyses were completed using Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) output for northern Alberta (174 grid cells) to generate FWI class datasets ( temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, Fine Fuel Moisture Code, Duff Moisture Code and Drought Code) for 1 x, 2 x and 3 x CO2 scenarios. The relative differences between the CRCM scenario outputs were then used to adjust the reference weather streams for northern Alberta. Area burned was calculated for 21 fires, fire weather classes and climate change scenarios. The area burned estimates were weighted based on the historical frequency of area burned by FWI class, and then normalized to derive relative area burned estimates for each climate change scenario. The 2 x and 3 x CO2 scenarios resulted in a relative increase in area burned of 12.9 and 29.4% from the reference 1 x CO2 scenario.

AB  - The absence of a rational, comprehensive, flexible and easy to use method with minimum data requirement to determine rivers' environmental flow requirements is the main motivation for this research. Based on the microhabitat preferences of index species, hydrological (the Tennant and Q (95)) and hydraulic methods for determining the environmental flow requirement (EFR) are compared. Using an ad hoc procedure, the important species of a river at the southern part of the Caspian Sea in Iran were distinguished, and the discharges to maintain the microhabitat (depth and velocity) in critical months were calculated. The observed differences between the index species' required velocity and depth and those suggested by the Tennant method emphasize the importance of the rivers morphological properties for this method application. Allocating EFR by the Tennant and Q (95) methods would degrade the aquatic life. The EFR determined by the hydraulic method is equal to 95 % of the average annual discharge, which could maintain the ecological habitat in good situation, but may provoke a conflict in the region. The Tennant, Q (95) and hydraulic methods allocate EFR as 14, 36 and 79 % of the annual flow volume, respectively. Developing a new combined method based on using the hydraulic method's discharge for critical months and the Tennant method suggestion for the excellent condition in other months allocates 50 % of the average annual discharge. This new method is a compromise between protecting environment and considering the water rights of rivers' flow consumers and is suggested specially for dry regions of the world.

AB  - The synthetic estrogen 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2) has been increasingly detected in sewage effluents in the last two decades. The aim of the present study was determined if EE2 exposure adversely affected reproduction in internally fertilizing fish species Jenynsia multidentata. Sexual behavior, brain and gonadal aromatase expression as well as sperm quality were evaluated. The brain aromatase expression, reproductive behavior, spermatozoa viability and gonadosomatic index were sensitive biomarkers of EE2 effects on this species. The condition factor, hepatosomatic index, gonadal aromatase expression, sperm count and sperm velocities were unaltered after EE2 exposure. The present work highlights the importance of using a combination of several biomarkers to study the effects of estrogenic compounds, especially when trying to link these results to potential population-level effects.

AB  - Wine production in most countries is based on the use of commercial strains leading to the colonisation of the wineries by these strains with the consequent reduction of autochthonous biodiversity. This implies that wine styles could therefore become standardised. The vineyard could be an important source of native yeasts of oenological interest. For this reason the objective of this study was to compare two agronomic conditions with the aim of preserving yeast biodiversity in the vineyard. A three year sampling plan was designed to evaluate the influence of different agronomic parameters on the biodiversity of fermentative grape yeasts. Thus two vineyards, one organic and one conventional, with three different grape varieties (Shiraz. Grenache and Barbera) were chosen. In total, 27 samples were collected from both vineyards. Of these, 1080 colonies were isolated and a total of 9 species were identified. The strains identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae were genotyped by microsatellite analysis obtaining nine different electrophoretic patterns. Classical ecology indexes were used to obtain the richness (S), the biodiversity (H') and the dominance (D) of the species studied. The results indicated a clear influence on grape associated yeast diversity of the phytosanitary treatment used in the vineyard. This is the first time that classical ecology indexes have been used to study the ecology of the spontaneous fermentation of grape musts and the species Candida sorbosa and Pichia toletana have been described in vineyards of the Madrid winegrowing region.

AB  - A 12-week feeding trial was conducted to study the effect of dietary lipid level on growth performance of juvenile Sacramento splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus at 18degreesC. We selected this temperature to simulate their natural habitats, although an earlier study showed that their optimum temperature was 22-26degreesC. Six isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets were formulated to contain 2-12% lipid in 2% increments and dietary lipid was an equal mix of corn oil and Q liver oil. Fish with an average initial body weigh of 9.0+/-0.2 g (mean+/-SE, n=24) were kept in a 24-tank flow-through system with 15 fish per tank, and each die; was randomly assigned to four replicate tanks of fish. Fish were fed 3.0% of their body weight per day by automatic feeders, which dispensed a small amount of feed every few minutes in daylight hours. Body weight and feed efficiency increased significantly with increasing dietary lipid level tip to 8%. Fish fed the diet containing 8% lipid showed significantly higher body weight increase and feed efficiency than those fed the diets containing less than 6% lipid. Dietary lipid level did not affect the hepatosomatic index, condition factor., and intraperitoneal fat ratio. Whole-body moisture was significantly lower but lipid was higher in fish fed the diet containing 8% lipid than in those fed the diets containing less than 6% lipid. Histological analysis revealed a higher prevalence of hepatocellular fatty vacuolation in fish fed the diet containing 12% lipid. Based on a broken-line analysis, a dietary lipid level of 8.4% is recommended for juvenile splittail reared at 18degreesC.

AB  - Heavy metals (HM) belong to the main pollutants of the hydrosphere. We aim at defining the degree of pollution of small rivers surface water in the Oka river basin with HM. We have made a long-term monitoring on the ecological range, which is a large-scale natural model created for complex researches, for assessing the degree of anthropogenic influence on ecosystems' state and getting information necessary for rational nature management both on local and regional levels. The monitoring program included estimation of ecological state of surface and ground water, hydrobiological and microbiological researches. The analysis of the information received during the monitoring enabled to establish that the maximum level of HM concentration in water is observed in winter period, and the minimum one - in summer period. There is a certain dependency in HM concentration both in ground waters and basin water. Increase of HM concentration in ground water is observed from April till July. Then HM concentration gradually diminishes and riches its minimum in August. Then from August gradual increase of HM concentration is registered in all wells and it reaches its maximum in December, which is followed by gradual decrease till March. As a part of the monitoring held on the territory of ecological range, a microbiological experiment was made that enables to define influence of different degrees of HM concentration on microorganisms.
   All the variants of the experiment are marked by decrease of bacteria colonies with increase of HM concentration in water, that indicates demise of microbes that are the most sensitive to toxicants. Such a situation may affect self-cleaning ability of the basin. The complex research of the most important component of the landscape of the Oka river basin, of the small river, show a huge anthropogenic influence on its ecosystem caused by agricultural activity that is indicated by excessive concentration of HM in surface and ground water and hydrobiological indicators. Thus there is an ecologically dangerous situation on the territory of the Oka river basin with a big amount of such water bodies.

AB  - Species succession of a natural bacterial community was indicated by the Gram stain index (GSI) using an experimental nutrient gradient in an oligotrophic pond created with an in situ gradostat. Various trophic conditions, ranging from eutrophic to mesotrophic, were formed experimentally with continuous inflow of sterile peptone solution in the gradostat, while the water mass outside the gradostat was oligotrophic. The GSI spectra of the natural bacterial populations show different profiles in accordance with the trophic level of the ambient water and the time progression of adaptation to different levels of eutrophication. Therefore, GSI can be used as a potential indicator of organic pollution in aquatic environments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Altered hydrology has become a major threat to the Florida Everglades. As water was diverted to accommodate the increasing demands of the expanding urban and utilized to support agricultural areas, an alteration to the patterns of ridge and slough occurred in the Everglades. Landscape indices were developed to quantify the spatial complexity of the ridge and slough landscape and to detect thresholds for deteriorating or deteriorated patterns. The analysis provides a framework for scientists and managers to quantify the effects of changing hydropatterns, and flow dynamics upon the Everglades ridge and slough community.
   Pattern analysis suggested that there is a wide range in ridge and slough patterns in the Everglades which can be described with landscape indices. These patterns may represent natural, deteriorating or deteriorated states of spatial complexity in the ecosystem. Lacunarity index (LI), ranging from 1.75 to 4.45 indicated a natural pattern while an LI below 1.75 or above 4.45 represented deteriorating or deteriorated patterns. It is assumed that natural patterns were created, maintained and balanced by historical flows through the system; while deteriorating or deteriorated patterns are due to hydrologic alteration. The results suggest that changes in landscape patterns are gradual and happen within the constraint of natural variations (e.g., 1.75 < LI < 4.45) or can drastically change due to a trigger or dynamic process leading to a loss of resilience. This loss of resilience can pave the way for a catastrophic shift which might have a threshold useful for predictions of success of flow restoration in the Everglades. Scientists and managers can utilize these metrics and their threshold values as one tool in evaluating different restoration alternatives. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Health of agricultural soils depends largely on conservation management to promote soil organic matter accumulation. Total soil organic matter changes slowly, but active fractions are more dynamic. A key indicator of healthy soil is potential biological activity, which could be measured rapidly with soil testing services via the flush of CO2 during 1 to 3 d following rewetting of dried soil. The flush of CO2 is related to soil microbial biomass C and has repeatedly been shown strongly related to net N mineralization during standard aerobic incubations. New research is documenting the close association with plant N uptake in semicontrolled greenhouse conditions (r(2) = 0.77, n = 36). Field calibrations are underway to relate the flush of CO2 to the need for in-season N requirement in a variety of crops. An index of soil biological activity can and should be determined to help predict soil health and soil N availability.

AB  - Prediction of ecosystem response to global environmental change is a pressing scientific challenge of major societal relevance. Many ecosystems display nonlinear responses to environmental change, and may even undergo practically irreversible 'regime shifts' that initiate ecosystem collapse. Recently, early warning signals based on spatiotemporal metrics have been proposed for the identification of impending regime shifts. The rapidly increasing availability of remotely sensed data provides excellent opportunities to apply such model-based spatial early warning signals in the real world, to assess ecosystem resilience and identify impending regime shifts induced by global change. Such information would allow land-managers and policy makers to interfere and avoid catastrophic shifts, but also to induce regime shifts that move ecosystems to a desired state. Here, we show that the application of spatial early warning signals in real-world landscapes presents unique and unexpected challenges, and may result in misleading conclusions when employed without careful consideration of the spatial data and processes at hand. We identify key practical and theoretical issues and provide guidelines for applying spatial early warning signals in heterogeneous, real-world landscapes based on literature review and examples from real-world data. Major identified issues include (1) spatial heterogeneity in real-world landscapes may enhance reversibility of regime shifts and boost landscape-level resilience to environmental change (2) ecosystem states are often difficult to define, while these definitions have great impact on spatial early warning signals and (3) spatial environmental variability and socio-economic factors may affect spatial patterns, spatial early warning signals and associated regime shift predictions. We propose a novel framework, shifting from an ecosystem perspective towards a landscape approach. The framework can be used to identify conditions under which resilience assessment with spatial remotely sensed data may be successful, to support well-informed application of spatial early warning signals, and to improve predictions of ecosystem responses to global environmental change.

AB  - Biological assessment of aquatic resources requires the availability of bioassessment tools that work in all waterbody types and regions of interest. Developing new assessment tools may require several years of data collection and substantial investment of resources, which may not be an option for some aquatic resource managers. Adapting tools developed for different regions or wetland types may be an attractive alternative to developing new indices, provided they work well in the novel setting. In this study, we explore the transferability of two bioassessment indices for application to depressional wetlands in California, which are wetland type of management concern but for which bioassessment tools don't currently exist. We tested the applicability of a depressional wetland invertebrate index of biotic integrity (IBI) developed in the San Francisco Bay region of northern California for application in the drier regions of southern California (i.e. geographic transferability), and the ability to apply a riverine benthic diatom IBI to benthic diatoms in depressional wetlands (i.e. water body type transferability). We evaluated the accuracy and responsiveness of the existing Indices for use in depressional wetlands and refined reference definitions and recalibrated thresholds relative to stressor gradients to maximize index performance. Performance of the adapted indices was compared to that of an existing habitat assessment tool (the California Rapid Assessment Method; CRAM) that has been developed for statewide application of depressional wetlands. Finally, we demonstrate application of the revised indices for ambient assessment of depressional wetland condition in southern California. Recalibrating both the macroinvertebrate and diatom indices to reference thresholds based on nutrient concentrations resulted in lower coefficient of variation among reference sites, greater differentiation between reference and non-reference and stronger relationship with stressors than when reference thresholds were based on landscape disturbance. Overall, the simple adjustment of the reference definition allowed us to transfer the indices with no structural changes to the metrics. This approach can facilitate future index adaptations that allow practitioners to include waterbody types for which there is no current index into routine biomonitoring programs.

AB  - We found that the Florida Lake Vegetation Index (LVI) did not identify Florida lakes that were impaired due to excess loading of phosphorus or nitrogen from anthropogenic sources. The index is based on 4 plant metrics: the Coefficient of Conservatism of the dominant or co-dominant taxa, the percent of sensitive taxa, the percent of native taxa, and the percent of invasive exotic taxa. Our analysis of the data used by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to establish and calibrate this biotic index found no link between nutrient concentrations and the LVI. The LVI was primarily associated with the pH and specific conductance of the lake waters, with the best scores found in acidic lakes and the poorest scores in more alkaline lakes. These variables are the result of natural gradients, not pollution, and are not included in the calculation of the LVI. Our study illustrates the importance of considering natural factors that determine the value of any index of biological integrity before it is used to indicate anthropogenic pollution.

AB  - The value of proline accumulation as a criterion in selecting for drought-tolerance, was evaluated in four tobacco cultivars of differing drought-tolerance. Proline determination, measurement and calculation of a membrane integrity index (MII), and ultrastructural observations were conducted simultaneously under controlled environmental conditions during the stress period. Water stress of increasing severity (0.2 - 0.3 MPa d-1) that ranged from light (-0.52 MPa) to severe (-2.51 MPa) was induced by withholding water. A substantial accumulation of proline was observed in all four cultivars, the extent of which correlated positively with their individual drought-tolerance. Ultrastructural observation indicated that the drought-tolerant cultivars mobilized the, more than adequate, store of starch to a greater extent than the drought-sensitive cultivars during stress. Water stress-induced membrane damage occurred earlier and was much more severe in the drought-sensitive cultivars, as their MII-values already rose to between 20.4 % and 23.4 % at a PSI(L) of -1.27 MPa, while those of the drought-tolerant cultivars only reached values of 18.5 % and 20.9 % at a PSI(L) of -1.67 MPa. The PSI(L) at which proline levels start to increase dramatically (the shorter the response time the better) and the end concentrations of proline accumulated, are advocated as criteria to be used in selecting for drought-tolerant tobacco genotypes as early as the F1- or F2-generations.

AB  - Boreal peat bogs contain distinctive insects in addition to widely distributed generalists, including species restricted to bogs (tyrphobionts) and species characteristic of bogs but not confined to them (tyrphophiles). Bogs raised above the water table form characteristic habitat islands in southern boreal and temperate forest zones. Many bogs have persisted for hundreds and even thousands of years, preserving relict ecosystems related to subarctic biomes. The historical development and nature of individual bogs are reflected by differences among their insects, which are of great biogeographical and ecological interest. The environmental sensitivity of bogs also makes insects valuable as bioindicators. Moreover, few readily accessible bogs remain in a natural state. Given the scientific interest of bog insects and the fact that each relict bog habitat island is unique, further studies of the diversity of bog faunas are merited, and the conservation of these habitats should be strongly supported by entomologists.

AB  - We used growth rates (estimated from otolith microstructure), morphometric (Fulton's K condition index) and lipid (triacylglycerols: sterols ratio, TAG:ST) condition indices measured on 0-group juveniles of common sole, to compare the habitat quality of 7 nursery grounds with differing levels of anthropogenic pressure. Along the French coast of the Southern Bight of the North Sea and the Eastern English Channel, we compared 2 sites located in intensively developed and industrialised harbour areas (Dunkerque and Calais), 1 site in a medium and less industrialised harbour (Boulogne), 1 site near a large and polluted estuary (Seine) and 3 other sites located near small estuaries less subject to human pressure (Canche, Authie and Somme). Indicators of human disturbance as well as hydrological and biotic data were used to establish between-site differences in environmental quality. Our results indicate consistent differences in the growth and condition indices of 0-group sole among the 7 sites. Sole had the slowest growth (mean G = 0.54 mm d(-1)) and lowest condition indices (mean K 1.07; TAG:ST = 0.32) at Dunkerque and Calais and the fastest growth (mean G = 0.70 mm d(-1)) and highest condition indices (mean K = 1.19; TAG: ST = 2.18) at the Authie, Canche and Somme estuaries. The indices measured in this study correlated well with anthropogenic disturbance and may provide a useful tool to assess habitat quality. Sites with highest sediment chemical contaminants had the lowest habitat quality and, through growth and lipid-storage limitation, could dramatically lower over-winter survival of the juveniles living in these nursery grounds.

AB  - Stated preference surveys often give minimal attention to distinctions between intermediate and final ecosystem services, leading to the potential for welfare estimates that overlook, misrepresent or double count associated values. This paper illustrates potential mechanisms through which multimetric indexes of the type developed in the ecological literature, here an index of biotic integrity, can be used within stated preference survey scenarios to both improve the validity of survey responses and provide otherwise unavailable information on willingness to pay for intermediate and final ecosystem services. We illustrate the approach using a choice experiment application to the restoration of migratory fish in a Rhode Island watershed. Where assumptions of the model hold, results can allow transparent disentanglement and estimation of marginal values for both intermediate and final ecosystem services.

AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) is one of the biodiversity hotspots, but in the last decades, it has been fragmented due to agricultural and urban-industrial expansion, which has a strong impact on forest fragments. The goal of this study was to analyze the Biotic Integrity Index (BII) in fragments of BAF in two medium-sized cities in Southeastern Brazil and to analyze the relation between BII and landscape metrics (size and shape). The method (BII) has eleven indicators (litter, grass, dead trees, exotic species, vines, gaps, epiphytes, orchids, palms, later species in canopy and understory). The survey was carried out in nine forest fragments in Ribeirao Preto (SP) and 23 in Sorocaba (SP), with a size variation between 0.33 and 185 ha, all of them in urban influence. The relation between BII and landscape metrics were analyzed by the Pearson regression. BII value was registered from 28.7 to 40.0 to Ribeirao Preto and from 22.34 to 35.34 to Sorocaba. Pearson regression was strong between IBB and the size for both cities (p = 0.742 to Ribeirao Preto, and p = 0.679 to Sorocaba). Pearson regression between IBB and shape was medium to Ribeirao Preto (p = 0.47) and weak to Sorocaba (0.1838). The results showed that there is a strong relation between BII and size, and less correlation between BII and shape. However, only size is not able to explain all variation in integrity, suggesting that other factors such as disturbance history and conservation management should have greater influence than the fragment size.

AB  - Estuarine areas represent complex and highly changing environments at the interface between freshwater and marine aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, the aquatic organisms living in estuaries have to face highly variable environmental conditions. The aim of this work was to study the influence of environmental changes from either natural or anthropogenic origins on the physiological responses of Mytilus edulis. Mussels were collected in the Vilaine estuary during early summer because this season represents a critical period of active reproduction in mussels and of increased anthropogenic inputs from agricultural and boating activities into the estuary. The physiological status of the mussel M. edulis was evaluated through measurements of a suite of biomarkers related to: oxidative stress (catalase, malondialdehyde), detoxication (benzopyrene hydroxylase, carboxylesterase), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase), reproductive cycle (vitelline, condition index, maturation stages), immunotoxicity (hemocyte concentration, granulocyte percentage, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, oxidative burst), and general physiological stress (lysosomal stability). A selection of relevant organic contaminant (pesticides, (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorobiphenyls) was measured as well as environmental parameters (water temperature, salinity, total suspended solids, turbidity, chlorophyll a, pheopigments) and mussel phycotoxin contamination. Two locations differently exposed to the plume of the Vilaine River were compared. Both temporal and inter-site variations of these biomarkers were studied. Our results show that reproduction cycle and environmental parameters such as temperature, organic ontaminants, and algal blooms could strongly influence the biomarker responses. These observations highlight the necessity to conduct integrated environmental approaches in order to better understand the causes of biomarker variations.

AB  - An ultrasensitive magnetic field sensor is proposed and investigated experimentally. The no-core fiber is fusion-spliced between two pieces of single-mode fibers and then immersed in magnetic fluid with an appropriate value of refractive index. Under the refractive-index-matched coupling condition, the guided mode becomes leaky and a coupling wavelength dip in the transmission spectrum of the structure is observed. The coupling wavelength dip is extremely sensitive to the ambient environment. The excellent sensitivity to the refractive index is measured to be 116.681 m/RIU (refractive index unit) in the refractive index range of 1.45691-1.45926. For the as-fabricated sensors, the highest magnetic field sensing sensitivities of 6.33 and 1.83 nm/mT are achieved at low and high fields, respectively. The sensitivity is considerably enhanced compared with those of previously designed, similar structures.

AB  - Bivalve molluscM. galloprovincialisis one of the most common marine animals in the Azov-Black Sea basin. The shell length increment of mussels is indicators of the degree of favourable environmental. The aim of the study the individual growth ofM. galloprovincialismussel in various habitat conditions. To determine the individual growth of mussel, a labelling technique was used. 50 individuals of one-sized 35 and other sized 60-mm mussels were placed into separate sectors of two oyster cages. One cage was hung out in the clear water area of a mussel-oyster farm, the second in a polluted apex part of the harbour. Mussels with a shell length of 35 mm from the mussel-oyster farm were 6 times higher in the shell length increment than mussels from harbour, in the size group of 60 mm were 3.5 times higher. In the studied water areas during the experimental period, the growth of mussels of the two size groups was uneven. In adverse harbour conditions, mussel growth slowed down, stopped and sometimes had 'negative growth' values were noted. The shell length increment of mussels was influenced by the ecological state of the environment (pollution), nutritive base, reproductive state and hydrodynamic regime of the compared water areas. The shell length increment ofM. galloprovincialisreflects the adaptation of mussels to a complex of environmental factors and can be used as a one of the parameters of bioindication of water areas.

AB  - This paper examines the changes in biomass and condition index in relation to stock enhancement of Kutum (Rutilus frisii kutum) in Iranian waters of the Caspian Sea during 1991-2011. Over this period, the condition factor of female and male Kutum showed decreasing trends. The average condition factor declined from 1.48 in 1991-1992 to 1.29 in 2010-2011 for females and from 1.40 in 1991-1992 to 1.20 in 2010-2011 for males. The instantaneous coefficient of natural mortality was estimated at 0.39/yr and the instantaneous coefficient of fishing mortality varied during the 20-years period between 0.20/yr to 1.04/yr. Biomass estimates of Kutum using biomass-based cohort analysis increased from about 34,700 mt in 1991-1992 to 40,900 mt in 1993-1994, declined to 28,800 in 2001-2002, increased to 56,900 in 2006-2007, and again declined to 42,600 in 2010-2011. The total number of released Kutum fingerlings increased from about 110 millions in 1991 to 400 millions pieces in 2010. Although there is a significantly positive correlation between fingerlings released and recruitments, it appears on the other hand that condition factor is adversely influenced by the number of fingerlings released. Moreover, over the recent period, biomass and catches do not seem to benefit so much from the increasing efforts in fingerlings release. We concluded that more research should be conducted to determine the desirable level of artificial propagation.

AB  - We identified an objective set of 25 commonly available ecosystem metrics applicable across the world's large continental freshwater and brackish aquatic ecosystem. These metrics measure trophic structure, exploited species, habitat alteration, and catchment changes. We used long-term trends in these metrics as indicators of perturbations that represent an ecosystem not in homeostasis. We defined a healthy ecosystem as being in a homeostatic state; therefore, ecosystems with many changing trends were defined as more disturbed than ecosystems with fewer changing trends. Healthy ecosystems (lakes Baikal, Superior, and Tanganyika) were large, deep lakes in relatively unpopulated areas with no signs of eutrophication and no changes to their trophic structure. Disturbed ecosystems (lakes Michigan, Ontario, and Victoria) had shallow to moderately deep basins with high watershed population pressure and intense agricultural and residential land use. Transitioning systems had widely varying trends and faced increasing anthropogenic pressures. Standardized methodologies for capturing data could improve our understanding of the current state of these ecosystems and allow for comparisons of the response of large aquatic ecosystems to local and global stressors thereby providing more reliable insights into future changes in ecosystem health.

AB  - This study examines seasonal changes in the activities of selected biomarkers in carp (Cyprinus carpi L.) from Karakaya Dam Lake and evaluates the influence of gender and environmental factors on those activities. Physicochemical characteristics of water were evaluated in the lakewater. Fish were sampled on seasonal basis, and liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase, plasma lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, and brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were assayed. Plasma vitellogenin level and hepatosomatic index and condition factors were also determined. Strong seasonal variations were observed but there were no gender differences among selected markers. The highest vitellogenin level of male fish was detected as 606 ng/mL which represents the estrogenicity of water in the lake in September 2005. In addition, the seasonal changes of some biomarkers such as EROD and AChE showed that the lake may be at risk of pollution by some xenobiotics arising from agricultural and/or industrial activities.

AB  - The data on many-years dynamics of bacterioplankton number and chlorophyll a concentration as indicators of the state of pelagic ecosystem of the north-western Black sea shelf (NWBS) are presented and analysed. It has been shown that in the end of the last century the quantitative characteristics of these factors grew steadily and reached the maximum values characteristic of highly eutrophic sea water in the early 90's. From mid-90's the trend of decrease in bacterioplankton number and chlorophyll a concentration began to slow down. At the beginning of this century their concentration was twice as low as in the years of maximum values. These changes indicate the decrease in the NWBS waters trophic level and improvement of the state of environment in the region. As a result of analysis a conclusion was made that in 1980-1990 maximum of chlorophyll a concentrations and maximum of eutrophication processes in the NWBS have been registered. It was suggested to use bacterioplankton and chlorophyll a together with nutrients furtheron as the simple indicators of marine water quality and of long-term changes in eutrophication processes in the Black sea.

AB  - Biomonitoring of mercury pollution of Dubasari reservoir of the Dniester River has been carried out using macrophytes, epiphytosuspensions and lichens. Macrophytes uptake mercury from water column and bottom sediments in the succession Potamogeton pectinatus L. > Myriophyllum verticillatum L. > Potamogeton perfoliatus L. > Butomus umbellatus L. These species possess the properties of bio-indicators. The mercury content in their biomass is in good positive correlation (r =: 0.908-0.990) with the mercury content both in water and bottom sediments. It has been shown that the maximum mercury content in these bio-indicators is found in the area of the Rezina-Rybnitsa industrial complex that consists of two cement plants and a metallurgical one. The use of lichens as bio-indicators for the ecological state of the air in the vicinity of the investigated aquatic ecosystem and of the epiphytosuspensions precipitated on submerged macrophytes, denote the active state of the source for mercury pollution of the Dubasari reservoir.

AB  - Quantifying the strength of non-trophic interactions exerted by foundation species is critical to understanding how natural communities respond to environmental stress. In the case of ocean acidification (OA), submerged marine macrophytes, such as seagrasses, may create local areas of elevated pH due to their capacity to sequester dissolved inorganic carbon through photosynthesis. However, although seagrasses may increase seawater pH during the day, they can also decrease pH at night due to respiration. Therefore, it remains unclear how consequences of such diel fluctuations may unfold for organisms vulnerable to OA. We established mesocosms containing different levels of seagrass biomass (Zostera marina) to create a gradient of carbonate chemistry conditions and explored consequences for growth of juvenile and adult oysters (Crassostrea gigas), a non-native species widely used in aquaculture that can co-occur, and is often grown, in proximity to seagrass beds. In particular, we investigated whether increased diel fluctuations in pH due to seagrass metabolism affected oyster growth. Seagrasses increased daytime pH up to 0.4 units but had little effect on nighttime pH (reductions less than 0.02 units). Thus, both the average pH and the amplitude of diel pH fluctuations increased with greater seagrass biomass. The highest seagrass biomass increased oyster shell growth rate (mm day(-1)) up to 40%. Oyster somatic tissue weight and oyster condition index exhibited a different pattern, peaking at intermediate levels of seagrass biomass. This work demonstrates the ability of seagrasses to facilitate oyster calcification and illustrates how non-trophic metabolic interactions can modulate effects of environmental change.

AB  - The current study was carried out from May 2014 to April 2015 to estimate the stock status of P. viridis in Marudu Bay. The gonad development was monitored by histological examination, while the population parameters including asymptotic length (L (a)), growth coefficient (K), mortality rate (Z, F and M), exploitation level (E) and recruitment of P. viridis were estimated using the lengthfrequency data. Results of the current study demonstrated that P. viridis in Marudu Bay spawned throughout the year with two major peaks, one in April to May and another one in October to December. The recruitment pattern was continuous with the peak in May to June 2014, which corresponded to the first spawning peak in April. However, no significant recruitment was observed from the second spawning peak due to the difference in spawning timing between male and female populations. The estimated asymptotic length (L (a)), growth coefficient (K), total mortality (Z), natural mortality (M), fishing mortality (F) and growth performance (N") of P. viridis in Marudu Bay were estimate to be 117 mm, 0.97 yr(-1), 4.39 yr(-1), 1.23 yr(-1), 3.16 yr(-1) and 4.123, respectively. The exponent b of the lengthweight relationship was 2.4 and exploitation level (E) was 0.72. The high mortality, low condition indices and negative allometric of P. viridis in Marudu Bay is caused by a lack of suitable food in the surrounding water.

AB  - Quantitative macroscopic's indexes have been used to compare three trophic models of the exploited benthic ecosystem of Tongoy Bay. In this system the primary productivity and benthic invertebrates are more important in the cycling of biomass. The models were built with a similar number of compartments for the years 1992, 2002 and 2012, using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE). Odum and Ulanowicz's frameworks and ecological network analysis were then used to estimate the levels of maturity, growth and development of the system. Likewise, "keystoneness" indexes - at each time - were also estimated for the models. Our results show that Tongoy Bay exhibited an increase in maturity and development ("health") in 2012 compared to past conditions, which was reflected by (1) an increase in the total system biomass, total system throughput, AMI, and absolute Ascendency, (2) higher flow and increased efficiency of transferred energy and its proportion at higher trophic levels, (3) an increase of recycling (FCI), (4) a reduction of NPP/R and NPP/B ratios of the system, and (5) an increase in the number of compartments trophically linked that comprise the keystone species complex. We argue that these results are a consequence of reduced fishing pressure on this benthic system in recent years. This study shows that the fishing would not only have a direct impact on exploited species, but would also affect the structure and functioning of the ecosystem. The information obtained could help to improve the management of fisheries resources, evaluating surveillance indicators that can show the putative changes of intervened ecosystems.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity can occur in response to environmental fluctuation and can bring about pronounced changes in behavioral, physiological, or morphological traits. Anthropogenic habitat modifications, such as prescribed fire, can provide insight on the phenotypic response of ectotherms to structural habitat change. Our objective was to quantify the effect of fire-altered landscapes on the locomotor performance of the eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Lizard sprint performance was compared among three habitats with different fire histories: a control habitat, which had not experienced fire in more than 60years, a recovering habitat that had not experienced fire in 4years, and a recent burn habitat that burned less than 6months prior to the study. There were significant differences in locomotor performance among lizards from the different habitats (indicative of phenotypic plasticity), and lizards in the recent burn habitat had significantly higher maximum sprint speeds than lizards in recovering and control habitats. To measure the consistency of locomotor performance within individuals, lizards were captured and raced during the field seasons of 2014 and again in 2015. Locomotor performance was significantly repeatable across years, suggesting lizard populations contain considerable individual variation, despite this trait being closely tied to fitness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to observe individual between-year repeatability in performance of free-ranging S.undulatus. Lizards had similar body condition among habitats suggesting that nutritional status did not play a role in performance plasticity. Habitats differed both structurally and thermally, and less restrictive thermal regimes in recently burned habitats appear to be the underlying mechanism permitting increased lizard locomotor performance.

AB  - Fish-based multi-metric indices have been widely developed in ecological quality assessments of estuaries in the past few years, but the ability of these indices and their respective metrics to respond to human pressures may be quite different. Based on a group consensus approach eliciting information from multiple experts integrating published literature, this work evaluated the strength and time-lag of the response of eight fish-based indices (AFI, EFAI, ELFI, Z-EBI, TFCI, EBI, EFCI, IBI), and their respective metrics, in relation to several human pressures (chemical pollution, eutrophication, loss of habitat, water turbidity, habitat fragmentation, fishing mortalities, invasive species, water temperature changes and flow changes). Results pointed out that most of the metrics detect several human pressures, being difficult to identify a particular pressure effect and its source. The majority of the metrics analysed presented a weak relationship with pressures and/or respond in a long time period. The metrics responding to chemical pollution and loss of habitat were generally the ones with stronger relationships, but their responses were often in a long time period. Consequently, the fish-based indices analysed did not detect all the pressures with the same sensitivity in terms of strength and time lag. This clearly collides with the needs for water ecological quality assessments, management and rehabilitation of estuarine ecosystems, and highlighted the value of metrics, especially the ones that are specific of certain pressures.

AB  - An assessment of annual trends in actual evapotranspiration (AET) and associated meteorological inputs is performed at 101 locations across Canada with available long-term hourly surface climate observations to determine if AET in Canada is increasing in relation to observed increases in air temperature. AET was estimated for the dominant land cover class, with representative soil and leaf area index conditions, within a 50 km x 50 km window around each location for the period 1960-2000. The Ecological Assimilation of Land and Climate Observations (EALCO) land surface model, which simulates coupled carbon, energy, and water cycles, was applied to estimate AET on a half-hourly basis at each location using in situ meteorological measurements and ambient atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Increases in annual AET, of up to 0.73% yr(-1), were identified at 81 locations, and decreases, of up to 0.25% yr(-1), were found at the remaining 20 stations. Statistically significant increasing trends were detected in 35% of the locations with the majority corresponding to Atlantic and Pacific coastal regions. Increasing trends were generally related to increasing temperature and total downwelling surface radiation trends in eastern Canada and increasing temperature, surface radiation, and precipitation trends in western Canada. In sharp contrast to other studies based on simpler AET models, annual AET trends in the prairie climate zone were mixed in terms of increases and decreases with no locations showing statistically significant trends. Future studies focused on scaling AET model estimates to subbasins or basins are required both to account for this spatial variability in soil conditions and to permit water budget closure validation.

AB  - Ecological integrity of coal mining areas is subject to intense disruption due to the large scale and intensity of operations and the intensification of associated human activity. Negative impacts of coal mining include soil erosion, decline in soil fertility, water pollution, and structural changes to land use. Impacts of coal mining are acute in western China which has been defined as an ecologically fragile zone on account of the arid soils and low rainfall climate that render ecosystem restoration problematic. Here, we studied drivers of ecological vulnerability (EV) in an ecologically fragile area of Shaanxi province and Inner Mongolia that is one of the most globally active and intensive coal mining regions. An evaluation model, using eight indicators of EV such as slope (SL), relief amplitude (RA), rainfall erosion factor (RE), average temperature (AT), land use type (LUT), soil erosion factor (SE), net primary productivity of vegetation (NPP) and coverage of vegetation (CV), was constructed based on a Pressure-State-Response model. An Ecological Vulnerablity Index (EVI) was calculated within the region for 2005, 2010, and 2015 by using the model of EVI and spatio-temporal changes in EV were analyzed. Mechanisms and drivers of EV were assessed using the stepwise regression. The results showed that the area of industrial and mining land increased by 912.96% between 2005 and 2015, where the greatest increase occurred between 2010 and 2015 by 620.00%. The EVI fluctuated insignificantly from 2.69 to 2.78 during the study period and was little related to changes in somewhat areas of urban land use and coal mining intensity. We concluded that the EV of the region slightly increased, despite the extent and intensity of coal mining actives. The main drivers of EV were temperature, precipitation, and land use change. This research will help inform environmental protection policies and environmental planning for coal mining operations in the study area.

AB  - The impacts of any activity on marine ecosystems will depend on the characteristics of the receptor medium and its resilience to external pressures. Salmon farming industry develops along a constant gradient of hydrodynamic conditions in the south of Chile. However, the influence of the hydrodynamic characteristics (weak or strong) on the impacts of intensive salmon farming is still poorly understood. This one year study evaluates the impacts of salmon farming on the marine sediments of both protected and exposed marine zones differing in their hydrodynamic characteristics. Six physico-chemical, five biological variables and seven indexes of marine sediments status were evaluated under the salmon farming cages and control sites. Our results identified a few key variables and indexes necessary to accurately evaluate the salmon farming impacts on both protected and exposed zones. Interestingly, the ranking of importance of the variables and the temporality of the observed changes, varied depending on the hydrodynamic characteristics. Biological variables (nematodes abundance) and environmental indexes (Simpson's dominance, Shannon's diversity and Pielou evenness) are the first to reflect detrimental impacts under the salmon farming cages. Then the physico-chemical variables such as redox, sulphurs and phosphorus in both zones also show detrimental impacts. Based. on the present results we propose that the hydrodynamic regime is an important driver of the magnitude and temporality of the effects of salmon farming on marine sediments. The variables and indexes that best reflect the effects of salmon farming, in both protected and exposed zones, are also described. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There are relatively few studies surveying how meteorological and qualitative characteristics of tree sites in urban areas influence Hymenoscyphus fraxineus (T. Kowalski) Baral et al. (  Chalara fraxinea T. Kowalski, = Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus Queloz et al.) or infection by that. Based on the significance of ash trees in urban areas and the frequent use of ash species and their varieties, it becomes increasingly important to identify factors that drive the pathogen. The aim of this study was to identify the effects of both meteorological parameters and tree characteristics on the severity of the disease in the city of Leipzig, Germany. We assessed 401 ash trees along streets and in green spaces distributed across Leipzig. The assessment included scoring the level of damage by H. fraxineus, visually estimating the degree of soil sealing under a tree's crown, measuring tree height, the height of crown base and the diameter at breast height, determining sex, year of planting and species variety, as well as recording qualitative characteristics (e.g. secondary pathogens, feeding marks). Mean relative air humidity, mean annual temperature and a combined index of meteorological conditions were used as meteorological parameters. In addition, we sampled tissue of 45 ash trees for the purpose of genetically verifying the occurrence of H. fraxineus. We analysed the effects of all variables on ash dieback by using linear mixed effect models. Results show an extensive damage by H. fraxineus in the whole city area with 70% of trees being infected. Mean relative air humidity and the index of meteorological conditions show a significant positive influence on the severity of ash dieback, whereas year of planting has a negative effect. Trees with feeding marks at the trunk tend to be more damaged by the fungus. Moreover, we found a significant difference in susceptibility between F. excelsior and its variety 'Atlas'. Both meteorological conditions and the susceptibility of species and their varieties should be taken into account when planting ash trees in urban areas.

AB  - Despite the fundamental dependence of human populations on water resources, a range of anthropogenic impacts, in particular the removal of riparian vegetation, threaten freshwater environments. One of the most effective means of evaluating the effects of anthropogenic disturbance in aquatic ecosystems is the use of bioindicators, and the insects of the order Odonata are among the most efficient indicators, due to their enormous sensitivity to environmental changes. In this context, the present study aimed to verify which parameters of the odonate community (species richness, abundance/biomass, composition, taxonomic diversity and taxonomic/phylogenetic distinctness) are most effective for the evaluation of the loss of environmental integrity. The study focused on 50 streams in the northeast of the Brazilian state of Para. The streams were sampled during the dry season, between June and August 2011. The physical characteristics of each stream were evaluated using a Habitat Integrity Index (HII). The species composition provided the best parameter for the evaluation of ecological integrity, providing a relatively accurate assessment at a lower mean research cost than other parameters. Taxonomic diversity and distinctness also provided relatively reliable results, contributed additional information on the evolutionary relationships among the odonate taxa, and also provided a low-cost approach. Deconstructing communities is necessary to detect impacts, considering the considerable variation in the environmental requirements of the different species. Overall, the parameter that best responded to gradients of disturbance was species composition, followed by diversity and taxonomic distinctness. Given these findings, odonate-based biomonitoring should focus on these parameters to guarantee the optimal detection and evaluation of habitat alterations.

AB  - BACKGROUND Depuration is an important process performed to ensure the safety of oyster consumption, and the effect of salinity stress on physiological and ecological characteristics of oyster remains unknow. In this study, the simulated depuration of Crassostrea gigas was performed with the salinities varying from +/- 10% to +/- 20% away from that of production area (26, 28, 32, 35, and 38 g L-1), as well as respiratory metabolism, glycolysis, lipolysis, and apoptosis were analyzed. RESULTS (i) The oxygen consumption rate, ammonia discharge rate and enzyme activities related to respiratory metabolism were decreased significantly at salinities of 38 g L-1, indicating that salinity stress triggered the abnormal respiratory metabolism of C. gigas, further, glycolysis was enhanced. (ii) Glycogen decomposition, lactic acid increase, and fatty acid composition modifications were caused by adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) -mediated during salinity stress. (iii) There was a clear decrease of the condition index and meat yield of C. gigas after 72 h of depuration, especially in salinity 38 g L-1. (iv) Salinity stress would lead to the increase of cytochrome c levels, then cause apoptosis of C. gigas, while heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) would interfere with this process. CONCLUSION Salinity stress had a significant effect on the physiological and ecological response of C. gigas during the depuration process, including respiratory metabolism, glycolysis, lipolysis, and apoptosis. In general, the low depuration salinity fluctuation (+/- 10%) is helpful to maintain quality of C. gigas, as well as the optimal depuration time was 48 h. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - In recent decades, considerable attention has been devoted to endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDC) and studies on fish feminization have increased throughout the years as a key signal for aquatic environmental contamination. The input of domestic sewage into water reservoirs is common in South American countries, especially in cities that experienced rapid population growths and unplanned urbanization. This study aimed at characterizing morphofunctional parameters of the tropical fish Sphoeroides testudineus and investigating the potential occurrence and effects of endocrine disruptors in the Pacoti River (Ceara, Brazil), often considered a reference site. After collection from the field, fish were measure/weighted and desiccated for gender identification (males, females, and undifferentiated), gonadal histology, and vitellogenin expression. From the biometric analysis, undifferentiated fish showed lower weight and length than female and male fish, although no differences in the condition index were observed. The gonadal weight of undifferentiated fish was significantly lower than those of females and males. Although this pattern was observed, gonadosomatic index (GSI) showed a different pattern, with differences being observed just between males and the other two groups (females and undifferentiated). Vitellogenin (VTG) expression was detected in many mature male and undifferentiated fish, indicating endocrine disruption. In addition, several EDCs (estrone, 17 alpha-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol, and estriol) were identified and quantified in sediments from the sampling site. These results were unexpected and indicative that the Pacoti River is impaired by estrogenic contamination.

AB  - Perkinsosis is one of the most widespread diseases affecting commercially important species of molluscs globally. We examined the impact of Perkinsus spp. on shell growth at the individual scale in 2 clam species: Ruditapes decussatus from Mundaka Estuary (Spain) and R. philippinarum from Arcachon Bay (France). At Arcachon, 2 contrasting sites in terms of environment and Perkinsus olseni presence were chosen: Arguin (disease-free) and Ile aux Oiseaux (infected site). We monitored the dynamics of perkinsosis over the course of the experiment at Mundaka and Ile aux Oiseaux. Prevalences were high (>70%), and intensities were around 10(5) cells g(-1) wet gills at Ile aux Oiseaux, and 10(6) cells g(-1) at Mundaka. No significant differences in prevalence or intensity were observed over time. A 2 yr field growth experiment of tagged-recaptured clams was performed to determine individual clam growth rate, condition index (CI), and Perkinsus spp. infection intensity. Clams were collected at Ile aux Oiseaux and transplanted to Arguin. The growth rate was always significantly and negatively correlated with Perkinsus spp. infection, and positively correlated with CI. CI and Perkinsus spp. infection explained 19% and 7% of the variability of the growth rate at Mundaka and Ile aux Oiseaux, respectively. In experimental clams at Arguin, P. olseni infection explained 26% of the variability of the growth rate at the lower tidal level. Our results suggest that at a concentration of between 10(5) and 10(6) cells g(-1), perkinsosis affects the physiological functions of the clams, highlighted by its impact on the growth rate.

AB  - Floods have occurred frequently all over the world. During 2000-2020, nearly half (44.9%) of global floods occurred in the Belt and Road region because of its complex geology, topography, and climate. Therefore, providing an insight into the spatial distribution characteristics of flood susceptibility in this region is essential. Here, a database was established with 11 flood conditioning factors, 1500 flooded points, and 1500 non-flooded points selected by an improved method. Subsequently, a rare combination of logistic regression and support vector machine, integrated by heterogeneous framework, was applied to generate an ensemble flood susceptibility map. Based on it, the concept of ecological vulnerability synthesis index in the ecological field was introduced into this study, and the flood susceptibility comprehensive index (FSCI) was proposed to quantify the degree of flood susceptibility of each country and sub-region. At the results, the ensemble model has an excellent accuracy, with the highest AUC value of 0.9342. The highest and high flood susceptibility zones are mainly located in the southeastern part of Eastern Asia, most of Southeast Asia and South Asia, account for 12.22% and 9.57% of the total study area, respectively. From the regional perspective, it can be found that Southeast Asia had the highest flood susceptibility with the highest FSCI of 4.69, while East Asia and Central and Eastern Europe showed the most significant spatial distribution characteristics. From the national perspective, of the 66 countries in this region, 20 of the countries have the highest flood susceptibility level (FSCIn > 0.8), which face the greatest threat of flooding. These results are able to facilitate reasonable flood mitigation measures develop at the most critical locations in the Belt and Road region and lays a theoretical basis for quantifying flood susceptibility at national or regional scale.

AB  - It has been proposed that immune functioning in wild animals is shaped by the trade-off between a probability of encountering pathogens and an availability of resources for maintaining immune system in active state. Due to resources' seasonality one can expect that immune functioning, e.g. absolute and relative counts of white blood cells, WBC (leukocyte profile) also follows an annual cycle. However, dynamics of the seasonal changes of leukocyte profile are controversial and specific inquiries so far addressed only a portion of annual cycle. To study the seasonal dynamics of the leukocyte profile and to test its possible endogenous basis we experimentally simulated annual cycle in a migratory passerine bird, chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita abietinus. We report here a clear seasonal pattern of leukocyte profile in that species. The highest WBC counts were observed during pre-alternate moult and the lowest during the subsequent spring migration; the seasonal dynamics of HL ratio showed the opposite tendency. Surprisingly, HL ratios during autumn migration were relatively low, indicating little to no stress. Observed seasonal changes in controlled experimental conditions suggest an existence of time-keeping programme underlying these variations. Additionally we found negative relationship between the body condition index and WBC counts and positive relationship with HL (heterophil to lymphocyte) ratio; these findings are controversial with the data obtained with other bird species in wild populations. Understanding the origins of variation of leukocyte profile per se and in relation with other parameters of physiological condition can be a useful tool in studying physiological response to environmental changes.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the transfer of toxic metals from honeybee workers (Apis mellifera L.) to bee honey in relation to the ecological state of the environment. The materials of the study consisted of samples of honeybee bodies and varietal honeys taken from the same apiary located in three areas: R1-urbanized (16), R2-ecologically clean (16) and R3-industrialized (15) of south-eastern Po-land. The contents of 14 elements in all tested samples, including toxic metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, Al, Ni, Tl) as well as bioelements (K. Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, Se), were analysed by the ICP-OES method with prior microwave mineralization. The concentrations of the majority of the studied elements, excluding aluminum and lead, were significantly higher in bee bodies than in honey samples (P < 0.05). The pollution of bee bodies by toxic metals was dependent on the environmental cleanliness, and the most pollution was observed in the industrialized area. The bee body was the most effective barrier for Cd and Tl transfer to the honey, while the level of Ni was similar in both tested materials. The Al concentration was significantly higher in honey than bee bodies (14.81 +/- 24.69 and 6.51 +/- 5.83 mg kg(-1), respectively), which suggests the possibility of secondary contamination of honey. The greatest sensitivity to heavy metal pollution was observed in honeydew honey compared to nectar honeys (P < 0.05). It was proved for the first time that bees work as biofilters for toxic metals and prevent honey contamination.

AB  - We developed an index of biotic integrity (IBI) for the Sand Hills ecoregion within the upper Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. This ecoregion exhibits differences in species composition among river basins and possesses a relatively depauperate fish fauna that has been affected by faunal homogenization. We also investigated whether this IBI could be improved by adding benthic macroinvertebrate information. Data collected from 70 wadeable stream sites were used to calculate 45 fish assemblage metrics. Twelve metrics within the categories of species richness, species composition, habitat guild, trophic guild, tolerance level, alien/invasive species, and individual fish condition were retained after screening all metrics for sensitivity to disturbance, redundancy, and ecological content. Heterogeneity of species composition among basins led to a greater reliance on richness, indicator species, trophic guild, and habitat guild metrics rather than on more geographically variable species composition metrics. Characteristic headwater assemblages provided the basis for some metrics, and invader species metrics were included to address faunal homogenization. The Sand Hills IBI (SHIBI) was more accurate ecoregion-wide than IBIs that were developed for portions of the Sand Hills, correctly classifying about 60% of the disturbed sites compared with less than 30% for the other IBIs. However, the SHIBI was not highly responsive to gradients in site quality, as indicated by an R-2 of 0.30 between SHIBI scores and instream habitat quality scores. This R2 value was improved to 0.49 by supplementing the SHIBI with a benthic macroinvertebrate index (the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera index). We conclude that ecoregion-wide IBIs should (1) be based on ecoregion-wide data that characterize responses to disturbance and natural habitat gradients, (2) maintain a substantial ecological basis by including several metric classes, and (3) include metrics that address faunal homogenization where disturbance has increased the dispersion of nonnative species and native generalist species. In addition, combining information from different assemblages can enhance IBI responsiveness to disturbance and improve performance.

AB  - The impact of Dreissena fouling on unionids has hardly been studied in Europe, despite the fact that in some ecosystems (e.g. Lake Balaton, Hungary) infestations of several hundreds to a thousand individuals per unionid have been observed. At present, the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha is a dominant species in Lake Balaton and in the last decade three other invasive bivalves were introduced, potentially increasing the pressure on native unionid survival. We examined whether the fouling of dreissenids (zebra and quagga (D. rostriformis bugensis) mussels) has a negative impact on native (Anodonta anatina, Unio pictorum and U. tumidus) and invasive (Corbicula fluminea and Sinanodonta woodiana) bivalves and whether there are any interspecific and temporal variations in fouling intensity and physiological condition measured by standard condition index and glycogen content. A significant negative impact was detected on native unionids only in July and September (no impact was detected in May), when the fouling rate was high. For invasive species, a significant negative impact was detected on S. woodiana with a high level of dressenid infestation; whereas no significant impact was detected on C. fluminea. Overall, this study confirms that Dreissena may threaten unionid species including the invasive S. woodiana, although high interspecific and temporal variations were observed. This situation should be taken into account in future ecological and conservational assessments because species respond differently to Dreissena fouling and effects seem to be more pronounced in late summer/early autumn. In addition, this study provides the first evidence that the invasive C. fluminea appear to be less vulnerable to dressenid fouling.

AB  - Reservoirs comprise an expanding proportion of global freshwater resources. New multimetric approaches to biological monitoring, such as the index of biological integrity, have been useful in streams; similar approaches in reservoirs might aid managers concerned about the reservoirs they manage. Electrofishing data from Tennessee Valley Authority reservoirs were used to evaluate the applicability of biomonitoring to those reservoirs. Individual metrics and overall index scores exhibited substantial annual variation. Within-year variation in scores from a supplemental data set suggests that annual changes in scores may not represent real fluctuations in resource condition. Species accumulation curves demonstrate that standard samples consisting of ten timed runs were not adequate; the sample error was high. Some metrics are useful, but they require more testing; other metrics are clearly not appropriate for use in a integrative multimetric index. Finally, the reservoirs included in this study may be similarly degraded; independent data from separate regions and watersheds are needed to resolve this and other issues. Although attaching qualitative judgements (e.g. excellent to poor) is premature, the concept of a reservoir biomonitoring index deserves more study, especially the development of more comprehensive and systematic sampling programmes designed to resolve sample adequacy and sources of variation in sample data.

AB  - Marine biofouling by the swiftly spreading invasive mussel (Musculista senhousia) has caused serious ecological and economic consequences in the global coastal waters. However, the fate of this highly invasive fouling species in a rapidly acidifying ocean remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated the impacts of ocean acidification within and across generations, to understand whether M. sentiousia has the capacity to acclimate to changing ocean conditions. During the gonadal development, exposure of mussels to elevated pCO2 caused significant decreases of survival, growth performance and condition index, and shifted the whole-organism energy budget by inflating energy expenses to fuel compensatory processes, eventually impairing the success of spawning. Yet, rapid transgeneraiional acclimation occurred during the early life history stage and persisted into adulthood. Eggs spawned from CO2-exposed mussels were significantly bigger compared with those from non-0O2-exposed mussels, indicating increased maternal provisioning into eggs and hence conferring larvae resilience under harsh conditions. Larvae with a prior history of transgenerational exposure to elevated pCO2 developed faster and had a higher survival than those with no prior history of CO2 exposure. Transgenerational exposure significantly increased the number of larvae completing metamorphosis. While significant differences in shell growth were no longer observed during juvenile nursery and adult grow -out, transgenerationally exposed mussels displayed improved survival in comparison to non-transgenerationally exposed mussels. Metabolic plasticity arose following transgenerational acclimation, generating more energy available for fitness -related functions. Overall, the present study demonstrates the remarkable ability of M. senhousia to respond plastically and acclimate rapidly to changing ocean conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conservation needs for amphibians in managed timberlands may differ based upon the species present and the timber harvesting methods employed. Clearcuts have been documented to be detrimental to amphibians but the impacts of associated silvicultural edges and alternative harvesting treatments are not well understood. The primary objective of this study was to determine if amphibian abundances and body condition differed in thinned forests and intact forests, and in clearcuts and associated silvicultural edges. We also examined which environmental attributes were important in explaining observed differences. We sampled clearcuts, silvicultural edges, and adjacent late-seral forests at 10 sites in northwestern California from October 1999 to July 2002. Clearcuts at these sites ranged in age from 6 to 25 years. Five of these forest stands were intact and five had been commercially thinned at least 10 years prior to our study. Amphibian abundances were similar in thinned and unthinned forests, but body condition of the most common species was lower in thinned forests. Abundances of amphibians were nearly twice as high in forests and at silvicultural edges than in clearcuts. Clearcutting at these sites appears to have affected amphibian numbers up to 25 years post-harvest, however, silvicultural edges were suitable habitats for amphibians. While commercial thinning did not reduce amphibian numbers, it is an intermediate treatment followed by clearcutting. Where conservation of amphibians is a concern, even-aged silvicultural systems may not provide the most appropriate method for maintaining viable populations on managed forestlands in the northwestern US.

AB  - Deliberately feeding wildlife is an increasingly popular tourism-related activity despite a limited understanding of long-term impacts on the species being fed. As a result, tourist behaviours that may have adverse impacts on imperiled species have often been encouraged without the necessary evaluation or oversight. Here, we report the responses of Northern Bahamian Rock Iguanas (Cyclura cychlura) to human-visitation pressure and associated food provisioning. We compared a variety of blood chemistry parameters of iguanas subjected to supplemental feeding at popular tourist destinations with iguanas occurring on islands where supplemental feeding does not take place. We demonstrate that male and female iguanas inhabiting tourist-visited islands where supplemental feeding occurs do not differ in body condition or baseline stress and stress response (determined by corticosterone levels) compared with iguanas from non-visited islands. Both males and females from tourist-visited sites experienced a greater incidence of endoparasitic infection and atypical loose faeces. Indicators of dietary nutrition, including glucose, potassium, and uric acid values, also differed for both sexes from tourist-visited and unvisited islands. Male iguanas from visited islands differed significantly from those on non-visited islands in calcium, cholesterol, cobalt, copper, magnesium, packed cell volume, selenium, and triglyceride concentrations, whereas female iguanas from visited islands differed significantly in ionized calcium. Although the interpretation of these differences is challenging, chronic biochemical stressors could compromise individual health over time or decrease survivorship during periods of environmental stress. We suggest protocols that can be adopted throughout the region to ensure that supplemental feeding has fewer impacts on these long-lived iguanas.

AB  - Maximizing the mitigation potential of open-water finfish-shellfish integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) farms is complex in terms of co-locating the trophic components. Both the dispersal of finfish aquaculture wastes and biological processes are highly influenced by water circulation. Consequently, the evaluation of shellfish-finfish synergy requires a combined study of biological and physical processes, which can be achieved by the implementation and coupling of mathematical models. A highly configurable mathematical model was developed that can be applied at the apparent spatial scale of IMTA sites. The model tracks different components of the seston, including feed wastes, fish faeces, shellfish faeces, natural detritus and phytoplankton. Based on the characterization of these fluxes, a hypothetical IMTA site was used to explore different spatial arrangements for evaluating finfish-shellfish farm mitigation efficiency. The site was modelled following a factorial design, which tested 2 levels of background seston concentrations, 3 farm designs, 2 hydrodynamic conditions and 2 levels of aquaculture intensity. The model predicts that mitigation efficiency is highly dependent on the background environmental conditions, obtaining maximum mitigation under oligotrophic conditions that stimulate shellfish filtration activity. The dominance of vertical fluxes of particulate matter triggered by the high settling velocity of finfish aquaculture wastes suggests that suspended shellfish aquaculture cannot significantly reduce organic loading of the seabed. Consequently, this suggests that waste mitigation at IMTA sites should be best achieved by placing organic extractive species (e.g. deposit feeders) on the seabed directly beneath finfish cages rather than in suspension in the water column.

AB  - Microplastics are ubiquitous in the marine environment and studies on their effects on benthic filter feeders at least partly revealed a negative influence. However, it is still unclear whether the effects of microplastics differ from those of natural suspended microparticles, which constitute a common stressor in many coastal environments. We present a series of experiments that compared the effects of six-week exposures of marine mussels to two types of nat-ural particles (red clay and diatom shells) to two types of plastic particles (Polymethyl Methacrylate and Polyvinyl Chloride). Mussels of the family Mytilidae from temperate regions (Japan, Chile, Tasmania) through subtropical (Israel) to tropical environments (Cabo Verde) were exposed to concentrations of 1.5 mg/L, 15 mg/L and 150 mg/L of the respective microparticles. At the end of this period, we found significant effects of suspended particles on respiration rate, byssus production and condition index of the animals. There was no significant effect on clearance rate and survival. Surprisingly, we observed only small differences between the effects of the different types of particles, which suggests that the mussels were generally equally robust towards exposure to variable concentrations of suspended solids regardless of whether they were natural or plastic. We conclude, that microplastics and suspended solids elicit similar effects on the tested response variables, and that both types of microparticles mainly cause acute responses rather than more persistent carry-over effects.

AB  - Quantitative biological assessment protocols are needed for monitoring river status and evaluating river rehabilitation efforts. We conducted a standardized macroinvertebrate survey at 100 sites on 38 nonwadeable rivers in Wisconsin to construct, test, and apply an index of biotic integrity (IBI) intended to be such a bioassessment tool. We assigned independent samples to IBI development (n = 75) and IBI validation (n = 25) data sets. We placed Hester-Dendy artificial substrates at the sites for 6 wk and processed the samples of colonizing macroinvertebrates in the laboratory with a 500-target subsampling procedure plus a large-rare taxon search. Independent of the biota, we assigned an environmental disturbance score to each site based upon water chemistry, land cover, flow modification, and point-source pollution. Ten metrics that represent macroinvertebrate assemblage structure, composition, and function constitute the IBI: the number of taxa in: 1) Insecta or 2) Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT); % individuals that were: 3) Insecta, 4) intolerant EPT, 5) tolerant chironomids, 6) gatherers, 7) scrapers, or from 8) the dominant 3 taxa; 9) the mean pollution tolerance value; and 10) the number of unique ecological functional trait niches. Analyses on both the validation subset of sites and all sites inclusive confirmed that least-disturbed sites had the highest IBI scores, severely disturbed sites had the lowest scores, and moderately disturbed sites had intermediate scores. Chironominae and Hydropsychidae taxa known to tolerate nutrient enrichment and overall degraded conditions dominated samples with low IBI scores. In contrast, a diverse assemblage that thrives in relatively undisturbed conditions was present in samples with high IBI scores. Comparison of the new macroinvertebrate IBI with an existing fish IBI suggested that the indices respond to different environmental stressors and illustrated the limitations of using only one taxonomic group for bioassessment. We discuss new macroinvertebrate methods, an IBI development process, and the refinement of metrics that may be useful in tailoring assessment tools for large rivers or wadeable streams in other regions. We also present applications of the IBI, including its potential use in comprehensive large river monitoring programs and for evaluating management efforts.

AB  - The impact of simulated seawater acidification and warming conditions on specimens of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis locally adapted to very distinct, widely separated sites in the Mediterranean Sea (Tunisia) and Atlantic Sea (Galicia, NW Spain) was evaluated in relation to key behavioural and eco-physiological parameters. Over the 2-month exposure to the experimental conditions, mussels were fed optimally to ensure that there are no synergistic interactions between climate change drivers and energetic status of the individuals. In general, regardless of origin (Atlantic or Mediterranean), the mussels were rather resilient to acidification for most of the parameters considered and they were able to grow in strongly acidified seawater through an increased feeding activity. However, shell strength decreased (40%) consistently in both mussel populations held in moderately and highly acidified seawater. The observed reduction in shell strength was not explained by slight alterations in organic matter, shell thickness or aragonite:calcite ratio. The combined effects of high acidification and warming on the key response of byssus strength caused a strong decline in mussel performance, although only in Galician mussels, in which the valve opening time decreased sharply as well as condition index (soft tissue state) and shell growth. By contrast, the observed negative effect of highly acidified scenario on the strength of Tunisian mussel shells was (partly but not totally) counterbalanced by the higher seawater temperature. Eco-physiological and behavioural interactions in mussels in relation to climate change are complex, and future scenarios for the ecology of the species and also the feasibility of cultivating them in Atlantic and Mediterranean zones are discussed.

AB  - River rehabilitation aims at alleviating negative effects of human impacts such as loss of biodiversity and reduction of ecosystem services. Such interventions entail difficult trade-offs between different ecological and often socio-economic objectives. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a very suitable approach that helps assessing the current ecological state and prioritizing river rehabilitation measures in a standardized way, based on stakeholder or expert preferences. Applications of MCDA in river rehabilitation projects are often simplified, i.e. using a limited number of objectives and indicators, assuming linear value functions, aggregating individual indicator assessments additively, and/or assuming risk neutrality of experts. Here, we demonstrate an implementation of MCDA expert preference assessments to river rehabilitation and provide ample material for other applications. To test whether the above simplifications reflect common expert opinion, we carried out very detailed interviews with five river ecologists and a hydraulic engineer. We defined essential objectives and measurable quality indicators (attributes), elicited the experts' preferences for objectives on a standardized scale (value functions) and their risk attitude, and identified suitable aggregation methods. The experts recommended an extensive objectives hierarchy including between 54 and 93 essential objectives and between 37 to 61 essential attributes. For 81% of these, they defined non-linear value functions and in 76% recommended multiplicative aggregation. The experts were risk averse or risk prone (but never risk neutral), depending on the current ecological state of the river, and the experts' personal importance of objectives. We conclude that the four commonly applied simplifications clearly do not reflect the opinion of river rehabilitation experts. The optimal level of model complexity, however, remains highly case-study specific depending on data and resource availability, the context, and the complexity of the decision problem.

AB  - High-quality nursery habitats support greater numbers of juveniles that survive to adulthood, but characteristics underlying high-quality habitats remain elusive because their productivity varies spatially and temporally and may be species-specific. Fish condition is an energy-integrative measure of ecological interactions, stress, and activity within a habitat, such that juvenile fish condition is representative of the quality of nursery habitats. We apply spatially explicit models to examine patterns in nursery habitat quality of Virginia estuaries based on nutritional condition for Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus, summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus, and striped bass Morone saxatilis. Environmental factors (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and depth) positively influenced the condition of Atlantic croaker but had mixed effects on striped bass and summer flounder condition, despite co-location of these species. Over the observed range of environmental conditions, the potential impact of salinity was 1.7 to 6 times that of other environmental factors. The condition of Atlantic croaker was negatively influenced by conspecific density, indicating local abundance mediates habitat quality. Regional habitat effects on fish condition were apparent after adjusting for broad-scale environmental effects: on average, striped bass condition was 22% greater in habitats near tributary mouths, Atlantic croaker condition was 28% greater in upestuary habitats, and the adjusted mean condition of summer flounder associated with coastal lagoons and the eastern side of Chesapeake Bay was 100% greater than conspecifics from other regions. Not all habitats are equally suitable for juvenile stages of estuarine species, but locations that produce well-conditioned individuals reveal the environmental characteristics associated with high-quality nursery habitats that contribute to species-specific productivity.

AB  - The present study aims to analyze the existing indoor environmental conditions of Firozabad City along with its impact on people's health by going through the correlative index of indoor environment's determinant and different diseases, faced by the people. In order to measure spatial disparities, the statistical technique, i. e. the standard score additive model (Z-score), has been applied to develop a composite score for each set of indicators in order to arrive at the general environmental and health condition of the study area as a whole. The analysis reveals that high intensity of indoor pollution and disease are reported in peripheral and old parts of the city. Preventive measures, likely to have deleterious health effects and improve such harmful environmental conditions, should be adopted. Enhanced use of clean fuel and national uniform housing codes or guidelines that address factors, affecting indoor air quality, makes up the current need.

AB  - Lipids in the female gonad of Pecten maximus from Ria de Arousa (N.W. Spain) were analysed for lipid class composition and fatty acid composition of triacylglycerols and phospholipids and their variations in relation to gametogenic cycle were studied for 16 months. The female condition index and stereological studies showed the existence of two principal spawning periods, winter and late spring early summer. No sexual resting period was found and oocyte lysis was high throughout the year. ovary lipid levels (16-21.5% dry weight) displayed clear seasonal changes linked to the gametogenic cycle. The acylglycerols (20-65% total lipids)and phospholipids (26-35%) were the major lipid classes, sterols (4-8%) were present in minor amounts. The acylglycerols and free sterols showed a seasonal variation similar to that of the mean oocyte diameter. The remainder of lipid classes showed no clear seasonal variation. The 20:5n-3 levels were higher than that of 22:6n-3 in the triacylglycerols, contrary to that of phospholipids. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were more abundant in the triacylglycerols and the series n-3 was clearly predominant. The Sigma n-3 and the principal n-3 fatty acids (mainly in phospholipids) showed a seasonal Variation clearly related to the reproductive cycle. (C) 1991 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Faecal glucocorticoid metabolites are minimally invasive stress physiology indices that can be used to understand how animals respond to physical and/or psychological challenges (stressors) and inform how to optimize conservation management in view of these stressors. We investigated contextual biological, environmental and parasitological factors influencing variation in baseline faecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) concentration in a critically endangered marsupial, the woylie (syn. brushtailed bettong, Bettongia penicillata). Woylies have undergone a rapid and significant population decline, with environmental stressors exacerbating disease suggested to contribute to these ongoing declines. We conducted a longitudinal field study of 15 adult woylies (9 females, 6 males) in a captive, naturalistic facility. FCM concentration in faecal samples (n = 269) collected monthly over 20 months was quantified by enzyme immunoassay in parallel with measures of body condition, sex, season, female reproductive status and the presence of endoparasites and ectoparasites. Linear mixed effect modelling revealed a significant effect of season, sex, body condition index and nematode parasite status on FCM. Overall, mean FCM was lowest in summer and highest in autumn and winter, and females had higher mean FCM than males. There was a significant but weak negative association between body condition and FCM. When woylies were shedding oxyurid nematode eggs they had higher mean FCM compared to when they were not shedding. In future, knowledge of factors that influence FCM fluctuations in woylies may be considered when carrying out potentially stressful conservation interventions that may influence the future survival of this unique and threatened species.

AB  - Interspecific synchrony and trait-based differences between species are likely to be related to each other. Therefore, we investigated interspecific synchrony patterns in a fish community under prolonged drought conditions, using a trait-based approach. We hypothesized that trait-similarity would predict interspecific synchrony among fish populations. We also expected that a general synchronous pattern for the whole community would be high during a severe drought context, indicating low stability. The study was conducted in a semi-arid reservoir between 2010 and 2017, which encompassed a five-year period of severe drought. We considered species differences in body length, gonadosomatic index, relative condition factor, and trophic level and found that interspecific synchrony was negatively related to species differences in body length. This result can be related to species requirements in terms of habitats and food resources. We also found a significant level of community-wide synchrony, with important implications for community stability during periods of prolonged drought. In conclusion, our results indicated a strong effect of environmental filtering in fish population dynamics over time. We highlight the importance of a trait-based approach to shed light on understanding ecological processes driving population dynamics. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although many loci have been associated with height in European ancestry populations, very few have been identified in African ancestry individuals. Furthermore, many of the known loci have yet to be generalized to and fine-mapped within a large-scale African ancestry sample. We performed sex-combined and sex-stratified meta-analyses in up to 52,764 individuals with height and genome-wide genotyping data from the African Ancestry Anthropometry Genetics Consortium (AAAGC). We additionally combined our African ancestry meta-analysis results with published European genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. In the African ancestry analyses, we identified three novel loci (SLC4A3, NCOA2, ECD/FAM149B1) in sex-combined results and two loci (CRB1, KLF6) in women only. In the African plus European sex-combinedGWAS, we identified an additional three novel loci (RCCD1, G6PC3, CEP95) which were equally driven by AAAGC and European results. Among 39 genome-wide significant signals at known loci, conditioning index SNPs from European studies identified 20 secondary signals. Two of the 20 new secondary signals and none of the 8 novel loci had minor allele frequencies (MAF) < 5%. Of 802 known European height signals, 643 displayed directionally consistent associations with height, of which 205 were nominally significant (p < 0.05) in the African ancestry sex-combined sample. Furthermore, 148 of 241 loci contained <= 20 variants in the credible sets that jointly account for 99% of the posterior probability of driving the associations. In summary, trans-ethnic meta-analyses revealed novel signals and further improved fine-mapping of putative causal variants in loci shared between African and European ancestry populations.

AB  - Successful organic farming requires crop varieties that are resilient to environmental variability. Assessing variety performance across the range of conditions represented on working farms is vital to developing such varieties; however, data collected from on-farm, participatory trials can be difficult to both collect and interpret. To assess the utility of data arising from participatory trialing efforts, we examined the performance of butternut squash (Cucurbita moschataL.), broccoli (Brassica oleraceaL.) and carrot (Daucus carotaL.) varieties grown in diverse organic production environments in participatory trials in Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and New York using adaptability analysis (regression of variety means on environmental index). Patterns of adaptation varied across varieties, with some demonstrating broad adaptation and others showing specific adaptation to low- or high-yielding environments. Selection of varieties with broadvsspecific adaptation should be guided by farmers' risk tolerance and on-farm environmental variation. Adaptability analysis was appropriate for continuous variables (e.g., yield traits), but less so for ordinal variables and quality traits such as flavor and appearance, which can be vitally important in organic vegetable crop variety selection. The relative advantages of adaptability analysis and additive main effects and multiplicative interactions are also discussed in relation to on-farm trial networks. This work demonstrated the unique challenges presented by extensive participatory vegetable trialing efforts, which, as compared to grain crops, require novel approaches to facilitating farmer participation as well as data collection and analysis. Efficient, precise and reliable methods for evaluating quality related traits in these crops would allow researchers to assess stability and adaptation across a wider range of traits, providing advantages for effective plant breeding and trialing activities within the organic sector.

AB  - Physoclistous fish are unable to rapidly ascend through the water column without significant risk of barotrauma via swim bladder hyperextension or rupture. Here, we report on the discovery of a highly specialised anatomical structure which permits some physoclistous fish species, the samson fish Seriola hippos and silver trevally Pseudocaranx georgianus, to vent swim bladder gas during ascent. Dissections of injected casts and X-ray imaging revealed the swim bladder 'vent' to consist of a membranous opening in the roof of the swim bladder which led to a flattened tube that bifurcated around the vertebral column and exited via a small, oval-shaped hole in the pharyngocleithral membrane underneath each operculum. Identification of these distinctive holes revealed that venting had occurred on ascent in 96 % of in S. hippos captured from depth. Decompression from simulated 30 m water depth in an experimental hyperbaric chamber revealed that venting in P. georgianus commenced when predicted swim bladder volume was approximately double that of its initial volume and ceased when the fish were again near neutrally buoyant. A homologous structure was identified in S. lalandi and S. dumerili. This structure represents an important step in the evolution of the teleost swim bladder which circumvents the normal physoclistous restriction on rapid ascents by eliminating, or minimising, barotrauma. Ecological benefits of this ability include an improved ability to capture prey, escape predators and perform 'spawning rushes'. The increased resilience to barotrauma provided by the swim bladder 'vent' may also reduce the levels of post-release discard mortality for deep-water species which possess the structure.

AB  - Produced water (PW) is the main discharge from the offshore oil industry and contains oil-derived compounds such as poly-aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, alkylphenols, and heavy metals Studies suggest that PW discharges may affect the biota over larger areas from the oil drilling sites at sea than originally predicted. We investigated the effects of chronic exposure to PW on some aspects of juvenile Atlantic cod immunity, stress response and growth by intermittently exposing fish to 0,100 or 200 ppm of PW for 22 weeks No significant effects of PW were observed on growth, hepatosomatic index, condition factor or plasma cortisol. The respiratory burst (RB) of circulating leukocytes was significantly elevated in the 100 ppm group only, while the RB of head kidney leukocytes was significantly decreased in both the 100 and 200 ppm groups. Significant up-regulation of the mRNA expression of beta-2-microglobulin, immunoglobulin-M light chain and interleukins-1 beta and 8 was observed in the 200 ppm group, while the down-regulation of interferon stimulated gene 15 was obvious for both the 100 and 200 ppm groups The results suggest that chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of beta W causes modulations of the immune system of juvenile Atlantic cod with most immune parameters being stimulated, potentially resulting in an energetic cost that may be detrimental to the fish Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB  - Pomacea canaliculata is a freshwater snail native to South America that together with some congeners has invaded natural wetlands and paddy fields in several continents, especially in Southern Asia. The high variability in shape, color and thickness of Pomacea shells and the sexual dimorphism in many traits blurs the species limits and hampers taxonomic identification. Ecological characterization of habitat productivity based on shells was previously proposed for P. canaliculata but was never methodically explored. Using full siblings of P. canaliculata, we studied the effects of different chronic levels of food availability (from 100% to 20% of daily ingestion rate) on shell shape, somatic indices and sexual dimorphism at maturity. The eight specific morphometric and somatic indices investigated showed different combinations of the effects of food availability and sex: changes related to food availability but independent of sex (relative aperture width), sexual dimorphism independent of food availability (shell globosity and relative aperture expansion), and changes related to food availability and sex, without a noticeable interaction (organic density); a significant interaction that increases the intersexual differences when food availability increases was detected in some indices (relative operculum weight, overall shell density and relative shell investment). The organic density can be used as a condition index to indicate the actual trophic availability in the field, although it should be estimated separately for males and females. The relative aperture width and the overall shell density can be used as paleo-environmental indicators of productivity, as they can be measured on empty shells. The effect of water alkalinity should be taken into account should the latter be used.

AB  - Silviculture can be considered a sustainable alternative to the extraction of wood from natural forests in Brazil. However, the high demand for wood products has decreased the area of natural Cerrado due to land transformation for forestry activities. This transformation could lead to the loss of species, including insects that cannot tolerate the new environment dominated by exotic plant species. This study aims to evaluate whether the presence of an extensive Eucalyptus silviculture in the Brazilian Cerrado decreases the integrity of nearby riparian environments and, consequently, decreases odonate diversity. Thirteen ponds were selected in patches of Cerrado embedded within a matrix of Eucalyptus silviculture in order to assess habitat integrity of ponds and their riparian zones and collect adult odonates. The physical integrity of the study sites was measured using a Habitat Integrity Index (HII) designed to determine the degree of conservation of aquatic environments. The HII of the study sites varied between 0.44 and 0.80, indicating differences in the degree of conservation. Therefore, a positive relationship was found between odonate richness and abundance and HII, and between the abundance of zygopterans and anisopterans and HII. These findings may be due to the fact that these insects are adapted to the natural resources maintained at the most conserved habitats, and which were lost in degraded riparian zones, such as the presence of aquatic vegetation and a diversity of organic debris on pond banks. We conclude that the conversion of natural areas to Eucalyptus silviculture can alter the integrity of nearby riparian zones and, consequently, odonate diversity. Graphical abstract

AB  - The non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has been introduced worldwide for angling purposes and has established self-reproducing populations in many parts of the world. Introduced rainbow trout often have negative effects on the native salmonid species, ranging from decrease abundance, growth and survival, to their local extinction. Assessing the effects of introduced rainbow trout on the native species is thus crucial to better set up conservation programmes. In this study, we investigated the effects of non-native rainbow trout on the diet of native marble trout (Salmo marmoratus) living in the Idrijca River (Slovenia). An impassable waterfall separates the stream in two sectors only a few hundred metres apart: a downstream sector (treatment) in which marble trout live in sympatry (MTs) with rainbow trout (RTs) and an upstream sector (control) in which marble trout live in allopatry (MTa). Specifically, we investigated using stable isotopes the effects of rainbow trout on dietary niche, diet composition, body condition, and lipid content of marble trout. We found dietary niche expansion and niche shift in marble trout living in sympatry with rainbow trout. Compared to MTa, MTs had higher piscivory rate and showed higher body condition and prereproduction lipid content. Our results indicate that the presence of rainbow trout did not have negative effects on marble trout diet and condition and that changes in dietary niche of marble trout are likely to be an adaptive response to the presence of rainbow trout, and further research is needed to better understand.

AB  - Providing insight into one's health status from a gut microbiome sample is an important clinical goal in current human microbiome research. Herein, we introduce the Gut Microbiome Health Index (GMHI), a biologically-interpretable mathematical formula for predicting the likelihood of disease independent of the clinical diagnosis. GMHI is formulated upon 50 microbial species associated with healthy gut ecosystems. These species are identified through a multi-study, integrative analysis on 4347 human stool metagenomes from 34 published studies across healthy and 12 different nonhealthy conditions, i.e., disease or abnormal bodyweight. When demonstrated on our population-scale meta-dataset, GMHI is the most robust and consistent predictor of disease presence (or absence) compared to alpha-diversity indices. Validation on 679 samples from 9 additional studies results in a balanced accuracy of 73.7% in distinguishing healthy from non-healthy groups. Our findings suggest that gut taxonomic signatures can predict health status, and highlight how data sharing efforts can provide broadly applicable discoveries.

AB  - We evaluated several lines of evidence to identify bedded fine sediment levels that should protect and maintain self-sustaining populations of native, sediment-sensitive aquatic species in the western US. To identify these potential criterion values for streambed sediments <= 0.06 mm (fines) and <= 2 mm (sand and fines) diameter, we examined: 1) the range of areal % fines and areal % sand and fines values at 169 least-disturbed reference sites in our sample, 2) sediment tolerance values calculated for a selection of sediment-sensitive aquatic vertebrate and macroinvertebrate taxa for both particle size ranges, 3) quantile regression predictions of the declines in vertebrate and macroinvertebrate Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) at progressively higher ambient levels of streambed sediment from synoptic survey data acquired in 557 mountain stream sampling sites in 12 western states, 4) a literature review of the effects of sand and fines on the survival of salmonid eggs to hatching, and 5) a literature review of studies that quantitatively linked macroinvertebrate response to the pertinent size ranges of streambed sediment in mountain streams. Predicted maximum vertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) declined 4.4 points (SE = 1.0) and macroinvertebrate IBI declined 4.0 points (SE = 0.60) for each 10% increase in % fines. Similarly, for each 10% increase in % sand and fines, the predicted maximum vertebrate IBI decreased 3.7 points (SE = 0.50) and macroinvertebrate IBI decreased 3.0 points (SE = 0.50). Combining all lines of evidence, we concluded that for sediment-sensitive aquatic vertebrates, minimum-effect sediment levels were 5% and 13% for % fines and % sand and fines, respectively, both expressed as areal percentages of the wetted streambed surface. For aquatic macroinvertebrates, minimum-effect levels for the 2 sediment size classes were 3% and 10%, respectively. We encourage managers to consider these biologically based minimum-effect values when developing sediment criteria for mountain streams. Quantifying and comparing both vertebrate and macroinvertebrate assemblage responses to streambed sedimentation informs the criteria-setting process and allows managers to set stream restoration priorities.

AB  - Human activity affects ecosystem functions through the disruption of pattern and rate of matter as well as energy flow through ecosystems. Extraction, transport and transformation of resources driven by societal and economic pressures change our landscape. These processes influence biodiversity, redefine the ecological state of ecosystems and impact both on society and the economy. Thus the inclusion of socio-economic dimensions into standard ecological research has been identified as a challenge in a new phase of development in Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER). Transformation from LTER to LTSER - Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research - raises questions about the comparability and compatibility of research, the need for indicators linking environmental and socioeconomic processes as well as criteria for launching research sites that focus on interaction between society and nature. In this paper we propose criteria developed within A Long-Term Biodiversity, Ecosystem and Awareness Research Network (ALTER Net). These criteria are designed to support the process of transformation of traditional research sites, with the aim of broadening their scope to a socio-economic dimension. They may also be used for identifying and launching new sites - the LTSER-sites. We suggest that apart from criteria for selection of specific sites, the whole pool of different sites (the network database) is crucial for recognizing cross-scale processes, general socio-ecological and economic trends as well as resource management. Therefore the paper distinguishes between two sets of criteria: local "site criteria" and network "pool criteria". They may be used both as a quality label for transition of traditional ecological sites and as a matrix for establishing and developing new research areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the variability in organism's immunological response is crucial for predicting changes at population or community level. The present study investigated the immunoecology of a commercially valuable clam Paphia malabarica in a tropical monsoon-influenced estuary. Clams were collected monthly during a year cycle, which coincided with pre-monsoon (February-May), monsoon (June-September) and post-monsoon seasons (October-January). For assessment of immune functioning, selected hemocyte parameters (total hemocyte concentration, hemocyte mortality, lysosomal content, esterase activity, reactive oxygen species production, and phagocytic activity) were analyzed using flow cytometry. Simultaneously, clam's condition index, nutrients, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and bacterial density were also measured at the sampling site. Our results exhibited seasonal patterns in hemocyte functioning with the highest activity during the pre-monsoon season (suggestive of a suitable harvesting period) and lowest during monsoon (suggestive of a critical biological period). The critical biological period for P. malabarica was marked with compromised immune parameters inflicted by low salinity, food availability, and possibly high bacterial abundance. Also, the involvement of reproductive stress altering the hematological functioning in P. malabarica cannot be ruled out. Nutrients, dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature could not explain much of the hemocyte variability. The present study has further validated the usefulness of hemocyte as a suitable marker for understanding immunoecology of P. malabarica which is of prime importance, especially in a monsoon-influenced tropical estuarine environment. The findings of our research will be constructive in monitoring natural as well as cultivated bivalve populations of economic and ecological relevance.

AB  - The application and development of environmental laws governing watershed management requires identification of biological indicators, parameters and measures to establish its ecological status, for which the present study aims to characterize the ecological indicator value of stream benthic algae in an urban area of Mexico City. Six sites of the Magdalena river were studied in the most contrasting seasons: dry-warm, rainy and dry-cold. At each site the physicochemical parameters of water were recorded and 10 samples were collected: Five with visible algal growths and five with diatoms. The environmental quality of each site was determined by the trophic status and its confirmation with the richness and benthic algal diversity, through a canonical correspondence analysis and the calculation of the indicator value of species (IndVal). According to the trophic status, three groups of sites were recognized. The first group (G1) was assessed as reference of the oligotrophic conditions and presented 11 species with the highest IndVal, protruding: Encyonema silesiacum, Gomphonema parvulum, Navicula cryptocephala, Planothidium lanceolatum, Vaucheria bursata, Placoma regulare and Nostoc parmelioides. A second group (G2) was associated with 15 species considered detectors, which were tolerant to increased nutrients in at least one season, such as Diatoma mesodon and Prasiola mexicana. The third group (G3) included sites with species that had a wide range of tolerance to pollution: Fistulifera saprophila, Nitzschia minuta, Nitzschia palea, Nitzschia recta and Phormidium autumnale. The species IndVal of Magdalena River has established reference sites of good environmental quality and those that are altered by human activities, therefore they are recommended as the first step in a methodological proposal for a long-term biomonitoring through a biological index.

AB  - y We quantified the influence of agricultural activities on environmental and biological conditions of floodplain wetlands in the upper Missouri River basin. Seasonally-flooded wetlands were characterized as low impact (non-disturbed) or high impact (disturbed) based on local land use. Biological data collected from these wetlands were used to develop a wetland condition index (WCI). Fourteen additional wetlands were sampled to evaluate the general condition of seasonally-flooded floodplain wetlands. Structural and functional attributes of macrophyte, algae, and macroinvertebrate communities were tested as candidate metrics for assessing biotic responses. The WCI we developed used six biological metrics to discriminate between disturbed and non-disturbed wetlands: 1) biomass of Culicidae larvae, 2) abundance of Chironomidae larvae, 3) macroinvertebrate diversity, 4) total number of plant species, 5) the proportion of exotic plant species, and 6) total number of sensitive diatom species. Disturbed wetlands had less taxa richness and species diversity and more exotic and nuisance (e.g., mosquitoes) species. Environmental differences between low and high impact wetlands included measures of total potassium, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, alkalinity, conductance, and sediment phosphorus concentration. Canonical analyses showed that WCI scores were weakly correlated (P = 0.057) with environmental variables in randomly selected wetlands. In addition, mean WCI score for random wetlands was higher than that for high impact wetlands, implying that floodplain wetlands were less impacted by the types of agricultural activities affecting high impact sites. Inter-year sampling of some wetlands revealed that WCI metrics were correlated in 2000 and 2001, implying that biological metrics provided useful indicators of disturbance in floodplain wetlands.

AB  - Wildfires are a major natural hazard, causing substantial damage to infrastructure as well as being a risk to lives and homes. An understanding of their progression and behaviour is necessary to reduce risks and to develop operational management strategies in the event of an active fire. Many empirical fire-spread models have been developed to predict the spread and overall behaviour of a wildfire, based on a range of parameters such as weather and fuel conditions. However, these parameters may not be available with sufficient accuracy or spatiotemporal resolution to provide reliable fire spread predictions. Fuel condition data include variables such as vegetation quantity, structure and moisture content and, in the event of previous wildfires, the burn severity and stage of ecosystem recovery. In this study, an index called the Vegetation Structure Perpendicular Index (VSPI) is introduced. The VSPI utilises the short-wave infrared reflectance in bands centred at 1.6 and 2.2 pm, essentially representing the amount and structure of the vegetation's woody biomass (as opposed to the photosynthetic activity and moisture content). The VSPI is quantified as the divergence from a linear regression between the two bands in a time series and represents vegetation disturbance and recovery more reliably than indices such as the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The VSPI index generally shows minor inter-annual variability and stronger post-wildfire detection of disturbance over a longer period than NBR and NDVI. The index is developed and applied to major wildfire events within eucalypt forests throughout southern Australia to estimate both burn severity and time to recovery. The VSPI can provide an improved information layer for fire risk evaluation and operational predictions of wildfire behaviour.

AB  - Drainage systems are responsible for maintaining adequate soil moisture levels and alleviating negative consequences of excess water coming from the spring thaw as well as torrential rains. In the face of the climate change and pervasive extreme weather conditions, the importance of these ameliorative measures will be increasing. It is imperative to ensure appropriate functioning of these drainage systems. To be effective they need to be adequately operated and maintained, with maintenance measures performed appropriately and with required frequency. Basic ditch conservation procedures include mowing to remove vegetation overgrowth and cleanout to remove sediment. A significant problem in Poland results from an insufficient number of renovation and conservation operations performed on drainage systems, their gradual deterioration and depreciation. As a result, it is crucial to assess the need for renovation and modernisation of drainage ditches. It needs to be remembered that these operations interfere with the environment and may cause some unfavourable ecological changes. In view of the above, the authors of this publication conducted a thorough evaluation of both the required renovation of the investigated drainage ditch system and its current ecological status. The study area comprised the Strumien Junikowski catchment with the main outlet, i.e. Strumien Junikowski, its tributaries (the Skorzynka, Lawica, Plewianka, Ceglanka) as the main collection ditches and field ditches. During the field inspection the existing drainage structures were inventoried, with their technical condition assessed according to Kaca and Interewicz (1991). In this paper the characteristics of habitats found in the drainage area of the watercourse are presented along with the bioindicator analysis performed using the Macrophyte River Assessment Method. Based on the MIR index the ecological status of the stream was assessed and classified in accordance with the Water Framework Directive. The results demonstrate a significant variation of the ecological state of Strumien Junikowski over its entire course. The condition of the drainage structures in the drainage area varies. In the main watercourse of Strumien Junikowski the inspected culverts are in a good condition in contrast to the ones located on the tributaries. Vegetation overgrowth and sediment deposition in the ditches are major problems of the drainage area. This is caused by a lack of effective and systematic maintenance and renovation of the watercourses. The Strumien Junikowski drainage area is further being developed, which is associated with a rapid and increased discharge of rainwater and snowmelt. Thus it is necessary to maintain drainage ditches to ensure their optimal condition, which is essential to decrease the risk of flooding in the urban areas adjacent to the watercourse.

AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of propolis on mortality of fish eggs due to mycosis, to study its efficacy on the fish growth rate and to analyze the histochemical and ultrastructural characteristics of muscle fibres. We evaluated the muscular development of fish in two different experimental conditions: traditional feeding and feeding with addition of propolis (groups A and B, respectively). The study was carried out on two species of teleosts bred in Italy, Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) and Salmo trutta (brown trout). The use of propolis reduced mortality of fish eggs. The muscles were stained for myosin ATPase and succinic dehydrogenase to evaluate fibre type. The area, maximum and minimum diameter for each fibre type in relation to the body length were measured. The animals fed propolis showed a more rapid muscular growth compared to control fed the standard diet. Fibres were larger in the Salmo trutta than in the Oncorhynchus mykiss in both groups. In fish of A group, myotomal muscle, the presence of giant fibres and index of environmental stress was noticed. This type of study is valuable in order to extend the use of propolis as an antifungal agent and a natural product that can improve fish farming.

AB  - In nature, animals often face periods without food caused by seasonal fluctuations and/or prey scarcity. An organism's physiological response to imposed energetic limitations is followed by changes in mitochondrial functioning (adjustment of energy metabolism) and a reduction of non-essential processes. However, this energy-saving strategy can have its costs. In this study, we examined oxidative stress as one of the possible physiological costs of short-term, two-week-long food deprivation on developing amphibian larvae of the crested newts Triturus macedonicus and Triturus ivanbureschi and their hybrids. We investigated whether this exogenous factor additionally affected the oxidative status (fitness-related trait) of hybrid individuals. The fasting treatment led to lower growth and a lower body mass and body condition index of individuals. The results revealed that the antioxidant system (AOS) of food-deprived larvae could not cope in a proper manner with reactive oxygen species production under limited energy availability, leading to higher lipid oxidative damage. The lowest AOS response was observed for H2O2 scavenging parameters (catalase, glutathione pemxidase, and total glutathione), which together with the elevated activity of superoxide dismutase suggested increased H2O2 concentrations. Comparison between parental species and their hybrids showed that hybrid individuals suffered greater oxidative damage (as demonstrated by higher concentrations of lipid peroxides), indicating that they were more susceptible to fasting-induced oxidative stress. Overall, this study illustrates that: (i) an oxidative event is one of the costs amphibian larvae face during short-term periods of fasting, (ii) hybrids are less capable of dealing with this stressful condition, which can lower their chances of survival in a changing environment.

AB  - Diatoms have been regularly used as bioindicators to assess water quality of surface waters. However, diatom-based indices developed for a specific geographic region may not be appropriate elsewhere. We sampled benthic diatom assemblages in the upper Han River, a subtropical river in China, to evaluate applicability of 14 diatom-based indices used worldwide for water quality assessment. A total of 194 taxa from 31 genera were identified in the dry season and 139 taxa from 23 genera in the wet season. During the dry season, significant relationships were found for all but one of the diatom-based indices (Index Diatom Artois-Picardie) with one or more physical and chemical variables including nutrients and ion concentrations in river waters. The Biological Diatom Index (IBD) and diatom-based eutrophication/pollution index (EPI-D) were strongly related to trophic status and ionic content, while Watanabe's Index was related to organic pollution and conductivity. Yet, the diatom indices showed weak relationships with physical and chemical variables during the wet season. It suggests that diatom-based indices developed in Europe can be applied with confidence as bioindicators of water quality in subtropical rivers of China, at least during base-flow conditions.

AB  - Bioassessment methods for wetlands, and other bodies of water, have been developed worldwide to measure and quantify changes in "biological integrity." These assessments are based on a classification system, meant to ensure appropriate comparisons between wetland types. Using a local site-specific disturbance gradient, we built vegetation indices of biological integrity (Veg-IBIs) based on two commonly used wetland classification systems in the USA: One based on vegetative structure and the other based on a wetland's position in a landscape and sources of water. The resulting class-specific Veg-IBIs were comprised of 1-5 metrics that varied in their sensitivity to the disturbance gradient (R (2) = 0.14 -aEuro parts per thousand 0.65). Moreover, the sensitivity to the disturbance gradient increased as metrics from each of the two classification schemes were combined (added). Using this information to monitor natural and created wetlands will help natural resource managers track changes in biological integrity of wetlands in response to anthropogenic disturbance and allows the use of vegetative communities to set ecological performance standards for mitigation banks.

AB  - Sardine, pilchard and anchovy stocks form the basis of commercially important purse seine fisheries in eastern boundary upwelling regions. High levels of environmentally driven recruitment variability have, however, made them especially difficult to manage. Reliable forecasts of recruitment success would greatly help with the setting of catch quotas prior to each fishing season. Theories of how environmental conditions influence recruitment success, according to survival/mortality of the early life-history stages, can be divided into mechanistic and sythesis theories. Mechanistic theories are concerned with specific physical processes, whereas synthesis theories attempt to unite the various mechanistic processes within a single conceptual framework. Despite the successful testing of some theories, there has been little success in reliably predicting recruitment success from a knowledge of environmental conditions. Possible reasons include the following: non-linearity in the relationship between environmental parameters and recruitment: the poor spatial and temporal resolution of much oceanographic data; the wide range of different factors involved in determining recruitment success; and the choice of environmental index. The recent compilation of time series of satellite images for these regions offers a solution to some of these problems, and in doing so reopens the possibility of finding sufficiently good relationships between environmental conditions and recruitment success for management purposes. In particular, the high resolution of these time series allows for the construction of environmental indices across many different spatial and temporal scales. These time series also open up the possibility of quantifying the behaviour of upwelling systems according to the evolution of their spatial structure through time, using pattern analysis techniques.

AB  - In this work, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems applied in university buildings with control based on PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) and aPMV (adaptive Predicted Mean Vote) indexes are discussed. The building's thermal behavior with complex topology, in transient thermal conditions, for summer and winter conditions is simulated by software. The university building is divided into 124 spaces, on two levels with an area of 5931 m(2), and is composed of 201 transparent surfaces and 1740 opaque surfaces. There are 86 compartments equipped with HVAC systems. The simulation considers the actual occupation and ventilation cycles, the external environmental variables, the internal HVAC system and the occupants' and building's characteristics. In this work, a new HVAC control system, designed to simultaneously obtain better occupants' thermal comfort levels according to category C of ISO 7730 with less energy consumption, is presented. This new HVAC system with aPMV index control is numerically implemented, and its performance is compared with the performance of the same HVAC system with the usual PMV index control. Both HVAC control systems turn on only when the PMV index or the aPMV index reaches values below -0.7, in winter conditions, and when the PMV index or the aPMV index reaches values above +0.7, in summer conditions. In accordance with the results obtained, the HVAC system guarantees negative PMV and aPMV indexes in winter conditions and positive PMV and aPMV indexes in summer conditions. The energy consumption level is higher in winter conditions than in summer conditions for compartments with shading, and it is lower in winter conditions than in summer conditions for compartments exposed to direct solar radiation. The consumption level is higher using the PMV control than with the aPMV control. Air temperature, in accordance with Portuguese standards, is higher than 20 degrees C in winter conditions and lower than 27 degrees C in summer conditions. In Mediterranean climates, the HVAC systems with aPMV control provide better occupants' thermal comfort levels and less energy consumption than the HVAC system with PMV control.

AB  - Historically, Argentina has been among the world leaders in the production and export of agricultural products. The country is increasingly confronted with severe conflicts that originate from trade-offs between actors involved in the agricultural sector. This work presents an integrated valuation of alternative land use scenarios in the Carcarana River Lower Basin, offering a way to link the various value domains by involving a broad set of multidimensional indicators and stakeholder concerns. Twenty-one indicators that address all three pillars of sustainability, environmental, economic and social, are selected and quantified. Three scenarios are analyzed: the Actual scenario, dominated by industrial-scale agriculture that primarily yields soybeans, maize and wheat; a Conservation Agriculture scenario, promoting permanent soil cover by crop rotation and the implementation of untreated buffer zones around the cities; and a Short Sighted Exploitation scenario, contributing to short-term profits for agribusiness but increasing pressure on the natural resources. A decision support system is implemented in the Driver, Pressure, State, and Ecosystem Services indicator framework. The Conservation Agriculture scenario is identified as the best option by stakeholders grouped into Regulatory State, Civil Society and Consensus perspectives. A ranking change occurs when the valuation is carried out from the Private Sector point of view and the Actual scenario comes in first position. We dare to say that the methodology presented in this work is a socio-technical innovation that can contribute to the process needed to achieve broad consensus among the agribusiness actors in Argentina.

AB  - Habitat heterogeneity is increased in natural systems via habitat loss and fragmentation, which decreases the patch size and alters the amount of edge relative to interior. However, our understanding of how increased habitat heterogeneity influences population dynamics, particularly set within a large scale marine landscape, is relatively incomplete. Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica populations have drastically declined resulting in fragmentation within and among reefs, thus altering reef size and distances from edge to interior. Over 2 yr (2011 to 2012), we evaluated oyster populations relative to varying distances from the reef edge to interior locations, habitat patch size, and reef type on naturally occurring intertidal fringing and patch reefs in southeastern North Carolina. Additionally, the influences of distance from edge to interior locations and habitat patch size were examined for oyster populations on 3 size classes of created intertidal reefs at 2 locations. The habitat characteristics examined significantly influenced oyster populations, with increased densities towards interior locations on a reef, a trend of overall higher densities on intermediate sized reefs, significantly greater densities on natural patch reefs compared to natural fringing reefs. Density and recruitment patterns suggested differences between edge and interior locations. However, other population characteristics, such as oyster condition and shell height, indicated there may be ecological trade-offs among the habitat characteristics examined. These results suggest intertidal reefs cannot be considered a uniform whole and may have substantially different habitat characteristics, which should be taken into account when further examining habitat fragmentation and restoration success.

AB  - The experiment was designed to determine the combined effect of fish diet and water temperature on juvenile tench Tinca tinca (L.). Three diets were used: commercial dry diet for fish Aller Futura (diet F); frozen Chironomidae larvae (diet C); and Aller Futura substituted with Chironomidae at a ratio of 3:2 (dry weight; diet FC). Daily food rations and duration of the experiment were adjusted to temperatures of 20 degrees C, 23 degrees C and 26 degrees C based on a correction factor q equal to 1.000, 0.779 and 0.609 respectively. The experiment lasted 92, 72 and 56days for the respective temperatures. No mortality occurred. The highest relative growth rates were found at 26 degrees C in diets F and FC. The lowest food conversion ratio of 1.12-1.22 (recalculated for dry weight of feed diet) was determined in fish fed diet F at 23 degrees C and 26 degrees C. A high value of condition index appeared to be the early warning of decreasing biological quality of fish and deformities. The lowest incidence of fish with deformities (IDef) was found in groups fed diet C (<1%), while the highest (90%) in fish fed diet F at 26 degrees C. A lower share of dry diet in the fish food and a lower water temperature led to a lower IDef. Thus, amount of dry feed in fish diet was the major factor inducing body deformities, while water temperature only modified the effects of the dietary factor. Diet C at 23-26 degrees C was the most cost-effective of the tested combinations of diet and temperature.

AB  - Estuarine bivalves are exposed to spatial and temporal variations in salinity and seston quality and quantity. This is the first study to investigate the effects of salinity reduction and phytoplankton availability on the survival, health and growth of a burrowing bivalve. The intertidal clam Austrovenus stutchburyi survived 6 wk of laboratory storage in dilute seawater (20parts per thousand) at 15degreesC. In salinities below 14parts per thousand, and at low phytoplankton concentrations (<10 mug chl a l(-1)), clams lost weight and mortality occurred within 4 wk of exposure. With high phytoplankton availability (> 20 mug chl a l(-1)), some clams survived 6 wk exposure to 7parts per thousand. Salinity and quality of seston over 5 shellfish beds varied both amongst and within sites. Chl a concentration at high tide was variable between sites, but was generally below 8 mug l(-1). Seston total particulate matter (TPM) ranged from 25 to 400 mg l(-1), and particulate organic matter (POM) from 3 to 31 mg l(-1). Clams transplanted to other sites in the estuary quickly adapted to new environmental conditions. Average growth rates of clams caged at 4 estuary sites for 6 mo (October 1997 to April 1998) were low, between 0.17 and 0.35 mm mo(-1). Total length increment correlated positively with low-tide temperature, salinity and average chl a concentration. After 2 mo, there was a direct linear relationship between transplanted clam standard condition index (CIshell) and length increment. The integrated laboratory and field studies confirm that salinity dilution, together with low phytoplankton availability, reduces growth and condition of this shallow-burrowing estuarine clam.

AB  - 1. We used 94 sites within the Northern Lakes and Forests ecoregion spanning Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan to identify environmental variables at the catchment, reach and riparian scales that influence stream macroinvertebrates. Redundancy analyses (RDA) found significantly influential variables within each scale and compared their relative importance in structuring macroinvertebrate assemblages.
   2. Environmental variables included landcover, geology and groundwater delivery estimates at the catchment scale, water chemistry, channel morphology and stream habitat at the reach scale, and landcover influences at three distances perpendicular to the stream at the riparian scale. Macroinvertebrate responses were characterised with 22 assemblage attributes, and the relative abundance and presence/absence of 66 taxa.
   3. Each scale defined macroinvertebrates along an erosional to depositional gradient. Wisconsin's macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity, Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera taxa and erosional taxa corresponded with forest streams, whereas organic pollution tolerant, Chironomidae and depositional taxa corresponded with wetland streams. Reach scale analyses defined the gradient similarly as dissolved oxygen and wide, shallow channels (erosional) opposed instream macrophytes and pool habitats (depositional). Riparian forests within 30 m of the stream coincided with an erosional assemblage and biotic integrity.
   4. Next, we combined all significant environmental variables across scales to compare the relative influence of each spatial scale on macroinvertebrates. Partial RDA procedures described how much of the explained variance was attributable to each spatial scale and each interrelated scale combination.
   5. Our results appeared consistent with the concept of hierarchical functioning of scale in which large-scale variables restrict the potential for macroinvertebrate traits or taxa at smaller spatial scales. Catchment and reach variables were equally influential in defining assemblage attributes, whereas the reach scale was more influential in determining relative abundance and presence/absence.
   6. Ultimately, comprehending the relative influence of catchment and reach scale properties in structuring stream biota will assist prioritising the scale at which to rehabilitate, manage and derive policies for stream ecosystem integrity.

AB  - The Cochin estuarine system (CES) being one among the world's highly polluted and productive estuarine system was monitored to assess the trophic condition in view of the changing nutrient regime. The estuarine system was shallow, with mixo-oligo to mixo-mesohaline salinities (9.65 +/- 6.99 %). The dissolved oxygen and the pH regime of the water column were 5.92 +/- 1.13 mg L-1 and 7.42 +/- 0.71, respectively. The study documents high dissolved inorganic nitrogen (28.95 +/- 8.47 mu mol L-1), dissolved inorganic carbon (1089.87 +/- 362.36 mu mol L-1), dissolved inorganic phosphate (7.76 +/- 3.56 mu mol L-1) and gross primary productivity (2.31 +/- 1.14 gC m(-3) day(-1)). However, explicitly augmented inorganic nutrients coupled with low dissolved oxygen, pH, and productivity patterns were observed in station 7. High dissolved inorganic carbon denoted net heterotrophic condition. Trophic index (TRIX units) was observed to be high compared to earlier reports, indicated eutrophicated condition with the highest value at station 1 (8.04 +/- 0.28). Therefore, proper management interventions are required to restrict allochthonous nutrient loading to protect CES from further anthropogenic impacts and to mitigate the eutrophication process.

AB  - More than three million farmed mallards are released annually for hunting purposes in Europe. The ecological impact of these releases depends on how many birds survive to join the wild breeding population. We estimated annual survival in farmed-released and wild-caught Swedish mallards, using mark-recapture data. In 2011-2018, we ringed 13,533 farmed ducklings before release (26.5% recovered). Most recoveries were birds shot at the release site, while only about 4% were found >3 km away. In 2002-2018, 19,820 wild mallards were ringed in Sweden, yielding 1369 (6.9%) recoveries. Like in farmed-released birds, most recoveries were by hunting, but 91.1% of recovered wild mallards were >3 km away from the ringing site. Annual survival rate in farmed-released mallards (ringed as pulli) was 0.02. In wild mallards (ringed as fledged or fully grown), annual survival was lower in females (0.64) than in males (0.71). At two sites in 2018, farmed ducklings were released in two batches 3 weeks apart to study the effect of early versus late release date, while controlling for body condition (BCI). Ducklings released early had a higher BCI and were recovered earlier (lower longevity) than those released late. Individual BCI and longevity were not correlated in recovered ducklings. Based on our estimate of annual survival in farmed-released mallards, a substantial number, i.e., 5000 (95% CI, 3040-6960), join the wild population annually. Despite being fed, a large proportion of released ducklings does not survive until the hunting season. Early releases may maximize pre-hunting survival. Repeated releases may prolong hunting opportunities and increase hunting bags.

AB  - Amazonia, the largest Brazilian biome, is one of the most diverse biomes around the world. Considering the Brazilian chiropteran species, 120 out of known 167 species are registered in Para state, with 10 endemic species. Despite the high diversity of bats in Amazonia, studies on their parasites, especially on helminths, are scarce. Therefore, the present study aims to study the helminth fauna of different bats from the Para state, Amazon biome, determine the descriptors of infection, and evaluate the host-parasite interactions, as well as evaluate differences in ecological indexes in accordance with the feeding guilds. The study was developed on 67 bats of 21 species captured in several areas of the Para state. The animals were identified, divided into feeding guilds, and necropsied. The parasites obtained were identified and quantified. A total of 182 parasites were found in 20.89 % of the studied bats, representing nine species, as follows: Anenterotrema eduardocaballeroi, Anenterotrema liliputianum, Ochoterenatrema caballeroi, Tricholeiperia sp., Parahistiostrongylus octacanthus, Litomosoides guiterasi, Litomosoides brasiliensis, Capillariinae gen. sp., and Hymenolepididae gen. sp. Also, the results indicated that there was no impact of parasitism on host body condition and no relationship between sex and parasite intensity. In relation to the feeding guilds, the omnivores showed higher prevalence and mean intensity. Animals from regions closer to the equator tend to have greater richness in parasite species, but the present study revealed low diversity and richness in species. In conclusion, the ecological pattern observed for other animal groups, in which higher parasitic diversity are registered in lower latitudes, is not applicable to chiropterans from the study area.

AB  - Upwelling and the El Nino "Southern Oscillation" (ENSO) are recurrent climatic phenomena in the southeastern Pacific Ocean that severely affect the reproduction and growth of pelagic fish populations. However, there are not long-term growth data from demersal fish populations to test these interconections in a long-term analysis. For this reason, a first extensive growth chronology was reconstructed from the annual growth of sagittal otoliths as a proxy for somatic growth for the cardinalfish (Epigonus crassicaudus). Adult fish ranging from 35 to 40 cm in fork length and from 39 to 63 years in age were collected off Chilean waters. The master chronologies were estimated for the period from 1974 to 2014, using the regional curve standardization approach (RCS) and linear mixed models (LMMs). Growth indexes derived from both approaches followed a similar trend and were positively correlated with the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and negatively with ENSO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation and sea surface temperature. LMMs showed that a 75% of growth variability was explained by the age of increment formation and HCI was the environmental index that most significantly affected the annual growth of cardinalfish followed by the sea surface temperature in spring. A reduced growth phase from 1974 to 1996 contrasted with a higher growth period from 1997, matching the 1997/1998 climatic regime shift, demonstrating that the enhanced growth for cardinalfish was associated with upwelling of nutrient rich water to the surface, triggering an increase of the primary and secondary productivity during the prevalence of a cold regime period in the Humboldt Current System. The consistence between RCS and LMM methods was indicative that both approaches are promising to evaluate the influence of environmental drivers on the growth condition of a demersal fish population in a highly productive marine ecosystem.

AB  - This paper presents a stock-flow consistent (SFC) macroeconomic simulation model for Canada. We use the model to generate three very different stories about the future of the Canadian economy, covering the half century from 2017 to 2067: a Base Case Scenario in which current trends and relationships are projected into the future, a Carbon Reduction Scenario in which measures are introduced specifically designed to reduce Canada's carbon emissions, and a Sustainable Prosperity Scenario which incorporates additional measures to improve environmental, social and financial conditions across society. The performance of the economy is tracked using two composite indicators constructed especially for this study: an environmental burden index (EBI) which describes the environmental performance of the model; and a composite sustainable prosperity index (SPI) which is based on a weighted average of seven economic, social and environmental performance indicators. Contrary to the widely accepted view, the results suggest that 'green growth' (in the Carbon Reduction Scenario) may be slower than 'brown growth'. More importantly, we show (in the Sustainable Prosperity Scenario) that improved environmental and social outcomes are possible even as the growth rate declines to zero.

AB  - In this work, composed by two experiments (EI and EII), was tested the efficiency of different eCG doses and the reuse of intra-vaginal progesterone (P4) device in fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) protocols for post-partum Nelore cows with suckling calves. Were used 263 cows with corporal condition score between 2 and 3 and ovarian condition 2, and that had calved between 60 and 110 days before. In EI, testing the effect of two eCG doses in the afore mentioned protocols, the cows were distributed in three groups (G1, G2, G3). The cows of the G1 (n = 54) did not receive eCG (control), while the cows of the G2 (n = 38) and G3 (n = 50) received, respectively, 200 UI and 300 UI of eCG. In EII, evaluating the efficiency of reusing P4 intra-vaginal implants, the cows were randomly distributed in four groups (G1, G2, G3, G4), where the cows in G1 (n = 31) received new implants, and the cows in G2 (n = 46), G3 (n = 25) and G4 (n = 19) had the implants used, respectively, twice, three and four times. Ten days after the FTAI, the cows were placed with the bulls in the pasture for a 30 day period. In order to evaluate the FTAI fertility index, the gestation diagnosis by rectal palpation was performed on the 45 degrees day after the inseminations, while the natural mount fertility index was measured by performing rectal palpation examination on the 45 degrees day after the bulls removal. In EI, the pregnancy indexes of FTAI and the natural mount were, respectively, of 22.2% e 55.5% (G1), 42.1% e 78.9% (G2) and 44.0% e 88.0% (G3). The G1 indexes were lower (P < 0.05) than the G2 e G3 indexes, and was not observed difference (P > 0.05) between G2 and G3. In EII, the pregnancy indexes of FTAI and the natural matting were, respectively, 50.06% and 86.87% (G1), 56.52% and 86.95% (G2), 52.0% e 88.0% (G3) and 31.57% and 73.68% (G4), being not observed difference between the FTAI and natural matting indexes. These results allow to advise the use of 200 U1 of eCG and the reuse of the P4 intra-vaginal device tip to four times in the FTAI protocols for Nelore cows.

AB  - The present study aimed to describe the floristic composition and the changes of diatom associations in the Itajai-Mirim River along its altitudinal gradient and with different land uses. The study was based on quarterly sampling of epilithon at six stations between 2004 and 2006. A total of 79 taxa, distributed in 24 families and 36 genera, were identified. The families with the highest species richness were Naviculaceae, Gomphonemataceae, Cymbellaceae, and Bacillariaceae. These families along with the Achnanthidiaceae had the greatest relative abundances. Changes in diatom associations along the altitudinal gradient of the Itajai-Mirim River were more evident in lowland areas, with anthropogenic activities such as sand extraction and discharge of domestic and industrial effluents. The important species, as provided by the Important Species Index, reflected the environmental conditions.

AB  - SALTINESS is the most restricting factor for agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions, addition to zinc is deposited in forms not accessible to plants in calcareous soils. During the 2018 and 2019 seasons, two field experiments were conducted at the Desert Research Center, Agriculture Experimental Station at Ras-Sudr, South Sinai Governorate, Egypt. The impact of seed priming by soaking seeds in ascorbic acid at 0, 100, 200, and 300mg ASC/L and the soil application of zinc at the rates of 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24kg zinc sulfate/ha (ZnSO4) on sunflower yields and its attributes were studied. The results reported that plant height, head diameter, number of seeds/head, seed weight/head, seed index, biological, seed and oil yields, and seed oil content responded considerably to ascorbic acid (ASC) in both seasons. In this connection, sunflower seeds soaked in 200mg ASC/L was the potency practice compared to other treatments in both years. ZnSO4 significantly affected all the aforementioned traits in both seasons. In this regard, adding 12kg ZnSO4 ha(-1) gave the highest values for all the studied parameters, except for plant height, which recorded the highest value of 143.2 and 131.2 cm at 24kg ZnSO4 ha(-1), respectively as compared to non-ZnSO4 application in both seasons. The outcomes of this study suggest that soaking sunflower seeds in 200mg/L ASC alongside ZnSO4 fertilization at a rate of 12kg/ha could be used to alleviate the harmful effects of salinity stress and increase the sunflower yields.

AB  - Aquaculture activities are often established in the vicinity of highly populated, potentially contaminated areas. Animals cultured at such locations, namely bivalves, are frequently used as test organisms in ecotoxicological testing. In this case, a period of depuration is required to allow the normalization of physiological processes, which are likely to be altered after exposure to a multiplicity of waterborne contaminants occurring in the wild. One of the most important species in modern marine aquaculture is the oyster species Crassostrea gigas. The aim of this study was to assess if the current depuration time frame of 24 h (adopted by most aquaculture facilities), is long enough to permit oysters to revert potential toxic effects exerted by environmental contaminants, allowing their use in laboratory-based ecotoxicological studies. The selected approach involved the monitoring of biochemical (antioxidant defence, oxidative damage, phase II metabolism, and neurological homeostasis) and physiological (condition index) parameters, along a period of 42 days. The obtained results showed that a period of 24 h does not revert any of the potential toxic effects caused by environmental contaminants to which animals may have been previously subjected; even a period of 42 days was not long enough for the oysters to completely normalize the levels of their antioxidant defences, namely total GPx activity, which increased over time. Lipid peroxidation was also increased during the depuration period, and the activity of the metabolic isoenzymes GSTs was significantly decreased. Furthermore, AChE activity measured in the adductor muscle of oysters was increased over time. These assumptions suggest that a period of depuration longer than 24 h is mandatory to obtain adequate test organisms of this oyster species, to be used for ecotoxicological testing purposes.

AB  - Food waste remains as one of the most serious environmental challenges facing the world today, with sizable quantities generated and disposed of in landfills. Accordingly, exploring solutions to mitigate the detrimental impacts of such waste becomes vital. Aquaculture, a rapidly growing industry in rural areas of developing nations, offers the potential of using this waste productively to partially replace commercial feed, which is often absent or expensive. The present study delves into new options of using plate food waste collected from local restaurants as fish feed supplementation. Food waste, collected and processed into pellets, was evaluated in an 8-week feeding trial of rabbitfish, Siganus rivulatus. Five feeding regimens were adopted in which commercial feed was substituted with waste-based feed at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of daily offering. Results suggest that up to 73.2% of the commercial feed can be substituted by waste-based feed with no significant effects on survival, growth rate, feed conversion ratio, or hepatosomatic and viscerosomatic indices of the fish. There were no statistical differences among treatments with 0, 25 and 50% replacement in terms of whole-body protein and lipid content or in hematological parameters. However, at 75% substitution, there was a clear decrease in growth, whereas at 100% replacement the fish showed complete mortality. Therefore, this study demonstrates a potential solution to mitigate food waste from landfills by utilizing it as a partial replacement of commercial fish feed. This in turn decreases the cost incurred in aquaculture production.

AB  - In the north Patagonian region of the Argentinean Continental Shelf, the San Jorge Gulf (SJG; 45 degrees-47 degrees S, 65 degrees 30MODIFIER LETTER PRIME-67 degrees 30MODIFIER LETTER PRIMEW) is the main nursery ground of age-0+ Argentine hakeMerluccius hubbsiMarini, 1933, one of the most important fishery resources in Argentina. The gulf exhibits strong seasonal and spatial fluctuations in environmental features, which might affect survival of age-0+ individuals and recruitment to the adult population. Our main goal was to evaluate the seasonal and spatial dynamics of their nutritional status within the SJG in winter 2016, spring 2016 and summer 2017. Condition indices (relative condition factorK(n), hepatosomatic index HSI and liver lipid content %L) and diet information (feeding incidence and relative importance of prey) were combined with physical (temperature and salinity) and biological (satellite chlorophyll-aconcentration; chl-a) data. Age-0+ condition indices and prey intake showed significant seasonal variations, with minimum values in winter, intermediate in summer and maximum in spring, strongly coupled to the mean chl-aconcentration in each season. Herbivorous euphausiidsEuphausiaspp. were the preferred prey along the study period. A bottom-up effect on condition of age-0+ hake is suggested, manifested as lower condition values in winter, the less productive season. Spatially, better conditioned individuals matched sectors of the gulf where chl-aconcentrations were higher, coupled to the presence of frontal systems. Monitoring age-0+ hake nutritional status is relevant in the current global change scenario, which might modify phytoplankton biomass and composition and, consequently, the herbivorous zooplankton abundances.

AB  - Objectives To understand patterns of subcutaneous (SC) biologics use over time in adults with inflammatory rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases receiving a homecare delivery service.
   Design Retrospective cohort.
   Setting Patients in secondary care receiving SC biologics in the largest Scottish Health Board.
   Participants A new bespoke cohort was created from routine data gathered as part of a health board Homecare Service Database. Patients over 18 years who received a supply of SC biologic from January 2012 to May 2015 with a diagnosis for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were included.
   Outcomes measured A standardised framework was applied by measuring discontinuation rates, persistence using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression and adherence using medication refill adherence (MRA) and compliance rate (CR).
   Results 751 patients were identified (AS: 105, PsA: 227, RA: 419) of whom 89.3% had more than one biologic delivery (median days' follow-up: AS: 494; PsA: 544; RA: 529) and 83.2% did not switch biologic. For all conditions, approximately half were persistent on their index biologic (52% AS, 54% PsA, 48%RA). Of patients who discontinued treatment, the majority reinitiated with the same biologic (19% AS, 18% PsA and 21% RA). Overall adherence during the period of treatment was over 80% when calculated using MRA (median %MRA: AS: 84.0%, PsA: 85.0%, RA: 82.4%) or CR (median %CR: AS: 96.6%, PsA: 97%, RA: 96.6%).
   Conclusion Use of linked routine data is a sustainable pathway to enable ongoing evaluation of biologics use. A more consistent approach to studying use (discontinuation, persistence and adherence metrics) should be adopted to enable comparability of studies.

AB  - Seasonal changes of sperm quality which can affect sperm biological parameters throughout the breeding period, have been little studied in mollusc species. Controlling gamete quality would aid the management of gametes in hatcheries and the development of selection programs. The aim of the present study was to describe the changes in sperm quality of wild Pacific oysters through the spawning season by comparing sperm parameters al the beginning (May), middle (July) and end (October) of this period using a panel of bio-descriptors. These parameters were studied over the 2014 breeding season based on shed sperm collected after serotonin injection of wild breeders. A significantly higher percentage of motile sperm was observed al the end of the spawning season (+78% relative to the value observed al the beginning) althought a lower total number of spermatozoa was collected (-59%). The mean condition index of oysters, however, was no different between the three sampling dates. For intratesticular sperm, the increase of the percentage of motile sperm and Velocity of the Average Path (VAP) in relation to time post activation was not significantly different among sperm sampling periods, suggesting that the kinetic of the sperm 'maturation process was similar. Furthermore, the mean VAP observed on shed sperm did not change through the spawning season. The sub-continuous gametogenesis of Pacific oyster can help to explain why only limited consequences of sperm ageing are observed in this species. Furthermore, the effects of sperm ageing may depend on the annual reproductive pattern of Pacific oyster. Statement of relevance: This study showed the effect of sperm ageing on sperm quality parameters. This knowledge is useful for aquaculture and would support the recent trends of mollusc farming, allowing a better management of the gametes in hatchery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this present study was to use the growth rates, RNA-DNA ratio and morphometric (Fulton's K) condition indices measured on 0-group juveniles European flounder, as a means of comparing the quality of estuarine nursery habitats. The Seine estuary, heavily impacted by manmade modifications and one of the most contaminated in Europe, was compared to two smaller estuaries considered as clean (low domestic, agricultural and industrial effluents). Indicators of human disturbance (sediment chemical contaminants) as well as biotic data (macrobenthos abundances) were used to establish between-site differences in environmental quality. The abundance of macrobenthos (potential preys for juvenile) was high and not significantly different among the three estuaries confirming the important role played by estuaries as feeding grounds. Sediment metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn) were significantly higher in the Seine than in the Canche and Authie estuaries. Otolith growth was closely related to somatic fish growth, and we used daily otolith increments from the previous 10 days before capture as an indicator of 0-group flounder recent growth (RG). RG did not vary significantly among flounders from the Canche and Authie estuaries and individuals from the Seine had slower RG. RNA-DNA ratio and K values were also significantly lower in individuals from the Seine compared to those of the Authie or the Canche. Pollution (e. g. metal contaminants) is the most likely cause of growth and condition differences among estuaries. The results of this study suggest that habitat-specific fish growth and condition are useful proxies for habitat quality since they integrate the effect of multiple environmental factors.

AB  - Indices of energy reserves may represent interesting parameters that can be used as bioindicators in environmental studies. The goal of this study was to identify a water-energy model that could predict energy reserves in winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus. Winter flounder kept in captivity and fed different food types (either capelin Mallotus villosus or Atlantic herring Clupea harengus, amphipods Anonyx sarsi, and wet pellets) for 2, 5, and 14 months and wild fish captured in May, July, and October were used to show a large range in energy content. High levels of correlation were observed between water and energy contents in fish carcasses (r(2) = 0.82) and muscle (r(2) = 0.75). However, the biochemical composition of the liver remained relatively constant, despite changes in the hepatosomatic index. The condition factor (somatic weight/length(3)) was associated with energy reserves (i.e., water contents) but the coefficients of determination were smaller (0.18 < r(2) < 0.34). We found that muscle water content, which can easily be determined, is an efficient way to accurately predict energy reserves in winter flounder.

AB  - Biological indicators of assessing surface waters depend on regionally based indices and sensitivity to environmental conditions. Periphytic algae often used as a potential biological assessment method for its environmental sensitivity characteristics. Here we studied the characteristics of the periphytic algae community and diatom species in the subtropical urban landscape lake known as West Lake, Hangzhou, China, which is in the process of ecological restoration. The changes in species composition, biomass and the community diversity of periphytic algae were determined. 71 taxa of 54 genera of periphytic algae were observed. The Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta dominated in the community. The Bacillariophytes exhibited the highest species richness, whereas the Cyanophytes showed the highest cell density. Principal component analysis environmental variables showed that the TN was main nutrient factor to periphytic algae in the West Lake. In terms of the relatively high TN contents characteristics in subtropical urban landscape lake West Lake, the ecological optimum values and tolerance values of TN about diatom were calculated by weighted regression method. Synedra capitata, Achnanthes minutissima, Gomphonema acuminatum, Navicula graciloides were extracted as indicator species for environmental gradients of TN in the West Lake. Those findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of diatoms biological index to improve the effectiveness of monitoring and evaluating the nutritional level of TN in urban landscape lakes system. It would be significant to identify the nutritional status of the subtropical shallow water bodies and advise related management.

AB  - Areas with controlled access, as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries (TURF), are conceived as tools to contribute to the ecosystem conservation and fisheries sustainability. Management and Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources (MEABR), a TURF system implemented in Chile, offers the opportunity to test this hypothesis. The management in these areas is based mainly on the assessment of the resources population status, with low or no consideration of the ecological - environmental effects that condition their productivity. In this study, we evaluate ecological trophic dynamics of the rocky subtidal community configuration in four periods along 20 years of the highly productive Choros Island MEABR - MPA, including one preimplementation period. In this TURF, the carnivore gastropod Concholepas concholepas (locally known as "loco") is the main targeted resource. The performance of ecosystem indexes of this TURF increased during the MEABR regime as compared with the pre MEABR implementation. Nevertheless, the most conspicuous increase occurred in 2013, primarily in response to changes in environmental conditions and their direct and indirect effects on community interactions. The analysis of interactions between guilds indicated that the main drivers were the interaction between the primary productivity, prey abundance and the top predator loco. This produces a longterm dynamic of the system modulated by the interplay of environmental variability, which at benthic community level increases prey populations thus sustaining increased loco productivity. In turn, intensified predation of loco reduces its prey. This produces natural productivity fluctuations, which counteract the expected outcome of management actions, impeding to achieve stable landings in the long term.

AB  - In Portugal, more than 150.000 ha of eucalypt plantations are managed in compliance with international certification systems. The objective of this work was to evaluate the biodiversity and the ecological quality of streams associated with certified eucalypt plantations, using different aquatic communities as biological quality indicators - fish, amphibians, and macroinvertebrates - and a morphological quality index (condition of river bed and banks). This study was carried out in two streams located in the central region of Portugal, the Foz stream (medium size and permanent flow regime) and the Rouxinois stream (small size and intermittent flow regime), surrounded by certified eucalyptus plantations and, consequently, presenting protected riparian buffer zones. The Foz stream revealed fish assemblages with a high species richness that, although dominated by an exotic taxon (Gobio lozanoi), included several endangered species. However, the amphibian fauna was not very abundant, probably due to the great diversity and density of fish and the strong presence of the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). A good morphological condition was also found for this stream, as well as a high diversity of the macroinvertebrate community, reflecting good water quality. In the Rouxinois stream the fish community was close to the potential for this river type and the amphibian fauna was diverse and abundant. However, a poor macroinvertebrate community was observed, most likely due to the lower habitat richness or the high water conductivity found there. The results showed that streams associated with certified eucalypt plantations can exhibit good ecological quality and a significant aquatic biodiversity.

AB  - Avian studies of endocrine disruption traditionally have focused on reproductive impairment, given that many environmental contaminants affect sex steroid hormones. There is also increasing interest in altered thyroid function, and associated early development, particularly in altricial species with extended developmental windows. Both types of effect are relevant under the complex pollutant conditions created in streams draining urban areas, but case studies are scarce. Therefore, the authors measured breeding performance, as well as nestling growth, condition, and plasma thyroid hormones, in 87 Eurasian dipper (Cinclus cinclus) nests on 36 urban and rural streams in south and mid-Wales (UK); invertebrate prey data were also collected. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether urban stream pollution or food scarcity might affect reproduction or development in this specialized aquatic songbird. Clutch sizes and egg fertility were similar on rural and urban streams, whereas nest success was actually higher at urban sites and food abundance was not significantly reduced. However, subtle but important differences were apparent. Urban nestlings were significantly lighter than rural nestlings for their body size (condition index), and brood sex ratios were increasingly male biased with increasing urbanization. The nestling thyroid hormone profile closely reflected urban land use, whereas depressed triiodothyronine (T3) hormones and poorer body condition were associated with higher exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) at urbanized sites. These data suggest that PCBs, PBDEs, and/or accompanying contaminants in urban streams could be affecting dipper nestling development, with potential consequences for the birds' fitness.

AB  - The effect of providing algal food to female Crassostrea gigas broodstock sampled at a favourable time of year was investigated using pre-defined indices of oocyte quality and Subsequent larval and post-larval performances. Broodstock were collected in the Aber Benoit estuary (Brittany, France) at the end of April 2002 and were divided into two groups, a starved control (S, 1 mu m - filtered seawater) and a fed group (F, ad libidum algal mixture of Isochrysis galbana clone T-Iso and Chaetoceros calcitrans), maintained Under these conditions for six weeks prior to fertilizations. For each conditioning type. two batches of larvae and post-larvae were reared from two identified females. Quality criteria were defined in terms of predictors (oocyte lipid contents, mature oocyte diameters, ovarian maturity and presence/absence of atresia) and validators (larval growth, algal consumption and time to settlement, and post-larval growth). Each female was considered as a treatment, and parametric and non-parametric ANOVAs were performed, where appropriate, on predictors and validators between each treatment. In both conditions, a surplus of oocytes was produced in relation to expected market conditions. No effect of the conditioning treatment was detected either on oocyte quality predictors or on subsequent validators. It is likely that winter reserve accumulation is more important than trophic conditioning for successful gametogenesis in the productive Aber Benoit environment. Given the considerable cost of abundant feeding during the conditioning, of broodstock collected at the end of winter and destined for gamete stripping (the prevalent practice in France), we suggest that feeding be minimal or Suppressed altogether when the condition index is favourable.

AB  - Two aviary sheds were used, the shed 1 (AECS) equipped with an adiabatic evaporative cooling system and the shed 2 (AECS + ESPB) equipped with an adiabatic evaporative cooling system together with an evaporative system of perforated bricks in the front and side of the shed. The temperature and the relative humidity of the air were assessed with automated devices (datalogger), together with the Environmental Thermal Index of Productivity for meat chicken (ETIPmc). Nine hundred and sixty male chickens from the Cobb strain were used, fed with isoproteic diets, except for the energy levels, which varied from 3,100 to 3,400 kcal. The use of the AECS was more efficient when associated to the ESPB. The AECS + ESPB provided a more comfortable and homogeneous environment, reflected on the productive parameters and favoring food conversion. Although the sheds exhibited moderately comfortable environments, according to the ETIPmc obtained, the AECS + ESPB showed a better balance of the environmental conditions between the sessions. The energy levels did not influence the variables analyzed, with the exception of the deposition of abdominal fat.

AB  - Yield data obtained from a comparative small grain cereals trial, grown for five consecutive growing seasons at a total of 23 environments in Cyprus, were subjected to regression analysis. Within each environment, yield trials consisted of a standard set of three cultivars or elite lines of barley, triticale, durum and bread wheat. The regression coefficient (b) of crop mean on the environmental index (1) and the mean square deviation from regression (sd2) were calculated for each crop. Each crop tended to have its own characteristic value of sd2 and its magnitude was an excellent indicator of specific crop-environment interaction. The causes of large sd2, for two of the four crops, were the susceptibility of barley to lodging, when favourable conditions were encountered at high yielding environments, and triticale dependence on late season precipitation. Durum wheat and triticale had an average response to different yielding environments (b = 1.19) and both were significantly different from those of bread wheat (1.08) and barley (0.54). Hence, barley, bread and durum wheat are specifically adapted to low, average and high yielding Mediterranean environments, respectively. The cultivation of triticale at the expence of durum wheat is not feasible. Furthermore, interactions between crops and environments demonstrated by the regression parameters, should constitute the basis for decision making, regarding crop adaptation in a region. The average yield in all environments should not be considered as a proper criterion for adaptation. In this study, triticale had a similar mean grain yield (3,842 kg/ha) to that of bread wheat, but was significantly higher yielding than barley or durum wheat (5 and 7%, respectively).

AB  - Soil nematodes are sensitive to environmental changes and are used widely as indicators of soil conditions. The community structure and diversity of soil nematodes were studied in different long-term land use regimes in the black soil area in Northeast China. The land use regimes were maintained for 22 years, and included crop land (CL), grass land (GL) and bare land (BL). Soil samples were taken throughout the growing season, and nematodes were extracted and identified. A total of 39 nematode genera with relative abundance over 0.1 % were identified. Heterodera was the dominant genus in CL; Boleodorus was the dominant genus in GL, and Boleodorus, Eucephalobus and Filenchus were the dominant genera in BL. Land use had a significant effect on abundance of all soil nematode tropic groups and ecological indices. Sampling time had an effect on soil nematode abundance, but only on three of the eight nematode ecological indices MI (maturity index of free-living nematode), CI (channel index) and EI (enrichment index). SR (species richness index) was highest in GL where plant species diversity was also high. The CI was the highest in BL among three land uses, which means the soil food web dominated, with fungal decomposition channels in BL. Soil nematode community structure and diversity was shown to be an effective and informative tool for analyzing ecological aspects of land use in black soil regions. The data are inconclusive as to whether the effect of land use on soil nematode parameters is direct, or indirect via inducing changes in soil physicochemical properties.

AB  - Ocean climate change strongly affects organisms and ecosystems, and the causes, consequences, and underlying mechanisms need to be documented. In the Baltic Sea, a marginal sea under severe eutrophication stress, a longer productive season, and changes in the phytoplankton community over the last few decades have likely impacted diet and condition of keystone species, from individual to population level. This study uses stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15, and derived isotope niche metrics) to trace energy and nutrient flows in archived samples of blue mussel (Mytilus edulis trossulus) spanning 24 yr (1993-2016). We test if long-term changes in isotope and elemental composition in mussels, as well as population abundance and biomass, can be explained by changes in abiotic and biotic variables, using partial least square regressions and structural equation modeling. We found decreasing trends in delta C-13 and delta N-15 as well as in mean size and total biomass of mussels, but no unidirectional changes in their stoichiometry or condition index. Changes in isotope composition were best explained by nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, by increased terrestrial organic carbon from land runoff (reflecting precipitation) and by decreases in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (indicative of successful eutrophication mitigation) and in biomass of a mixotrophic ciliate species. The trophic niche (assessed from isotope niche) was included as the best predictor for both mussel body condition and the observed decline in their total biomass. This study reveals that altered trophic relationships from climate-induced changes in the productivity base may strongly impact keystone species, with potential knock-on effects on ecosystem functions.

AB  - In this study 308 milk samples were collected and analyzed from 181 individual female New Zealand sea lions (NZ sea lions; Phocarctos hookeri) breeding on Enderby Island (Auckland Islands). Samples were collected from the 1st part of early lactation (January and February) over a period of 7 years (1997, 1999-2003, and 2005). The effect of year, month, and maternal characteristics (body mass, body condition index [BCI], and age class) on the composition of milk was evaluated using a mixed model for repeated measures. The gross composition (+/- SD) of the milk was lipid (21.3% +/- 8.1%), protein (9.4% +/- 2.4%), water (67.9% +/- 8.8%), ash (0.48% +/- 0.06%), and energy content (10.3 +/- 3.2 kJ/g). Overall, the quality of milk of the NZ sea lions in this study was relatively lower in solids and fats than that of other pinnipeds and, in particular, other sea lion species. There were significant effects of year and month on the concentration of lipids in milk, and of year and maternal age class on maternal body mass and BCI. There were significant relationships between various maternal characteristics and milk composition. Thus, the concentration of milk lipids was significantly correlated with maternal BCI, body mass, and pup age. Given that NZ sea lions are a nationally critical species in decline, the relationship between the temporal (yearly and monthly) variations in milk composition, maternal body mass, reproductive success, and changes in food supply in relation to natural perturbations or fisheries resource competition warrants further investigation to disentangle this relationship and implement appropriate management initiatives.

AB  - The article analyzes the methodological approaches to the development of agricultural enterprises taking into account an environmental component. The methodology for assessing the state of environmental orientation of agricultural production is justified. It has been found that when planning production volumes, the number of resources used, the level of technology, emissions, etc., an economic entity should predict the level of the government regulatory influence under a certain mode of motivational management. It has been proven that the methodological prerequisite for choosing a motivational management mode is to take into account an integral natural-territorial complex, the state of which depends on the intensity of business activity rather than any land plot of an economic entity that is owned or leased by an agricultural enterprise for agricultural production. The estimated cost of creating a purchasing center for biological agricultural products (investment costs) is calculated. A constructive way to solve the problem of assessing the intensity of the environmental situation of the territory under the conditions of economic management is the step-by-step comparison of volumes of environmental substances used and the potential for restoring these substances by an agricultural ecosystem. An organizational mechanism for marketing biological agricultural products as an incentive for the environmentally sound development of enterprises is proposed.

AB  - Thirty streams were surveyed in urban and natural settings in the municipality of Manaus in the central Amazon basin (Brazil) with the objective of identifying the species of adult odonates that can be used as bioindicators of environmental quality. The data collected were used to test the hypothesis that species in the suborder Zygoptera are indicators of better-preserved environments due to their smaller body sizes and reduced tolerances to habitat modification, whereas species in the suborder Anisoptera were presumed to be indicators of impacted habitats with no vegetation. The habitats were classified as preserved, intermediate, and degraded, based on their environmental characteristics. A total of 908 specimens were collected, representing 60 species. The results of the indicator value (IndVal) identified 13 species as indicators of environmental quality, of which nine were typical of preserved habitats, two of intermediate habitats, and four of modified habitats (intermediate or degraded). Odonate species richness declined with increasing urbanization, a pattern also presented by the zygopterans, although anisopteran species richness was higher in intermediate habitats. Zygopteran species showed high fidelity/specificity for preserved habitats, although a small number of the species of this suborder showed a similar relationship with intermediate or degraded habitats, whereas anisopterans were associated only with disturbed habitats (intermediate and degraded). Overall, the results indicate that the diagnosis of the adult odonate community can provide a rapid and effective tool for evaluation of environmental quality. As many species are stenotopic, they can be used as indicators of good habitat quality, whereas some of the more eurytopic species can indicate disturbed habitats. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The at-sea distribution of seabirds primarily depends on the distance from their breeding colony, and the abundance, distribution and predictability of their prey, which are subject to strong spatial and temporal variation. Many seabirds have developed flexible foraging strategies to deal with this variation, such as increasing their foraging effort or switching to more predictable, less energy dense, prey, in poor conditions. These responses may vary both within and between individuals, and understanding this variability is vital to predict the population-level impacts of spatially explicit environmental disturbances, such as offshore windfarms. We conducted a multi-year tracking study in order to investigate the inter-annual variation in the foraging behaviour and location of a population of northern gannets breeding on Alderney in the English Channel. To do so, we investigated the link between individual-level behaviour and population-level behaviour. We found that a sample of gannets tracked in 2015 had longer trip durations, travelled further from the colony and had larger core foraging areas and home range areas than gannets tracked in previous years. This inter-annual variation may be associated with oceanographic conditions indexed by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Our findings suggest that this inter-annual variation was driven by individuals visiting larger areas in all of their trips rather than individuals diversifying to visit more, distinct areas. These findings suggest that, for gannets at least, if prey becomes less abundant or more widely distributed, more individuals may be required to forage further from the colony, thus increasing their likelihood of encountering pressures from spatially explicit anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - A taxonomic checklist, biogeographic data and spatio-temporal distribution for fish larvae in Veracruz Reef System, Mexico are presented. Twenty six stations were monitored monthly in the SAV with 9 samplings in total, in the period June 2011-June 2013. Samples were obtained from diurnal horizontal surface tows with a conical net. Fish larvae spatio-temporal distribution and ecological index in this system are showed. Highest larvae fish abundance occurred in one month of rainy season and 2 months at the end of 'northerlies' season in nearby transects to the mouth of Jamapa River. 3941 organisms belonging to 61 taxa were obtained: 47 to level species and 14 to genus were identified. Atherinopsidae and Carangidae families showed the highest Specific Richness with 4 species each one. The highest larvae fish abundance belonged to Haemulidae family (Haemulon aurolineatum and H. plumierii) which contributes 47.62% to total abundance. With this contribution, the geographic distribution of larvae stage of fishes Apogon aurolineatus, Cantherhines macrocerus, Cheilopogon cyanopterus, Hemiramphus brasiliensis and Membras vagrans towards central and south of Gulf of Mexico and Mexican Sea Caribbean was expanded. New records support connectivity theories and dispersal patterns postulated by several authors between reefs of western coast Gulf of Mexico and Mexican Caribbean. Rainfall and end northerlies season act as natural mechanisms that propitiate accurate conditions for maintaining high larvae abundance. It was showed a substantial number of species in this sampling, however, we suggest alternative methods for record cryptic species, due to habitat complexity in this area.

AB  - Biogenic modifications of benthic environment by organism's activities like feeding, burrowing or excretion have in general negative implications for cohabiting sessile infauna, especially for suspension-feeders. However, the outcome of these interactions depends on several biological and physical characteristics and thus, it is not easily predictable in soft bottom environments. The stout razor clam Tagelus plebeius, an estuarine, infaunal and sessile filter feeder species, coexists in Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (Argentina, 37 degrees 32'S, 57 degrees 19'W) with the mud crab Cyrtograpsus angulatus, a very mobile benthic consumer. Due to the intense crab activity and consequent habitat transformation, we predicted negative effects on clams' filtration rate and their growth. However, an inclusion experiment showed that T. plebeius filtration rate was higher in enclosures when crabs were present responding to enhanced turbidity and chlorophyll a. Additionally, another experiment showed that mean condition index as well as mean shell growth increment of clams was not negatively affected by crabs, although maximum values of shell growth increments (mm) were smaller in crab inclusions. Our findings suggest that the clams can exploit the increased food availability (i.e., Chl a) generated by resuspension and are also not affected by the disturbance that crabs can make over sediment surface. In conclusion, contrary to the generalized outcome proposed for this kind of interaction, crabs do not have a negative effect on T. plebeius. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indices have been developed with invertebrates, fish, and water quality parameters to detect the impact of human disturbance on coastal wetlands, but a macrophyte index of fish habitat for the Great Lakes does not currently exist. Because wetland macrophytes are directly influenced by water quality, any impairment in wetland quality should be reflected by taxonomic composition of the aquatic plant community. We developed a wetland macrophyte index (WMI) with plant presence/absence data for 12 7 coastal wetlands (154 wetland-years) from all five Great Lakes, using results of a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to ordinate plant species along a water quality gradient (CCA axis 1). We validated the WMI with data collected before and after the implementation of remedial actions plans (RAPs) in Sturgeon Bay (Severn Sound) and Cootes Paradise Marsh. Consistent with predictions, WMI scores for Sturgeon Bay were significantly higher after the implementation of the RAP. Historical data from Cootes Paradise Marsh were used to track the declining condition of the plant community from the 1940s to 1990s. Subsequently, when remedial actions had been implemented in 1997, the calculated WMI scores showed improvement, but when the presence of exotic species (WMIadj) was accounted for, improvements in ecological integrity of the aquatic-plant community were no longer evident. We show how WMI scores can be used by environmental agencies to assess the historic, current, and future ecological status of wetland ecosystems in two Canadian national parks, Point Pelee National Park (PPNP) and Fathom Five National Marine Park (FFNMP).

AB  - Aquatic insects are widely distributed, and are especially diverse and abundant in tropical streams, where they play an important role in the food chain due to their diversity of feeding strategies, and the potential for the transfer of energy between aquatic and terrestrial environments. The intimate relationship found between these insects and environmental variables means that they are often used as bioindicatorss in environmental studies. We tested the hypothesis that the loss of environmental integrity in tropical streams will lead to a loss of species and a decline in the abundance of mayflies (Leptophlebiidae), in addition to a change in species composition, and the dynamics of population. Collect immature leptophlebiids in 18 streams representing different degrees of conservation, in the Brazilian Cerrado. The environmental integrity of the sites was assessed using a Habitat Integrity Index (HII), which generates values of zero (degraded) to one (preserved), based on soil use, the extension and conservation of riparian forest, as well as morphological features of the stream. A total of 4945 immature leptophlebiids were collected and identified as belonging to 16 species or morphospecies. On an average, a reduction of 0.1 in the value of the HII led to the loss of five specimens and one species. The composition of the communities varied systematically along the environmental gradient, with more sensitive species being found only when the index was above a threshold of 0.6. The importance of the riparian vegetation for the aquatic biota, especially its role in the mitigation of impacts from the surrounding matrix, supports the universal conservation of this type of habitat.

AB  - Direct estimates of extinction risk are frequently unavailable, so surrogate indicators are used in threatened species categorizations, but there is inadequate information on which best predict vulnerability. We compared the ability of 16 frequently-used factors to predict extinction risk for 45 vertebrate taxa. Median times to extinction were estimated using taxon-specific stochastic population models. Population size (N) and trend were clearly the best correlates of extinction risk in our data set. Stepwise multiple regression with additive and interaction terms identified N, N x trend, plus taxonomic level, number of sub-populations x N x trend, number of offspring (O) and N x O as predictors, and explained 70% of the variation. Trend was important in large, but not in small populations. Population size is the most important data to collect for threatened species and with trend should be the major focus in endangered species categorization and state of the environment reporting.

AB  - To secure the sustainable use of nature, governments track nature's health and develop regulations and policies. Although there is a seeming abundance in observation-recordings, decision- and policy-makers are constrained by the lack of data and indicators, mostly as a result of barriers preventing existing data from being found, accessed, made suitable for (automated) processing and reused, but also due to missing visualisations targeted at answering questions asked by policy makers. This paper explores the process and principles for developing a biodiversity web-platform that informs policy and management on the state and trends of nature, based on experiences with the Dutch Caribbean Biodiversity Database (DCBD). The DCBD supports the assessment of the state of nature and guarantees long-term data availability in an environment that experiences a high turnover in project funds and personnel. Three principles made DCBD's uptake and growth possible: The platform is funded, promoted and used by national and regional policy makers, it simplifies tasks of local management and rapporteurs, and it is continuously being adapted to changing needs and insights. Stronger dissemination of DCBD's narratives in social arenas (e.g. newspapers, social media) may make Caribbean nature and biodiversity more politically and societally relevant.

AB  - The maternal effects of the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae on offspring phenotypes and performance on wheat varieties with different resistance traits were examined. We found that both conditioning wheat varieties(the host plant for over 3 months) and transition wheat varieties affected the biological parameters of aphid offspring after they were transferred between wheat varieties with different resistance traits. The conditioning varieties affected weight gain, development time (DT), and the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), whereas transition varieties affected the fecundity, r(m), net reproductive rate, and fitness index. The conditioning and transition wheat varieties had significant interaction effects on the aphid offspring's DT, mean relative growth rate, and fecundity. Our results showed that there was obvious maternal effects on offspring when S. avenae transferred bwteen wheat varieties with different resistance level, and the resistance traits of wheat varieties could induce an interaction between the conditioning and transition wheat varieties to influence the growth, development, reproduction, and even population dynamics of S. avenae. The conditioning varieties affected life-history traits related to individual growth and development to a greater extent, whereas transition varieties affected fecundity and population parameters more.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical component in aquatic ecosystems, yet its seasonal variability and reactivity remain not well constrained. These were investigated at the land-ocean interface of a subtropical river (Minjiang River, SE China), using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The annual export flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the Minjiang River (5.48 x 10(10) g year(-1)) was highest among the rivers adjacent to the Taiwan Strait, with 72% occurring in spring and summer. The freshwater absorption coefficient a(280), DOC-specific UV absorbance SUVA(254) and humification index HIX were higher, while the spectral slope S275-295 and biological index BIX were lower in summer than in winter. This suggests intensified export of terrestrial aromatic and high molecular weight constituents in the rainy summer season. Six fluorescent components were identified from 428 samples, including humic-like C1-C3, tryptophan-like C4 and C6, and tyrosine-like C5. The freshwater levels of four components (C1, C2, C4, and C6) were lower while that of C5 was higher in the wet season than in the dry season, suggesting contrasting seasonal variations of different constituents. Laboratory experiments were performed to assess the effects of photochemical and microbial degradation on DOM. Photo-degradation removed chromophoric and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM) effectively, which was stronger (i) for high molecular weight/humic constituents and (ii) during summer under higher solar radiation. Microbial degradation under laboratory controlled conditions generally showed little effect on DOC, and had smaller impact on CDOM and FDOM in winter than in summer. Overall, this study showed notable seasonal changes in the chemical composition and reactivity of DOM at the land-ocean interface, and demonstrated the significant effects of photo-degradation.

AB  - The concept of inclusive development provides equal opportunities for all participants in access to the labor market and resource allocation. This concept emphasizes the equality of human capital, the ecological state of the environment, social protection and food security. This concept is fundamentally different from the standard perception of economic growth, because it has broader goals than simply increasing incomes and GDP. It rejects the position that positive results are an automatic consequence of growth; here the basic condition is human development and increase of its well-being, reduction of poverty. Therefore, it is not the result of distribution that becomes primary, but the involvement in the process of social reproduction. An alternative system of characterization of the country's position according to the resulting indicator of the Inclusive Development Index was presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The relevance of the study is that it provides an opportunity to compare the results of the calculation of the index of inclusive development with world counterparts. Most scientific works contain a justification for inclusive growth as a basis for socio-economic development of the country, without dwelling on the definition of its parameters for national realities in the regional aspect. Focus on the theoretical basis of the basics of methodological description of inclusive growth is found in different interpretations. In this research the methodical development of the system of estimation of the index of inclusive development for regions of the NUTS 4 level of the European classification is resulted. The theoretical and methodological basis of this work is the assessment of the index of inclusive development, proposed by the World Economic Forum. Logical and accessible in application methodological approach was proposed.

KW  - YIELD
AB  - Combining ability analysis was conducted on 12 parental genotypes and their 27 F(1) hybrids to identify superior genotypes based on morpho-physiological traits in Basmati rice following line x tester mating design. Highly significant genetic variability was present among treatments, parents, parents vs. crosses, crosses, testers and line x tester interaction for flag leaf area, panicle density, harvest index, biological yield per plant and yield per plant. However, lines were significant for all the traits except flag leaf area and yield per plant. Preponderance of non-additive gene effects was realized by higher value of specific combining ability comparing to general combining ability, ratio of variance of general combining ability to variance of specific combining ability and degree of dominance. Four parental genotypes for grain yield per plant, 5 for flag leaf area, 4 for plant height, 5 for panicle density, 4 for harvest index and 3 for biological yield per plant were found good general combiners based on significant high mean performance and GCA effects. Seven hybrids for yield per plant, 4 for flag leaf area, 7 for plant height, 7 for panicle density, 4 for harvest index and 3 for biological yield per plant excelled other hybrids in attaining high mean performance and SCA effects, hence these are recommended for heterosis breeding to improve yield and yield related traits. Based on SCA effects of the hybrids in relation to GCA effects of their parents, Kashmir Basmati x Basmati-385 is recommended for recombination breeding with early selection of desired plants whereas DM-107-4 x Basmati-385 and Super Basmati x Basmati-385 are proposed for recombination breeding with the condition of delayed selection of superior genotypes to develop potential varieties.

AB  - This paper introduces a new methodology for quantifying the total resilience of water resources management scenarios. The climate change impacts on water supply and demand have been investigated using a calibrated soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) and a MODSIM water allocation model. Several criteria have been defined to measure five aspects of water resources systems resilience. The first aspect defines resilience as system strength against crossing a performance threshold (reliability). In the second aspect, if the system crosses the performance threshold, the recovery rate of the system after a disturbance is evaluated. The violation from the performance threshold has been measured as the third aspect (vulnerability), which considers the failure's severity. The fourth aspect is the resilience under extreme events with unknown occurrence probability, which includes four sub criteria, namely rapidity, robustness, resourcefulness, and redundancy (4 R). Finally, the fifth criterion considers the ecological condition of the system (ecological index). To compare water resources management scenarios (alternatives), an analytical evidential reasoning-based (ER) approach has been used. To show the applicability of the proposed methodology, it has been applied to the Zarrinehrud river basin, which is the leading water supplier of Lake Urmia in Iran. As one of the largest saline lakes globally, this lake has been suffering from drastic desertification and salinization in the past two decades. The grade-based results of the performance criteria are synthesized into a grade-based total resilience criterion to facilitate the comparison of water resources management scenarios. It is shown that a scenario which results in 40% reduction in agricultural water demand until 2023 has the highest resilience and an acceptable construction and operational cost.

AB  - Animals frequently undergo periods when they accumulate lipid reserves for subsequent energetically expensive activities, such as migration or breeding. During such periods, daily lipid-reserve dynamics (DLD) of sentinel species can quantify how landscape modifications affect function, health, and resilience of ecosystems. Aythya affinis (Eyton 1838; lesser scaup; diving duck) are macroinvertebrate predators; they migrate through an agriculturally dominated landscape in spring where they select wetlands with the greatest food density to refuel and accumulate lipid reserves for subsequent reproduction. We index DLD by measuring plasma-lipid metabolites of female scaup (n = 459) that were refueling at 75 spring migration stopover areas distributed across the upper Midwest, USA. We also indexed DLD for females (n = 44) refueling on a riverine site (Pool 19) south of our upper Midwest study area. We found that mean DLD estimates were significantly (P < 0.05) less than zero in all ecophysiographic regions of the upper Midwest, and the greatest negative value was in the Iowa Prairie Pothole region (-31.6). Mean DLD was 16.8 at Pool 19 and was markedly greater than in any region of the upper Midwest. Our results indicate that females catabolized rather than stored lipid reserves throughout the upper Midwest. Moreover, levels of lipid catabolism are alarming, because scaup use the best quality wetlands available within a given stopover area. Accordingly, these results provide evidence of wetland ecosystem degradation across this large agricultural landscape and document affects that are carried-up through several trophic levels. Interestingly, storing of lipids by scaup at Pool 19 likely reflects similar ecosystem perturbations as observed in the upper Midwest because wetland drainage and agricultural runoff nutrifies the riverine habitat that scaup use at Pool 19. Finally, our results underscore how using this novel technique to monitor DLD, of a carefully selected sentinel species, can index ecosystem health at a landscape scale.

AB  - This study reports on the performance of 34 clones of crapemytle (Lagerstroemia indica L., L. fauriei Koehne, and L. indica X L.fauriei hybrids) grown in field plots at four locations representative of different environments in the southeastern United States. Traits evaluated were spring leaf-out and initiation of flowering in the second season after field planting and plant height after 3 years of growth. Cluster analysis (Ward's method) was used for grouping and comparison of means across locations for each trait. Best linear unbiased prediction was used for estimating random effects in linear and generalized linear mixed models to better determine the general performance of the clones under a variety of environmental conditions. Each clone's trait stability was quantified using the regression of an individual genotype's performance for each of the three studied traits on an environmental index based on the trait mean for all genotypes grown in an environment. Sequence of clone leaf-out and size rankings were more stable across the environments than the sequence in which the various clones initiated flowering. L. fauriei clones and clones originating from the initial cross between L. indica and L. fauriei were generally later to leaf out, earlier to flower, and more vigorous growers than L. indica or the complex L. indica x L.fauriei clones that were evaluated. First flowering, was affected by environmental variation more with interspecific hybrids than with L. fauriei and L. indica clones. Performance, particularly with respect to plant height, of several clones did not agree with previously published classifications. Information generated by this study,will allow crapemyrtle breeders, landscape professionals, and consumers to better select the most appropriate crapemyrtle clone for a particular application.

AB  - Aim: Theory suggests that as ecological systems approach regime shifts, they become increasingly slow in recovering from perturbations. This phenomenon, known as critical slowing down [CSD], leads to spatial and temporal signatures in ecological state variables, thus potentially offering early indicators of regime shifts. Indicators using temporal dynamics have been empirically validated in laboratory microcosms and other well-mixed systems, but tests of spatial indicators of regime shifts at large spatial scales in the field are rare due to the relative absence of high-resolution data and difficulties in experimental manipulations. Here, we test theoretical predictions of CSD-based spatial indicators using large-scale field data from the Serengeti-Mara grassland-woodland system.
   Location: Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, Tanzania and Kenya.
   Time period: Year 2000
   Major taxa studied: Vegetation
   Method: We used a space-for-time substitution method to empirically test the validity of CSD-based spatial indicators, i.e., we computed indicators along a spatial [in lieu of temporal] gradient of ecological states. First we used a model of vegetation dynamics to determine if our space-for-time substitution method was appropriate. Then we tested for CSD-based spatial indicators using high-resolution spatial vegetation [30 m] and rainfall [2.5 km] data from the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem.
   Results: Our model predicts that CSD-based indicators increase along a spatial gradient of alternative vegetation states. Empirical analyses suggest that grasslands and woodlands occur as alternative stable states in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem with rainfall as one of the potential drivers of transitions between these states. We found that four indices of CSD showed the theoretically expected increasing trends along spatial gradients of grasslands to woodlands: spatial variance, spatial skewness, spatial correlation at lag-1 and spatial spectra at low frequencies.
   Main conclusions: Our results suggest that CSD-based spatial indicators can offer early warning signals of critical transitions in large-scale ecosystems.

AB  - Species coexistence has been a fundamental issue to understand ecosystem functioning since the beginnings of ecology as a science. The search of a reliable and all-encompassing explanation for this issue has become a complex goal with several apparently opposing trends. On the other side, seemingly unconnected with species coexistence, an ecological state equation based on the inverse correlation between an indicator of dispersal that fits gamma distribution and species diversity has been recently developed. This article explores two factors, whose effects are inconspicuous in such an equation at the first sight, that are used to develop an alternative general theoretical background in order to provide a better understanding of species coexistence. Our main outcomes are: (i) the fit of dispersal and diversity values to gamma distribution is an important factor that promotes species coexistence mainly due to the right-skewed character of gamma distribution; (ii) the opposite correlation between species diversity and dispersal implies that any increase of diversity is equivalent to a route of "ecological cooling" whose maximum limit should be constrained by the influence of the third law of thermodynamics; this is in agreement with the well-known asymptotic trend of diversity values in space and time; (iii) there are plausible empirical and theoretical ways to apply physical principles to explain important ecological processes; (iv) the gap between theoretical and empirical ecology in those cases where species diversity is paradoxically high could be narrowed by a wave model of species coexistence based on the concurrency of local equilibrium states. In such a model, competitive exclusion has a limited but indispensable role in harmonious coexistence with functional redundancy. We analyze several literature references as well as ecological and evolutionary examples that support our approach, reinforcing the meaning equivalence between important physical and ecological principles.

AB  - The Upper Mississippi River is a dynamic floodplain river that has been largely transformed by navigational levees and dams since the 1930s. The pools upstream of each dam are lake-like and only about the upper third of each reach retains a riverine character. In contrast, the Wisconsin River is not managed for commercial navigation and today its lower 149 km represent one of the least-degraded large river reaches in central North America. Riverine reaches in both the Mississippi and Wisconsin rivers have similar macro-habitats including numerous islands, large side channels, and connected backwaters and floodplain lakes. In this study, shoreline electrofishing samples were collected during summer 2002 and 2003 to characterize resident fish assemblages. We compared fish species abundance, biomass, and biotic integrity along main and side channel borders between the Upper Mississippi River and the Lower Wisconsin River. We expected that, in the absence of environmental degradation, fish composition and structure would be similar between the Mississippi and Wisconsin rivers, and between channel types within each river. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and redundancy analysis revealed that fish species in the Mississippi River, unlike in the Wisconsin River, were characteristic of non-riverine habitats. We consider non-riverine fish assemblages indicative of environmental impairment. The main and side channel sites in the Mississippi River had more variable fish assemblages than the Wisconsin River. Analyses of fish index of biotic integrity scores showed that environmental condition was excellent for both channel types in the Wisconsin River, whereas in the Mississippi River the side channel was rated good and the main channel only fair. We conclude that differences between the two rivers and between channel types of the Mississippi River are consistent with direct and indirect effects of navigation. This study demonstrates the utility of a fish index of biotic integrity, an inexpensive and rapid bioassessment tool, for detecting change in ecological health on one of the world's largest rivers.

AB  - The development of general-purpose no-reference approaches to image quality assessment still lags recent advances in full-reference methods. Additionally, most no-reference or blind approaches are distortion-specific, meaning they assess only a specific type of distortion assumed present in the test image (such as blockiness, blur, or ringing). This limits their application domain. Other approaches rely on training a machine learning algorithm. These methods however, are only as effective as the features used to train their learning machines. Towards ameliorating this we introduce the BLIINDS index (BLind Image Integrity Notator using DCT Statistics) which is a no-reference approach to image quality assessment that does not assume a specific type of distortion of the image. It is based on predicting image quality based on observing the statistics of local discrete cosine transform coefficients, and it requires only minimal training. The method is shown to correlate highly with human perception of quality.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates from a small forest stream in central-south Chile were sampled monthly from September 2017 to August 2018 to assess temporal variability in the assemblage and the effects of that variability on ecological indicators. Higher precipitation and flows occurred in winter months, and water quality varied among months. We collected 59 macroinvertebrate taxa, finding higher taxa richness and abundances in summer months than in winter months. Four taxa demonstrated marked seasonality, being abundant in some months and then decreasing in following months (Limnoperla jaffueli (Navas), Nousia maculata (Demoulin), Smicridea sp. (McLachlan), Chironomidae spp.). The scores of the family Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), Hilsenhoff Species-level Biotic Index (HSBI), Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index (MMI), and Chilean Biological Monitoring Working Party (ChBMWP) index varied throughout the year reflecting natural variability. However, only HBI and HSBI scores were significantly different among seasons, ranging across three water quality classes (excellent, very good, and good), showing the lowest water classes in spring, coinciding with higher abundances of tolerant species. The MMI and ChBMWP indicated good and very good site conditions throughout the year, respectively. Shannon-Weaver diversity ranged between 2.59 (April) and 1.78 (February); however, Pielou evenness had high values throughout the year (> 0.62), except in February. Changes in macroinvertebrates composition throughout the year were explained primarily by discharge, water temperature, and conductivity. Our findings indicate that natural monthly variability in macroinvertebrate assemblages influences the scores of biological indices throughout the year. Therefore, we recommend that natural stream variability be accounted for in biomonitoring programs. We also emphasize the need to use caution when interpreting biological index scores to avoid misinterpretations in stream quality classification.

AB  - Transportation networks are severely affected by natural hazards, including landslides. The prioritization of maintenance works is required to preserve the efficiency and functionality of road infrastructure. To overcome the subjectivity of traditional visual inspections for road pavement condition assessment, advanced (semi-) automatic approaches have been emerging. Still, the quantitative and objective description of damage typology and extent, and its severity classification remain the major issues for the assessment of landslide impacts on transportation routes. The objective of this work is to provide a ready-to-use tool for semi-automatic damage assessment of asphalt-paved roads in landslide-affected areas to support risk analysis and planning of mitigation measures. The use of 3D models and 2D images as reconstructed from UAV-based photogrammetry is investigated to detect longitudinal and transverse cracks on the road pavement and assess their severity in landslide areas, as a rapid, systematic, objective and less laborious alternative to traditional field surveys. A semiautomatic procedure is proposed to i) select asphalt-paved roads exposed to landslides, ii) rapidly map distresses on selected road sections, iii) quantitatively detect and describe longitudinal and transverse cracks, and iv) classify their severity according to the International Roughness Index (IRI). The procedure is applied to the Province of Como (northern Italy), where three test sites are selected for detailed analyses. The results indicate that the proposed procedure is useful for road management purposes at different levels of details by providing four outputs: i) a road damage hotspot map to detect deformations, ii) a multi-criteria binary classifier to detect pavement damage, iii) an IRI-based criterion to rate the pavement quality, and iv) a road damage severity map.

AB  - In recent decades, drought has been identified as part of the several regular climate-related hazards happening in many African countries including South Africa, often with devastating implications on food security. Studies have shown that the earth temperature has increased over the recent years which can trigger drought occurrences and other climate-related hazards. Drought occurrence is principally a climate-related event that cannot be totally effaced though it can be managed. This study is aimed at appraising drought severity in Cape Town area, South Africa using Geographic Information System (GIS) and remotely sensed data obtained from United States Geological Survey (USGS) database between the years 2014 and 2018. The study revealed that the land use dynamics witnessed drastic changes where vegetation, water body and bare surface decreased from 2095 to 141 km(2), 616 to 167 km(2) and 2337 to 1381 km(2) respectively while built up and sparse vegetation increased from 5301 to 8191 km(2) and 7382-7854 km(2) during the period. Vegetation health and drought severity of the study area was assessed using vegetation indices and Normalized Drought Dryness Index (NDDI). The result reveals that Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and other vegetation indices decreased considerably more in recent years (2017 and 2018) which might have triggered drought events during the period compared to the other years (2014-2016). Furthermore, the spatial trend of land surface temperature (LST) and NDDI increased in recent years with NDDI values ranging between moderate drought and severe drought threshold. Consequently, if the increment persists, it can lead to adverse impacts such as food insecurity, land degradation and environmental health deterioration. Evidently, this study reveals the current state of vegetation health regarding drought severity in the area using remotely sensed data.

AB  - Salmonids belong to a high trophic level and are thus considered as strictly carnivorous species, metabolically adapted for high catabolism of proteins and low utilisation of dietary carbohydrates. However they conserved a "mammalian-type" nutritional regulation of glucokinase encoding gene and its enzymatic activity by dietary carbohydrates which remains puzzling regarding their dietary regime. The present study investigates the hypothesis that this conservation could be linked to a real consumption by trout of this nutrient in their natural habitat. To do so, brown trout were sampled in the sub-Antarctic Kerguelen Islands, a site presenting oligotrophic hydrosystems and no local freshwater fish fauna prior the introduction of salmonids fifty years ago. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of carbohydrate content within Kerguelen trout stomachs demonstrate that these animals are fed on food resources containing digestible carbohydrates. Additionally, glycaemia and more particularly gck mRNA level and gck enzymatic activity prove that Kerguelen trout digest and metabolise dietary carbohydrates. Physiological and molecular analyses performed in the present study thus strongly evidence for consumption of dietary carbohydrates by wild trout in natural environments. Investigating differences between Kerguelen individuals, we found that smaller individuals presented higher glycaemia, as well as higher carbohydrates contents in stomach. However no relationship between scaled mass index and any physiological indicator was found. Thus it appears that Kerguelen trout do not turn to carbohydrate diet because of a different condition index, or that the consumption of carbohydrates does not lead to a generally degraded physiological status. As a conclusion, our findings may explain the evolutionary conservation of a "mammalian-type" nutritional regulation of gck by dietary carbohydrates in these carnivorous fish. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In 2021, the Biden administration signed an executive order to protect 30% of American lands by 2030. Accomplishing this ambitious goal in the U.S. requires understanding the relative contribution of public and private lands toward supporting biodiversity. New approaches are needed because existing approaches focus on quantity of habitat without incorporating quality. To fill this need, we developed a 30 m resolution national habitat condition index (HCI) that integrates quality and quantity measures of habitat. We hypothesized that including an evaluation of the quality of habitat at landscape scales, both in conservation-focused preserves and working lands would provide a better assessment of the value of geographies for conservation. We divided the conterminous U.S. by major land cover type and into natural and cultivated lands and then spatially mapped multiple anthropogenic stressors, proximity to aquatic habitat, and vegetation departure from expected natural disturbance regimes. Each map layer was then scored for site impact and distance decay and combined into a final national index. Field observations providing scored relative ecological conditions were used for HCI calibration and validation at both CONUS and regional scales. Finally, we evaluate lands by management (conservation versus working lands) and ownership (public versus private) testing the value of these lands for conservation. While we found regional differences across CONUS, functional habitat was largely independent of protection status: working lands provide clear habitat and other values. These results are relevant for guiding strategies to achieve the U.S. 30 by 30 goals. Where similar data exist in other countries, analogous modeling could be used to meet their national conservation commitments.

AB  - Offshore wind-wave resistant mechanized platform is a new mode of abalone farming in China compared to the traditional raft-based system. A series of on-site experiments was conducted to identify the optimal cultivation conditions for this new model. The effects of different stocking densities and diets on the survival rate and growth rate were examined. Abalones were placed in four stocking densities (20, 30, 40, and 50% coverage of available surface area of the culture cage) in this platform, and a control group with one density was set in the traditional aquaculture system. In addition, the effects of different diets (formulated diet, dried Laminaria japonica, and fresh Gracilaria lemaneiformis) for abalone were also studied. Over 240 days, reductions of the survival rate and growth rate of shell length and body weight were observed with the increase of the stocking density. Although the abalone were fed adequate food, the growth rate was limited by the stocking density. Condition index increased with the culture time but decreased with the increase of the stocking density. The growth rates of the shell length and body weight in the formulated diet group were significantly higher than the other two diets. The results also indicated that the medium and large-sized abalone may be more suitable for the new platform, as the medium and large-sized abalone had a higher growth rate when culturing on the mechanized platform, whereas small abalone grew faster on the traditional model. The results from this study can provide fundamental data supporting the offshore mechanized farming of abalone, which will not only promote the yield and reduce the stress of coastal aquaculture environments, but also will contribute to the transformation and upgrading of the abalone farming industry.

AB  - The Floreana Mockingbird (Mimus trifasciatus) is one of the rarest bird species in the world, with an estimated 550 individuals remaining on two rocky islets off the coast of Floreana, Galapagos, Ecuador, from which the main population was extirpated more than 100 yr ago. Because they have been listed in critical danger of extinction, a plan to reintroduce this species to Floreana has been initiated. Determining the health status of the source mockingbird populations is a top priority within the reintroduction plan. We report the health status, over the course of 4 yr, of 75 Floreana Mockingbirds on Champion Island and 160 Floreana Mockingbirds on Gardner-by-Floreana, based on physical examinations, hematology, hemolysis hemagglutination assay, exposure to selected infectious disease agents, and ecto- and endoparasite counts. Birds on Gardner-by-Floreana had higher body condition index scores, packed cell volumes, total solids, and lymphocyte counts. Additionally, Gardner-by-Floreana birds had lower heterophil counts, eosinophil counts, and heterophil:lymphocyte ratios. No Chlamydophila psittaci DNA or antibodies to paramyxovirus-I, adenovirus-II, or Mycoplasma gallisepticum were found in any of the mockingbirds tested. Ectoparasites were present on birds from both islands, although species varied between islands. A coccidian species was found in eight of the 45 fecal samples from birds on Gardner-by-Floreana, but none of 33 birds examined from Champion. Birds on Gardner-by-Floreana were classified as healthier than those on Champion based on clinical and laboratory findings. These health data will be analyzed in conjunction with genetics, population structure, and disease presence on Floreana for developing recommendations for the Floreana Mockingbird reintroduction plan.

AB  - When prey alter behavioral or morphological traits to reduce predation risk, they often incur fitness costs through reduced growth and reproduction as well as increased mortality that are known as nonconsumptive effects (NCEs). Environmental context and trophic structure can individually alter the strength of NCEs, yet the interactive influence of these contexts in natural settings is less understood. At six sites across 1000 km of the Southeastern Atlantic Bight (SAB), we constructed oyster reefs with one, two, or three trophic levels and evaluated the traits of focal juvenile oysters exposed to predation risk cues. We monitored environmental variables (water flow velocity, microalgal resources, and oyster larval recruitment) that may have altered how oysters respond to risk, and we also assessed the cost of trait changes to oyster mortality and growth when they were protected from direct predatory loss. Regardless of trophic structure, we found that oyster shell strength and natural oyster recruitment peaked at the center of the region. This high recruitment negated the potential for NCEs by smothering and killing the focal oysters. Also independent of trophic structure, focal oysters grew the most at the northernmost site. In contrast to, and perhaps because of, these strong environmental effects, the oyster traits of condition index and larval recruitment were only suppressed by the trophic treatment with a full complement of risk cues from intermediate and top predators at just the southernmost site. But at this same site, statistically significant NCEs on oyster growth and mortality were not detected. More strikingly, our study demonstrated environmental gradients that differentially influence oysters throughout the SAB. In particular, the results of our trophic manipulation experiment across these gradients suggest that in the absence of predation, environmental differences among sites may overwhelm the influence of NCEs on prey traits and population dynamics.

AB  - Aquatic resource monitoring attempts to assess the condition of aquatic habitat and organisms. Assessments require that disturbances from human activities be identified, quantified and ordered along a gradient for interpreting biological response. An index of relative risk to aquatic systems was developed based on identifying and prioritizing stream-reach and watershed stressors. Mail surveys were sent to natural resource experts (county extension agents, NRCS employees) familiar with the targeted watersheds, to collect data for assessment of 25 watersheds in the Mid-Appalachian region of the United States. A 56% correspondence was found between this method and another approach when scoring identical sites. Scoring differences resulted from discrepancies in available data between the two methods. Scores were consistent with water chemistry and benthic macroinvertebrate measures of stream condition and required less time to develop for ranking watersheds than the second method. The mail survey approach is readily transferable to other regions.

AB  - We screened 351 species or genera for their response to disturbance in coastal sage scrub (CSS) to develop a 15-metric, 5-taxon Index of Biological Integrity (IBI). We collected data on ants, birds, herpetofauna, small mammals, and plants for two years on 46 sites established across a gradient of disturbance in three reserves. The gradient spanned relatively intact CSS with thick stands of shrubs, to former CSS stands type-converted to exotic grasses. ANOVAs and clustering analyses indicated the IBI could distinguish four levels of disturbance in CSS. General measures of community structure, such as richness, did not show changes across the gradient for most taxa, and responses of taxa across the gradient were varied and rarely correlated. However, turnover in species or genera across the gradient was common across all taxa as shrub-obligate life forms were replaced by those favoring grassy or disturbed habitats. Our data indicate index-based approaches based on data collected across disturbance gradients may outperform more traditional community level metrics when responses to anthropogenic influences are complex and vary across species.

AB  - Most studies of female choice have assumed that mating preferences are shared within a population or species. However, variation both within and among females exists in natural populations, and foraging history is among the many ways in which females may vary. Here, we used diet manipulations in an effort to understand how foraging history influences female mate choice. Immature Schizocosa wolf spiders collected from a mixed population of brush-legged and non-ornamented males were reared in the laboratory on two diets that varied in both quality and quantity (low/high diet). For low-and high-diet individuals, we recorded data on rates of development, adult size and adult mate choice. Consistent with previous work, we found that high-diet spiders matured more quickly and were significantly larger as adults than low-diet spiders. Males also matured earlier than females. Body condition varied with diet treatment and sex. High-diet individuals and females were both characterized by better body condition indexes. In addition, high-diet brush-legged males had larger brushes than low-diet brush-legged males. Upon maturation, females were paired simultaneously with a low-and a high-diet male of the same form (brush-legged or non-ornamented) in a mate choice trial. While no obvious differences were observed in courtship and/or mating effort between males, female mate choice varied with the female's diet treatment. High-diet females mated more frequently with high-diet males than with low-diet males, whereas low-diet females showed no selectivity. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - We examined physical and biological indices from Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. surveys and commercial fisheries to index nearshore rearing habitats used by age-0 and age-1 Sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria in the eastern Gulf of Alaska and as indicators for their recruitment to age2 during the period 2001-2013. The best-fitting general linear model used to estimate age-2 Sablefish recruitment included chlorophyll-a concentration during late August and an index of juvenile Pink Salmon O. gorbuscha abundance during the age-0 stage of Sablefish. The model and biophysical indices from 2012 and 2013 produced a forecast of 23 million age-2 Sablefish for 2014 and a forecast of 8 million Sablefish for 2015. This study highlights the opportunity to use proxies for direct ambient physical and biological observations of rearing habitats in estimating groundfish recruitment to older ages.

AB  - In the present study, the effects of sex, age, nutritional status, and habitat use on hair and internal tissue concentrations of some trace metals (Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb and Cd) in brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) from Aran-O-Bidgol City in Central Iran were investigated. Five sampling stations in different land-uses were selected for the study. Concentrations of Cd and Pb in liver and whole body concentration as well as concentration of Zn in hair of male rats were significantly higher than females. A significantly higher concentration was only observed for Pb in kidney of male gerbils than females. In numerous cases, age had significantly negative correlations with concentration of metals in different tissues of both species, and was only significantly (and positively) correlated with the concentration of Cd in kidney and Zn in liver of gerbils. This finding may indicate that the early neonatal age is a critical period for metals accumulation. The relationships between nutritional status and metal concentrations for both species were negative, which can be ascribed to the weight-specific metabolic rate that cause to a relatively low uptake of metals per unit of body weight. No significant differences were observed for soil metals concentrations in different sites. So, this suggests that the influence of life history, microhabitat use and foraging behavior did significantly influence on inter and intra specific variation of metals concentration in small mammals. Our observations suggest that hair cannot be used alone for monitoring exposure of metals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aquatic organisms that produce epibenthic structures such as saltmarsh plants play key roles in habitat functioning through their ecosystem engineering effects. Intertidal Spartina species are well known for modifying tidal hydrodynamic and sediment processes, affecting cohabiting infaunal organisms. The stout razor clam Tagelus plebeius is an infaunal filter-feeding species that inhabits a broad range of mudflats (MF) and Spartina saltmarshes (SM) along the American Atlantic coast. Through descriptive and experimental approaches conducted at the Bahia Blanca estuary (Argentina, 38 degrees 47'S, 62 degrees 20'W), we evaluated ecosystem engineer effects of Spartina alterniflora (due to changes in sediment and water characteristics) on somatic and shell growth of T. plebeius. Comparison of bulk sediment parameters indicated that the sediment is more easily eroded in the SM than in the MF, but softer in the latest. In addition, food supply for clams (i.e., total particulate organic matter) was higher in the MF although food quality (i.e., percentage of organic matter in the water column) was in general higher in SM. Shell growth was higher but clam condition index (CI) was lower in the MF, and the opposite pattern was found in the SM. These results represent an uncoupling between shell and somatic growth with a positive effect of S. alterniflora on the Cl of clams. Nevertheless, results of field experiments manipulating stems and roots of plants separately suggested that the effect of Spartina on clam's Cl was not due to the structural changes generated by plant presence itself, although a better food quality in the SM may be related to the larger clam.

TI  - Behavioral Ecology of Color Patterns in Atka Mackerel
T2  - MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES
LA  - English
AB  - The behavioral ecology of seasonal and ephemeral variations in color patterns of Atka mackerel Pleurogrammus monopterygius was investigated and is discussed relative to alternative mating tactics, reproductive condition, social status, and predation risk. Breeding males underwent a conspicuous seasonal color change during the mating and brooding period, resulting in one of two nuptial phenotypes. Type I males held and defended territories inside nesting colonies and had a uniform yellow coloration with a golden hue across the head and dorsum. Type II males were nonterritorial, hovered above the nesting colony, and attempted periodic forays into the nesting colony; their color was plain yellow with irregular dark blotches across the head and dorsum and a light patch on the nape. When displaced from their nests, type I males also showed dark blotches and a light patch on the nape, but these characteristics were less pronounced than those in type II males. The color of females and nonbreeding males was indistinguishable and exhibited little seasonal variation; however, females close to spawning showed an ephemeral darkening of the body with white spots and patches along the dorsum. Nonbreeding males and females undergoing diel migrations also showed the same pattern across the dorsum but without darkening. The overall mean ratio of males to females in the trawl-sampled population was 1.22:1.00, of which 44.9% were females, 40% were nonbreeding males, 9.8% were intermediate males (with characteristics intermediate between those of breeding and nonbreeding males), and 5.3% were breeding males. The proportion of breeding males was 12 times higher inside nesting colonies than outside the colonies. The mean fork length (FL) of intermediate and breeding males was larger (by <= 1 cm) than that of females or nonbreeding males. Understanding the behavioral ecology of Atka mackerel is important to the development of a comprehensive ecological index for monitoring and assessing the reproductive health of Atka mackerel stocks.

AB  - In November 2002 the tanker 'Prestige' sunk in front of the Galician coast (NW Iberian Peninsula). As a result, > 60000 t of heavy fuel oil leaked into the sea, affecting > 1000 km of coastline. In order to assess the effects of the oil spill on coastal ecosystems, mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis were sampled (April, July and September 2003) in 17 locations along the Galician and Bay of Biscay coasts. In this study, 3 biomarkers were assessed: lysosomal responses as changes in the lysosomal structure and in the lysosomal membrane stability, accumulation of intracellular neutral lipids and peroxisome proliferation as induction of acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) activity. Mussel flesh condition index and gonad developmental stages were assessed as supporting parameters. Lysosomal membrane stability was reduced in mussels from all locations, indicating disturbed health, especially in mussels from all Galician locations. Similarly, lysosomal enlargement was observed in most locations, as shown by relatively low values of the surface-to-volume ratio, although the volume density of lysosomes was low due to decreased lysosomal numbers. Overall, intracellular accumulation of neutral lipids was conspicuous in digestive tubules of mussels collected in July and was increased further in September. AOX induction was detectable in mussels sampled in April, except for those collected in Galicia. In July mussels from the most impacted stations in Galicia, Caldebarcos and Camelle, showed the highest AOX values. In conclusion, the biomarkers employed detected exposure to toxic chemicals and a disturbed status of health in mussels from the northern Iberian Peninsula after the 'Prestige' oil spill and will allow assessment of the long-term effects of the spill on the coastal ecosystems.

AB  - The extraction of coal and coal seamgas (CSG) will generate produced water that, if not adequately treated, will pollute surface and groundwater systems. InAustralia, the discharge of produced water from coal mining and related activities is regulated by the state environment agency through a pollution licence. This licence sets the discharge limits for a range of analytes to protect the environment into which the producedwater is discharged. This study reports on the impact of produced water from coal mine activities located within or discharging into high conservation environments, such as National Parks, in the outer region of Sydney, Australia. The water samples upstream and downstream from the discharge points from six mines were taken, and 110 parameters were tested. The results were assessed against a water quality index (WQI) which accounts for pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, total phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen and E. coli. The water quality assessment based on the trace metal contents against various national maximum admissible concentration (MAC) and their corresponding environmental impacts was also included in the study which also established a base value of water quality for further study. The study revealed that impacted water downstream of the mine discharge points contained higher metal content than the upstream reference locations. In many cases, the downstream water was above the Australia and New Zealand Environment Conservation Council and international water quality guidelines for freshwater stream. The major outliers to the guidelines were aluminium (Al), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn). The WQI of surface water at and downstream of the discharge point was lower when compared to upstream or reference conditions in the majority of cases. Toxicology indices of metals present in industrial discharges were used as an additional tool to assess water quality, and the newly proposed environmental water quality index (EWQI) lead to better trend in the impact of coal and coal seam gas mining activities on surface water quality when compared to the upstream reference water samples. Metal content limits were based on the impact points assigned by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, USA. For environmental and health impact assessment, the approach used in this study can be applied as a model to provide a basis to assess the anthropogenic contribution from the industrial and mining activities on the environment.

AB  - Most matured landfill leachate contains organic recalcitrant molecules that cannot be easily separated by biological processes alone. Integrating an advanced oxidation process (AOP) and a biological process would be a better option for treating matured landfill leachate. Among the different AOPs, the Electro-Fenton (EF) process is the most promising technology as it is economical, effective, and environmentally friendly in processing organic waste material. Better effluent quality and a lower footprint are the significant merits of membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology, making it an attractive choice for wastewater treatment. In this study, the EF process is integrated with a MBR for treating matured landfill leachate. In EF treatment, the effect of independent variables such as pH, current density, H2O2 dosage, and reaction time on the biodegradability index [biological oxygen demand (BOD)/chemical oxygen demand (COD)] was determined using response surface methodology (RSM). Under optimum conditions (pH 2.85, current density 129.5 A/m(2), H2O2 dosage 55.75%, reaction time 40 min), the biodegradability index of the matured landfill leachate increased from 0.21 to 0.45. The EF-MBR integrated system gave a total reduction in total suspended solids, BOD, COD, ammonia nitrogen, phosphate, sulfate, sulfide, and chloride of 94.2%, 90.62%, 94.55%, 84.66%, 100%, 83.19%, 85.07%, and 83.37% respectively. The economic analysis revealed that the total cost of an EF-MBR integrated treatment is $0.488/kg of COD digested and $10.68/m(3) of matured landfill leachate treated. The study reveals the possibility of enhancing BOD/COD by EF and reducing the amount of pollutants considerably through an EF-MBR integrated process to guarantee environmental protection.

AB  - Understanding metal and proton toxicity under field conditions requires consideration of the complex nature of chemicals in mixtures. Here, we demonstrate a novel method that relates streamwater concentrations of cationic metallic species and protons to a field ecological index of biodiversity. The model WHAM-F-TOX postulates that cation binding sites of aquatic macroinvertebrates can be represented by the functional groups of natural organic matter (humic acid), as described by the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM6), and supporting field evidence is presented. We define a toxicity function (F-TOX) by summing the products: (amount of invertebrate-bound cation) x (cation-specific toxicity coefficient, alpha(i)). Species richness data for Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), are then described with a lower threshold of F-TOX, below which all organisms are present and toxic effects are absent, and an upper threshold above which organisms are absent. Between the thresholds the number of species declines linearly with F-TOX. We parameterised the model with chemistry and EPT data for low-order streamwaters affected by acid deposition and/or abandoned mines, representing a total of 412 sites across three continents. The fitting made use of quantile regression, to take into account reduced species richness caused by (unknown) factors other than cation toxicity. Parameters were derived for the four most common or abundant cations, with values of alpha(i) following the sequence (increasing toxicity) H+ < Al < Zn < Cu. For waters affected mainly by H+ and Al, F-TOX shows a steady decline with increasing pH, crossing the lower threshold near to pH 7. Competition effects among cations mean that toxicity due to Cu and Zn is rare at lower pH values, and occurs mostly between pH 6 and 8. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, most indicator initiatives throughout the world have been aimed at state-of-the-environment reporting, with relatively few aimed at developing sectoral indicators. This paper provides the results of a review to establish trends in the development of indicators that assist in integrated water resource management. Twenty-one organisations from around the world were approached with regard to whether they had developed indicators of sustainable development for catchment management. Of these, only five organisations had developed, or were in the process of developing, indicator sets that were available for review. These included the Fraser Basin Council (Canada), the Murray-Darling Basin Commission (Australia), the Tennessee Valley Authority (USA), the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the World Resources Institute. All of these indicator sets were developed using an issues-based approach. Each indicator set was unique, reflecting the policy, both national and organisational, upon which it had been based. An analysis of these five indicator sets revealed that the most important themes that required information for water resource management at a catchment level, were biodiversity and ecosystem integrity, land-use change, water quality, waste production, water availability and resource use. Common indicators included population growth; community involvement; water availability; water use; water quality trends; soil contamination; non-compliance; species at risk; key species assessment; change in vegetation; agricultural impact; access to recreational opportunities, and ecosystem health. The identification of these themes and common indicators will be useful for the development of indicators for catchment management in South Africa. More importantly, policy frameworks and the physical characteristics of catchment systems in the country need to be taken into account. Additionally, it is recognised that no effective indicator set can be developed without the input of stakeholders.

AB  - The Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment (MAIA-Estuaries) evaluated ecological conditions in US Mid-Atlantic estuaries during the summers of 1997 and 1998. Over 800 probability-based stations were monitored in four main estuarine systems-Chesapeake Bay, the Delaware Estuary, Maryland and Virginian coastal bays, and the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System. Twelve smaller estuaries within the four main systems were also assessed to establish variance at the local scale. A subset of the MAIA-Estuaries data is used here to estimate the extent of eutrophication, sediment contamination, and benthic degradation in mid-Atlantic estuaries. An Environmental Report Card and Index of Environmental Integrity summarize conditions in individual estuaries, the four estuarine systems, and the entire MAIA region. Roughly 20-50% of the region showed signs of eutrophication (high nutrients, excessive production of organic matter, poor water clarity, or depleted dissolved oxygen), 30% had contaminated sediments, and 37% had degraded benthic communities. Compared with the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP)-Virginian Province study in 1990-1993, larger fractions of Chesapeake Bay (17%) and Delaware River (32%) had increased metals or organics in sediments.

AB  - The subcellular effects of pollution were evaluated using two lysosomal biomarkers in mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, deployed periodically over a period of 5 years in a harbour area in the Bay of Muggia (Gulf of Trieste, North Adriatic Sea) that is strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities. Mussels were collected from a clean marine farm and analysed (sample TO). A sub-sample was transplanted to the harbour site (sample M) and analysed after about 12 weeks. An additional sub-sample was relocated within the farm as a control and was also tested at the end of the 12-week period (sample T1). The transplantation procedures were repeated twice yearly for 5 consecutive years, starting in 2009. Two well-established lysosomal biomarkers, i.e. lysosomal membrane stability and lipofuscin accumulation, were evaluated in hepatopancreas cells. The body condition index and mortality rate were also assessed. Moreover, various pollutants were determined in both mussel flesh, for a better comprehension of the biological response, and sediments, for a general characterization of the study area. As a whole, the applied biomarkers were found to be appropriate for determining the responses of mussels to environmental pollutant loads over time. Variations in lysosomal membrane stability and lipofuscin content were mostly related to total PAHs and metals respectively. Our results confirm the usefulness of active biomonitoring in evaluating pollution trends in marine coastal areas and in particular the value of lysosomal biomarkers as a rapid screening tool for highlighting pollutant effects at least at organism level.

AB  - Freshwater fishes utilising seasonally available habitats within annual migratory circuits time movements out of such habitats with changing hydrology, although individual attributes of fish may also mediate the behavioural response to environmental conditions. We tagged juvenile Arctic grayling in a seasonally flowing stream on the Arctic Coastal Plain in Alaska and recorded migration timing towards overwintering habitat. We examined the relationship between individual migration date, and fork length (FL) and body condition index (BCI) for fish tagged in June, July and August in three separate models. Larger fish migrated earlier; however, only the August model suggested a significant relationship with BCI. In this model, 42% of variability in migration timing was explained by FL and BCI, and fish in better condition were predicted to migrate earlier than those in poor condition. Here, the majority (33%) of variability was captured by FL with an additional 9% attributable to BCI. We also noted strong seasonal trends in BCI reflecting overwinter mass loss and subsequent growth within the study area. These results are interpreted in the context of size and energetic state-specific risks of overwinter starvation and mortality (which can be very high in the Arctic), which may influence individuals at greater risk to extend summer foraging in a risky, yet prey rich, habitat. Our research provides further evidence that heterogeneity among individuals within a population can influence migratory behaviour and identifies potential risks to late season migrants in Arctic beaded stream habitats influenced by climate change and petroleum development.

AB  - The Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita) is one of the world's most threatened species of birds. The number of individuals in captivity is several times greater than the number of individuals in the wild, so that the re-introduction of individuals from captive breeding into their natural habitat may be vital for the recovery of the species. A knowledge of the health problems associated with the handling of captive individuals and the improvement of their veterinary care could have great importance in determining the success of these captive breeding programs. Haematology and blood chemistry are very useful complementary tools in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in birds, and provide valuable information about the individual's nutritional status and physical condition. The present work reports haematocrit and blood chemistry values for individuals belonging to a captive population of this species, and analyses their variability with respect to age, sex, and physical condition of the animals. Adults presented greater values of haematocrit, uric acid, total proteins, cholesterol, and aspartate amine transferase than the young. With respect to sex differences, adult female birds had higher concentrations of alkaline phosphatase than males, contrary to previous results for captive individuals of this species. The condition index of adults was positively correlated with triglycerides, glucose, and alkaline phosphatase levels, and negatively with urea and lactate dehydrogenase levels. These results may be very useful as a complementary diagnosis tool during the veterinary care of individuals of this species included in re-introduction programs.

AB  - The present paper presents a green process of two-step nanocellulose modification of hemp fibres and investigates the mechanisms of the efficacy of the modification. The results showed that the present nano-modification significantly increased the mechanical and interfacial properties of hemp fibres. The optimized condition (pH 11, 0.1% DTAB) of the nano-modification resulted in an increase of the modulus, tensile stress and tensile strain of hemp fibres by 36.13%, 72.80% and 67.69% respectively. FEG-SEM micrograph revealed that the nanocellulose modified the natural fibres in two ways, namely, nanocellulose (i) filling in the stria and (ii) bonding the inter-fibrils in the gaps between fibrils. XRD results showed the nano-modification increased the crystallinity index of natural fibres up to 38.46%. Resin absorption of the nano-modified fibres increased by 39.00%. XPS measurement and the ATR-FTIR characterization indicated that the nanocellulose modification may have resulted in changes in the chemical elements and chemical structure of interfaces, the esterification between hydroxyl groups at C-2 and C-6 of nanocellulose and carboxyl groups of the unsaturated polyester.

AB  - Montgomery County, Maryland faces a growing problem that confronts local governments across the country: the Cumulative impacts that Population growth and the resulting land-use changes are having on local streams and their accompanying ecosystems. County officials found they needed ail affordable tool to serve as a report card for stream health, and began a biomonitoring program in 1994. By 1997 county officials had monitored all 23 watersheds within the county's boundaries, and in 1998 the County published its first Countywide Stream Protection Strategy (CSPS). The County uses the CSPS to prioritize its watershed restoration efforts to those areas most in need of immediate remediation. Six primary programs now Support or require the use of information from Montgomery County's biomonitoring program. And, the lessons learned from Montgomery County can help other county and local governments develop similar programs of their own.

AB  - Multimetric indices of biotic integrity provide a quantitative measure of biological quality and have been developed for several taxonomic groups. Community integrity for fish is typically represented by the multimetric Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), while for macroinverterates the Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) can be applied. Given the considerable sampling efforts required for biomonitoring, it is important to know the extent to which indices based on particular taxonomic groups respond differently to (anthropogenic) stressors in the environment. The three goals of our study were (1) to assess the concordance of freshwater fish and macroinvertebrate communities, (2) to derive stressor-response relationships for IBI and ICI pertaining to multiple environmental factors and (3) to compare the responses of IBI and ICI to these environmental factors in the state of Ohio (USA). We used a database containing abiotic as well as biotic information for 545 local catchments located across Ohio (USA). Our 22 environmental factors covered physiography, water chemistry, physical habitat quality and toxic pressure. Concordance between the fish and invertebrate communities was assessed using a Mantel test. Response patterns of IBI and ICI to each of the environmental factors were analyzed by constructing stressor-response curves with Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). Fish community integrity was primarily related to physical characteristics of the stream (channel- and riffle quality) and latitude, whereas invertebrate community integrity mainly responded to the phosphorus concentration. Response curves showed that the two indices responded similarly to most of the water chemistry variables, while responses differed for physiographical and physical habitat quality variables.

AB  - Twenty-four cowpea genotypes were evaluated under sole cropping or additive series intercropping with sorghum from 2004 to 2005 at four sites representative of the Guinea and Sudan savannah ecologies in Ghana. The aim was to determine whether cowpea breeding programs that emphasize selection under sole-crop conditions have the potential to produce cultivars that are effective under additive series intercropping. Genotype xcropping systems interaction was significant for days to 50% flowering but not for grain yield, biomass and other studied traits. Genotypic yield reaction to cropping systems indicated that bridging the yield gap between sole cropping and intercropping systems is best addressed by agronomic interventions that reduce stress on intercrop cowpea rather than by selecting for specifically adapted genotypes for intercropping. Significant genotype x environment interactions were observed for all traits when data was pooled over cropping systems. Partitioning of the genotype xenvironment interaction variance indicated that days to 50% flowering was dominated by heterogeneity of genotypic variance, whereas genotype xenvironment interactions for grain yield and biomass was mainly due to imperfect correlations. Large differences in genotypic yield stability were observed as estimated by the among-environment variance, regression of yield on the environmental index, Kataoka's index, and by partitioning of genotype x environment interaction sum of squares into components attributable to each genotype. The results suggest that in regions where genotype x environment interaction for yield frequently causes re-ranking across environments, genotypes with the least contribution to the interaction sum of squares are likely to be most productive. On the whole, the results support the contention that breeding under sole-crop conditions has the potential to produce cultivars effective under intercropping conditions.

AB  - Stream benthic macroinvertebrates are useful indicators of the impacts of disturbances on catchment and stream conditions because they integrate many catchment-scale ecological processes. We tested the ability of macroinvertebrate assemblages over a 3-year period to indicate the impacts of a range of disturbances resulting from military training at the Fort Benning Military Installation, Georgia. We studied seven small streams that drained catchments spanning disturbances that ranged from light infantry movements to heavy disturbances from tracked vehicle movements. The main disturbance to streams was influx of sediment associated with training and use of unpaved roads. We quantified disturbance level as the % of catchment occurring as bare ground on slopes >3% and as unpaved road cover. Disturbance level values ranged from about 3 to 15%. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations revealed macroinvertebrate assemblages were associated with catchment disturbance. Irrespective of season, several richness measures (e.g., number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa and richness of Chironomidae) negatively corresponded with catchment disturbance, however except for chironomid richness all measures showed high variation among seasons and annually. Compositional and functional feeding group measures also showed high seasonal and annual variation, with only the % of macroinvertebrates clinging to benthic habitats (=% clingers) corresponding with disturbance. Both tolerance metrics tested, the Florida index and North Carolina biotic index, showed little seasonal and annual variation, however only the Florida index related to disturbance. A regional multimetric, the Georgia stream condition index, consistently corresponded with catchment disturbance and showed the least temporal variability. Our results further suggest a threshold at 8-10% of the catchment as bare ground and unpaved road cover, a disturbance threshold similar to that reported for other land uses. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Future oceans are predicted to contain less oxygen than at present. This is because oxygen is less soluble in warmer water and predicted stratification will reduce mixing. Hypoxia in marine environments is thus likely to become more widespread in marine environments and understanding species-responses is important to predicting future impacts on biodiversity. This study used a tractable model, the Antarctic clam, Laternula elliptica, which can live for 36years, and has a well-characterized ecology and physiology to understand responses to hypoxia and how the effect varied with age. Younger animals had a higher condition index, higher adenylate energy charge and transcriptional profiling indicated that they were physically active in their response to hypoxia, whereas older animals were more sedentary, with higher levels of oxidative damage and apoptosis in the gills. These effects could be attributed, in part, to age-related tissue scaling; older animals had proportionally less contractile muscle mass and smaller gills and foot compared with younger animals, with consequential effects on the whole-animal physiological response. The data here emphasize the importance of including age effects, as large mature individuals appear to be less able to resist hypoxic conditions and this is the size range that is the major contributor to future generations. Thus, the increased prevalence of hypoxia in future oceans may have marked effects on benthic organisms' abilities to persist and this is especially so for long-lived species when predicting responses to environmental perturbation.

AB  - The real-world economic conditions have inevitably forced many companies to pursue outsourcing as a suitable long term planning tool to reduce operating costs and improve their competitiveness in different marketplaces. One of the critical activities for outsourcing success is the outsourcing provider selection, which may be regarded as a type of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In this study, we propose a multiple-criteria group decision making model under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment to select the best outsourcing provider. First, an IVIF-weighted geometric averaging (IVIFWGA) operator is employed to aggregate all individual IVIF-decision matrices provided by a group of experts into a collective IVIF-decision matrix. Then, a new version of ELECTRE method in an IVIF environment by novel indexes is proposed for the evaluation process in terms of insufficient and inaccurate information. Finally, to demonstrate its usefulness, an application example for evaluating of outsourcing providers is given from the recent literature.

TI  - Alcohol consumption, depression, overweight and cortisol levels as determining factors for NR3C1 gene methylation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - The NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene is a component of the stress response system, which can be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. NR3C1 methylation has been associated with trauma and mental issues, including depression, post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and personality disorders. Previous studies have reported that stressful events are involved in NR3C1 gene methylation, suggesting that its regulation under environmental effects is complex. The present study aimed to analyze associations involving stressors such as socioeconomic status, health conditions, and lifestyle in relation to NR3C1 methylation in adults. This study included 386 individual users of the Brazilian Public Unified Health System (SUS), and evaluated socioeconomic and health conditions, body mass index, cortisol levels, and lifestyle. Data were correlated with NR3C1 methylation, determined using DNA pyrosequencing. The results showed that alcohol consumption, overweight, and high cortisol levels were related to NR3C1 demethylation, while depression was related to its methylation. Habits, lifestyle, and health status may influence NR3C1 gene regulation via methylation, revealing the complexity of environmental impacts on NR3C1 methylation.

AB  - Numerous methods have been developed for the quantitative assessment of eutrophication: statistical techniques, simulation models and water quality indicators are the most widely used techniques to assess trophic levels. All these methods share a common goal: to evaluate the environmental impact due to high nutrient concentrations / phytoplankton biomass and classify the waters into oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic water types. This classification provides a useful tool for assessing environmental quality and help coastal managers and planners in the decision making. In the present work the indicators used for eutrophication assessment are reviewed. They provide useful information because voluminous amounts of data can be expressed through a single number. Variable indices such as chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton biomass and water transparency are examined and ranges defining levels of eutrophication are proposed. Among the flux measurements, primary productivity has also been considered as an indicator useful in assessing trophic levels and a productivity scaling is also given. Community indices and their application in eutrophication studies are overviewed and their effectiveness in describing eutrophic trends is evaluated; their assumptions, advantages and shortcomings are also discussed. Among the twelve community indices evaluated for assessing eutrophication, only four were found to respond to eutrophic conditions; in nutrient and phytoplankton variables used as indicators, their frequency distribution showed overlapping between water types; this seems to be a problem in defining boundary values discriminating trophic levels. As the indices express ecosystem status and conditions, if they are going to be used under the Water Framework Directive, special consideration is needed since different scales seem to apply at regional level rather than forming a universal tool applicable to all European coastal waters.

AB  - We evaluated the temporal dynamics of the aggregate groundfish community, further decomposed into functional groups, individual species abundances, and health indicators, from adjacent management units on the Scotian Shelf. On the colder, eastern half of the shelf, several species collapsed in the early 1990s, while, on the western half, no such collapses were evident despite similar exploitation regimes. The decline in the eastern aggregate biomass was influenced by a decline in average body size, which was interpreted as a past integrator of temperature and size-selective fishing. Biomass of 3 out of 4 functional groups declined in the east; 3 out of 4 groups increased in the west. Some species from the east appear to be slowly compensating, but not enough to counter the decline in aggregate biomass. Species inhabiting the warmer western region show strong evidence of compensation, In effect, warmer waters allow potential compensating species to increase at a faster rate. Quantitative measures of functional group temporal stability revealed no differences between areas; therefore, neither area can be considered stable. Physiological condition declined in many species in both regions. Species that increased in the west, or had slower rates of decline, had higher levels of condition than eastern populations. With the exception of cod in the western region, species growth rates declined in both areas. Although the west appears more stable, it is following a similar, but protracted trajectory, to that found in the east. The protracted response in the west may be due to higher demographic rates in warmer waters. To foster resilience in the western area, we should address the rapid pace of new fisheries, effects of size-selective mortality, and the diminishing number of natural refugia.

AB  - Changes in body condition and body size in field populations of house mice, Mus domesticus, were examined to investigate why mouse populations do not increase rapidly in some years when favourable environmental and demographic conditions indicate they might. Mice had repeated seasonal patterns each year in breeding, growth rates and body condition that reflected the seasonal availability of food, but mean levels for each parameter varied among years. In most years mice lost body condition during summer, breeding declined and population growth slowed. Rapid population growth occurred when body condition was generally high and was maintained throughout summer. Female mice with large body length were more likely to breed than smaller mice, at all times, but changes in body condition accounted for most of the variability in female breeding activity between years and between habitats, and for the seasonal changes in the importance of body length. During rapid population growth, the recruitment rate of juveniles relative to the number of breeding females was 150-300% higher than in other years but adult survival rates were not higher. The data indicate that the ability of mice to maintain body condition, particularly when subject to moisture stress in summer, affects the proportion of females breeding, the number of juveniles weaned and their body condition at weaning, and is promoted by foraging conditions that favour maintenance of juvenile body condition after weaning. These factors, in turn, greatly affect juvenile recruitment rates and eventual population density of mice. Low juvenile survival is suggested as a reason that numbers of house mice in southern Australian cereal-growing areas do not increase rapidly in some years when other parameters are favourable. Similar processes are likely to play a role in regulating other rodent populations.

AB  - This paper explores some of the factors that may contribute to the sustainable use of water on irrigated dairy farms in Victoria, Australia. The paper begins with a discussion of the principles of sustainable water use as they would apply to dairy farms in the Gippsland region of Victoria. A series of indicators are used to link aspects of sustainable water use at a regional scale, and the observable trends are discussed. Of particular interest is the way that local river systems contribute to the dairy industry in this region and the aspects of dairying and other significant regional factors that may be impacting on the sustainability of river systems in this area. The indicators are structured and analysed using the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework developed by the OECD, most commonly used in State of the Environment reporting. The trends highlighted by the indicator set are discussed in terms of the implications that current patterns of water use may have for possible shifts towards more sustainable water use on individual dairy farms in Gippsland. Keywords Dairy industry; environmental indicators; Pressure-State-Response Framework; sustainable water-use.

AB  - The urgency of the research. In the early 90s of the last century, economists and scientists attributed Ukraine to the undisputed leaders due to the existing resource potential and predicted its rapid economic growth. Unfortunately, the predictions have not come true: over the last 25 years, Ukraine has lost its advantages on certain indicators. As for the positions, which have been saved, Ukraine should pay the unreasonably high price by the ecological and social conditions deterioration. Target setting. The question is how the other countries have coped with these problems. Moreover, in our opinion, the most valuable experience is the experience of post-socialist countries, which had the same problems as Ukraine had like adaptation problems to the market environment. Recent scientific researches and issues analysis. The most authoritative foreign researchers on the sustainable development problems are Donella H. Meadows, G. Brundtland, M. Ashby, N. Droste, K. Fiorella and others. The most authoritative researchers on the sustainable development problems in Ukraine are Mykhailo Zghurovskyi and his project performers. Uninvestigated parts of general matters defining. However, these researchers did not conduct the investigations of indication of the sustainable development of Ukraine in comparison with the countries of post-socialist camp. The research objective. The survey target is a comprehensive study of Ukraine in the global dimension of sustainable development index: the implementation of post-socialist countries ranking placement in the indices of economic, social and environmental dimension, the index of a sustainability, the index of economic measurement and index of harmonization, the components of quality of life and safety of life; the analysis of placement in these spaces in order to find patterns and distinctive features for a particular group of countries; setting of the countries' placement features in the above mentioned spaces and the comparison of groups with Ukraine. The statement of basic materials. The article deals with the author's research results about Ukraine's place in the sustainable development measuring global index. The valuation is performed by measuring metric indices of sustainable development in the space of three pillars (economic, environmental, and social) in the context of quality and safety of life. Conclusions. Performed the ranking of the post-socialist states' placement in the space of sustainable development index. The analysis of placement in these spaces in order to find patterns and distinctive features for a particular group of countries is made. Peculiarities of the placement in the abovementioned spaces are outlined, and the comparison of these groups with Ukraine is given.

AB  - Without mentioning methodical gaps, plants and animals as bioindicators are essential means to characterize the ecological state of landscape and to evaluate landscape functions.  Instead of discussing other landscape functions there is gone more fully into estimating landscape as a habitat of plants and animals.  The choice of methods that should be applied depends on the aim, the needed scale, the adequate working expenses and the available data. There are two groups of methods:  The indirect methods are based on analysis and interpretation of land use types, presence and state of protected areas, condition of environmental media, neighbourhood effects.  The direct registration of biotic landscape components contains floristical and faunistical mapping, the record of actual vegetation, biotope mapping and interpretation of synecological research (ecological demands of species like habitat bonding, minimal areas etc.).  Derived features are rarity, endangering, naturalness, hemeroby, diversity, isolation, connectivity, stability, ecological and protective value.  Examples from test areas near Dresden are shown.

AB  - Aim Hybrid populations can have intermediate, conserved or transgressive niches, compared to the parental species. Fine-scale analyses can improve our understanding of niche evolution, but information on microhabitat differences between parental species and hybrids is extremely scarce for animal populations. We assessed the pattern and role of niche variation along a hybrid zone, by investigating differences in microhabitat selection between terrestrial cave salamander species (Hydromantes ambrosii and Hydromantes italicus) and their hybrids. We tested whether introgressed populations show intermediate, conserved or transgressive niche, compared to parental species. Furthermore, we compared body condition index (BCI) among individuals observed in different microhabitats (different areas of caves), to assess the potential advantages of exploiting specific microhabitats. Location We surveyed similar to 700 cave sectors in Italy, across the whole range of the two parental species and along their contact zone. Methods We recorded salamander distribution and measured microhabitat features influencing salamander distribution: humidity, temperature and incident light. We tested niche differences between parental species and hybrids, and analysed spatial variation of body condition. Results We detected significant niche shifts between parental species and hybrids. Introgressed populations showed a transgressive niche and exploited sectors with warmer temperature, lower humidity and more light, compared to the non-introgressed ones. Introgressed salamanders were better able to exploit the microhabitat conditions that are frequently found nearby cave entrance. For males, BCI was significantly higher in individuals found close to the cave entrance. Main conclusions The transgressive niche of hybrids between H. ambrosii and H. italicus indicates niche expansion towards harsh environmental conditions, and such transgressive segregation allows exploiting environments with higher food availability. The ability to exploit dry and warm sectors can provide important advantages to hybrid populations that can better persist under stressful conditions. Transgressive niche can be important for long-term persistence and evolution within hybrid zones.

AB  - A global flood risk index (FRI) is established, based on both natural and social factors. The advanced flood risk index (AFRI) is the expectation of damage in the case of a single flood occurrence, estimated by a linear regression-based approach as a function of hazard and vulnerability metrics. The resulting equations are used to predict potential flood damage given gridded global data for independent variables. It is new in the aspect that it targets floods by units of events, instead of a long-term trend. Moreover, the value of the AFRI is that it can express relative potential flood risk with the process of flood damage occurrence considered. The significance of this study is that not only the hazard parameters which contribute directly to flood occurrence, but vulnerability parameters which reflect the conditions of the region where flood occurred, including its residential and social characteristics, were shown quantitatively to affect flood damage.

AB  - Ocean acidification driven by anthropogenic climate change is causing a global decrease in pH, which is projected to be 0.4 units lower in coastal shallow waters by the year 2100. Previous studies have shown that seaweeds grown under such conditions may alter their growth and photosynthetic capacity. It is not clear how such alterations might impact interactions between seaweed and herbivores, e.g. through changes in feeding rates, nutritional value, or defense levels. Changes in seaweeds are particularly important for coastal food webs, as they are key primary producers and often habitat-forming species. We cultured the habitat-forming brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus for 30 days in projected future pCO(2) (1100 mu atm) with genetically identical controls in ambient pCO(2) (400 mu atm). Thereafter the macroalgae were exposed to grazing by Littorina littorea, acclimated to the relevant pCO(2)-treatment. We found increased growth (measured as surface area increase), decreased tissue strength in a tensile strength test, and decreased chemical defense (phlorotannins) levels in seaweeds exposed to high pCO(2)-levels. The herbivores exposed to elevated pCO(2)-levels showed improved condition index, decreased consumption, but no significant change in feeding preference. Fucoid seaweeds such as F. vesiculosus play important ecological roles in coastal habitats and are often foundation species, with a key role for ecosystem structure and function. The change in surface area and associated decrease in breaking force, as demonstrated by our results, indicate that F. vesiculosus grown under elevated levels of pCO(2) may acquire an altered morphology and reduced tissue strength. This, together with increased wave energy in coastal ecosystems due to climate change, could have detrimental effects by reducing both habitat and food availability for herbivores.

AB  - The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of light and temperature on seed germination and the effect of light on seedling emergence of Clausena excavata, an invasive exotic species. Seeds were incubated at constant temperatures (10 to 40 degrees C), under continuous white light and darkness. Seedling emergence was evaluated under full sun and canopy shade. There was no significant difference between seeds germinated in the presence or absence of light at temperatures between 20 and 35 degrees C. Seeds maintained at 20 degrees C germinated more slowly than other temperatures. Independent of temperature, seed germination was much more synchronised under white light than under darkness. In the field, emergence occurred in both environments, but a greater percentage was observed under full sun. Seedling emergence occurred at the same rate and synchronisation index under both conditions. C. excavata has a high invader potential in open areas and shaded environments.

AB  - The new index FINE, a multimetric, fuzzy-based index for the evaluation of environmental quality for Mediterranean transitional waters, was calculated using biotic data gathered between 2000 and 2006 at 15 stations in 4 Tyrrhenian transitional water ecosystems (Orbetello Lagoon, Padrongiano Delta, Stagno di S. Teodoro, and Stagno di Tortoli), i.e. in a different biogeographic sub-province respect to the one in which the index was developed and validated. The rationale of FINE is that certain attributes, selected on the basis of established principles of benthic ecology, are fundamental for lagoon ecosystem function. A set of other indices (Simpson's 1 - lambda', the W-statistics, AMBI, and BOPA) was also calculated and compared to FINE outputs. FINE, 1 - lambda', and the W-statistics were significantly correlated with sedimentary organic matter content. Some stations were unequivocally assigned to the same ecological status, independently from the index used; for others, some discrepancies were evident. Mediterranean transitional waters probably share ecosystem complexities which are not yet fully captured by indices developed and validated elsewhere. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There are rich deposits of mineral and fossil natural resources in the Arctic, which make this region very attractive for extracting industries. Their operations have immediate and vast consequences for ecological systems, which are particularly vulnerable in this region. We are developing a management strategy for Arctic watersheds impacted by industrial production. The case study is Lake Imandra watershed (Murmansk oblast, Russia) that has exceptionally high levels of economic development and large numbers of people living there. We track the impacts of toxic pollution on ecosystem health and then - human health. Three periods are identified: (a) natural, pre-industrial state; (b) disturbed, under rapid economic development; and (c) partial recovery, during recent economic meltdown. The ecosystem is shown to transform into a qualitatively new state, which is still different from the original natural state, even after toxic loadings have substantially decreased. Fish disease where analyzed to produce and integral evaluation of ecosystem health. Accumulation of heavy metals in fish is correlated with etiology of many diseases. Dose-effect relationships are between integral water quality indices and ecosystem health indicators clearly demonstrates that existing water quality standards adopted in Russia are inadequate for Arctic regions. Health was also poor for people drinking water from the Lake. Transport of heavy metals from drinking water, into human organs, and their effect on liver and kidney diseases shows the close connection between ecosystem and human health. A management system is outlined that is based on feedback from indices of ecosystem and human health and control over economic production and/or the amount of toxic loading produced. We argue that prospects for implementation of such a system are quite bleak at this time, and that more likely we will see a continued depopulation of these Northern regions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A mesocosm experiment (1 m(3) enclosures) was carried out over 28 days to evaluate the effect of Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) derived from decaying Phaeocystis globosa colonies on the physiological performance and mortality of European sea bass juveniles (35 mm in length and 113 days old). Accordingly, sea bass juveniles were exposed to high TEP concentrations derived from both a culture of decaying P. globosa colonies (7634.27 +/- 3514.41 mu g XG eq L-1) and freshly sea foam (932.54 +/- 341.21 mu g XG eq L-1). During the experiment, environmental parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature and salinity) were stable, similar among treatments and not limiting for growth. Only TEP concentration varied between treatments. Fish mortality rate was relatively low (0 to 2% d(-1)) and mostly occurred during the first week when TEP concentrations were relatively low. Despite high and varying TEP concentrations, juvenile sea bass physiological performances (growth in length and weight, Fulton condition index and RNA-DNA ratio) did not differ between replicates and treatments. In addition, juvenile sea bass increased both in size by 7.2 mm (growth rate of 0.26 mm d(-1)) and weight by 708 mg (growth rate of 25.29 mg d(-1)) during the 28 days of the experiment. Altogether, these results showed clearly that TEP derived from decaying P. globosa bloom and foam accumulation have no negative effect on juvenile sea bass physiological performances and survival if water dissolved oxygen is maintained high. Despite being one of the most recurrent phytoplankton blooms recorded in the northwest European shelf seas and forms large blooms in the coastal waters during spring, we suggest that Phaeocystis bloom has no deleterious effect on marine coastal fish aquaculture activities.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios are increasingly used to study long-term change in food web structure and nutrient cycling. We retrospectively analyse elemental composition (C, N and P) and stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) in archived monitoring samples of two important taxa from the bottom of the food web; the filamentous ephemeral macroalgae Cladophora spp. and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis trossulus from three contrasting regions in the Baltic Sea (coastal Bothnian Sea and Baltic Proper, open sea central Baltic). The aim is to statistically link the observed spatial and interannual (8-24 years' time-series) variability in elemental and isotope baselines with their biomass trends and to the oceanographic monitoring data reflecting the ongoing environmental changes (i.e., eutrophication and climate) in this system. We find clear differences in isotope baselines between the two major Baltic Sea basins. However, the temporal variation in Mytilus delta C-13 was similar among regions and, at the open sea station, mussels and algae delta C-13 also correlated over time, likely reflecting a global (Suess) effect, whereas delta N-15 of both taxa varied with local and regional dissolved nitrogen concentrations in water. delta N-15 in source amino acids allowed detection of diazotrophic N in Mytilus, which was masked in bulk delta N-15. Finally, Cladophora N:P reflected regional nutrient levels in the water while P%, which differed for both taxa, was linked to food quality for Mytilus. This study highlights the potential of a multi-taxa and multi-stable isotope approach to understand nutrient dynamics and monitor long-term environmental changes.

AB  - The goal of the work was to estimate, quantitatively, vegetation state and productivity using AVHRR-based Vegetation Condition Index (m). The VCI algorithm includes application of post-launch calibration to visible channels, calculation of NDVI from channels' reflectance, removal of high-frequency noise from NDVI's annual time series, stratification of ecosystem resources, and separation of ecosystem and weather components in the NDVI value. The weather component was calculated by normalizing the NDVI to the difference of the extreme NDVI fluctuations (maximum and minimum), derived from multi-year data for each week and land pixel. The VCI was compared with wheat density measured in Kazakhstan. Six test fields were located in different climatic (annual precipitation 150 to 700 mm) and ecological (semi-desert to steppe-forest) zones with elevations from 200 to 700 m and a wide range of NDVI variation over space and season from 0.05 to 0.47. Plant density (PD) was measured in wheat fields by calculating the number of stems per unit area. PD deviation from year to year (PDD) was expressed as a deviation from median density calculated from multi-year data. The correlation between PDD and VCI for all stations was positive and quite strong (r(2) > 0.75) with the Standard Errors of Estimates (SEE) of PDD less than 16 percent; for individual stations, the SEE was less than 11 percent. The results indicate that VCI is an appropriate index for monitoring weather impact on vegetation and for assessment of pasture and crop productivity in Kazakhstan. Because satellite observations provide better spatial and temporal coverage, the VCI-based system will provide efficient tools for management of water resources and the improvement of agricultural planning. This system will serve as a prototype in the other parts of the world where ground observations are limited or not available.

AB  - The status of three Lithuanian medium-sized streams: a forested natural stream, an agricultural natural stream and a straightened stream, receiving diffused pollution from agricultural lands, was evaluated in spring, summer and autumn 2008 using selected physicochemical variables and macroinvertebrate analysis. Taxonomic composition of invertebrate macrofauna was used for calculation of the following biotic indices: the Danish Stream Fauna Index (DSFI), Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP), Average Score per Taxon (ASPT), Belgian Biotic Index (BBI) and Extended Biotic Index (IBE).
   The data obtained show that water quality was of class 1 in the forested natural stream, of class 3 in the agricultural natural stream and of class 4 in the agricultural channelized stream (on a five-class scale), according to NO3-N and N total values.
   It was concluded that BMWP, ASPT, BBI and IBE indices tend to assign stream water to a higher water quality class than DSFI and HBI do. According to BMWP, BBI and IBE indices, good water quality was found even in the agricultural natural stream, where water quality was moderate according to NO3-N and NT values.

AB  - Despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent annually in the United States on environmental monitoring, policy and decision makers seldom have ready access to monitoring data to aid in prioritizing research and assessment efforts or to assess the extent to which current policies are meeting the desired objectives.  EPA is currently conducting research to evaluate options for establishing an integrated, cooperative monitoring program, with participation by federal, state, and private entities, that could result in annual statistical reports and interpretive summaries on the status and trends in indicators of adverse disturbance and corresponding 'health' of the nation's ecosystem on the regional and national scale.

AB  - Understanding why a species occupies a certain geographic range and predicting how they will be affected by climate change require characterizing physiological traits in geographically-distant populations. The objective of this study was to perform a direct comparison of two eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) populations that occupy contrasting temperature and salinity habitats, New Brunswick, Canada (47 degrees N - Gulf of St. Lawrence) and Louisiana, USA (29 degrees N - Gulf of Mexico). Specifically, clearance rate, valve opening, and oxygen consumption rate were measured in oysters of both populations following a full factorial design with three temperatures (10, 20, 30 degrees C) and two salinities (15, 25). New Brunswick oysters had a greater gill area, shell gape angle, and oxygen consumption rate. Temperature was the main driver of clearance rate, valve opening duration and oxygen consumption rate. Clearance rate at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C was significantly higher than at 10 degrees C, and oysters at 20 degrees C had their valves opened for a greater percentage of time compared to oysters at 10 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Oxygen consumption rate increased gradually from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C and similarly for both populations, with no indications of a thermal breakpoint at 30 degrees C. Temperature coefficients for the oxygen consumption rate (Q(10)) were within the normal ecological range for both populations. No physiological differences were observed between salinity treatments in both populations. No latitudinal compensation in the physiological rates was found. Overall, results showed that C. virginica is tolerant to a broad range of temperatures and salinities. Such physiological plasticity is consistent with the species' extended geographical range.

AB  - We investigated the impact of riparian vegetation type on shredder guilds in three similarly sized Danish forest streams during the period 1992-1994. One stream drained beech forest (Fagus sylvatica L.), one drained mixed, mainly deciduous forest, and one drained conifer plantations. Temperature was lowest in the conifer stream reflecting the high degree of shading during winter. The standing stock of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) differed only slightly among streams, although CPOM quality differed more markedly. Leaf litter respiration rates differed significantly among streams, being lowest in the conifer stream. The shredder guild was comprised of 9 species, of which only Nemoura flexuosa AUBERT. was present in all 3 streams. In terms of biomass, the dominant shredders were the amphipod Gammarus pulex L. and the trichopteran Sericostoma personatum SP. in the deciduous streams, and the plecopteran Nemurella picteti KLP. in the conifer stream. Shredder biomass was significantly higher in the two deciduous streams than in the conifer stream. The condition index expressed as mass: head width ratio was significantly lower for Leuctra nigra (OLV.) and N. flexuosa in the conifer stream than in the deciduous streams. Total shredder guild production was 5982 mg m(-2) yr(-1) in the beech stream, 4681 mg m(-2) yr(-1) in the mixed deciduous stream and 1310 mg m(-2) yr(-1) in the conifer stream. Our results thus suggest that forest stream shredder guilds are influenced by forest type, and apparently attributable to a combination of factors including water temperature and chemistry, and the quality of the available food resource. If low secondary production of the shredder guild is a general feature of streams draining conifer plantation forest, it could have important implications for higher trophic levels and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Ecological security defined as the creation of a condition where the physical surroundings of a community provide for the needs of its inhabitants without diminishing its natural stock, which is important for regional security and social stability. In recent years, land use patterns in the Changbai Mountain region have changed significantly with intensive human activities, and consequently led to increasing problems in regional ecological security. Based on the Pressure-State-Impact-Response (PSIR) model and the mathematical method of catastrophe progression supported by geographical information system (GIS), the ecological security situation of the study area under land use and cover change (LUCC) was evaluated. The results indicated that the ecological security in Changbai Mountain region varied nonlinearly, which got better from 1990 to 2000 but became worse from 2000 to 2007, the ecological security levels in Changbai Mountain region were mainly medium and medium to low during the past 17 years, with higher values of Ecological Security Index (ESI) in the central region and lower values in the east and west, the ecological security situation was more serious in the settlements and river valleys, where the LUCC was most remarkable.

KW  - INDEX
AB  - An index of biotic integrity (IBI) is a frequently used approach for assessing the ecological integrity of streams with fish and macroinvertebrates the faunal assemblages most commonly used as indicator taxa. The IBI approach has been much less commonly applied to wetlands, despite the legal, policy and scientific need to assess wetland condition and develop ecological performance goals for wetland creation, restoration and enhancement. While some IBIs are sophisticated systems with statewide application that have undergone one or more testing iterations, many published IBIs are derived from single data sets of a single class of aquatic resource with limited geographic application. The State of Ohio initiated development of a wetland IBI using vascular plants in 1996. Sampling methods were investigated and ultimately a plot-based method was adopted. Potential attributes and different human disturbance gradients were evaluated in several studies. Ultimately, IBIs for emergent, forest and shrub dominated wetlands were developed. Data from the Vegetation IBIs-emergent (VIBI-E) is presented to illustrate this process. Subsequent testing and refinement is a critical step in the development of a robust IBI with more than local application. Throughout its initial development (R 2 = 0.863, p < 0.001), first major testing iteration (R-2 = 82.2%, p < 0.001), second test iteration (R-2 = 75.0%, p < 0.001) and third test iteration (R-2 = 82.1%, p < 0.001), the VIBI-E has remained significantly correlated with the disturbance gradient. Eight of the original 10 metrics proposed continued to have significant and interpretable relationships with the disturbance gradient, with 4 metrics remaining completely unchanged, and 4 undergoing relatively minor modifications, and 2 being replaced. The VIBI-E and its component metrics were also evaluated against a new disturbance gradient (Landscape Development Index or LDI), derived from land use percentages within a I km radius of the wetlands, that was not used during VIBI-E development. The VIBI-E score and 9 of 10 metrics were significantly correlated with the LDI disturbance gradient providing separate confirmation of the VIBI. The Vegetation IBI-E consistently and reliably assessed wetland condition across the whole range of wetland types throughout Ohio's ecological regions. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been used in consumer and military products since the 1950s but are increasingly scrutinized worldwide because of inherent chemical properties, environmental contamination, and risks to public health and the environment. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) identified 24 PFASs of interest for further study and possible regulation. We examined 371 peerreviewed studies published since 2001 to understand the occurrence and distribution of 24 priority PFASs in global surface waters and groundwater. We identified 77,541 and 16,246 data points for surface waters and groundwater, respectively, with total PFAS concentrations ranging from low pg/L to low mg/L levels. Most data were from Asia, Europe, and North America with some reports from Oceania. PFAS information from other geographic regions is lacking. PFASs levels are consistently higher in rivers and streams followed by lakes and reservoirs and then coastal and marine systems. When sufficient data were available, probabilistic environmental hazard assessments (PEHAs) were performed from environmental exposure distributions (EEDs) to identify potential exceedances of available guideline values for each compound by matrix, region, and aquatic system. Specifically, exceedances of USEPA drinking water lifetime health advisory levels were up to 74% for PFOS in groundwater from Oceania and 69% for PFOA in North American groundwater. Our findings support selection of environmentally relevant experimental treatment levels for future toxicology, ecotoxicology and bioaccumulation studies, and potable source water exposure investigations, while highlighting PFASs and major geographic locations requiring additional study and inclusion in global monitoring and surveillance campaigns.

AB  - The purpose of the paper is to analyse the physiology of thermoregulation in various climate types using human body exergy balance model where mutual influence of environmental parameters and personal factors are considered. Two virtual persons with different metabolic rates and effective clothing insulations were exposed to selected climate conditions. Human body exergy balance (hBExB) was calculated with software developed by Hideo Asada Rev 2010. Results showed that climate conditions in combination with metabolic rate and effective clothing insulation had large influence on every part of hBExB. Thermally comfortable conditions with PMV index closer to 0 did not always result in the lowest possible hbExC rate. The value of hbExC rate strongly depends on environmental parameters as well as on metabolic rate and effective clothing insulation. Understanding the mutual influence of environmental parameters and personal factors on hBExB is a key factor for identifying recommendations for healthy, comfortable and stimulative conditions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED BOTANY-ANGEWANDTE BOTANIK
LA  - English
AB  - A total of 834 samples of local adapted maize germplasm were collected from eight administrative regions of Ethiopia; 592 samples in 1984 and 1985, 242 in 1986 and 1987. After collection, the accessions were evaluated at two experimental stations - Awasa and Zewai. Both stations are located in a semi-arid environment of southern Ethiopia where rainfall amount is low. In particular at Zewai, rainfall is poorly distributed and highly variable. Under these conditions, maturity indeces of germplasm from Welo, Game Gofa, Shewa and Hererge were early to medium. Accessions from Welega, Illubabor, Keffa, and Sidamo area were late types with an average growth period of more than 130 days. Data on maturity indeces, plant and ear height, disease and pest reaction, and yield performance revealed the diversity and variability of maize germplasm in Ethiopia. An experiment carried out during 1988 and 1990 under controlled conditions at Awasa indicated the potential and adaptability of unexploited Ethiopian maize germplasm as source material for the maize improvement under stress environments. Germplasm selected for early maturity, drought resistance, disease and pest tolerance, and yield were superior in most aspects compared to a new variety ready for release and a standard check which should further be assessed for trueness to type.

AB  - The main objective of this article is to analyze global trends in the use of methods to assess the contamination of heavy metals (MP) associated with urban road sediment (SV). A systematic literature review was carried out between the years 1995-2018. A citation frequency index was used to establish an order of importance for the detected categories. The results show the following order of importance for the categories detected: metallic enrichment (87.0%) > health risk (55.8%) > environmental risk (35.1%). The global preference methods for each of the categories are the geo-accumulation index (55.8%), hazard quotient (50.6%), and the ecological risk index (31.2%), respectively. These preferences are possibly conditioned by the local existence of information on background concentrations of MP, daily inhalation doses of particles associated with SV, toxicity factors due to ingestion/dermal contact with MP, and emission factors of SV particles. The most relevant MP are Pb (97.4%), Cu (93.5%), and Zn (89,6%). However, Cr-Cd-As are also highlighted for their high ecological and carcinogenic risk.

AB  - The main aim of this brief and purposely radical essay is to investigate further possibilities for empirical research in natural classification of semiosis (signs as wholes). Before introducing emon - a missing term in the taxonomy of signs - we make a distinction between the natural and artificial, and between the taxonomic and meronomic classifications of signs. Natural classifications or typologies are empirically based, while artificial classifications do not require empirical test. Meronomy describes the relational or functional structure of the whole (for instance triadic, circular, etc. composition of sign), while taxonomy categorizes individuals (individual signs). We argue that a natural taxonomy of signs can be based on the existence of different complexity of operations during semiosis, which implies different mechanisms of learning. We add into the taxonomy a particular type of signs - emonic signs, which are at work in imitation and social learning, while being more complex than indexes and less complex than symbols. Icons are related to imprinting, indexes to conditioning, emons to imitating, and symbols to conventions or naming. We also argue that the semiotic typologies could undergo large changes after the discovery of the proper mechanisms or workings of semiosis.

AB  - Macrozoobenthic communities provide vital ecosystem services including habitats and foraging resources for other species in all marine ecosystems. Although macrozoobenthos of deeper parts of the Pechora Sea (SE Barents Sea) have been studied in more detail, there is a lack of research in shallow waters of the Pechora Bay. The study area lies within the Nenetsky State Nature Reserve, established in 1997, to protect important breeding and moulting grounds of waterfowl. Macrozoobenthos provide key foraging resources for waterfowl in the nature reserve, however, there is a mismatch between ornithological and macrobenthic data. Eight stations were studied along the Russky Zavorot Peninsula in the Pechora Bay on a depth of 1.1-1.8 m within the near-shore zone of the Nenetsky State Nature Reserve in August 2016. A monodominant community of Limecola balthica with a biomass of 21.31 +/- 0.32 g/m(2) and 14 species in total was recorded across the area. The dominant species of the community correspond to those in the community of L. balthica recently described from the central estuarine part of the Pechora estuary. A low biomass and poor species richness in the L. balthica community support the earlier published results for the northern part of the bay and indicate the dependence of the community characteristics on enviromnental factors. The paucity of macrozoobenthos in the area is likely attributed to extreme enviromnental conditions including the following: (1) the water column freezes to the bottom during winter in the shallows of the Pechora estuary or (2) the freshwater flow spreads under the ice, severely impacting salinity. Hence the community is comprised of eurythermal and emyhaline forms and is reduced in biomass. It is unlikely that the shallows of the Russky Zavorot Peninsula play an important role as feeding grounds for benthic predators since a low in biomass barren community of a burrowing mollusc L. balthica does not provide enough foraging resources to feed stocks of waterfowl. The L. balthica-community could be used as an indicator of climate changes in the future - it is predicted that a reduction in sea ice volume will improve conditions for growth of L. balthica and may therefore lead to an increased body size and biomass of bivalves in the shallows.

AB  - The biological effects of a coastal process water (PW) discharge on native and caged mussels (Mytilus edulis) were assessed. Chemical analyses of mussel tissues and semi permeable membrane devices, along with a suite of biomarkers of different levels of biological complexity were measured. These were lysosomal membrane stability in haemocytes and digestive cells; micronuclei formation in haemocytes; changes in cell-type composition in the digestive gland epithelium; integrity of digestive gland tissue; peroxisome proliferation; and oxidative stress. Additionally the Integrative Biological Response (IBR/n) index was calculated. This integrative biomarker approach distinguished mussels, both native and caged, exhibiting different stress conditions not identified from the contaminant exposure. Mussels exhibiting higher stress responses were found with increased proximity to the PW discharge outlet. However, the biological effects reported could not be entirely attributed to the PW discharge based on the chemicals measured, but were likely due to either other chemicals in the discharge that were not measured, the general impact of the processing plant and or other activities in the local vicinity.

AB  - This research aimed to assess the Zahuapan river health through a holistic and watershed approach. The Rapid Bioassessment Protocols for Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers, of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was used as a support procedure to develop an integrated assessment, considering biotic, habitat and water quality partial assessments. In order to assess the river condition, two reference sites, located in a forest land, and nine perturbed sites, representatives of agricultural, urban and industrial lands, were selected in a geographical information system, with the support of field trips. The river biotic condition was based on families of benthic macroinvertebrates, the river habitat condition was assessed by using the habitat parameters established by the EPA, and the river water quality condition by developing an index from the nine measured physical and chemical parameters. The current river health was considered as the mode of the category of the partial assessments. While the river health of the reference sites was optimum, it was poor for all the perturbed sites, the worst condition in the index scale.

AB  - The food web structure (FWS) and ecosystem functioning (EF) of lakes worldwide are impacted by multiple disturbances. The historical evolution of the FWS and EF are not well understood due to the lack of sufficient long-term records of biotic variations. This study reconstructed the food web models in the 1950s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s for Baiyangdian Lake (BYDL), the largest shallow lake in northern China, using the Linear Inverse Modeling (LIM) and investigated EF in different periods. Our results confirmed that the FWS and EF of BYDL have undergone significant changes. The biomass of phytoplankton continuously increased, and the primary productivity of phytoplankton began to replace the primary productivity of submerged macrophytes in the 2000s and became the largest energy flow in the food web. Changes in the energy flow of primary producers are transmitted to high-trophic functional groups, which affects the diet composition of fish. Based on the ecological network analysis indices and food web stability indicators, it was concluded that after a turning point in the 1990s, the ecosystem showed initial stability and then gradually became unstable. Water level fluctuations and nutrient enrichment may be the key driving factors for changes in ecosystem state. Therefore, to maintain a good state of the ecosystem, we recommend implementing comprehensive management measures of hydrological management, nutrient-loading reduction, and biomanipulation. Furthermore, this study extended LIM to lake ecosystems, which may provide a new method for lake ecological environment management.

AB  - As ocean waters warm due to climate change, tropical species are shifting their ranges poleward to remain within their preferred thermal niches. As a result, novel communities are emerging in which tropical species interact with local temperate species, competing for similar resources, such as food and habitat. To understand how range-extending coral reef fish species perform along their leading edges when invading temperate ecosystems, we studied proxies of their fitness, including somatic growth (length increase), feeding rates, and body condition, along a 730-km latitudinal gradient situated in one of the global warming hotspots. We also studied co-occurring temperate species to assess how their fitness is affected along their trailing edges under ocean warming. We predicted that tropical fishes would experience reduced performance as they enter novel communities with suboptimal environmental conditions. Our study shows that although tropical fish maintain their body condition (based on three proxies) and stomach fullness across all invaded temperate latitudes, they exhibit decreased in situ growth rates, activity levels, and feeding rates in their novel temperate environment, likely a result of lower metabolic rates in cooler waters. We posit that tropical fishes face a growth-maintenance trade-off under the initial phases of ocean warming (i.e. at their leading edges), allowing them to maintain their body condition in cooler temperate waters but at the cost of slower growth. Temperate fish exhibited no distinct patterns in body condition and performance along the natural temperature gradient studied. However, in the face of future climate change, when metabolism is no longer stymied by low water temperatures, tropical range-extending species are likely to approach their native-range growth rates along their leading edges, ultimately leading to increased competitive interactions with local species in temperate ecosystems.

AB  - The Southwestern Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus; hereafter "flycatcher") is a federally listed endangered species that breeds in densely vegetated riparian habitats dominated by native and exotic plants, including introduced monotypic saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima). Some workers have theorized that saltcedar is unsuitable habitat for the flycatcher, primarily because it generally supports a smaller and less diverse invertebrate community (the flycatcher's food base) than native habitats (e.g. Salix spp.). However, differences in insect communities between native and saltcedar habitats are not proof that saltcedar habitats are inferior. The only way to evaluate whether the habitats differ in dietary or energetic quality is to document actual food limitation or its manifestations. Measurements of an individual's body condition and metabolic state can serve as indicators of environmental stressors, such as food limitation and environmental extremes. We captured 130 flycatchers breeding in native and saltcedar habitats in Arizona and New Mexico and measured 12 variables of physiological condition. These variables included body mass, fat level, body condition index, hematocrit, plasma triglycerides, plasma free fatty acids and glycerol, plasma glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate, plasma uric acid, total leukocyte count, and heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. We found substantial sex-based differences in the condition of male and female flycatchers. Ten of the 12 measures of physiological condition differed significantly between the sexes. In all cases where male and female condition differed (except mass), the differences suggest that males were in poorer condition than females. We found few habitat-based differences in flycatcher condition. Only 3 of the 12 physiological condition indices differed significantly between habitats. Our data show that, at least in some parts of the flycatcher's range, there is no evidence that flycatchers breeding in saitcedar habitats exhibit poorer nutritional condition or are suffering negative physiological affects.

AB  - Although commercial grazing can degrade natural habitats, sustainably grazed land may be effective for wildlife conservation. Thus, land condition frameworks that assess the landscape quality of grazed land may also be useful for assessment of habitat quality for wildlife. However, the relationship between the condition of grazed land and native biodiversity is mostly unknown, and this knowledge gap must be addressed to adequately balance commercial production and conservation. In the present case study we determined the relevance of a widely used grazing land condition scale to understanding native vertebrate species richness and abundance (birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals and all these vertebrate classes grouped) in grazed rangelands in northern Australia (similar to 24-13 degrees S; annual rainfall ranging from > 1200 to < 400 mm), sampled over approximately 10 years from 17 unique sites, containing 381 1-ha study plots. We defined the land condition scale relative to climate and comprehensive assessment of habitat attributes, and then described the relationships between land condition, habitat and biodiversity. The land condition scale partially explained richness and abundance patterns only for mammals (especially rodents), which tended to be higher in better-condition pasture. For other vertebrate groups, the scale was a very poor descriptor of richness and abundance. The land condition scale was not useful to assess wildlife diversity primarily because `woody thickening' (increases in woody vegetation on grazed land, including shrubs and trees) lowers the `grazing value' of land while also generally promoting vertebrate diversity. In line with this, biodiversity decreased with increasing bare ground and erosion, together with, and in the absence of, vegetation cover (i.e. desertification), consistent with grazing land degradation. The present study supports observations that land clearing and reductions in woody vegetation on grazed rangelands are particularly detrimental to native vertebrates.

AB  - The paper aims at providing a framework to calculate the agro-eco-compensation standard based on the systems agro-ecological concept of embodied energy as emergy. We have proposed a calculation system of eco-compensation standard for sustainable agricultural development based on the convertibility between emergy and price. According to our calculation, the total energy of agricultural production in Yongding River Basin was 3.45 E + 16 Sej/ ha (the unit emergy value, expressed in solar emergy joules per unit) in terms of the renewable resources, nonrenewable resources, material inputs, and service costs. The energy of renewable and nonrenewable resources was 1.59 E + 16 and 1.86E + 16 Sej/ ha, respectively. The ESI (environmental sustainability index) of the study area was 0.1056, indicating that its agricultural production was in a seriously unsustainable condition. To realize the sustainable agricultural production in the watershed, the downstream governments should pay $21.81 M ((sic)135 million) approximately to upstream governments for water and soil conservation. The results of the present study suggested that the emergy-based calculation method of agro-eco-compensation standard is feasible to a certain degree.

AB  - Reef-building eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, provide many ecosystem services, including production of valuable commercial products, formation of complex habitats, improved water quality and shoreline protection. Despite this, oyster populations have experienced dramatic declines throughout their range, spawning massive investment in management and restoration. Restoration efforts typically consider several well-studied metrics that normally influence oyster success; however, one potential factor that has not received much prior attention is submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). We conducted a series of field surveys and field experiments to explore the relationship between SGD and oysters in a marsh-lined tidal creek in Georgia, USA. SGD was mapped across multiple time points using a natural radon tracer (radon-222), and fluxes were paired with discrete measurements of oyster density, condition, size, recruitment and growth at multiple locations along the creek. Variation in oyster metrics was best explained by a combination of SGD, pH, and DO, which displayed a high degree of multicollinearity. We found an overall negative, nonlinear relationship between oyster density and groundwater flux. Interestingly, juvenile and adult condition and growth were not negatively impacted by groundwater. Rather, our results suggest that the likely mechanism for the density-flux relationship was inter-ruption of the larval recruitment, which was also negatively related to flux. We hypothesize that larval inter-ruption is due to the low dissolved oxygen and pH conditions of the groundwater at high flux sites. Overall, the interaction between SGD and oysters appears complex, and may be affected by other variables. This study provides evidence of a potential negative effect of a previously understudied natural phenomena on oyster de-mographics, and we suggest that SGD be considered in future management efforts.

AB  - This paper reports on a comparative perspective of liver histopathological data of the sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus. The data was collected from a spectrum of relatively un-impacted and isolated, to polluted, eutrophic freshwater ecosystems. Results were compared between regional areas, by combining data from freshwater systems which has a similar pollution status and/or is located within the same geographical region. Measurements included necropsy observations, semi-quantitative liver histopathology (Liver Index), and selected biometrical indices. The aim was to establish whether the results of these measurements would differ between, and/or reflect the pollution status of, the different freshwater aquatic ecosystems. The histopathological analysis showed a higher prevalence of toxicopathic non-neoplastic, and pre-neoplastic alterations in C. gariepinus from the polluted sites. We also found a significant difference between the Liver Index, hepatosomatic index, and condition factor values of fish inhabiting impoundments known to be polluted, compared to the same species from the selected reference sites. Fish from polluted sites also had more macroscopic liver abnormalities. The results suggest that the liver histopathology of this bio-indicator fish species could be a useful biomarker of freshwater aquatic pollution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Accidental releases of pollution can have severe environmental, societal, economic, and institutional consequences. This paper considers the use of risk mapping of accidental pollution events, and zonal prevention measures for alleviating the impact on large urban areas. An Environmental Pollution Accident Risk Mapping (EPARM) model is constructed according to a mapping index system supported by quantitative sub-models dedicated to evaluating the risk arising from different sources of potential accidental pollution. The EPARM approach consists of identifying suitable indexes, assessment of environmental risk at regional and national scales based on information on previous pollution accidents and the prevailing environmental and social conditions, and use of GIS to map the overall risk. A case study of pollution accidents in Minghang District, Shanghai, China is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. The paper also proposes a systemic framework for accidental environmental pollution risk prevention, and detailed countermeasures for specific risk zones.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive requires that the European Union countries determine the biological state of their waters with respect to sites of high quality. Although bioindicators have been widely applied in running waters and deep lakes throughout Europe, little is known about their applicability in shallow lakes and wetlands. The objective of this work is to check the effectiveness of epiphytic diatoms as indicators of the trophic state in two wetlands of Alava Province (N Spain). Diatom and water chemical samples were collected during summer and autumn 2007, following standard methodology. Stems of submerged macrophyte (Carex riparia, Iris psemlacorus, Veronica anagallis-aquatica) were sampled in each lake. Based on the number of statistically significant correlations between diatom indices and environmental factors, the SID index was show as the most suitable method to assess nutrients within these systems. SID was significantly correlated with TP, NTK and ammonium levels. Among three different plants, only the indices calculated from I. pseudacorus samples were significantly correlated with nutrients.

AB  - In the last decade, the question of the current disproportion of quality of life and economic progress of global proportions is often raised, in contemporary socio-economic and political-economic conditions. We are witnessing a constant tendency toward targeted well that can be seen through human, economic and environmental benefits. The first two dimensions are goals that imply the complete sustainability of social protection of people and the protection of the environment. They are in a strong correlation with each other, since they can not be regarded as separate goals, but mutually equal because they depend on each other. On the other hand, in order to achieve sustainability of economic well-being, it is necessary to include multidimensional aspects of innovation, which will provide tools, through which adjustments of policies to promote long-term growth of production and increase of productivity, ie decrease of unemployment rate, will be adapted. Therefore, as part of the globalization process, it is necessary to review the possibilities and capacities of efficient sustainability of people's quality of life and environmental protection, with constant and balanced economic prosperity, not only countries in transition, but all factors in the world economy.

AB  - In Tibetan and Thai linguistics, indexicals, Such as evidentials and personal pronouns have been largely studied in the domain of grammar, despite that they are closely tied with contexts. The social life of evidentials is not, in all cases, about marking the information source. They can be manipulated to will arguments, or simply to be polite. Personal pronouns do not always correlate with social categories. Speakers choose one form over another according to their interests and needs ill Situations at hand. Hence, all analysis to reveal the true nature of indexicals needs to account for "counter-examples to normative usage," and incorporate native speakers' judgments. It must be grounded ill a theory that allows dynamic synchrony and indeterminacy of meaning. This paper contributes to an understanding of these two indexicality systems that Constitute the essence of these Asian languages. It argues that the Buddhist principle of contingency, namely Nagarjuna's theory of change call explain the actual usage of these indexicals. According to Nagarjuna, the true condition of things is change, which Occurs at every moment in time. The theory paves the way for a more complete understanding of Thai and Tibetan and sheds light on how linguists should analyze indexicals. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Functionally graded materials (FGMs) have wide applications in different branches of engineering such as aerospace, mechanics, and biomechanics. Investigation of the mechanical behaviors of structures made of these materials has been performed widely using classical elasticity theories in micro/nano scale. In this research, static, dynamic and vibrational behaviors of functional micro and nanobeams were investigated using non-local theory. Governing linear equations of the problem were driven using non-local theory and solved using an analytical method for different boundary conditions. Effects of the axial load, the non-local parameter and the power index on the natural frequency of different boundary condition are assessed. Then, the obtained results were compared with those obtained from classical theory. These results showed that a non-local effect could greatly affect the behaviors of these beams, especially at nano scale.

AB  - Aquatic environments face a variety of threats in the Hondo River basin, Southeastern Yucatan Peninsula. Some of these impacts, like pollution by pesticides, may depend on land use and cover. Our objective was to assess the effect of land use/cover using a previously published index of biotic integrity (IBI), based on fishes and designed for shallow streams in the Hondo River basin. Our hypothesis was that land uses that cause deforestation and pollution, such as urbanization, cattle breeding, or sugar cane fields, would be reflected in low IBI values, at least at some spatial scales. The 23 sites originally used in 2008-2009 to estimate by electrofishing the relative abundance and other characteristics of selected fish species and guilds to construct the IBI, were revisited in February 2010, to validate by direct inspection the type of land use/cover suggested by landscape information in digital databases. We analyzed the effect of seven types of land use/cover (agriculture, pasture, human settlements, water bodies, wetlands, forest, and secondary vegetation) on the IBI values, at four spatial scales, i.e., the percent of every land use/cover at progressively larger circles (125, 250, 500, and 1 000 m diameter) centered on the water body where the IBI value was measured. Correlations were established among the percent land/use cover by scale around 23 sites, and with their corresponding IBI values. Then, Student's t tests were calculated to examine significant differences in land use/cover between groups of localities above and below the median IBI value, and Mann-Whitney's U tests were applied to compare IBI values between localities with and without a given landscape cover. Agriculture, human settlements, and secondary vegetation correlated negatively with the IBI; forests positively. Differences were significant (p<0.05) for forest (higher in sites with higher IBI values) and human settlements (lower in sites with higher IBI). Of all the landscape categories located in the Hondo River basin, with the exception of pasture, those of anthropogenic origin tended to be detrimental to aquatic biotic integrity.

AB  - The surf zone is a highly dynamic environment subject to seasonal fluctuations which could impose restrictions to the development of juvenile fish. The allometric condition factor index (K) provides a value of 'well-being' for fish, been used to compare populations under different environmental conditions. The aim of this study concerned on evaluate the effect of seasonality on surf-zone juvenile fish' K. Along two years the K values of the main fish species were analyzed. The temperature and abundance were also reported. We compared data between cold and hot seasons to test the effect of seasonality. A total of 955 individuals were collected, totaling 20 species. Despite the surf zone instability, most fish species showed a stable K regardless of season. We found that the condition factor in neritic Atherinella blackburni, Mugil brevirostris, Trachinotus carolinus and Trachinotus goodei did not vary. Only a demersal species, Menticirrhus littoralis, shown the lowest condition factor in the hot season, coinciding with maximum water temperature. We discussed how the surf zone provides conditions for the development of fish and reinforce the importance of this environment as a breeding site.

Drawing on hundreds of pages of narrative reports based on surveys, interviews, secondary data, and focus groups by trained Nepalese facilitators, the authors created systemic depictions of relationships between multiple stakeholder groups, ecosystem health, and human health. These were then combined to examine interactions among stakeholders, activities, concerns, perceived needs, and resource states (ecosystem health indicators). These qualitative models have provided useful heuristics for both community members and research scholars to understand the eco-social systems in which they live; many of the strategies developed by the communities and researchers to improve health intuitively drew on this systemic understanding. The diagrams enabled researchers and community participants to explicitly examine relationships and conflicts related to health and environmental issues in their community.

AB  - Assessing the ecological impacts of anthropogenic pressures is a key task in environmental management. Multimetric indices (MMIs), based on aquatic assemblage responses to anthropogenic pressures, have been used increasingly throughout the world. The MMI approach is a low-cost, rapid field method that produces an aquatic condition index that responds precisely to anthropogenic pressures, making it useful for conservation and environmental management. We developed four candidate MMIs based on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages sampled at 40 randomly selected sites to assess the environmental condition of streams upstream of a hydroelectric power plant in the Brazilian Neotropical Savanna biome. Those MMIs were built from landscape-adjusted and unadjusted biological metrics as well as two alternative ways of choosing metrics. The alternative MMIs performances were tested by comparing their precision to distinguish least-disturbed areas, responsiveness to discriminate least-and most-disturbed areas, and sensitivity to anthropogenic pressures at catchment and local scales. The best performing MMI had landscape-adjusted metrics and was produced through use of principal component analysis for metric selection. It included 4 metrics: Ephemeroptera richness, average tolerance score per taxon, percentage of predator individuals, and percentage of Odonata individuals adjusted by elevation. This index discriminated well the anthropogenic pressures at local-and catchment-scales, and at both scales simultaneously, as indicated by an integrated disturbance index. Our methodological development included statistical criteria for identifying least-and most-disturbed sites, calibrating for natural landscape variability, and use of non-redundant metrics. Therefore, we expect it will provide a model for environmental assessment of water resources elsewhere in Brazil and in other nations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite numerous studies on changes to optical proxies of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by biogeochemical processing, the applicability of commonly-used spectroscopic indices has not been explored as DOM source tracking tools under conditions where biogeochemical processes may alter them. For this study, two contrasting DOM end members, Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) and algogenic DOM (ADOM), and their mixtures, were used to examine the potential changes in the conservative mixing behaviors of several well-known optical indices via end member mixing analysis under the influence of biodegradation, UV irradiation, and clay mineral (kaolin) adsorption. Most of the source tracking indices exhibited large deviations from conservative mixing behavior between the two end-members. Biodegradation tended to lower the portions of labile and ADOM in the mixtures, while the allochthonous end member (SRFA) was reduced by a greater extent after the process of UV irradiation or adsorption. The extent of the variations in biological index (BIX) and fluorescence index (FI) was smaller for more allochthonous DOM mixtures under the processes of biodegradation and UV irradiation. Overall, the process-driven variations in ratios of humic-like: protein-like fluorescence (as modeled by parallel factor analysis, PARAFAC) were greater for the SRFA versus ADOM. Evaluation criteria used in this study suggested that BIX, specific UV absorbance (SUVA), and Fl each could be the reliable discrimination parameter least affected by biodegradation, UV irradiation, and adsorption, respectively. This study provided criterion information for the choice and the interpretation of the optical indices for DOM source discrimination in aquatic environments after substantial biogeochemical processing.

AB  - Ecuadorian paramo ecosystems (EPEs) function as water sources, contain large soil carbon stores and high levels of biodiversity, and support human populations. The EPEs are mainly herbaceous paramo (HP). To inform policy and management and help drive ecological science toward a better understanding of the HP ecosystem, and the relationships among its multiple ecosystem services, we asked: (1) What is the state of the HP regarding its land use/land cover (LULC)?; and (2) Is the HP being pushed away from its natural state or it is regenerating? To answer these questions, we assessed the LULC in central EPEs using Landsat 8 imagery, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and a Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm. Results show that two-fifths of the paramo ecosystem remain as native HP (NHP) and two-fifths as anthropogenic HP (AHP). Although the anthropic alteration of the pedogenesis of young paramo soil leads to the establishment of AHP, we found evidence of regeneration and resilience of the NHP. The results of this study will be useful to scientists and decision-makers with interest in paramo ecosystems in central Ecuador. The proposed methodology is simple, fast, and could be implemented in other landscapes to establish comprehensive monitoring systems useful in landscape assessment and planning.

AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the present ecological state of rivers and streams in the Buffelspoort Valley Conservancy (BVC), against which later potential changes in, and impacts on, water quality could be measured. After very brief training, all field work, including site selection and sample collection, was carried out by the members of the Conservancy. All samples collected by the members of the Conservancy were of an adequate quality for analysis and yielded meaningful results. This study demonstrates that there is great potential for the use of diatoms in community monitoring programmes, mainly due to the ease and rapidity with which samples can be collected. The participation of communities is also vital in gaining a more complete overview of the diatom species occurring in South Africa.

AB  - Brown Ring Disease (BRD) is a bacterial disease caused by the pathogen, Vibrio tapetis. The disease induces formation of a brown deposit on inner shell of the Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum. Development of this disease is correlated with a decrease in the condition index of infected clams. Experiments were conduced in order to assess the effect of the development of BRD on two parameters affecting the energy balance of the clams: the clearance and the respiration rates. Experiments were performed in a physiological measurement system that allowed simultaneous measures of clearance and respiration rates. During both acclimation and measurements clams were fed with cultured T-iso and temperature was close to seasonal field temperature (10 degrees C. Our results showed that severely diseased clams (conchiolin deposit stage, CDS >= 4) are subject to weight loss in comparison to uninfected ones, indicating that BRD induces a disequilibrium in the energy balance. We demonstrated a reduction of the clearance rate of severely diseased clams which led to a decrease in energy acquisition. Respiration rate showed a significant decrease with BRD symptoms, but evidence in the literature allowed us to hypothesize that energy mobilised for an immune response and lesion repair increases overall organism maintenance costs. Both factors should thus contribute to the degradation of the energy balance of diseased clams. Because effects of B RD on naturally infected clams only appears significant for CDs >= 4, when brown ring assumes a significant place on the inner shell, we consider that the Manila clam is tolerant of low disease levels.

AB  - In this review, we propose a new framework, dynamic disequilibrium of the carbon cycles, to assess future land carbon-sink dynamics. The framework recognizes internal ecosystem processes that drive the carbon cycle toward equilibrium, such as donor pool-dominated transfer; and external forces that create disequilibrium, such as disturbances and global change. Dynamic disequilibrium within one disturbance-recovery episode causes temporal changes in the carbon source and sink at yearly and decadal scales, but has no impacts on longer-term carbon sequestration unless disturbance regimes shift. Such shifts can result in long-term regional carbon loss or gain and be quantified by stochastic statistics for use in prognostic modeling. If the regime shifts result in ecosystem state changes in regions with large carbon reserves at risk, the global carbon cycle might be destabilized.

AB  - In 2008 a calcareous mound fen not listed in the state Natural Heritage Inventory was discovered in south-central Wisconsin. Air photo interpretations and interviews with land users indicated two distinct major historical alterations to this fen: (1) drainage tiling without widespread soil disturbance and (2) plowing with or without direct drainage. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination of survey plots revealed that an assemblage of calciphiles, fen indicators, and wetland generalists persisted in the mound's center, while invasive herbaceous and woody vegetation reached highest cover along the disturbed flanks. Cluster analyses revealed three distinct communities: (1) a fen meadow in the center of the fen, (2) invading shrub-carr in tiled areas, and (3) a weedy/invasive herbaceous community where soil disturbance was widespread. This study lends support to past assertions that drainage can lead to shrub-carr invasion and suggests that widespread soil disturbance can lead to domination by herbaceous invasive plants on fen flanks.

AB  - Objective evaluation of the state of the environment may be made on the basis of the parameters of human health. The cities of Kirovsk, Apatity, and the Lovozersky district stand out among the cities and districts of the Murmansk Region for the diseases of the musculoskeletal system and urolithiasis. The population of these areas uses water formed within the giant alkaline massifs - Khibiny and Lovozero, containing the oxides of strontium, thorium, barium and rare earths. The solution - crystalline substance system was studied with the help of physicochemical modeling using the Selector software package. Environmental conditions and physiological parameters of the human organism were taken into account. Natural drinking water, gastric juice, a mixture of drinking waters and gastric juice were considered as the solution, while the newly formed phases in equilibrium with solution were considered as the crystalline substance. The chemical forms of the migration of elements including uranium were studied, and the conditions of mineral phase precipitation in the system natural waters - gastric juice under the conditions of reduced and increased acidity were investigated. It was demonstrated that the forms of element migration (Ni2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, Sr2+) remain carcinogenic or toxic at the temperature and parameters existing in the stomach. The proposed approach opens new opportunities in environmental and medical-ecological studies.

AB  - The present contribution explores likely socio-cultural and institutional factors that better correlate with successful forest community management in Mexico. To this end, 8 Forest Agricultural Units of the Durango State and 8 of the Michoacan State were analyzed. In each unit, six socio-cultural driving variables were measured and five response variables derived from a land use cover change analysis between 1986 and 2000. A land cover dynamic index is proposed as a surrogate of the performance of the natural capital. Based on the natural capital dynamics index, both states are increasing their forest resources. Cluster and correlation analyses depicted forest management, institutional organization, degree of governance and economic development as the main underlying driving factors guiding successful forest community management. On the contrary, age of the agricultural unit, emigration, land parceling, loss of communal natural capital and age of forest plan management were highly correlated with processes decreasing their natural capital.

AB  - Teleoperation allows humans to reach environments that would otherwise be too difficult or dangerous. The distance between the human operator and remote robot introduces a number of issues that can negatively impact system performance including degraded and delayed information exchange between the robot and human. Some operation scenarios and environments can tolerate these degraded conditions, while others cannot. However, little work has been done to investigate how factors such as communication delay, automation, and environment characteristics interact to affect teleoperation system performance. This paper presents results from a user study analyzing the effects of teleoperation factors including communication delay, autonomous assistance, and environment layout on user performance. A mobile robot driving task is considered in which subjects drive a robot to a goal location around obstacles as quickly (minimize time) and safely (avoid collisions) as possible. An environment difficulty index (ID) is defined in the paper and is shown to be able to predict the average time it takes for the human to drive the robot to a goal location with different obstacle configurations. The ID is also shown to predict the path chosen by the human better than travel time along that path.

AB  - Quantifying relative habitat quality is an important means of ecosystem assessment, and an essential step in the development and validation of indices of biotic integrity (IBI). Variables included in multimetric IBIs are selected on the basis of their correlation with a human disturbance gradient, and the IBI is tested by examining correlation between IBI scores and rankings on the human disturbance gradient for an independent suite of sites. We present an objective approach to develop a disturbance gradient that ranks sites based on local-level measurements of physical and chemical stress; however, it could equally be applied to GIS-derived data. We measured 52 variables at three types of wetland in Alberta: reference wetlands, oil sands reclamation wetlands exposed to mine tailings, and reclamation wetlands free from tailings contamination. We used the data's correlation structure to select a sub-set of variables that minimized redundancy while retaining sensitivity and interpretability. The optimal sub-set included eight variables: chloride, cation and nitrogen content of water; water and oil content of sediment; water depth and amplitude and Secchi depth/total depth. We combined these eight environmental variables using different combinations of standardization (conversion to a common unit) and weighting schemes to produce six multi-metric stress indices. We evaluated the stress indices on their ability to discriminate among our three wetland types. The indices differed in their sensitivity to stress. Standardization had greater influence on index score than weighting. While all stress indices detected a difference among the three wetland types, only two were able to discriminate between the two classes of reclamation wetlands, both of which used percentile binning to standardize variables. The optimal stress index was standardized by percentile binning and weighted such that water quality, sediment chemistry, physical structure, and the level of tailings contamination were weighted equally. The approach we developed is repeatable and produced a sensitive index of wetland condition that is easily interpreted and relies minimally on best professional judgment. It may be suitable for measuring restoration success or the impact of any anthropogenic disturbance in a variety of ecosystem types. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It seems that the acceptance of retardation (slowing down) of both pace of life and transforming natural resources can play a positive role in building a sustainable reality. Building this new socio-economic order, in connection with the report on the state of ecosystem services in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, is both urgent and difficult, and requires new best practices to be created and used as a model.
   This paper shows examples of opportunities allowing for contemplating one's own place in the surrounding reality and a way to make progress creating it.

AB  - We surveyed benthic macroinvertebrate communities, water chemistry, and thermal regime in the Cheat River, WV, USA in an attempt to quantify the interactive effects of multiple stressors on ecological condition and identify priorities for restoration in this mined Appalachian watershed. We used a novel approach, which combined use of the West Virginia Stream Condition Index (WVSCI) to quantify ecological losses and community similarity analysis to assign specific levels of ecological loss to AMD, thermal effluent, and their interaction. Finally, we developed an ecological currency to quantify the relative benefits of a restoration program that focused either on AMD remediation or heat reduction and to identify spatially explicit restoration priorities. Variation in ecological condition was strongly correlated to variation in water quality when AMD and heat stress occurred in isolation. Acute inputs of AMD or heat caused predictable reductions in condition followed by rapid recovery downstream. However, benthic communities failed to recover from combined inputs of heat and AMD even when these stressors occurred at relatively low levels. Over the course of an entire year, AMD alone was over two times more responsible than heat alone for ecological loss. Consequently, AMD is the dominant factor limiting ecological condition and should be the primary target for restoration. Nevertheless, an AMD x heat interaction also was responsible for extensive ecological loss in lower reaches of the river. Consequently, full restoration of the lower Cheat River mainstem will require an approach that integrates AMD remediation with effective management of thermal effluent. Our results provide some of the first field evidence of the interactive effects of multiple stressors on biological communities in a mined watershed. This approach may be valuable for quantifying impacts from multiple interacting stressors and for prioritizing restoration efforts in other mined watersheds.

AB  - -Age structure and growth dynamics are examined for the black scorpionfish Scorpaena porcus Linnaeus, 1758, from three sites characterized by different levels of pollution: Kazach'ya, Alexandrovskaya, and Streletskaya bays. No substantial differences were found in age structures, which largely correspond to the natural state of the population; differences between the mean age in the least polluted Kazach'ya Bay and the most polluted Streletskaya Bay are not significant (p = 0.35). According to the indicators L-infinity, W-infinity, k of females, phi of females, and phi' of females, the black scorpionfish from the least polluted Kazach'ya Bay is characterized by a higher growth rate. However, nonsignificance of differences in the values of these parameters in comparison with the more polluted Streletskaya and Aleksandrovskaya bays does not allow an unambiguous conclusion to be made about the fish growth delay in the latter two.

AB  - Around 34 years ago, the first reports on the performance of triploid oysters were published. Since then, triploid oysters have offered many benefits to the oyster industry, such as faster growth, improved meat quality, partial sterility, and increased survival due to disease resistance. However, the extent of a triploid growth advantage, in particular, can vary across studies, measurement parameters, environmental conditions and husbandry practices. To quantitatively compare diploid and triploid oyster growth rates, a meta-analysis was performed with 29 published studies using triploid oysters produced by chemical induction or by crossing diploid and tetraploid oysters (i.e., "mated triploids"). The difference in growth rate between ploidy was evaluated using natural log transformed response ratios (ln [3n/2n]) in a random-effects model weighted by sample size. The positive response ratios in 126 of the 148 independent experiments showed a significant growth advantage of the triploid over the diploid. On average, mated triploids grew 20% faster than diploids in shell height and 49% faster in whole wet weight. While chemically induced triploids had marginally less growth advantage than mated triploids, growing on average 8% faster than diploids in shell height and 31% faster in whole wet weight. Response ratios for experiments using mated triploids and measuring whole wet weight was significantly affected by species and length of study, while response ratios for experiments using chemically induced triploids and measuring whole wet weight was significantly affected by initial size at deployment. Conversely, response ratios for experiments using mated triploids or chemically induced triploids and measuring shell height were not affected by any tested moderator. The lack of a triploid growth advantage in 15% of the experiments (22/148) could have been influenced by a variety of factors including intraspecific variation, differences in sampling, husbandry practices, and environmental conditions.

AB  - The composition of littoral macroinvertebrate communities in lakes is governed by multiple natural and anthropogenic environmental influences interacting at different spatial scales. Since ecological assessment methods using littoral macroinvertebrates should respond specifically to a single stressor, knowledge on the unique effects of a given stressor is necessary. To effectively disentangle the effects of hydromorphology and trophic state requires analysing macroinvertebrate communities at lake sites with the full range of both stressors. We used a dataset of 98 lakes encompassing the entire gradient of geographical locations, lake types, hydromorphological degradation and trophic states in Central European lakes. We studied the unique and joint effects of hydromorphology and trophic state on macroinvertebrate richness, community composition and the Littoral Invertebrate Multimetric Index based on Composite Sampling (LIMCO). Variation partitioning analyses were conducted to test the importance of hydromorphology relative to trophic state across and within hydromorphological states (natural shorelines, hard and soft shore modifications) and trophic states (oligotrophic to hypertrophic states). At natural, hard and soft modification sites, hydromorphology explained 10, 16 and 19%, respectively, of the average unique variation of diversity, community composition and the LIMCO index, whereas trophic state explained on average 2, 5 and 5%, respectively. Similarly, in low, medium and high trophic state lakes, hydromorphology explained 10, 15 and 7%, respectively, of the average unique variation of diversity, community composition and the LIMCO index, whereas trophic state explained on average 0.3, 3 and 6%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that littoral hydromorphology was a more important driver of macroinvertebrate diversity, community composition and LIMCO than trophic state across hydromorphological states and trophic states. This indicates that multiple stressors in lakes act hierarchically on littoral macroinvertebrate communities and that the hydromorphological degradation of littoral zones is the primary driver for altered communities.

AB  - Despite frequent use of length-based condition indices by fisheries managers and scientists to describe the overall well-being of fish, these indices are rarely evaluated to determine how well they correlate with more direct measures of physiological or ecological condition. We evaluated common condition indices (Fulton's condition factor K-F, Le Cren's condition index K-LC, and two methods of estimating relative weight W.) against more direct measures of physiological condition (energy density, percent lipid content, and percent dry mass) and ecological condition (prey availability) for lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis in Lake Huron. We developed four standard weight (W-s) equations using the regression length percentile (RLP) method: one for the species as a whole. and three separate equations describing immature, mature male, and mature female lake whitefish from 385 populations in North America. Species RLP-W-s showed less length-related bias and more closely matched empirical quartiles of lake-specific mean weight than did maturity- or sex-specific RLP-W-s equations. Significant length-related bias was detected in EmP-W-r. No biologically significant length-related bias was detected in K-LC, but this index was specific to a single population of fish. Species RLP-W-r showed no significant length-related bias, and K-F was significantly size dependent. All length-based condition indices were significantly correlated with energy density, percent lipid content, and percent dry mass. The index most strongly correlated with all three measures of physiological condition was K-F, likely because both the physiological measures and K-F exhibited positive relationships with body size. Across two Lake Huron sites, RLP-W-r was significantly correlated with density of prey (amphipods Diporeia spp.). Of the two condition indices developed in this study, RLP-W-r was consistently more strongly correlated with physiological condition indices than was EmP-W-r.

AB  - Nitrogen fertilizer recommendations for maize (Zea mays L.) should be adequate to ensure high yields but should be both economical and environmentally sound. Previous research developed algorithms using a digital camera to determine the dark green color index (DGCI) that predicted N recommendations from leaves of maize between V6 and V10. This study evaluated those algorithms by comparing them with recommendations from the University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service. There were no significant differences in yield between recommendations for N using the DGCI method between V6 and V10 and extension recommendations on fields with either low-or medium-residual N. The DGCI method averaged about 112 and 92 kg N ha(-1) less than extension recommendations in low residual N soils when 67 and 0 kg N ha(-1) was applied pre-plant, respectively. Future research should simplify the DGCI method for use in the field and evaluate DGCI method recommendations over a range of soils and environments.

AB  - The surf clam Mesodesma donacium is an economically important species for Chilean and Peruvian shellfisheries. This clam is often infested by Polydora bioccipitalis, a species belonging to the Spionidae, the most common parasitic polychaete group. To study this association, clams were sampled monthly over a one-year period in northern Chile. Collected clams covered the entire available size range and were classified into four infestation levels in order to study: (1) the relationship between prevalence of infestation (PI) and host size, (2) the temporal pattern of infestation events related to seasonal temperature changes, and (3) the relationship between infestation, body condition index (BCI) and gonado-somatic index (GSI). Additionally, growth rate and digging ability of clams with different infestation levels was studied. A logistic regression model best explained the relationship between PI and host size, with the smallest infested clam being 34 mm long and PI increasing steeply thereafter. Ontogenetic shifts in the habitat of the clam and ontogenetic changes, mainly in shell morphology, seem to explain the sigmoid pattern. Periods of increased shell blistering after infestation by R bioccipitalis showed a similar seasonal pattern with GSI and BCI of non-infested clams, suggesting either an association between infestation ability and low condition of the clam or common environmental triggers for those factors. Heavily infested clams showed a significant lower BCI, growth rate and digging ability; however, given its low number, they are unlikely to be significant in terms of the local population survival. However, the infestation could play a key role in explaining mass mortality of northern populations during El Nino events, given the latitudinal differences in PI and the fact that infestation ability could be enhanced by increased temperature and facilitated in stressed clams.

AB  - Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) has caused an endemic upper respiratory and ocular infection in the eastern house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) after the epidemic first described in 1994. The disease has been studied by a number of investigators at a population level and reports describe experimental infection in group-housed MG-free house finches. Because detailed observation and evaluation of individual birds in group housed passerines is problematic, we studied individually housed house finches that were experimentally inoculated with the finch strain of MG in a controlled environment. To accomplish this, a study was conducted spanning the period of November 2001-April 2002 with 20 MG-free (confirmed by the rapid plate agglutination assay and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] assay) eastern house finches captured in the Cayuga Basin area of central New York (USA) in the summer of 2001. After a period of accliniatization and observation (12 wk), 20 finches were inoculated with a 0.05-ml aliquot of MG (3.24X10(5) colony-forming units/ml) via bilateral conjunctival sac instillations. Two additional finches acted as controls and were inoculated in the same manner with preservative-free sterile saline solution. After inoculation, all finches except the controls exhibited clinical signs of conjunctivitis within 2-6 days. The progression of the disease was evaluated by several methods, including PCR, behavioral observations, and physical examination including eye scoring, body weight, and body condition index. Over a period of 21 wk, MG-infected finches developed signs of disease and recovered (80%), developed signs of disease and progressed to become chronically infected (15%), or died (5%). We hypothesize that the high survival rate and recovery of these finches after infection was associated with the use of controlled environmental conditions, acclimatization, a high plane of nutrition, and low stocking (housing) density, all of which are factors documented to be important in the outcome of MG infections in domestic poultry and other species.

AB  - Irregular boundary lines can be characterized by fractal dimension, which provides important information for spatial analysis of complex geographical phenomena such as cities. However, it is difficult to calculate fractal dimension of boundaries systematically when image data are limited. An approximation estimation formula of boundary dimension based on square is widely applied in urban and ecological studies. But the boundary dimension is sometimes overestimated. This paper is devoted to developing a series of practicable formulae for boundary dimension estimation using ideas from fractals. A number of regular figures are employed as reference shapes, from which the corresponding geometric measure relations are constructed; from these measure relations, two sets of fractal dimension estimation formulae are derived for describing fractal-like boundaries. Correspondingly, a group of shape indexes can be defined. A finding is that different formulae have different merits and spheres of application, and the second set of boundary dimensions is a function of the shape indexes. Under condition of data shortage, these formulae can be utilized to estimate boundary dimension values rapidly. Moreover, the relationships between boundary dimension and shape indexes are instructive to understand the association and differences between characteristic scales and scaling. The formulae may be useful for the prefractal studies in geography, geomorphology, ecology, landscape science, and especially, urban science.

AB  - This study assessed the impact of introduced black rats (Rattus rattus) on Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis) in a multi-invaded insular ecosystem where rats are mesopredators. We hypothesized that black rats should have little impact on Cory's shearwaters in the presence of cats as superpredators. Stomach contents and stable isotope analysis (SIA) in tissues of black rats were analyzed to assess the trophic ecology and the importance of Cory's shearwater in their diet. We also studied the isotopic signature in tissues of house mouse (Mus domesticus) to confirm previous data showing no predation of this species on Cory's shearwaters. For both rodent species, temporal variation in diet composition in response to the availability of seabird prey was evaluated, and short- and long-term consistency in diet was tested using different tissues from the same individual. For black rats a Bayesian isotope mixing model (SIAR) was applied to determine the relative contribution of each prey to the individual diet. SIA of mouse tissues varied between the Cory's shearwater breeding and non-breeding periods. However, no significant differences were found in diet and SIA for black rats. In contrast, individuals of both species showed a strong consistency in diet which apparently benefited their body condition index. Although black rats supplement their diet with Cory's shearwater eggs and chicks (8.3% in stomach contents and 10.6% in the SIAR model), their current impact on the Cory's shearwater population appears to be small, probably due to several factors including the small size of the rat population and a high level of rat predation by cats.

AB  - A large scale study of trace metal contamination (Hg, Cd, Pb and Ni) by means of caged mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis was undertaken along the coastal waters of the Western Mediterranean Sea within the context of the MYTILOS project. Individual mussels from an homogeneous population (shell size 50 +/- 5 mm) obtained from an aquaculture farm were consecutively caged and deployed at 123 sites located in the Alboran, North-Western, South-Western and Tyrrhenian sub-basins for 12 weeks (April-July) in 2004, 2005 and 2006. After cage recoveries, both the metal content in the whole mussel tissue and the allometric parameters were measured. Statistical analysis of the datasets showed significant differences in concentrations between sub-basins for some metals and mussel condition index (CI). Linear regression models coupled to the CI were revisited for the data adjustment of certain trace metals (Hg, Cd and Ni), and four level categories were statistically derived to facilitate interregional comparison. Seawater masses surrounding coastal areas impacted by run-off from land mineralised coasts and industrial activities displayed the highest concentration ranges (Hg: 0.15-0.31 mg kg(-1) dw; Cd: 1.97-2.11; Ni: 2.18-3.20 and Pb: 3.1-3.8), although the levels obtained in most of the sites fitted within moderate or low categories, and they could be considered as baseline concentrations. However, few sites considered little-influenced by human activities, at present, showed high concentrations of Cd, Ni and Pb, which constitute new areas of concern. Overall, the use of active biomonitoring (ABM) approach allowed to investigate trace metal contamination in order to support policy makers in establishing regional strategies (particularly, with regard to the European Marine Strategy Directive).

AB  - In order to study the effect of foliar micronutrients application on quantitative and qualitative characteristics of sunflower, an experiment was conducted in research field of Islamic Azad University, Varamin Branch in Iran during 2011 growing season. The experimental design was laid out in a randomized complete block in four replications. The factor in this study included foliar micronutrients application (Fe+Zn+Mn+B) in six levels (non-foliar application, foliar micronutrients application within emergence stage, pollination stage, initial maturity stage, maturity stage and all growth stages). The result showed that foliar micronutrient application increased plant height, cap diameter, seed number in cap, 1000-seed weight, seed yield, biological yield, harvest index, oil percentage and oil yield in all growth stages. The results obtained here suggest that foliar micronutrients application can improve the seed yield and seed quality of sunflower grown under irrigation condition.

AB  - The research was conducted in 2016-2020 at the National Research Center "Institute of Agriculture of the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine". The experimental plots were placed on the fields of selection crop rotation located in the KyivSviatoshynskyi district of the Kyiv region; the soils of the fields belong to the sod-medium-podzolic sandy loam. The years of research on the temperature regime generally exceeded the value of the average long-term norm, and the amount of precipitation was characterized as arid. According to the generally accepted technology for lupin and soybeans, experiments to determine the plasticity and stability of varieties were carried out on a single agronomic background. The area of the experimental plots was 20.0 m(2), repeated four times. Twelve varieties and selection numbers of white lupin and 15 soybean varieties of selection "NSC Institute of Agriculture of National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine" were analyzed according to the manifestation of seed yield. Field, measuring, weighing, and laboratory research methods were used to evaluate the material. The analysis of varieties and selection numbers of white lupin allowed dividing them into groups according to the level of yield and plasticity and determining the reaction to changes in environmental conditions, which must be taken into account when determining the location and cultivation technologies. It is established that precocious soybean varieties provide the highest and stable seed yields. Due to the short growing season, ultra-early varieties do not have time to provide high enough yields but are characterized by stable productivity, which allows them to be sown later as an insurance crop and used as a precursor for winter cereals. Medium-ripe varieties of soybeans often suffer from drought in the second half of summer, so high yields can be formed only with sufficient moisture during this period

AB  - The eastern panhandle region of West Virginia is entirely within the Appalachian Ridge and Valley ecoregion. It is underlain by limestone in the eastern part and by shale and sandstone in the western part. Agricultural and urban development has affected the condition of the streams of this region. We examined samples from 165 stations in the Ridge and Valley, collected from 1998 to 2004. Land use, geological characteristics, physical and chemical parameters, and algal and macroinvertebrate assemblages were used to identify potential stressors that affect streams in the region. Our analyses indicated that both human land uses and ecoregional differences led to elevated nutrient concentrations in streams of the study areas. Multiple regression analyses indicated that both agricultural and urban land use in the watershed were associated with high nutrient concentrations (NO2+3, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) in streams. These elevated nutrient concentrations have led to increased algal biomass, increased trophic state, and degradation of macroinvertebrate community in the streams. Values of the West Virginia Stream Condition Index, as well as several other benthic macroinvertebrate metrics, decreased with increased nutrient concentrations and conductivity, especially in the limestone region. When regional differences were partitioned out in the analysis, nutrient concentrations became the strongest stressor in the limestone region while conductivity exhibited less of an effect on macroinvertebrate metrics. Meanwhile, periphyton diagnostic metrics also responded to increased nutrient concentrations, suggesting nutrients could be a cause of biological degradation in the Eastern Ridge and Valley region. Multiple approaches and multiple lines of evidence (reference approach and stressor-response approach) were applied to develop nutrient benchmarks for different geological regions in the study watershed.

AB  - The northwest Atlantic leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) population is exhibiting decreasing trends along numerous nesting beaches. Since population health and viability are inherently linked, it is important to establish species- and life-stage class-specific blood analyte reference intervals (RIs) so that effects of future disturbances on organismal health can be better understood. For hatchling leatherbacks, the objectives of this study were to (1) establish RIs for morphometrics and blood analytes; (2) evaluate correlations between hatchling morphometrics, blood analytes, and hatching success; and (3) determine temporal trends in hatchling morphometrics and blood analytes across nesting season. Blood samples were collected from 176 naturally emerging leatherback hatchlings from 18 clutches. Reference intervals were established for morphometrics and blood analytes. Negative relationships were noted between hatchling mass and packed cell volume, total white blood cells, heterophils, lymphocytes, and total protein and between body condition index (BCI) and immature red blood cells (RBC), RBC polychromasia and anisocytosis, and total protein. Clutch deposition date showed positive relationships with lymphocytes and total protein, and negative relationships with hatchling mass and BCI. Hatching success was positively correlated with mass, and negatively with total protein and glucose, suggesting that nutritional provisions in eggs, incubation time, and/or metabolic rates could change later in the season and affect survivorship. These various observed correlations provide evidence for increased physiological stress (e.g., inflammation, subclinical dehydration) in hatchlings emerging later in nesting season, presumably due to increased nest temperatures or other environmental factors (e.g., moisture/rainfall). Data reported herein provide morphometric and blood analyte data for leatherback hatchlings and will allow for future investigations into spatiotemporal trends and responses to various stressors.

AB  - This study aimed to model and forecast the average daily concentration of inhalable particulate matter (PM10), in the Greater Vitoria Region (GVR), Espirito Santo, Brazil, using the SARIMAX model, for the period from January 1st, 2012 to April 30th, 2015. Data set from the State Environmental Institute was used. The Enseada do Sua station was chosen for purposes of prediction and forecasting. Some meteorological parameters (wind speed, relative humidity, rainfall and temperature) measured at the GVR were taken as explanatory variables of PM10 concentrations. Based on modelling performance indicators, it was verified the SARIMAX model (1.0.2) (0.1.1)(7) is the most accurate between the ones studied, purposing to predict and forecast the air quality in the GVR. The statistical performance of the SARIMAX model was better than the ARMA model, with regard to prediction of regular air quality events. Among the evaluated meteorological variables, wind speed and rainfall were significant and improved the model estimated. Regarding to air quality forecasting, the time series models showed satisfactory results.

AB  - Pseudoaciphophonis bimaculatus is an invasive species widely spread throughout freshwater ecosystems in central Mexico, for that reason we described its trophic strategy into a gradient of environmental quality. We sampled individuals of P. bimaculatus at eight sites located in the Lerma-Chapala and Panuco River Basins during dry season. These basins have been impacted by industrialization and urbanintion processes, but are considered as water reserves in Mexico. To evaluate the environmental quality of the river, we applied the Visual-based Habitat Assessment, the Index of Biological Integrity and the Family-level Biotic Index. We assessed the trophic guild, the diet width, the omnivory level, and the diet selectivity. We also explored the relation of trophic strategies with the habitat condition. We captured a total of 202 individuals of P. bimaculatus from 10 to 67 mm of SL, finding a total of 24 food items. The diet of P. bimaculatus was composed of terrestrial, aquatic insects and bony fish. Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus in some sites can feed on different trophic levels, in other it is a specialist and secondary consumer. We found that P. bimaculatus changes its diet according the alterations in the habitat structure, water quality, and biotic integrity. Moreover, this invasive species can endure changes in the trophic web and food availability.

AB  - Background: Salinity plays an important role in shaping coastal marine communities. Near-future climate predictions indicate that salinity will decrease in many shallow coastal areas due to increased precipitation; however, few studies have addressed this issue. The ability of ecosystems to cope with future changes will depend on species' capacities to acclimatise or adapt to new environmental conditions. Here, we investigated the effects of a strong salinity gradient (the Baltic Sea system - Baltic, Kattegat, Skagerrak) on plasticity and adaptations in the euryhaline barnacle Balanus improvisus. We used a common-garden approach, where multiple batches of newly settled barnacles from each of three different geographical areas along the Skagerrak-Baltic salinity gradient were exposed to corresponding native salinities (6, 15 and 30 PSU), and phenotypic traits including mortality, growth, shell strength, condition index and reproductive maturity were recorded.
   Results: We found that B. improvisus was highly euryhaline, but had highest growth and reproductive maturity at intermediate salinities. We also found that low salinity had negative effects on other fitness-related traits including initial growth and shell strength, although mortality was also lowest in low salinity. Overall, differences between populations in most measured traits were weak, indicating little local adaptation to salinity. Nonetheless, we observed some population-specific responses - notably that populations from high salinity grew stronger shells in their native salinity compared to the other populations, possibly indicating adaptation to differences in local predation pressure.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that B. improvisus is an example of a true brackish-water species, and that plastic responses are more likely than evolutionary tracking in coping with future changes in coastal salinity.

AB  - The present study quantified the agrarian quality and assessment of 16 sediment samples in two seasons from the identified three representative zones (North, Center and south) of Kol wetlands in Vembanad system, situated in the west coast of Kerala, India. Estimated the pollution quality indices (Enrichment Factor, Geoaccumulation index and Contamination Factor), sediment quality (Organic matter, texture and nutrients) and their ecological risk . Water Quality parameters (pH, salinity, DO) of the residing habit were also examined. The overall seasonal analyses of sediment trace metal's mean concentration of these three zones exhibited in the following order: Fe>Zn>Pb>Cr>Mn>Ni>Co>Cu>Cd. The nutrient quality parameters inferred high concentration with spatial disparity. The Enrichment factor of Co, Cr, Zn, Cu and Ni varies from moderate to severe; and the potential ecological index of Cd in the studied Kol sampling sites were likely to result in a dangerous situation in the near future. Water Quality of the surface water noticed a putrefied condition with negligible Dissolved Oxygen (DO) at Tholur (8) in the non monsoon season. While comparing the Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) and the recommended food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) standard values, the Cd, Zn and Cu concentration were exceeded the recommended limit. These scenario alter the ecological and environmental feasibility of the habitat including the sediment dwelling organisms. Multivariate statistics Analysis infers the anthropogenic and domestic source input of Cd, Ni, Mn, Co and Cu in the central basin and the correlation pattern with respect to Pb, Zn, Total Sulfur (TS), NO2-N and NH4+-N indicates an agriculture input. Among these three distinct zones the cluster results shows that the central agriculture sites confronts elevated trace metal concentration. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous research has linked racial residential segregation to a number of poor health outcomes. Yet, the mechanisms that could account for this association remain poorly understood and have seldom been empirically tested in the literature. In an analysis of the Houston area, we test one potential mechanism-perceived neighborhood conditions, as measured by two indices for neighborhood disorder and environmental quality. Using individual-level health data from a survey of Houston residents and neighborhood-level sociodemographic data from the U.S. Census, we estimate a series of multilevel models. We find that black and Latino segregation are linked to the perceived neighborhood disorder index, but no such relationship for the environmental quality index. Moreover, we find that both indices are related to poor self-rated health in that residents who evaluate their neighborhood conditions negatively are more likely to evaluate their health as poor. We also find a direct effect of black and Latino segregation on poor self-rated health, and that perceived neighborhood disorder partially mediates this relationship. We do not find a mediation effect for environmental quality. The results suggest that in order to improve the health of these communities, both residential segregation and neighborhood conditions need to be addressed.

AB  - The northeastern United States once had a robust and profitable wild bay scallop Argopecten irradians commercial fishery that generated revenue for fishermen and quality seafood for regional consumption. Since the 1980s, bay scallop landings have been declining due to overfishing, habitat loss, and coastal water quality degradation. There is potential for bay scallop aquaculture to fill the void left by the decline of the wild fishery. However, further investigation into optimizing growth and survival in the nursery, grow-out, and overwintering phases is needed. Growth and survival as related to stocking density were investigated during the nursery phase using a floating downweller system. Over the 6-week nursery period, survival, growth, and food availability were documented in relation to flow rates and initial stocking densities. Initial bay scallop stocking density largely predicted mean bay scallop growth rates (mm/d) over the 6-week observation period but had little impact on survival. At the end of the observation period, bay scallops were moved out of the nursery system to three different grow-out locations on Cape Cod. At each location, bay scallops were stocked into three surface gear types (floating bags of two different mesh sizes [6 or 9 mm] or hanging trays) and bottom cages to investigate grow-out phase strategies. In exposed, high-energy environments, the surface gear was susceptible to damage, and bay scallop growth rates and survival were impacted. In low-energy environments, growth rates and survival were similar between surface and bottom gear. In both low- and high-energy environments, bay scallop growth rates (mm/d) declined significantly once temperatures dropped below 15 degrees C. Observed growth rates and survival in the configurations examined in this study indicate that bay scallop farming on New England shellfish farms is viable.

AB  - Little is known about the nutrition or lipid metabolism of cold-water crabs, particularly in the North Pacific. We undertook a 2-part study to understand more completely the energetics and nutritional requirements of juvenile red king crab (RKC; Paralithodes canusehaticus). First, we investigated changes in proximate composition, total lipids (TLs), lipid classes, and fatty acids (FAs) throughout a molt cycle (C4-C5). Trends in lipid parameters were described by a 3-pari, piecewise linear regression with 3 distinct stages: (I) a postmolt phase (similar to 0-7 days), (2) an intramolt stage (similar to 7-24 days), and (3) a premolt stage (similar to 24-33 days). Significant intramolt differences in TLs indicated that caution should be taken when comparing crabs of unknown molt stage in future aquaculture and ecological experiments. However, little variability was found in the proportional FA composition of crabs, indicating that the intramolt stage has little effect on the interpretation of FA biomarkers. During a second investigation, we examined differences in lipid classes and FAs from cultured and wild RKC. We found significantly higher proportions of the essential fatty acids (EFAs) 20:5n-3 (EPA) and 20:4n-6 (AA) in wild crabs compared with cultured animals at the same stage. Furthermore, higher proportions of bacterial markers and lower proportions of zooplankton FA markers were found in wild than in hatchery-reared crabs. Here, we provide the first baseline data for future dietary studies on juvenile cold-water crabs. We suggest that an initial EFA ratio for DHA:EPA:AA of 5:8:1 could be used as a starting point for controlled dietary studies on the effect of EFAs on juvenile growth, molt success, and survival.

AB  - The paper analyses the environment pollution state in different case studies of economic activities (i.e. co-generation electric and thermal power production, iron profile manufacturing, cement processing, waste landfilling, and wood furniture manufacturing), evaluating mainly the environmental cumulative impacts (e.g. cumulative impact against the health of the environment and different life forms).
   The status of the environment (air, water resources, soil, and noise) is analysed with respect to discharges such as gaseous discharges in the air, final effluents discharged in natural receiving basins or sewerage system, and discharges onto the soil together with the principal pollutants expressed by different environmental indicators corresponding to each specific productive activity. The alternative methodology of global pollution index (I (GP) (*) ) for quantification of environmental impacts is applied.
   Environmental data analysis permits the identification of potential impact, prediction of significant impact, and evaluation of cumulative impact on a commensurate scale by evaluation scores (ESi) for discharge quality, and global effect to the environment pollution state by calculation of the global pollution index (I (GP) (*) ).
   The I (GP) (*) values for each productive unit (i.e. 1.664-2.414) correspond to an 'environment modified by industrial/economic activity within admissible limits, having potential of generating discomfort effects'. The evaluation results are significant in view of future development of each productive unit and sustain the economic production in terms of environment protection with respect to a preventive environment protection scheme and continuous measures of pollution control.

AB  - Daily exposure under solar ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) is prone to cause skin cancer and photoaging. Real-time monitoring of the environmental UV index and IR radiation temperature during outdoor activities can enhance awareness and strengthen personal protection. It is a challenge to design flexible, wearable devices (with measurement capabilities) that can be integrated with apparels. Here, microfluidic spinning technology (MST) was used for the continuous and large-scale fabrication of eco-friendly coresheath Janus fibers with a well-defined axially symmetric Janus core. One side of the core was sensitive to UV light and the opposite was sensitive to IR radiation. Textiles woven with Janus fibers showed excellent independent reversible color responses to dual-wavelength stimulation. Such textiles switched among four colors under UV and IR irradiation, both individually and in combination. The color gradient of the textiles changed significantly with increasing UV intensity (UV index). After 60 cycles of UV/IR stimulation and 50 washes, the change rate of the comprehensive chromatic aberration (Delta E*(ab)) of the textiles under different conditions was only 0.42%-4.71%. This was attributed to the unique structure of the fibers. The three-line striped textiles demonstrated the potential of the fibers to be used as wearable energy-free real-time visual monitors of the UV index and IR radiation temperature.

AB  - We related temporal variation in the environment to demographic parameters and body condition of ringed seals (Phoca hispida) in Hudson Bay, near the southern limit of the species' geographic range. Ringed seals harvested by Inuit hunters for subsistence purposes in Arviat, Nunavut, Canada, from 1991 to 2006 were measured and sampled. Ringed seal ovulation rate did not change over time, but pregnancy rate and percent pups in the fall harvest increased in the 2000s, compared to the 1990s. Ringed seals grew faster and attained sexual maturity earlier in life, and the population age structure shifted to younger age classes in the 2000s compared to the 1990s. Ringed seal demographic parameters were characteristic of a population in decline in the 1990s and a growing population in the 2000s. A quadratic polynomial regression best described the relationship between percent pups in the harvest and snow depth, and between pup and adult female body condition index and date of spring breakup, suggesting that ringed seals have evolved to do best within a relatively limited range of environmental conditions. We propose that the decline of ringed seal reproductive parameters and pup survival in the 1990s could have been triggered by unusually cold winters and heavy ice conditions that prevailed in Hudson Bay in the early 1990s, through nutritional stress and increased predation pressure. The recovery in the 2000s may have been augmented by immigration of pups, juveniles, and young adult ringed seals into the study area. We discuss the possibility of a decadal-scale biological cycle that reflects fluctuations in climatic variables, and particularly in the sea ice regime.

AB  - This paper provides a medical-environmental and biogeographical assessment of potential natural hazards in the Ile-Balkhash State Nature Reserve (Republic of Kazakhstan) with consideration of the tourism activities planned there. The exposure factors were analyzed for allergenic and poisonous plants and natural disease foci. The medical-geographical risks are caused by the existence of five natural foci of nosological entities in the reserve, among which tularemia and brucellosis have high morbidity levels in the region. The mammals inhabiting the reserve act as carries of natural-focal diseases, and a large number of poisonous and allergenically active plants grow there. This indicates that the presence of the corresponding risks require regular medical and environmental monitoring. The presented methodological scheme used to assess natural hazards may also be applied to other arid areas and regions.

AB  - Environmental indicator systems aim to improve both the information and communication on the state of the environment and the environmental policy making. They have to fulfill scientific, functional and pragmatic requirements, e.g., consideration of ecological context, transparency and reproducibility, comprehensibility, policy relevance, international comparability, and justifiable expenditure. This paper analyzes the experiences made with the development of the German environmental indicator system and draws general conclusions toward further improvements. For Germany, an indicator system has been developed that uses the pressure-state-response approach proposed by the OECD, together with a classification in 14 environmental themes. According to the general requirements, the main criteria used for selecting the indicators are the ecological significance of the indicator, its quantifiability and data availability, and its comprehensibility and policy relevance. Altogether, about 140 indicators are selected. This high number stresses the need for further high-level aggregation, e.g., using methods developed for the valuation process in LCA. Further improvement is also needed, especially for the development of response indicators and in the area of data systematization.

AB  - Ocean acidification and warming (OAW) pose a threat to marine organisms, with particular negative effects on molluscs, and can jeopardize the provision of associated ecosystem services. As predation is an important factor shaping populations in the marine environment, the ability of organisms to retain traits valuable in predation resistance under OAW may be decisive for future population maintenance. We examine how exposure to seawater temperature (control: 16.8 degrees C and warm: 20 degrees C) and atmospheric pCO(2) (ambient [similar to 400], similar to 750, and similar to 1000 ppm) conditions affects traits linked to predation resistance (adductor muscle strength and shell strength) in two ecologically and economically important species of oysters (Magallana gigas and Ostrea edulis) and relate them to changes in morphometry and fitness (condition index, muscle and shell metrics). We show that O. edulis remained unimpacted following exposure to OAW scenarios. In contrast, the adductor muscle of M. gigas was 52% stronger under elevated temperature and similar to 750 ppm pCO(2), and its shell was 44% weaker under combined elevated temperature and similar to 1000 ppm pCO(2). This suggests greater resistance to mechanical predation toward the mid-21st century, but greater susceptibility toward the end of the century. For both species, individuals with more somatic tissue held an ecological advantage against predators; consequently, smaller oysters may be favoured by predators under OAW. By affecting fitness and predation resistance, OAW may be expected to induce shifts in predator-prey interactions and reshape assemblage structure due to species and size selection, which may consequently modify oyster reef functioning. This could in turn have implications for the provision of associated ecosystem services.

AB  - Life-history strategies vary dramatically between the sexes, which may drive divergence in sex-specific senescence and mortality rates. Telomeres are tandem nucleotide repeats that protect the ends of chromosomes from erosion during cell division. Telomeres have been implicated in senescence and mortality because they tend to shorten with stress, growth and age. We investigated age-specific telomere length in female and male red-sided garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis. We hypothesized that age-specific telomere length would differ between males and females given their divergent reproductive strategies. Male garter snakes emerge from hibernation with high levels of corticosterone, which facilitates energy mobilization to fuel mate-searching, courtship and mating behaviours during a two to four week aphagous breeding period at the den site. Conversely, females remain at the dens for only about 4 days and seem to invest more energy in growth and cellular maintenance, as they usually reproduce biennially. As male investment in reproduction involves a yearly bout of physiologically stressful activities, while females prioritize self-maintenance, we predicted male snakes would experience more age-specific telomere loss than females. We investigated this prediction using skeletochronology to determine the ages of individuals and qPCR to determine telomere length in a cross-sectional study. For both sexes, telomere length was positively related to body condition. Telomere length decreased with age in male garter snakes, but remained stable in female snakes. There was no correlation between telomere length and growth in either sex, suggesting that our results are a consequence of divergent selection on life histories of males and females. Different selection on the sexes may be the physiological consequence of the sexual dimorphism and mating system dynamics displayed by this species.

AB  - It is often purported that unusually dry weather conditions provoke small-scale social conflict riots by intensifying the competition for water. The present paper explores this hypothesis, using data from Sub-Saharan Africa. We rely on monthly data at the cell level (0.5 x 0.5 degrees), an approach that is tailored to the short-lived and local nature of the phenomenon. Using a drought index to proxy for weather shocks, we find that a one-standard-deviation fall in the index (signaling drier conditions) raises the likelihood of riots in a given cell and month by 8.3%. We further observe that the effect of unusually dry weather conditions is substantially larger in cells with a lower availability of water resources (such as rivers and lakes), a finding that supports the significance of the competition-for-water mechanism.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to compare the influence of a five-month finishing period in a sea or in the lagoon site on quality changes during chilled storage of Pacific cupped oysters (C gigas), farmed in the lagoon. The oysters were analysed for morphological and chemical characteristics, and for parameters useful to monitor changes during shelf life (intervalvar liquid content, colour, volatile organic compound profile, pH and microbiological load) on 1st, 3rd, 7th and 10th days of refrigerated storage at 4 degrees C. Oysters finished in the lagoon showed a higher incidence of soft part and higher condition indexes, even though oysters finished in the sea had larger biometric dimensions. Lagoon-finished oysters had edible part richer in total lipids (11.82 vs 9.34%) with lower percentages of PUFAn-6 and C20:5n-3, whereas C22:6n-3 percentages were similar. From sensory analysis, sea-finished oysters were judged saltier and more bitter, whereas lagoon-finished oysters kept better during refrigerated storage, presenting more stable pH values, higher retention of intervalvar liquor and a moderate capacity to control bacterial proliferation during 10 days of refrigerated storage. The profile of volatiles was the same in both groups of oysters, but the amounts of each volatile tended to be significantly higher in lagoon-finished oysters. The finishing period in the sea induced a decrease in quality of all market and sensory characteristics and poorer storage performance. The better nutritional status of lagoon-finished oysters at harvest, the better trophic conditions of lagoon finishing and the better adaptation of the molluscs to a wide range of fluctuations in environmental parameters were presumably linked to their greater ability to withstand hypoxia during out-of-water refrigerated storage.

AB  - Lipids are central for energy metabolism and their fate in bivalves is closely linked to environmental conditions and gametogenic cycle. In order to assess the pollution impact on lipid metabolism of bivalves, storage and structure lipids from samples of Scrobicularia plana were studied. These samples were collected during sexual maturity both from estuaries considered contaminated (Goyen and Blavet) and from a reference site (Bay of St Brieuc) for comparison. Lipids were extracted from the gonads and the digestive glands and further separated by column chromatography. Fatty acids and sterols were then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Correlations were shown between dioxin-like compounds (Eq-TCDD) and triacyglycerol levels (TAG). In the same way, glycolipids and contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and pollutants with estrogenic activity seem to be closely related. In a second time, lipid indices (ratio between storage and structure lipids) were evaluated. Whereas these indices are often used in fish to assess habitat quality with regards to differential anthropogenic pressure, the ratio TAG/sterols was not here significantly influenced by the site of origin of S. piano. Intersite fluctuations of the ratio TAG/phospholipids also remained very limited. This could be explained by the limited contamination level in studied sites but also by a contrasted response from organisms in different taxa (bivalves vs. fish). Environmental pollution is not the only factor able to induce changes in lipid classes. The trophic wealth seemed to be different between the reference site and contaminated estuaries, the total organic carbon content being higher in muddy estuarine sediments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this paper modal analysis is performed on a symmetric aluminum beam which is coated with functionally graded material containing porosities. A polynomial function is used to vary the density and elasticity through the thickness of the coating, while the effective elastic modulus and density are found with classical lamination theory. To achieve a truthful modeling the gradually changing mechanical properties of the coating are modeled as 25 layers of material, while each individual layer is isotropic and homogeneous. MATLAB is used to write a finite element code and Timoshenko beam elements are used to include shear deformation effects. To show the influences of crack location, crack depth, porosity and the polynomial function index on the natural beam frequencies a parametric study is conducted. Multiple boundary conditions were also considered and it was found that the natural frequency values were significantly affected by the studied parameters.

AB  - Mutualism, as one of the main types of symbiosis, refers to the reciprocal relationship among rural settlements on the basis of material and information interactions and capitalizing on the environments where they are located in. The relationship among rural settlements has long been neglected in the process of rural settlement restructuring. To explore the possibility of integrating mutualism into rural settlement restructuring, an environmental index (El) was defined to comprehensively evaluate the exterior conditions of rural settlements at a patch level, and two hypotheses were proposed. The first hypothesis postulates that mutualism exists in aggregation area of rural settlement patches with high El values. The second one suggests that mutualism is present in areas where there are interactions among all the participant settlement patches. Hotspot analysis and component analysis were conducted respectively to obtain mutualistic areas based on the two hypotheses. In the case study of Huangpi, real mutualism was defined based on utilizing people flow data from questionnaire investigation in three towns, and crosstabs analysis and chi-square test were conducted between real mutualism and assumed mutualism developed from the two hypotheses. As results, the second hypothesis was verified. 26 mutualistic areas of Huangpi were identified, and 42 rural settlement patches with a total area of 12.51 ha were decided as relocation settlements. Considering the effects of urban land, serving areas of urban land were derived from accessibility analysis. Intersection of serving areas of urban land and mutualistic areas of rural settlement patches were set to be the prior restructuring direction within a town. Otherwise, two restructuring directions were suggested, including serving areas of urban land oriented and mutualism of rural settlement patches oriented directions. This study contributes to understanding the mutualism among rural settlement patches, and also offers a new perspective to rural settlement restructuring.

AB  - Biomarkers have the potential to be used to assess the impact of anthropogenic discharges in marine waters. We have used a suite of biomarkers spanning from enzymatic to histopathological alterations and general stress responses to assess the short- and long-term impact on mussels Mytilus edulis of heavy fuel oil no. 6 and styrene. Mussels were exposed for 5 months, with a refilling of the exposure system, to a water soluble fraction of heavy fuel and, then, kept for a month in clean water for recovery. In a second experiment, mussels were exposed to styrene for 19 days and maintained in clean water for up to 4 months. Chemical body tissue levels reflected the weathering processes of these compounds. Acyl-CoA oxidase activity was induced in oil-exposed mussels after refilling, whereas styrene inhibited it after 19 days of exposure and after 2 weeks in clean water. Gamete development and alkali-labile phosphate levels suggest that neither oil nor styrene behaved as endocrine disruptors. Neutral red retention time was lower in treated groups than in controls. Lysosomal membrane stability was significantly reduced in exposed groups and recovered after withdrawal of oil but not after removal of styrene. Neither oil nor styrene exposure affected the condition index except for the reduction seen in mussels exposed to oil for 1 month. Biomarker response index discriminated exposed mussels, which showed higher values, and returned to control levels after recovery. Results obtained from these pilot experiments can help to identify relevant monitoring tools to assess the impact of oil and chemicals in marine spill scenarios.

AB  - Androgen disrupting chemicals (ADCs) are widespread in the aquatic environment, where they may pose a risk to aquatic organisms during critical periods of development. In this study, static renewal 96-h toxicity tests were followed over a 3-month growth period to investigate the endocrine disrupting effects of the androgen 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), and the antiandrogen flutamide (FLU) on 1-week-old Qurt strain medaka larvae. The measured endpoints included: survival, growth performance (i.e., body weight, body length, condition index), and histopathology. There was no significant acute mortality, except for males treated with the highest FLU concentration (96 h-LC50 = 1.92 mg/l). Gender-specific effects in growth were identified after 11-KT and FLU treatments. Histopathological alterations including thyroid follicular hypertrophy (TFH), germ cell necrosis (GCN), ovarian atresia (OA), and testis-ova (TO) were observed in medaka at 90-day post-exposure. We observed TFH in all 11-KT treatment levels. The incidence of TFH in males was double that in females 11-KT or FLU treatment. Females showed GCN at lower 11-KT concentrations (0.01, 0.1 mg/l) than males (1.0 mg/l). Severe OA was observed at low (0.01 mg/l) and high (1.0 mg/l) 11-KT concentrations in females. Flutamide induced TO (0.32, 1.0 mg/l), ovarian cell necrosis (0.32 mg/l), and disrupted spermatogenesis (3.2 mg/l) in males. The lowest observed effective concentration (LOEC) for TO induction in Qurt medaka males was 0.32 mg/l. The present study underscores the importance of fish early life stage tests for detecting the interaction of ADCs with the reproductive and thyroid glands in both genders. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to introduce both the concept of fuzzy extension of a classical function for modelling imprecise relations between variables and the basic arithmetic operations which this entails.
   The concept of fuzzy extension can be considered as a generalisation of the concept of classical function extended to the field of the fuzzy sets defined in R. The fuzzy extension (f) over bar of a classical continuous function f(x) is a particular kind of fuzzy relation, which describes the correspondence between two variables x and y. The univocal image of each value of x through (f) over bar is a closed interval of y values [f(l)(x),f(u)(x)]. Functions f(l)(x) and f(u)(x) set the limits of the y interval whose extent of correspondence to x is nonzero, being zero for all y : y <= f(l)(x) and for all y : y >= f(u)(x) and they fulfill the condition that for all x is an element of f(l)(x) <= f (x) <= f(u)(x). A fuzzy extension f is defined by its membership function mu((f) over bar)(x,y), which quantifies the extent to which each value of the y variable corresponds to each value of x. The image (y) over bar of each fuzzy set (x) over bar is achieved by means of the composition rule of (f) over bar. In order to perform arithmetic operations with fuzzy extensions, the following basic operations are defined: the addition (a) over bar, subtraction (s) over bar, multiplication (m) over bar and division (d) over bar of two fuzzy extensions. The concept of fuzzy extension of a classical function, the procedure to specify and model mu((f) over bar)(x,y) the procedure to determine the image (y) over bar and the arithmetic operations are graphically illustrated and properly exemplified.
   A fuzzy extension (f) over bar defined in this way is a useful alternative to the set of fuzzy rules or knowledge base for modelling inherently imprecise relations, which are frequently described in a simplified manner by means of classical functions. For this reason, fuzzy extensions can be applied to a number of different fields, being particularly suitable for environmental assessments, such as the design and evaluation of environmental quality indexes and the environmental impact assessments, among others.

AB  - Maternal reproductive characteristics can play an influential role in fisheries by affecting offspring traits that can persist to influence year-class formation. We evaluated maternal characteristics of common carp (Cyprinus carpio), a widespread invader that can degrade aquatic ecosystems, to determine the variability of fecundity, egg size and egg energy density. Common carp fecundity increased with female size but was lower than identified in previously published reports. Female length, age, condition, and gonadosomatic index were positively correlated with ovary weight, fecundity, and egg volume, but not egg energy density. Additionally, fecundity was positively correlated with ovary weight and egg volume, but not energy density. Thus, larger and older females in better condition produce more and larger eggs compared to females that are smaller, younger, and in lower condition. These results have implications for understanding common carp reproduction, recruitment dynamics, and management of this species throughout its range.

AB  - Basic diagrams of the cyclic crack growth resistance of two of the most investigated titanium alloys, namely Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn. are presented. Diagrams are plotted for, in-air, distilled water and 3.5% NaCl solution, which are necessary for lifetime calculations of structural elements made of these metals. The dependency of cyclic crack growth resistance on the yield strength is established. It is shown that cyclic crack growth resistance of titanium alloys in corrosive environments is determined not only by the stress-strain state but also by the electrochemical conditions at the corrosion fatigue crack tip, which for aqueous environments can be characterized integrally by the hydrogen index of the environment and the electrode potential of the metal. Therefore, cyclic corrosion crack growth resistance testing should be performed under constant electrochemical conditions at the corrosion fatigue crack tip or these conditions should be taken into account. A new method of plotting the basic cyclic corrosion crack growth resistance diagrams of titanium alloys is considered.

AB  - A novel procedure to determine the environmental quality of boilers based on the combustion entropy degradation, the pollutants emission and the device efficiency is proposed. The entropy generation due to the chemical reaction was determined and then the irreversibilities on the external environment were first quantified. Successively, the entropy generation numbers of the combustion reactions were combined with the heat transfer process entropy generation of the boilers to consider the actual functioning conditions, in order to quantify the environmental damages by introducing an Environment Quality Index (EQI). A parametric study varying the heat exchanger efficiency, fluid flow rates and temperatures, for different fuel typologies, was performed to assess the environmental impact. Solar hydrogen was considered for its importance as future renewable energy carrier. The results showed that the highest EQI was produced by the natural gas, but if heat exchanger parameters are defined opportunely, the score gap with other fluids can be recovered. For hydrogen and coal decreasing the flue gases temperature or by increasing the flue gases mass flow rate can strongly improve the EQI index, whereas the gap recovery for Diesel is rather difficult.

AB  - In this study, the potential ecological risks and eco-toxicity of heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cd, Cr, As and Hg) in sewage sludge were quantitatively evaluated. Sewage sludge samples were collected from three wastewater treatment plants in Wuxi city during five years from 2009 to 2013. The levels of the eight metals temporally varied. The contents of Zn and Cu in the tested sewage sludge were the highest, followed by Cr, Ni, Pb and As, and the contents of Cd and Hg were the least. The Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction results showed that Zn, Ni and Cd had the highest mobilisation potential, while Cu, Pb, Cr and Hg were not stabilised and would release to the environment under oxidising conditions. The removal efficiency of Cu and Cr was higher than 70%, while that of As, Cd and Hg was less than other heavy metals. The overall potential ecological risk index (RI) of heavy metals in sewage sludge was 1376.34, revealing very high risk. However, the environmental risk values based on the index of geo-accumulation (I-geo) and risk assessment code (RAC) were both low. Cd contamination is the major concern while the treated sewage sludge is used for agricultural purposes.

AB  - Reference benchmarks are needed to assess the contemporary status of rivers and to establish restoration targets. We developed predictive models to estimate site-specific reference values for a macroinvertebrate community index (MCI), which is used to indicate a range of human impacts on wadeable streams. We compared three statistical modelling approaches - general linear, boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF) - and tested the effect of spatial scale on predictive accuracy by developing national and regional BRT models. Using fitted flexible models (BRT, RF) and resetting predictors to reflect natural state provided the most accurate predictions of reference condition. Variation in reference MCI predictions from national and regional models was within the range observed from methodological and temporal variability. The proportion of native vegetation in upstream catchments was the primary predictor of MCI scores in all models, while secondary predictors varied regionally.

AB  - This paper discusses some conceptual fundamentals for the derivation of environmental indicator sets. On the one hand, it defines requirements from environmental politics, environmental management and legislation, reaching from political target hierarchies and sustainable management strategies to holistic protection concepts such as process protection, resource preservation, ecosystem health and ecological integrity. On the other hand, demands from ecosystem theory are described which include the consideration of features such as self-organization, emergence, thermodynamics, gradients and ecological orientors in environmental indicator sets. From that concept, collective and emergent properties are selected and eight holistic ecosystem features are presented that indicate the ecosystemic state as an ensemble. These general indicators of ecosystem integrity are supplemented by variables on structural changes and substance dynamics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present investigation was conducted with the objectives of determining the quality of the water, categorizing health conditions and the socioeconomic profile of the inhabitants of the Village Balsa en Medio, Julian and Severino of the micro-basin of the Carrizal River. The samples were taken from stored water, determining at the sight: pH, temperature, electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen; and in the laboratory total solids, nitrates, phosphorus, BOD and fecal coliforms, with values interpreted according to the Environmental Quality Index. For the quantification of the variables related to the unsatisfied basic needs, a survey was applied; on the other hand, for the socioeconomic diagnosis such as health, information was obtained from the Censuses of the National Institute of Statistics, Registries in Infocenters and Health Centers. According to the quality index, the waters of Balsa en Medio and Julian are little polluted, whiles of Severino are contaminated. In 28% of cases, families consume boiled water, without chlorination, while 72% consume it directly from the river. In 2016 amoebic dysentery, shigellosis, widespread diarrhea, and Campylobacter ssp infections were detected, among others. The communities are located within a significant level of poverty, which makes it difficult for them to access drinking water.

AB  - Background: The present study aimed at demonstrating the heat stress situation (distribution and intensity) based on a standard and common heat stress index, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), during hot seasons and interpret the obtained results considering global warming and rising temperature in different parts of the country based on climate changes studied in Iran.
   Methods: Heat stress assessment was done using WBGT index. Environmental parameters were measured simultaneously in the early, middle and end of shift work. The personal parameters including cloth thermal insulation and metabolic rate of 242 participants from 9 climatic categories were recorded for estimating effective WBGT (measured WBGT plus cloth adjustment factor as well as metabolic rate effect). The values of the indicator were categorized in the statistical software media and then linked to the climatic zoning of the data in the GIS information layers, in which, WBGT values relating to selected stations were given generalization to similar climatic regionalization.
   Results: The obtained results showed that in the summer about 60 % and more than 75 % of the measurements relating to 12 pm and 3 pm, respectively, were in heat stress situations (i.e. the average amount of heat stress index was higher than 28 degrees C). These values were found to be about 20-25 % in the spring. Moreover, only in the early hours of shift work in spring could safe conditions be seen throughout the country. This situation gradually decreased in the middle of the day hours and was replaced by the warning status and stress. And finally, in the final hours of shift work thermal stresses reached their peaks. These conditions for the summer were worse.
   Conclusions: Regarding several studies related to climate change in Iran and the results of present study, heat stress, especially in the central and southern parts of Iran, can be exacerbated in the decades to come if climate change and rising temperature occurs. Therefore, paying attention to this critical issue and adopting macro-management policies and programs in the field of workplace health is essential.

AB  - Ecosystem health report cards are an increasingly popular means of summarizing the results of environmental monitoring programs for broad, non-scientific audiences. This paper describes a whole-of-system report card initiative developed to monitor the condition of a multi-use port in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, Queensland, Australia. Concerns over the impacts of major industrial expansion, fish health incidents, safety of recreational harbour users and habitat loss prompted stakeholders in the Gladstone region to unite and establish the Gladstone Healthy Harbour Partnership. The objective was to monitor and report on the health of the harbour via an annual report card (http://rc.ghhp.org.au/). We illustrate one approach to designing a report card against ten core considerations; 1) strong links to all stakeholders at all stages, 2) rigorous science, 3) effective communication, 4) setting clear goals and 5) realistic expectations, 6) flexibility in implementation, 7) transparency, open access and accountability, 8) results linked to actionable management recommendations, 9) regular evaluation, and 10) long term commitment. Innovative aspects of this report card include the combination of four components of harbour health: environmental, social, cultural and economic; underpinned by a sophisticated monitoring, modelling and reporting program. A review of the report card content and methodology, conducted in 2017, determined that the design meets the original vision and objectives set by Gladstone stakeholders. However, stakeholder perceptions of the effectiveness of the report card have not been comprehensively assessed to date. This paper provides a guide to others designing report card programs and environmental metrics, with advice on maximizing transparency and data sharing, coordinating otherwise disparate monitoring efforts, and linking with management through the provision of scenario analysis tools with which to interpret and respond to annual report card results.

AB  - The bivalve Scrobicularia piano has been proposed as a sentinel species for the assessment of estuarine sediment quality. The aim of this study was to test the responsiveness of a set of biomarkers in bivalves originating from a moderately contaminated site (Loire estuary, France) and a comparatively cleaner site (Bay of Bourgneuf, France) used as reference. Temporal fluctuations were examined in animals collected on eight occasions from March 2008 to October 2009 for the determination of biochemical (MTs, GST, AChE), physiological (energy reserves as glycogen and lipids, condition, hepato-somatic and gonado-somatic indices), and behavioural biomarkers (burrowing). Metals in clams were examined with the aim of understanding the variations in MT concentrations. The current findings indicate that among biochemical markers MTs must be used in a precautionary fashion, and comparison with a reference site remains indispensable together with an appreciation of any salinity effects. Clearer responses were obtained for GST activity which contributes to defence against organic compounds. However, any such defence was not sufficient to ensure total protection since a number of impairments were observed at the individual level (burrowing behaviour, condition index, gonado-somatic index). The integrated biomarker response (IBR) illustrated higher levels of stress in clams collected from the Loire estuary compared to those gathered from the reference site at most of the sampling periods. The interpretation of responses involved in the cascade of energetic events (from available food, digestive enzyme activities, energy reserves to condition and reproductive status) is complex but did reveal disturbances in the Loire estuary which is far from being the most contaminated estuary in France and over the world. However, no links can be established between effects at individual and supra-individual levels in organisms in the Loire estuary, even in the case of a small oil spill which occurred at the beginning of this study.

AB  - Aquatic systems are subjected to various sources of stress due to global changes, such as increasing temperature and pollution. A major challenge for the next decade will be to evaluate the combined effects of these multiple stressors on organisms and ecosystems. For organisms submitted to chemical, biological or physical stressors, the capacity to set up an efficient adaptive response is a fundamental prerequisite for their long-term survival and performance. In this study, goldfish (Carassius auratus) were subjected to individual and combined pesticide mixtures and increased temperatures to evaluate their adaptive response in multistress conditions from the molecular to the individual level. Fish were exposed for 16 days to a mixture of pesticides at environmental relevant concentrations (S-metolachlor, isoproturon, linuron, atrazine-desethyl, aclonifen, pendimethalin and tebuconazole) and at two temperatures (22 degrees C and 32 degrees C). Three major physiological traits of the stress response were measured: the hormonal response (i.e. plasma cortisol), the metabolic balance from molecular to individuals' levels (metabolomics, cellular energy allocation, energy reserves and global condition indexes), and the cellular defense system induction (SOD, CAT and GST). Results show that (1) environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides lead to significant responses in fish at all biological levels; (2) the metabolic response depends on the nature of stress (thermal vs. chemical); and (3) fish may be unable to set up an efficient adaptive response when chemical and thermal stresses were combined, with adverse outcomes at the individuals' level.

AB  - By combining the concepts of environmental stress, state susceptibility and environmental crisis, "Security Diagram" (SD) provides a quantitative approach to assessing environmental change and human security. The SD is a tool that clearly presents in a diagram the security situation of a population or region affected by a particular environmental crisis. Its underlying concept emphasises that the higher the level of environmental stress and socio-economic susceptibility, the higher the probability of the occurrence of crisis. Focusing on drought, this study analyses the susceptibility of case study regions in India, Portugal, and Russia from a socio-economic perspective. A conceptual framework of socio-economic susceptibility is developed based on the economic development theories of modernisation and dependency. Fuzzy set theory is used to generate susceptibility indices from a range of national and sub-national indicators, including financial resources, agricultural dependency and infrastructure development (for economic susceptibility), and health condition, educational attainment and gender inequality (for social susceptibility). Results indicate that socio-economic susceptibility over the period 1980-1995 was highest in India, followed by Russia and (since 1989) lowest in Portugal. Globalisation is likely to contribute to changes in the level of socio-economic susceptibility over time. Moreover, specific social and economic structures unique in each country (e.g., the role of women in society in India, the socialist legacy in Russia) may explain differences in susceptibility between the case study regions.

AB  - Drought is a complex natural hazard that can occur in any climate and affect every aspect of society. To better prepare and mitigate the impacts of drought, various indicators can be applied to monitor and forecast its onset, intensity, and severity. Though widely used, little is known about the efficacy of these indicators which restricts their role in important decisions. Here, we provide the first validation of 11 commonly-used drought indicators by comparing them to pasture and browse condition data collected on the ground in Kenya. These ground-based data provide an absolute and relative assessment of the conditions, similar to some of the drought indicators. Focusing on grass and shrublands of the arid and semi-arid lands, we demonstrate there are strong relationships between ground-based pasture and browse conditions, and satellite-based drought indicators. The soil adjusted vegetation index has the best relationship, achieving a mean r2 score of 0.70 when fitted against absolute pasture condition. Similarly, the 3-month vegetation health index reached a mean r2 score of 0.62 when fitted against a relative pasture condition. In addition, we investigated the Kenya-wide drought onset threshold for the 3-month average vegetation condition index (VCI3M; VCI3M < 35), which is used by the country's drought early warning system. Our results show large disparities in thresholds across different counties. Understanding these relationships and thresholds are integral to developing effective and efficient drought early warning systems. Our work offers evidence for the effectiveness of some of these indicators as well as practical thresholds for their use.

AB  - Albania possesses a wealth of aquatic ecosystems, many of enormous natural and biological value, such as the Lakes Ohrid, Prespa and Shkodra, glacial lakes, river valleys, and coastal lagoons. Although many habitats are highly polluted by inorganic and organic wastes, detailed knowledge on the water quality is still lacking. For the first time, an environmental assessment of the water quality is presented and the main polluting sources identified. As a consequence, a systematic control and the establishment of routine monitoring of surface and groundwater is proposed, which elucidates the present environmental state and helps to develop new strategies of waste and wastewater management. It would help allow Albania to reach an international standard in environmental protection, as a part of UNECE Convention, the Mediterranean Action Plan, the MAP/UNEP Medpol Program and the Basel Convention.

AB  - Growth and condition in fishes have been taken as indicating levels of energy available for survival and reproduction, major components of a population's productivity. After a rapid collapse in population size, northern (NAFO Division 2J3KL) cod (Gadus morhua) remained at a very low level of abundance for 20 years. We investigated the potential for poor growth and condition to have played a role in the collapse and lack of recovery of northern cod. Juveniles and adult males and females all showed similar patterns. Perceptions about the importance of growth and condition to population status depended on the metrics and area examined. When the northern cod population was declining, the northern areas of the population clearly had reduced growth and condition, while these metrics improved in the south. Results were equivocal as to the potential role of growth and condition in the continued low abundance of northern cod and, to some extent, depended on the nature of the metric being examined. Indices of condition, which included lipid storage in the form of liver weight, were generally lower in the north while the stock remained at a low level. Metrics associated with longer-term protein storage returned to precollapse levels quickly following the period of collapse. An index of food availability was more closely related to growth and condition than was temperature. These results point to the need both for studies of growth and condition in a population to have a comprehensive time-series of data covering the entire range of the population and the need for a better understanding of the causes and implications of changes in different metrics of condition.

AB  - Hydrology, water quality and biological pressures can influence structure and function of stream and river ecosystems. However, in practice, identifying the shared effects of factors on communities instead of isolated effects is a challenging task. Benthic macroinvertebrate community can reflect bottom conditions of streams and is less disturbed by river flows and human activities. Therefore, it is suitable to analyze the shared effects of hydromorphological and physico-chemical parameters. Benthic macroinvertebrate based Multi-Metric Index (BMMI) was built to evaluate overall status and the effects on three biological traits were calculated, including diversity and abundance (D/A), sensitivity and tolerance to pollutions (S/T) and functional feeding groups (FFGs). Redundancy Analysis (RDA) was performed to evaluate the percentage of explained variance of 18 hydromorphological and physico-chemical parameters on invertebrate community. Our analysis showed that the two facets of the environment have high shared explained variances (28.2%-44.5%). Relatively, physico-chemical parameters have higher contributions on B-MMI than hydromorphological parameters. Seasonal analysis showed the shared effects are higher in dry season than wet season. S/T characteristics are most sensitive to seasonal shared effects, which in wet season can best show the isolated effects of the two facets of the environment. At the catchment-scale, middle stretches had higher B-MMI values since stony substrate and less disturbed land use types. And reach studies showed channel morphology contributed more in stony reaches while bottom conditions contributed more in silty and sandy reaches. Our findings consequently give rise to concern to the integrity index of benthic invertebrate community, which allows to show large shared effects of hydromorphological and physico-chemical factors. Besides catchment scale, reach scale also help add the perspective of substrate diversity and heterogeneity in habitat restoration and conservation.

AB  - Hyperforin, the main antidepressant constituent of Hypericum perforatum, influences the extracellular concentrations of transmitters in vitro and in vivo. In vivo experiments have shown that hyperforin enhances the extracellular concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and glutamate in the locus coeruleus. Hyperforin-free Hypericum extract also elevates the extracellular concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine in the locus coeruleus, but, in contrast to hyperforin, the extracellular concentration of serotonin is diminished. The differing profiles of hyperforin and hyperforin-free Hypericum extract on the extracellular transmitter concentrations point to the presence of an additional biologically active compound in Hypericum perforatum. Inescapable shock increases the release of monoamines and several amino acids, as well as motility, blood pressure and heart rate. Conditioned fear, similar to hyperforin-free Hypericum extract, decreases the release of serotonin in the locus coeruleus. Conditioned fear also leads to tachycardia. The latter finding shows that telemetric heart rate recording is a good index for conditioned fear. Invivo findings confirm the idea that the anti-depressive properties of Hypericum extract and hyperforin result from increases in extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations. Since hyperforin-free extract, like conditioned fear, reduces the extracellular concentration of serotonin, hyperforin may be more beneficial than Hypericum extract in the treatment of depressive disorders.

AB  - In highly variable environments, conditions can be so stressful in some years that entire populations forgo reproduction in favor of higher likelihood of surviving to breed in future years. In two out of five years, Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga Columbiana) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem exhibited population-wide failure to breed. Clark's nutcrackers at the study site experienced substantial interannual differences in food availability and weather conditions, and the two nonbreeding years corresponded with low whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) cone crops the previous autumn (<= an average of 8 +/- 2 cones per tree versus >= an average of 20 +/- 2 cones per tree during breeding years) and high snowpack in early spring (>= 61.2 +/- 5.5 cm versus <= 51.9 +/- 4.4 cm during breeding years). The average adult body condition index during the breeding season was significantly lower in 2011 (-1.5 +/- 1.1), a nonbreeding year, as compared to 2012 (6.2 +/- 2.0), a breeding year. The environmental cues available to the birds prior to breeding, specifically availability of cached whitebark pine seeds, may have allowed them to predict that breeding conditions would be poor, leading to the decision to skip breeding. Alternatively, the Clark's nutcrackers may have had such low body energy stores that they chose not to or were unable to breed. Breeding plasticity would allow Clark's nutcrackers to exploit an unpredictable environment. However, if large-scale mortality of whitebark pines is leading to an increase in the number of nonbreeding years, there could be serious population-level and ecosystem-wide consequences.

AB  - In the Jequetepeque basin (Peru), gold extraction activity has been performed in the last decades, leading to a release of metals and metalloids into the environment. Sediment samples were taken in the vicinity of two mines and analyzed. Extraction of metals and metalloids from sediments was carried out using single extraction procedures, acidic (HNO3), and complexation (EDTA) leaching, in order to determine the mobility of trace elements. Results indicated that acidic extraction at low pH values increased the leachability of trace elements. EDTA showed a higher bioavailability of metals in sediments than acidic extraction under similar pH conditions because of its greater leaching capacity. This is an important issue in view of risk assessment analysis. The highest extractability was observed for Cd in all sediments with up to 90% of extraction after 1h. The mobility index analysis indicated that faster kinetic leachability of some trace elements leads to a higher mobility in sediments, especially those near the active gold extraction mine. The ecological risk assessment suggested that the four river sediments were at high and very high risk levels, indicating that sediment contamination is an issue of environmental concern in the Jequetepeque basin of northern Peru.

AB  - Ecosystem resilience is the inherent ability to absorb various disturbances and reorganize while undergoing state changes to maintain critical functions. When ecosystem resilience is sufficiently degraded by disturbances, ecosystem is exposed at high risk of shifting from a desirable state to an undesirable state. Ecological thresholds represent the points where even small changes in environmental conditions associated with disturbances lead to switch between ecosystem states. There is a growing body of empirical evidence for such state transitions caused by anthropogenic disturbances in a variety of ecosystems. However, fewer studies addressed the interaction of anthropogenic and natural disturbances that often force an ecosystem to cross a threshold which an anthropogenic disturbance or a natural disturbance alone would not have achieved. This fact highlights how little is known about ecosystem dynamics under uncertainties around multiple and stochastic disturbances. Here, we present two perspectives for providing a predictive scientific basis to the management and conservation of ecosystems against multiple and stochastic disturbances. The first is management of predictable anthropogenic disturbances to maintain a sufficient level of biodiversity for ensuring ecosystem resilience (i.e., resilience-based management). Several biological diversity elements appear to confer ecosystem resilience, such as functional redundancy, response diversity, a dominant species, a foundation species, or a keystone species. The greatest research challenge is to identify key elements of biodiversity conferring ecosystem resilience for each context and to examine how we can manage and conserve them. The second is the identification of ecological thresholds along existing or experimental disturbance gradients. This will facilitate the development of indicators of proximity to thresholds as well as the understanding of threshold mechanisms. The implementation of forewarning indicators will be critical particularly when resilience-based management fails. The ability to detect an ecological threshold along disturbance gradients should therefore be essential to establish a backstop for preventing the threshold from being crossed. These perspectives can take us beyond simply invoking the precautionary principle of conserving biodiversity to a predictive science that informs practical solutions to cope with uncertainties and ecological surprises in a changing world.

AB  - The flatfish species Solea solea has been the subject of research for supporting their management in fisheries, restocking natural populations, domestication in aquaculture, and ecotoxicology research. Soles undergo a metamorphosis with drastic morphological and physiological changes and settlement, processes that make them potentially more vulnerable to pollutants than other fish. Up to date, efforts made to develop its aquaculture production in Europe have been limited. In the context of climate change (CC), this review aims i) to gather research conducted in S. solea larvae that summarizes the effects of increased temperature and contaminant exposures during larval development; and ii) to provide a summarized and synergistic view about its larval development. The review consists of 4 sections. Section 1 justifies the selection of this species from ecological and economic perspectives. Section 2 focuses on larvae ontogenesis, metamorphosis, rearing challenges, and further aquaculture production. Section 3 reviews studies dealing with the effects of temperature change (due to CC) and pollutants on larval development. Finally, section 4 provides a "how to go forward on ecotoxicological research" guideline, in which we highlight the methods that we found promising as tools to study the combined effects of CC and pollution. The section includes a multidisciplinary framework that proposes how existing data coming from different scientific domains can be synthesized to be useful for risk assessors and ecotoxicologists. To benefit from such a framework, it is necessary to reach consensus and nurture team effort from players that operate in different research disciplines.

AB  - The decrease of microbial and nutrient inputs from the watershed has long dominated lagoon ecosystem management objectives. Phytoplankton biomass and abundance have drastically decreased for more than a decade and Zostera meadow have gradually recovered, expressing lagoon ecosystem restoration such as Thau lagoon. Do the progressive achievement of the good ecological status of the Thau lagoon possibly threatens the shellfish industry in terms of production and oyster quality, by reducing the carrying capacity? To provide answers about the right balance to be achieved between conservation and exploitation, a new numerical tool was developed to help in decision-making. We hereby propose to incorporate a Dynamic Energy Budget type shellfish production model to an existing lagoon ecosystem box-model. The influence of different scenarios of nutrient inputs (related to projections of population growth or improvement of treatment plants) and shellfish stocks were tested on oyster performances (production, oyster condition index), carrying capacity of the lagoon and ecological status indices used within the EU Water Framework Directive. Model outputs demonstrated that shellfish production was mainly controlled by nutrient inputs, which depend on hydro-meteorological variability, and specifically by phosphorus and N:P ratios of nutrient inputs. Scenarios tested, however, demonstrated smaller differences of oyster production in comparison to inter-annual variability. The overall ecological status of the lagoon remained in a "good" status with acceptable lagoon-scale phytoplankton depletion, regardless of scenarios, setting the carrying capacity of this ecosystem to be sustainable.

AB  - The estuarine fish community index (EFCI) and an estuarine fish guild assessment (EFGA) were used in 2004 and 2008 to determine the ecological state and effects of selected ecosystem variables on the Umvoti and Matigulu/Nyoni estuaries. The EFCI indicated that the Matigulu/Nyoni Estuary was in a moderate state and that the Umvoti Estuary was in a poor to very poor state. The EFGA revealed a clear spatial differentiation, based on the estuaries' fish community structures, that was being driven primarily by the freshwater-dominated state of the Umvoti Estuary and the poor water quality of the Umvoti Estuary. The analysis of estuarine fish assemblage characteristics was shown to contribute towards the management and conservation of these systems.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to give an ecological description of the vegetation of the Jurisdam-Seekoegat section of the Mountain Zebra National Park in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The effect of different land use practices on the vegetation composition was also investigated. Vegetation classifications and descriptions are of immense value to scientists and land managers and provide information on the composition, structure, diversity and effect of management on the different ecosystems present. The Braun-Blanquet approach was used to classify the different plant communities, while the veld condition was determined using the Ecological Index Method. Plant community data was analysed using the JUICE software package while diversity of the different plant communities was determined using the Shannon-Wiener and Gini-Simpson Indices. From a TWINSPAN analysis eight plant communities that can be grouped into six major communities were identified. Two plant communities not previously described for the Park were identified. The different plant communities can all be related to topography and effect of previous land use. Grasses and dwarf shrubs are the most prominent species. The plant communities of the rocky midslope areas achieved the highest species richness and diversity for the study area. The areas least affected by heavy grazing had a higher veld condition score than those heavily grazed by domestic animals in the past. The results of this study also emphasises the importance of resting overgrazed veld, while it seems that heavily grazed areas will not recover without further human intervention. A vegetation map of the different plant communities was produced using ArcGIS. (c) 2018 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The variations of the nucleolar characteristics size and number were studied in the gill and liver of Odontesthes bonariensis under different feeding regimes in order to test the hypothesis that functional genomes at the nucleolus, which determine variation of size (heterogeneity) in juvenile fishes, are modulated by environmental factors such as food availability. The programme that controls genetic changes of the nucleolar characteristics of the diploid cells of O. bonariensis was different from that described in the diploid cells of cyprinid fishes. No variations of the mean nucleolar number per nucleus were observed in liver or gill cells in relation to the feeding regime. Conversely, significant reduction of the mean nucleolar volume per nucleus (V-MN) and change in the shape of the frequency distribution of the total nucleolar volume per cell was evident in both cell types in response to starvation or food restriction. Tissue specificity was observed in relation to the absolute values of the nucleolar characteristics; however, the relative behaviour was comparable in digestive and non-digestive tissues. The time-course reduction of V-MN in gill and liver cells of restrictively fed fish followed a negative exponential. A good correlation between V-MN and the condition index of the fish (K) was observed after long-term food restriction; however, a faster response of V-MN was observed after short-term fasting events. Results supported the stated hypothesis and showed nucleolar activity as a direct, rapid and sensitive indicator of the nutritional status of the fish. (c) 2007 The Authors.

AB  - The scientific approach toward ecological risk assessment (ERA) has advanced greatly during the 1990s. This growth has been accompanied by the development of ERA guidance by USEPA Headquarters, individual USEPA Regions, state environmental agencies, as well as international agencies. This compilation of ERA guidance and procedural documents identifies many of the existing ERA reference materials from the regulatory and/or governmental agency arena. In addition, this compilation provides annotations pertaining to the focus of each reviewed document, and compares/contrasts the approaches presented in the documents. As such, the evaluation provides insight into some of the qualities and levels of detail provided by each document. Examples of documents which are highlighted include recently published USEPA's "Guidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment;" USEPA's "Ecological Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund;" the U.S. Army's "Procedural Guidelines for Ecological Risk Assessments;" and Environment Canada's "Ecological Risk Assessments Under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act."

AB  - In temperate environments, seasonal selective sources of mortality (e.g., starvation and predation) may drive season-specific energy allocation patterns of young-of-year fish. However, when quantifying such phenomena, the effect of ration is rarely considered. We conducted two experiments to investigate the effect of ration on seasonal energy allocation patterns of age-0 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) during summer and fall. In a laboratory experiment designed to evaluate short-term effects of ration on energy allocation, recent ration history strongly affected body dimensions and length-adjusted energy content. In outdoor raceways, young largemouth bass grew at different rates under different ration levels. In response, length-adjusted energy content, a size-independent index of condition, differed among raceway ration treatments during late summer. However, during fall, high- and low-growth treatment fish expressed similar length-adjusted energy content. Thus, while low-growth fish appeared to allocate a disproportionately low amount of energy to growth of energy-rich storage tissue during late summer, as winter approached, low-growth fish switched and instead allocated a disproportionately high amount of energy to storage tissue. We conclude that energy availability (via ration level) affects short-term energy allocation patterns and may interactively influence seasonal shifts in energy allocation patterns.

T2  - NOVENYTERMELES
LA  - Hungarian
AB  - Susceptibility of maize hybrids to maize dwarf mosaic virus-A (MDMV-A) and two strain of sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV-MB and A) were studied in greenhouse following artificial inoculation.  In addition hybrids were tested in the field under high natural infection pressure at two locations (Baja and Szeged).  At Baja MDMV was the prevalent virus, while at Szeged MDMV and SCMV were found in 50-50% in the leaf samples investigated by Elisa-test.
   Some hybrids which were resistant or moderatelly susceptible in the field developed symptoms much more higher percentage in the greenhouse then in the field, but in these hybrids symptoms appeared 5-8 days later compared to hybrids found to be very susceptible in the field.
   Kuhn and Smith (1977) suggested a disease index system to evaluate corn for resistance under greenhouse conditions.  The index considers both the disease incidence and the rate of symptom appearance after mechanical inoculation.  In our study Kuhn and Smith's diseae index values provide more precise information about resistance of maize hybrids than disease incidence at the late reading time and index values were correlated with disease incidence in the field.

AB  - Age-0 walleye pollock growth along a frontal transect around the Pribilof Islands, Bering Sea, was estimated by using a spatially-explicit bioenergetics model. Predicted growth patterns along the transect were tested against the spatial resolution of the model, to examine the extent to which informative results were affected by the input spatial resolution. Results of model implementation to the Pribilof Islands scenario showed that on average fish residing in the offshore region of the transect were exposed to areas in which growth potential was two to three times higher than in the inshore region. Modelling results corroborated well with independent indicators of age-0 pollock growth, such as age-specific length and Fulton condition index from fish collected at the same location examined with the model. In spite of the better feeding and growth potential of the offshore region, age-0 pollock were found mainly in the inshore portion of the transect. Evidently, other factors, besides habitat energetics, needed to be considered to explain the distribution of age-0 pollock around the islands. Predictions of age-0 pollock growth along the transect were highly sensitive to the input spatial resolution of the model, but only at a spatial scale larger than a threshold of about 1000-2500 m. It is proposed that such threshold represents the limit beyond which important physical and biological boundaries are crossed and consequently model predictions derived from average conditions become biased.

AB  - This study evaluated the annual cycle of biological reproductive aspects of Prochilodus lacustris, a neotropical fish species, in Baixada Maranhense Protection Area in northeastern Brazil. Fish were collected monthly between June of 2015 and June of 2016 using gill nets. In the laboratory, 600 individuals were weighed, measured, and eviscerated to obtain biometric data and data for the microscopic and macroscopic analyses of the maturation stages of the gonads. These analyses allowed the determination of the reproductive period using biological indicators such as the gonadosomatic index and hepatosomatic index, condition factor, stomach repletion index, and spawning season. Abiotic variables were measured in situ during the samplig: temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and electrical conductivity. In addition, local rainfall data was also obtained. The results showed that the total body length of individuals varied from 151 to 211 mm in males, and from 142 to 239 mm in females. The sex ratio showed a predominance of females over males, and the species showed negative allometric growth. The annual variation of reproductive indicators and the frequency of individuals in advanced stages of gonadal maturation suggest that the reproductive cycle of the species occurs between November and January, with a reproductive peak in January. This reproductive peak coincides with the beginning of the region's rainy season. Although we did not do the fertility analysis, our results suggest that the species presents partitioned spawning. In conclusion, this results demonstrates that the reproduction of the investigated specie is influenced by associations between environmental variables on a seasonal scale and can be contribute to improve the understanding of the dynamics of the physiological reproductive process in lentic environments.

AB  - Brazilian railroads transport over 490 million tons a year using diesel-electric locomotives. These locomotives emit several pollutants into the atmosphere and because of that, the railroads seek to reduce emissions and achieve global emission standards. Thus, it is important to analyze the environmental impact of the use of diesel and alternative fuels to reach environmental standards. This paper makes use of a method based upon the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) metrics to evaluate the locomotives' eco-efficiency. The method was applied to Estrada de Ferro Vitoria a Minas (EFVM). Different scenarios representing the exchange of fuel sources arid technologies were developed, tested and analyzed. The impacts were evaluated by seven ecoefficiency performance indicators and compared With United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. The results offered cost savings and emissions reduction opportunities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Analysis of the spatiotemporal variation of the biological parameters of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) inhabiting two aquatic systems in coastal Algeria revealed no significant differences in length, gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, or condition coefficient between non-parasitized (NPT) and parasitized (with the nematode Anguillicoloides crassus) (PT) sub-populations at Lake Tonga. However, there were significant differences in these parameters between the two Lake Tonga sub-populations and a non-parasitized population at Bou Haroun port (NPT). There were no significant differences in weight among these three sub-populations. The highest values of the condition coefficient were observed in eels at Lake Tonga. Parasite numbers >= 10 per swim bladder had a negative effect on all measured biological parameters. At both stations, the condition of the eels was lowest in the spring and summer. Principal components analysis distinguished two groups of eels. The first comprised the Lake Tonga individuals, separated by parasitic indices and dissolved oxygen. The second group comprised the Bou Haroun eels, separated by pollution parameters. In fact this parasite was not present at Bou Haroun, presumably because it is unable to develop in this environment. Both Anguillicoloides crassus and Anguilla anguilla, prefer non-polluted environments with low salinity, as found in Lake Tonga.

AB  - The effects of agricultural activities on the environment can be presented by suitable pressure indicators. These pressure indicators can also be used as control variables to achieve a desired environmental state. Therefore, pressure indicators can play a decisive role in the elaboration of agri-environmental measures. This paper deals with the use of pressure indicators to assess the sustainability of agricultural land use on the one hand, and their contribution to the development of agri-environmental measures on the other hand. After the illustration of the general political background on the CAP evolution and the information needed for monitoring, control and ex-post assessment, the methodological approach of the AEMBAC project to provide this information is presented. Experiences in applying pressure indicators in assessing the agri-environmental measures are discussed and their applicability for the identification of environmental impacts, management and monitoring is evaluated.

AB  - Nowadays, nanostructures such as nanotubes and nanosheets are widely used in industry, especially the medical industry, for drug delivery, prevention and treatment. In the present investigation, the feasibility of detecting the amantadine gas molecule onto the outer surface of pristine single layer boron nitride nanosheet, as well as its aluminum (Al)-, gallium (Ga)-, phosphorus (P)-, and arsenic (As)-doped structures, was carefully evaluated. For achieving this goal, a periodic boundary condition density functional theory level of study using the HSEH1PBE functional together with a 6-311G (d) basis set has been used. Subsequently, the B3LYP-D3, wB97XD, and M062X functionals with a 6-311G (d) basis set were also employed to consider the single point energies. Subsequently, the B3LYP-D3 (BJ)/6-31G (d) method was also used to consider the contribution of scattering interactions to energy analyzes, natural bond orbital and quantum theory of atoms in molecules and the results were compatible with the electronic properties. In this regard, the total density of states, the Wiberg bond index, natural charge, natural electron configuration, donor-acceptor natural bond orbital interactions, and the second-order perturbation energies are performed to explore the nature of the intermolecular interactions. All of the calculations and analyses denote that by adsorbing of the amantadine molecule onto the surface of pristine boron nitride nanosheet, the adsorption is of the type of physical adsorption and van der Waals interactions. Among the doped nanotubes, gallium-doped nanotube has a very high adsorption energy compared to other elements, and is expected to be chemically adsorbed in this case and appears to be a suitable drug delivery option.

AB  - The energy content and biochemical composition of seed of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis of two distinct origins (subtidal and rocky shore) were compared after both groups were transferred to the water column (subtidal habitat) in the Arousa Ria, NW Spain. The experimental period comprised a total of 228 days. The relative percentages of carbohydrates, glycogen and lipids were significantly higher in the subtidal mussels in the first 15 days, whereas the proteins were significantly higher in the rocky shore mussels during the first 36 days. A multiple regression analysis referred to the same time period showed that the origin of the mussel seed influenced significantly the variance observed in the energy values of all biochemical components (measured in terms of kJ mg(-1)). In the period between days 50 and 110, mussel origin only showed a significant effect on the lipid energy content, but in contrast to the previous period, the content was greater in the rocky shore mussels. The multiple regression analysis showed that after 125 days of culture, mussel origin did not influence the variance observed in the energy values of all biochemical components, whereas the ratio chlorophyll a/particulate organic material, temperature and total particulate material influenced significantly the variance observed in the different energy values of all biochemical components. Changes observed in the energy content of carbohydrates and lipids throughout the different periods of this study can be related to catabolism-anabolism processes linked mainly to the availability of phytoplanktonic food. Moreover, with regard to lipids, our results suggest that changes were also associated with reproductive activity.

AB  - Rock alteration patterns related to the large felsic intrusive complex (felsite) beneath The Geysers steam field (California, USA) are important indicators: of the origins of the modern geothermal system. Metagreywacke host rocks fbr the system show widespread moderate oxygen isotope alteration in the permeable steam reservoir above the felsite, with concentrated alteration low on the hanks of the intrusion. Numerical models of fluid. heat and oxygen isotope transport in the pre-development (natural state) Geysers system demonstrate that an unbroken caprock is required throughout the liquid-dominated lifetime of the system to produce this pattern. The widespread moderate alteration throughout the steam reservoir suggests a long-lived liquid system, and probably required upwardly increasing permeability in the steam reservoir. The models indicate that the maximum hydrothermal lifetime for the system is 0.5 million years (Myr), whereas the youngest dated large intrusive is 1.2 Myr. Combined, these factors indicate repeated igneous intrusions at The Geysers, up to at least 0.5-0.6 Myr ago, and development of a stable liquid-dominated system after that. the evolution of which was truncated by a relatively recent transition to vapor-dominated conditions. Observed chemical compartmentalization of fluids in The Geysers steam reservoir is inconsistent with the lateral extensiveness of alteration at depth, since the latter requires good horizontal connectivity of deep permeable zones to allow penetration of O-18-depleted fluids. This compartmentalization is probably recent, developing as a consequence of vapor-dominated conditions introducing relative permeability effects. Petrologic evidence: fur high paleo-fluid temperatures (300 degreesC) within 1 km of the surface is difficult to reconcile with subdued O-18 alteration beneath these locations. These peak paleotemperatures ale likely to indicate small, short-lived penetrations of the caprock. Natural-state models allow the combined influence of these factors on the evolution of The Geysers to be analyzed quantitatively.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration was evaluated for several long-term rain-fed cropping systems for conservation agriculture (CA) and conservation tillage (CT) in Cambodia using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model. The mean crop yield, biomass and SOC stocks of four treatments and three replication in each primary cropping system (rice, soybean and cassava) were used for calibration and validation during the period 2009-2013. The CT and CA1 treatments were assigned to continuous cropping of primary crops. CA2 and CA3 treatments were assigned to rotated primary crops with maize. In all CA treatments, forage or legume cover crops were prior planted and intercropped with the primary crops to maintain full soil cover. The results show that EPIC successfully simulated crop yields, biomass, and SOC. However, the model tended to underestimate SOC in the CT treatments and overestimate SOC in the CA2 and CA3 treatments. Crop residue was found to highly influence SOC sequestration. Sediment loss in the CT treatments was found to be four times greater than CA treatments due to the CT tillage effects. The 20-year future simulations, using historical weather and automatically generated by EPIC, showed a decrease trend in SOC stocks in all CT treatments and an increase trend in most CA treatments, with the greatest increase for CA2 and CA3 treatments. Thus, the CA treatments in combination with the maize rotation were demonstrated to be more efficient to manage SOC sequestration over CA with one continuous primary crop.

AB  - Invasive insects facilitate secondary invasive species by altering forest structure and function. Specifically, invasive insect herbivores may promote the establishment and growth of invasive plants by creating canopy gaps. Such secondary invasions may be influenced by ecological integrity - the degree to which ecosystem composition, structure, and function deviate from their natural or historical range of variation. Here we investigate (i) whether emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis; EAB) induced ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality facilitates European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) - an invasive, shade-tolerant shrub, and (ii) the role of ecological integrity in this relationship. We use a principal component analysis (PCA) to calculate an index of ecological integrity and a zero-altered negative binomial generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to describe European buckthorn occurrence and abundance. European buckthorn occurrence is influenced by canopy gaps, independent of EAB-induced gap formation. Ecological integrity and EAB-induced ash mortality interact to control European buckthorn abundance, with high ecological integrity limiting EAB-facilitated buckthorn invasion. This is the first evidence for EAB-facilitated buckthorn invasion and for an interaction between a secondary invasion and ecological integrity. Thus, ecological integrity plays an important role in the EAB-buckthorn system and may be used to manage the impacts of secondary invasions.

AB  - This study highlights the importance of interspecific interactions among marine organisms and the effect that these trophic interactions have on the development of effective, adaptive management strategies for reef fishes in the Gulf of Mexico. To represent the spatially and temporally constrained, interspecific interactions among reef fishes we employ Atlantis (a spatially explicit, biogeochemical ecosystem model) as our simulation tool. Within Atlantis, we evaluate the performance of a two-point harvest control rule (HCR) that adaptively increases fishing mortality linearly between upper and lower biomass thresholds based on the available biomass of the stocks. This example demonstrated the use of a blanket two-point HCR that assessed the available biomass of several reef fish species (often co-caught in fishing gear) both simultaneously and objectively. To estimate the impact of reef fish fishing on species abundance and biodiversity in the ecosystem, we examined four low and four high fishing mortality (F) scaler scenarios. All model projections are forward looking, representing a 50-year time horizon (2010 to 2060). We evaluated the performance of the two-point HCRs under the eight fishing mortality scenarios using ecosystem metrics that were previously found to robustly track changes in ecosystem function caused by fishing. We found that the lower F scenarios produced an ecologically distinct ecosystem state compared with the higher F scenarios, where relatively higher levels of fishing mortality (particularly on predators such as the deep Serranidae group) resulted in an increase in prey availability in later years of the simulation. This led to an increase in the overall productivity of the ecosystem over time and higher catch and biomass of most other reef fish groups at equilibrium (year 50). Our results suggest that a better understanding of interspecific interactions among targeted reef fishes and their prey is critical to developing ecosystem-based management strategies for the Gulf of Mexico.

AB  - Ommastrephes bartramii is an oceanic squid distributed widely in the North Pacific, and its western winter-spring cohort is the target of a traditional squid fishery. Commercial fisheries data from the Chinese mainland squid-jigging fleet for the period 1995-2004 were analysed with respect to environmental variables. Sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in the Nino 3.4 region had the strongest negative correlation with the SSTA of feeding and spawning grounds of the squid, with a time-lag of three and eight months (p < 0.05), respectively. A La Nina event would result in a decrease in squid recruitment through variability in environmental conditions on the spawning grounds, whereas an El Nino event would lead to environmental conditions favourable to squid recruitment. El Nino/La Nina events also influenced squid distribution on the feeding grounds, resulting in a northward shift of the fishing grounds in La Nina years and a southward shift in El Nino years. A multiple linear regression equation was derived to describe the dependence of the squid abundance index on environmental variables.

AB  - Dam would influence the flux of water and sediment, eventually disturbing ecological connectivity. In Asia, especially in China, there are many dams, but great scientific uncertainty still exists about their effects on downstream macroinvertebrates. Therefore, we investigated macroinvertebrate assemblages, in upstream and downstream reaches of a run-of-river dam on a tributary of the Xiangxi River, central China. Surber samples and associated physicochemical measurements were taken from five sites during the period from June 2003 to June 2007. According to the metrics selection principle of benthic biotic integrity index (B-IBI), we selected macroinvertebrate species richness and number of EPT taxa from 27 biological metrics to assess the effect of dam construction. We divided sites into three habitats (H1-H3) according to the impact extent of the dam. Using partial least squares (PLS), we developed two predictive models (macroinvertebrate species richness and number of EPT taxa) based on the environmental variables of the unregulated habitat (111). These models were then used to predict species richness and number of EPT taxa at impacted habitats (H2 and H3). To evaluate the impact of flow regulation residuals, i.e. the differences between observed and predicted values, were used to evaluate the impact of flow regulation. Significant impacts of flow regulation on macroinvertebrate species richness and number of EPT taxa were detected at impacted habitats (H2 and H3), where observed species richness were lower 8.7% and 28.1%, and EPT taxa also were lower 12.8% and 30.0%. Then, possible mechanisms for observed impacts were discussed. This study addressed the negative impacts of run-of-river dams on macroinvertebrates, which may lead to more sustainable management strategies.

AB  - One of the most difficult problems for coral conservation is to find a sensitive physiological parameter to assess the health of living coral. In searching for a suitable index, ATP concentration in several species of coral under different natural and experimental conditions was studied from 1986 to 1989 in the coastal waters of southern Taiwan (21-degrees 56' N, 120-degrees 44' E). Interspecific variation in ATP concentration in 6 coral species ranged from 8.2 +/- 1.3 to 52.6 +/- 14.8-mu-g g-1. In an experiment of short-term desiccation stress, ATP content in Acropora hyacinthus dropped drastically from 67.0 +/- 13.7 to 7.9 +/- 6.1-mu-g g-1. During a bleaching event resulting from a natural disturbance, ATP concentration in A. hyacinthus dropped significantly but recovered gradually to normal values several months later. An annual survey of ATP variation in A. formosa showed a high peak between December and April with lower values in other months, perhaps in response to fluctuating temperature. In view of the significant rapid response of coral ATP content to stress and the rise in concentration during a recovery phase of months, the amount of ATP in living coral could be feasible parameter for monitoring environmental stress in living coral.

AB  - This field study showed a lack of a correlation between a morphometric (Fulton's K) and biochemical (RNA:DNA ratio) condition index in juvenile plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and dab (Limanda limanda) studied to assess habitat quality in four sandy beach nursery grounds in Galway Bay, Ireland. Based on monthly surveys from June to September in 2008 and 2009, fish growth, indicated by RNA:DNA ratios and Fulton's K, displayed considerable spatio-temporal variability. Site-related patterns in Fulton's K for plaice and dab were consistent between years whereas RNA:DNA ratios displayed annual and interspecific variability among nursery habitats. This indicates a higher sensitivity of RNA:DNA ratios to short-term environmental fluctuations which is not apparent in Fulton's K measurements of juvenile flatfish. Generalized Additive Modelling (GAM) revealed non-linear relationships between the condition indices and (biotic and abiotic) habitat characteristics as well as diet features, derived from gut content analyses. Density of predators, sediment grain size and salinity were the most important predictors of both condition indices. Temperature also affected condition indices in dab whereas plaice condition indices varied with depth. Diet features did not contribute to the explained variability in the models predicting RNA:DNA ratios whereas certain prey groups significantly improved the explained variability in the models predicting Fulton's K of plaice and dab. The value of both indices for assessing fish condition and habitat quality in field studies is discussed. These findings aid understanding of the biological and physical mechanisms promoting fast growth and high survival which will help to identify high quality nursery areas for juvenile plaice and dab.

AB  - Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations in 27 classes of lakes have been hindcast by simulation models and related to presence of coldwater, coolwater, and warmwater fishes in 3002 Minnesota lakes. A one-dimensional, dynamic water quality model driven by 25 years of daily weather data was used to model water temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles of these lakes. Fish presence data were available for these lakes from the Minnesota Lake Fisheries Data Base. Water temperature and dissolved oxygen criteria derived from a very large United States Environmental Protection Agency fish-temperature database and dissolved oxygen observations were used to define and link simulated water temperatures and dissolved oxygen conditions to suitability of habitats for coldwater, coolwater, and warmwater fish assemblages. Good agreement was found between fish presence and numerical simulations of fish habitat defined by water temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations. Generally water temperature and DO are good indicators of suitable fish habitat.

AB  - Pervious pavement systems can have a life span of about 20 years but, at end-of-life, it becomes necessary to evaluate the state of the infrastructure to determine whether they pose a health and safety risk to workers during dismantling, and also determine potential reuse of the waste material generated. In this paper, we report of an investigation conducted to evaluate whether Pervious pavement systems are hazardous to human health at end-of-life and also to assess the mobility of the storm water pollutants trapped in the system as a measure of their potential release to receiving systems such as water-bodies and ground water systems. After decommissioning, the pervious pavement structure was sampled for analysis including Gas Chromatography, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and, leachate analysis. Results show that carcinogenic risks were significantly below the regulatory limit of 1 x 10(-6) while, the hazard quotients and cumulative hazard indices were also below regulatory value of 1, based on United States Environmental Protection Agency standards. Furthermore, mean concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene were significantly less than the UK soil guideline values. The results of the leachate analysis show that the metals of concern, Pb, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cd and Cu were all below the threshold for reuse applications such as irrigation purposes as they were all below the regulatory limits such as Food and Agriculture Organization and, United States Environmental Protection Agency standards. Finally, the evaluation of potential reuse and recycling purposes indicate that wastes generated from the dismantling of the PPS are within limits for recycling as aggregates for other civil engineering projects as per European Union standards. This has potential to enhance UK's drive to achieve the target of 70% level of construction & demolition waste recovery for reuse and recycling by the year 2020 as per European Union Water Framework Directive.

AB  - 1. When movement behaviour is correlated with traits affecting fitness, it may affect population performance directly, independent of extrinsic habitat conditions.
   2. In a previous 3-year, capture-recapture study, upstream movement by the salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus compensated for low reproduction in the upper 500 m of Merrill Brook, a first-order stream in northern New Hampshire (U.S.A.). This immigrant subsidy resulted from excess reproduction in the downstream section (i.e. the lower 500 m of stream length) and from consistently upstream-biased movement by salamanders. Reproduction in the two stream sections was positively correlated with mean body condition. Using 6 years of capture-recapture data, this study examines whether the movement behaviour of G. porphyriticus is related to body condition and thereby directly influences mean body condition and reproduction in the two sections of Merrill Brook.
   3. Upstream-biased movement and greater mean body condition in the downstream section were consistent across 6 years of data collection. In Merrill Brook and four other streams, however, individuals with high body condition were more likely to move upstream and low-condition individuals were more likely to move downstream. Movement direction was unrelated to the size, sex and initial location of individuals. Body condition was positively related to growth rate, further supporting its link to reproductive potential, and positively autocorrelated through time in individuals that moved.
   4. Results of this 6-year study suggest that the movement behaviour of G. porphyriticus partially compensated for environmental factors differentiating mean body condition and reproduction along Merrill Brook and illustrate the potential for this form of self-organisation to occur in linear habitats such as streams and rivers.

AB  - Recent work suggests that avian egg color could be a sexually selected signal to males that provides information about female condition, female genetic quality, or maternal investment in eggs. Theory predicts that egg color should influence male investment if it is an honest signal of the marginal fitness returns on paternal investment; a male should invest more in a colorful clutch if that investment increases offspring success more than an equivalent investment in a less colorful clutch. Some experimental support for this hypothesis has been found for species that lay blue eggs containing the pigment biliverdin, a potentially costly antioxidant. However, the brown eggshell pigment protoporphyrin, a pro-oxidant associated with poor female condition, has received less attention as a potential predictor of female quality or investment. We performed a cross-fostering experiment with House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) in southwest Michigan in 2007 to test whether brown egg color was related to female condition or maternal investment, and whether male provisioning of nestlings was related to egg color. We swapped entire clutches between nests and measured egg characteristics and parental provisioning rates. We found that brighter eggs (i.e., those with less brown pigment) were heavier, and that nestlings that hatched from brighter eggs were fed at higher rates by their foster mothers, but not by their foster fathers. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that egg color is a potential signal of egg quality and female investment, but we found no evidence of a male response to this potential signal. This lack of a response could be the result of methodological limitations, a nonadaptive biological constraint, or adaptive indifference because chicks from brighter eggs do not actually yield increasing marginal returns on paternal investment. Clearly, additional study is needed to differentiate among these possibilities.

AB  - Aim. This study was an attempt by the authors to identify the impact of oil production in the Caspian Sea on the quality of waters surrounding oil and gas-production platforms.
   Material and Methods. In 2018, by order of the Committee for Forestry and Wildlife of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Kazekoproekt carried out comprehensive marine research to assess the state of biological resources in the eastern part of the Caspian Sea. All studies were carried out according to standard methods accepted in international practice. Samples were collected in summer (July-August) 2018 and autumn (September) 2018.
   Results. An analysis of the materials of environmental studies carried out in the water area of the eastern part of the Caspian Sea in 2018 established the absence of biogenic concentrations in sea water in excess of the standard indicators. It was found that in the waters surrounding several stations in summer and autumn, concentrations of oil products were exceeded. The concentrations of pesticides in the waters of the northern Caspian Sea recorded in 2018 were not detected.
   Conclusion. It was found that in the eastern part of the Caspian Sea in 2018 there was no concentration of biogenic elements in sea water above the standard indicators. Of the heavy metals, an excess of maximum permissible concentrations was found only at one station - of copper in the summer over 159 sq. m and in the autumn over 121 sq. m. Of particular concern is the fact that at several stations in summer and autumn excessive concentrations of petroleum products were recorded. The concentrations of pesticides in the waters of the northern Caspian Sea recorded in 2018 were not detected.

AB  - The investigation findings are of interest in the fundamental hydrobiological studies and new methodological approaches to the phytoplankton ecological state assessment. In mesotrophic-eutrophic lake the active vegetation of plankton algae was revealed at the end of winter under snow (0.13-0.34 m) and ice (0.56-0.70 m) layers at water temperature of 0-4.5 degrees C along the water column (6 m depth). The winter phytoplankton involved species from Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Euglenophyta, Dinophyta, Cryptophyta, Ochrophyta and Cyanobacteria. The maximum abundance and biomass are due to passive plankters, incapable of active phototaxis from Microcystis, Gomphosphaeria, Chroococcus, Anabaena, Gloeocapsa, Cyanothece, Monoraphidium, Scenedesmus, Dictyosphaerium and Hyaloraphidium genus. In the ice cover period, the species number reaches 52-56, the abundance - 26.4-1056.0 th. cells/l, biomass - 0.2-12.2 g/m(3), the chlorophyll a concentration - 1.8-24.1 mg/m(3). Although these characteristic values appeared to be high for the cold period (at low temperature and insufficient light), they were lower than in the summer season (more than 100 species, 0.11-1.74 mln. cells/l, 0.64-18.16 g/m(3) and 27.49-83.40 mu g/m(3), respectively). It is noted that algae growth in winter period was limited by the depth of snow cover, but not of the ice. Water temperature affects the species composition and chlorophyll a concentration, but not the algae abundance and biomass. The microscopic method results for determining the plankton algae concentration were compared with the non-contact methods of investigation (spectrophotometric method of light attenuation recording). The assumption that since algae photosynthesis is most active in the blue (wavelength is 400-460 nm) and red (670-800 nm) spectral zones, the absorption of these light waves will be maximum, was confirmed by experimental data. The trend of increasing algae abundance, chlorophyll alpha concentration and spectral light attenuation in the blue and red light from the surface to the bottom during the summer season and the ice cover period at 0.13 m snow depth was noted.

AB  - Diatom species diversity in the natural diet of healthy adult green abalone (Haliotis fulgens) and pink abalone (H. corrugata) from NW Mexico was analyzed and, referenced with values of condition index and hepato-gonadic index, used respectively as indicators of the health and reproductive season for the abalone. Likewise observations were done in abalone specimens affected with withering syndrome (WS). Our hypotheses stated that: a) the diatom assemblages represented in the gut contents of H. fulgens vs. H. corrugata would show a typical structure with few abundant taxa and many rare or uncommon species; b) no difference would be found between the structure of diatom assemblages in the gut contents of H. fulgens and H. corrugata; and c) diatom assemblages in abalone specimens with WS would be similar to those of healthy specimens. To test our hypotheses we examined healthy abalones collected from February 2102 to February 2013, and specimens with WS collected from March to May 2012. All specimens were measured and weighted and their condition and hepato-gonadic indices calculated. To analyze the diatom species diversity in gut contents of the abalone, specimens from 7 sampling dates from March to September 2012, were dissected. The diatom samples were described using species relative abundances, diversity indices and similarity between samples. For this period 19 diatom taxa comprised 80% of the relative abundances; the most abundant were Cocconeis scutellum, Gomphonemopsis pseudexigua, Grammatophora gibberula, Bacillaria socialis and Striatella unipunctata. High diversity values were estimated for diatom samples in all abalone specimens. Similarity and diversity values indicate that throughout this period both abalone species fed on the same diatom assemblages available in situ. Likewise, diatom samples in the guts of specimens affected by WS represented diatom assemblages similar to those of healthy specimens. No evidence was thus at hand for rejecting our hypotheses.

AB  - High levels of environmental pollutants such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including PCB and DDT have been found in the Arctic and many of those pollutants may impair reproduction through endocrine disruption. Nevertheless, their effects on stress hormones remain poorly understood, especially in free-ranging birds. Corticosterone, the principal glucocorticoid in birds, can indirectly impair reproduction. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between POPs and reproduction through their potential consequences on different reproductive traits (breeding decision, egg-laying date, breeding success) and corticosterone secretion (baseline and stress-induced levels). We addressed those questions in an Arctic population of female black-legged kittiwakes during the pre-breeding stage and measured several legacy POPs (PCBs and pesticides: HCB,p,p'-DDE, CHL) in whole blood. POP levels were not related to breeding decision neither to breeding success, whereas females with high levels of pesticides laid their eggs earlier in the season. We found a negative relationship between POP levels and body condition index in non-breeding females. Black-legged kittiwakes with higher levels of PCB showed stronger adrenocortical response when subjected to a capture-handling stress protocol. We suggest that PCBs may disrupt corticosterone secretion whereas the positive relationship between pesticides and egg-laying date could either originate from a direct effect of pesticides or may be related to other confounding factors such as age or individual's quality. Although no direct negative reproduction output of POPs was found in this study, it is possible that the most contaminated individuals would be more sensitive to environmental stress and would be less able to maintain parental investment than less polluted individuals.

AB  - The ability of intertidal organisms to maintain their performance via molecular and physiological adjustments under low tide, seasonal fluctuations and extreme events ultimately determines population viability. Analyzing this capacity in the wild is extremely relevant since intertidal communities are under increased climate variability owing to global changes. We addressed the seasonal proteome signatures of a key intertidal species, the shrimp Palaemon elegans, in a natural setting. Shrimps were collected during spring and summer seasons at low tides and were euthanized in situ. Environmental variability was also assessed using hand-held devices and data loggers. Muscle samples were taken for 2D gel electrophoresis and protein identification through mass spectrometry. Proteome data revealed that 55 proteins (10.6% of the proteome) significantly changed between spring and summer collected shrimps, 24 of which were identified. These proteins were mostly involved in cytoskeleton remodelling, energy metabolism and transcription regulation. Overall, shrimps modulate gene expression leading to metabolic and structural adjustments related to seasonal differences in the wild (i.e. abiotic variation and possibly intrinsic cycles of reproduction and growth). This potentially promotes performance and fitness as suggested by the higher condition index in summer-collected shrimps. However, inter-individual variation (% coefficient of variation) in protein levels was quite low (min-max ranges were 0.6-8.3% in spring and 1.2-4.8% in summer), possibly suggesting reduced genetic diversity or physiological canalization. Protein plasticity is relevant to cope with present and upcoming environmental variation related to anthropogenic forcing (e.g. global change, pollution) but low inter-individual variation may limit evolutionary potential of shrimp populations.

AB  - The course of recovery in biological activity was assessed in the top 5 cm of undisturbed soil cores (29.7 cm diameter, 30 cm deep) that had been fumigated in the laboratory with methyl bromide.  The cores were returned to their original pasture and forest sites, two with a moderate and two with a high rainfall, and untreated soils at all sites served as baselines.  Sampling took place over 166 days (midsummer to midwinter).  Microbial biomass (as measured by fumigation-extraction and substrate-induced respiration procedures) and dehydrogenase activity both recovered rapidly, but remained consistently lower in the fumigated than in untreated samples at both forest sites and at the moister of the two pasture sites.  Bacterial numbers also recovered rapidly.  Fungal hyphal lengths were, on average over 166 days, 25% lower in the fumigated soils.  Levels of mineral N were initially highest in the fumigated soils, but declined with time.  Fumigation generally had no detectable effects on the subsequent rates of net N mineralization and little effect on nitrification rates.  Fumigation almost totally eliminated protozoa, with one to three species being recovered on day 0; the numbers recovered most rapidly in the moist forest soil and slowly in the dry pasture soil.  The recolonization rate of protozoan species was similar in all soils, with species numbers on day 110 being 33 and 34 in the fumigated and untreated soils, respectively.  Nematodes were eliminated by fumigation; recolonization was first detected on day 26 but by day 166, nematode numbers were still lower in fumigated than in untreated soils, the abundance being 10 and 62 g-1 soil and diversity 10 and 31 species, respectively.  Overall, the results suggest that protozoan and nematode populations and diversities could provide a useful medium-term ecological index of the recovery in comprehensive soil biological activity following major soil pollution or disturbance.

AB  - Human conversion of land cover alters biotic communities and sets the stage for ongoing change as species interact within new environments. We studied the response of a native forest specialist, the Pacific wren (Troglodytes pacificus), to immediate and ongoing environmental changes facilitated by urbanization. We found evidence of a synergistic effect of native land cover loss followed by increased aggressive interactions with a native generalist, the Bewick's wren (Thryomanes bewickii), resulting in the decline of Pacific wrens in urbanizing environments. Pacific wren relative abundance decreased dramatically during and after development, while Bewick's wrens increased and persisted at greater abundance post-relative to pre-development. Breeding territories of the two species overlapped minimally, suggesting spatial segregation either by differential resource use or territorial aggression. A comparison of territory characteristics revealed the species generally used different resources, although territory composition was increasingly similar at urbanizing sites where the species co-occurred. Territorial playback experiments confirmed that the two species interact aggressively. Analyses of body size, body condition and reproductive success did not suggest Bewick's wrens negatively impact fitness of Pacific wrens at sites where they co-occurred. In established subdivisions (>10 years old) Bewick's wrens appear to limit the abundance of Pacific wrens, however this was not yet the case at sites we studied immediately after development. Although the results of this study are not conclusive, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that new environmental gradients and communities created by urbanization increase competitive interactions among native species.

AB  - The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the increasing risks of global and local environmental crises put forward new demands to ensure national, economic, political, public ecological safety, including ecological safety of the educational space. The right to a favorable environment is one of the fundamental rights of citizens; therefore, ensuring ecological safety and comfort of the educational environment for the formation of a person focused on harmonious interaction with nature and protected from environmental threats becomes very important. The purpose of the study is aimed at the analysis of different approaches to the ecological safety of the University educational environment, the identification of mechanisms and conditions of the very process. The results of the study reveal that the system of ecological safety of the University educational environment is the combination of regulatory, training, educational, medical, recreational activities, aimed at harmonious interaction of man with the biosphere and the ecosphere. The ecological safety of the educational environment is determined by the compliance degree of the actual parameters of the environment ecological state with their optimal indicators for the preservation of the health of the educational process participants. The main elements of the mechanism to ensure environmental safety of the University educational environment are revealed: a comprehensive environmental assessment of the University and its surrounding area, environmental monitoring and effective management decisions in this area. The main conditions for the effectiveness to ensure environmental safety in the University educational environment are the use of the regulatory framework, the use of organizational and administrative impact and financial support, the unity of all participants' activity in the educational process in this area. The Materials of the article are of theoretical and practical value for the development of educational and methodical complexes on ecology and environmental pedagogy, teachers' training and retraining programs, as well as programs aimed at the formation of ecological safety of the University educational environment.

AB  - Quantifying drought variations at multi-time scales is important to assess the potential impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems, especially vulnerable desert grassland. Based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), we assessed the influences of different time-scales drought (SPEI-3, SPEI-6, SPEI-12, SPEI-24, and SPEI-48 with 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 months, respectively) on vegetation dynamics in the Qaidam River Basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Results showed that (1) temporally, annual and summer NDVI increased, while spring and autumn NDVI decreased from 1998 to 2015. Annual, spring, and summer SPEI increased, and autumn SPEI decreased. (2) Spatially, annual, spring, summer, and autumn NDVI increased in the periphery of the Basin, with 45.98%, 22.68%, 43.90%, and 30.80% of the study area, respectively. SPEI showed a reverse variation pattern with NDVI, with an obvious decreasing trend from southeast to northwest. (3) Annual vegetation growth in most areas (69.53%, 77.33%, 86.36%, 90.19%, and 85.44%) was correlated with drought at all time-scales during 1998-2015. However, high spatial and seasonal differences occurred among different time-scales, with the maximum influence in summer under SPEI24. (4) From month to annual scales, NDVI of all land cover types showed higher correlation to long-term drought of SPEI24 or SPEI48. Vegetation condition index (VCI) and SPEI were positively correlated at all time-scales and had a more obvious response in summer. The highest correlation was VCI of grassland (June-July) or forest (April-May, August-October) and SPEI48. This study contributes to exploring the effect of drought on vegetation dynamics at different time scales, further providing credible guidance for regional water resources management.

AB  - One of the decisions made by hatchery managers around the world is what degree of shading and nest depth are required to maximise the production of high-quality hatchlings at optimal sex ratios. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the effects of (1) hatchery shading and nest depth on nest temperatures and emergence lag, and (2) nest temperatures and nest depth on hatchling sex ratio and quality. In 2001, 26 Chelonia mydas clutches from Ma'Daerah beach, Terengganu, Malaysia, were relocated alternatively at depths of 50 cm and 75 cm into a 70%-shaded and a 100%-shaded hatchery. Data loggers were placed into the centre of each relocated clutch to record the temperature every hour over the course of incubation. When the hatchlings emerged, a sample of the clutch was run, measured and weighed and a separate sample was examined histologically for sex characteristics. Nest temperatures ranged between 28 degrees C and 30 degrees C and generally showed increases over the second half of incubation due to metabolic heating of the clutch. There was no significant correlation found between nest temperature and any of the hatchling parameters measured. Hatchlings from 75-cm-deep nests had a longer emergence lag (46.4 (+/- 10.2) h) than hatchlings from 50-cm-deep nests. Hatch and emergence success were similar to those of natural populations and hatchling sex ratios were male dominant, with an average of 72% males. There was a poor correlation between mean middle-third incubation temperatures and sex ratio. Hatchlings from 75-cm-deep nests had similar running speeds but lower condition index than their conspecifics from 50-cm-deep nests.

AB  - We provide an efficient tool for the processing of a large volume of data (big data) from a marine ecosystem and predicting its status, including its complex and nonlinear biological structure (biocomplexity) and its ability to remain alive or continue to exist (survivability). The Geoecological Information-Modeling System developed earlier by the authors of this paper is used for the first time as a basis for the development of the Sea Ecosystem Model that parameterizes the energy exchange between major trophic components of the sea with spatial resolution 1/6 degrees x 1/6 degrees taking into account natural and anthropogenic factors. In particular, the dependence of energy exchange processes on environmental factors is modeled with a minimum level of uncertainty. The biological components are modeled using traditional trophic balance equations, whose coefficients are determined from observational data. The simulation results for the Okhotsk Sea show the critical ecosystem states that prevail when the biocomplexity and survivability of this ecosystem reach dangerous levels. The prediction of the ecosystem status is carried out to 2100 with an accuracy of better than 79.9%. For this purpose, the complex model proposed recently by the same authors, entitled "nature-society system model", was used. Among the main results that have emerged is that the biocomplexity and survivability characteristics of this marine ecosystem will be stable over the next 100 years, regardless of the expected climate change.

AB  - The number of fish species and their biomass were evaluated in a total of 49 sites in 1993-1994 (Fig. 8). The streams were selected to involve all important right- and left-hand tributaries of the Berounka river. Tab. I shows basic data on the streams under study. The Krivoklatsko Protected Landscape Area was established on an area of 628 km(2) at the end of 1978. Forest percentage is 64 in the area concerned, forest communities mostly consist of broadleaved and mixed forests. Average temperatures range from 7.5 to 8.5 degrees C, precipitation from 480 to 580 mm. Settlements with more than 1 000 inhabitants are rather exceptional, and they are situated on the margin of the protected area. The lowest values of chemical oxygen demand (GOD) were recorded in the Klucna stream. This is in keeping with forest percentage equalling 100% in its watershed. Comparable COD values were measured in the Tytersky stream and in the Ryzava stream. The other three streams (Zbirozsky, Oupor and Vuznice) show higher COD values (particularly in spring months and in late fall), see Fig. 1. Nitrate concentrations are lowest in the Klucna stream, comparable values were determined in the Tytersky stream and Ryzava stream. Higher values, particularly in spring months, were found out in the Zbirozsky stream, in Oupor and Vuznice streams. This is related to agricultural farming especially in the spring areas of these streams and to nitrate leaching in the season without vegetation cover. Chloride concentrations are lowest in the Klucna stream. Average values of chloride concentrations recorded in the other streams are approximately twofold or threefold (Figs. 2 and 3). Sixteen fish species and the brook lamprey were determined in total in the streams under study (Tab. II). The presence of three species is related to ponds in the watersheds of the particular streams. Dominant species involve brown trout (35-100%), dace (38% in Oupor, 17% in the Tytersky stream), chub (13% in Oupor, 17% in the Zbiroisky stream). Relative abundance of other species is about 10%. The dominance of the bullhead in the Klicava stream is an exception (48%), see Fig. 4. Species diversity of ichthyocenoses in the sites where at least two species are present is smaller for all streams than is the average for Czech streams up to 50km length (Pivnicka et al., 1995). There were more species than is the above standard in some sites only in Oupor and Zbiroisky stream (Fig. 6). Fish biomass in the Krivoklatsko streams is higher than the average biomass in the streams of Bohemia and Moravia (Figs. 7 and 8). Higher biomass is produced at lower diversity and prevalence of invertvorous and piscivorous species - brown trout, gudgeon, dace, barbel, stone leach, bullhead. These species indicate fairly preserved environment of the streams under study. A preliminary estimate of biotic integrity index for fish community in the Oupor stream showed the average value of 44 scores, in the Klicava stream 46 scores out of the 50 scores reachable. The Rakovnicky stream below Mestecko (Pivnicka et al., 1995) has the overall value of biotic integrity index 25 scores. The results of multivariate regression analysis show that the number of species is significantly affected by the relative biomass of brown trout and by the number of fished sections (more locations will reflect more types of biotopes).
   A distance from the source of the stream is also at the level of significance. A relation between the species number in a stream and the effective parameters can be expressed as follows: number of fish species = 0.624 * number of fished locations + 0.327 * COD + 0.202 * distance from source - 0.053 * brown trout biomass + 1.096. The correlation ratio is 0.
   961. F-test value is also statistically significant (19.38). It suggests that the relation between the species number and the parameters studied is usable to predict a species number in the stream up to 50 km from the source of the stream.

AB  - This study provides a new methodology for simulating environmental water stress index (EWSI) that addresses environmental droughts' stochastic nature at regional and local scales. The current research used a case study of the Upper Ewaso Ngiro river basin in Kenya that possesses regional disparities attributed to climatic, biophysical, and anthropogenic variables. A stochastic modelling approach that ensembled 4D Euclidean feature space algorithm, least-squares adjustment, and iterations integrated the four environmental droughts indicators (meteorological, agricultural, socio-economic, and hydrological) into a single multivariate index called EWSI. The correlation between the simulated EWSI and initial reconnaissance drought index (RDI alpha) produced a correlation coefficient (r) of -0.93 and a p-value < 0.02. The correlation between EWSI and river discharge had a correlation coefficient of -0.89 and a p-value < 0.02. The assessment of severity revealed that 67-100% of the basin exhibited moderate to extreme environmental water stresses conditions between 1986 and 2018.

AB  - The green algal communities in podzolic soils under coniferous forest in N.E. European Russia were studied in areas that were subjected to different technogenic pollution intensities. Sixty-five green algal species belonging to 4 classes, 12 orders, 20 families and 27 genera were recorded. The algal communities in the investigated soils of the different type spruce phytocoenoses included from 15 to 38 taxa on one site. Indicator species were identified for background spruce forests (Chlamydomonas gelatinosa, Tetracystis aggregata, T. dissociata, Pseudopleurococcus botryoides, Myrmecia bisecta) and for aerotechnogenically polluted spruce forests (Actinochloris sphaerica). The results may be used for the monitoring of the ecological state of biota in soils under boreal forests of protected areas and spruce forests exposed to intense aerial technogenic pollution.

AB  - Climate change is a real, pressing and significant global problem. The concept of 'climate change vulnerability' helps us to better comprehend the cause/effect relationships behind climate change and its impact on human societies, socioeconomic sectors, and physiographical and ecological systems. In this study, multifactorial spatial modelling evaluated the vulnerability of a Mediterranean forest ecosystem to climate change and variability with regard to land degradation. This produced data and developed tools to support better decision-making and management. As a result, the geographical distribution of Environmental Vulnerability Areas (EVAs) of the forest ecosystem is the estimated Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) values. These revealed that, at current levels of environmental degradation, physical, geographical, policy enforcement, and socioeconomic conditions, the area with a "very low" degree of vulnerability covered mainly the town, its surrounding settlements and agricultural lands found principally over the low, flat travertine plateau and the plains to the east and southeast of the district. The spatial magnitude of the EVAs of the forest ecosystem under current environmental degradation was also determined. This revealed that the EVAs classed as "very low" accounted for 21% of the area of the forest ecosystem, those classed as "low" for 36%, those classed as "medium" for 20%, and those classed as "high" for 24%.

AB  - Ecological footprint (EF) forecasting is essential for dynamically evaluating human impact on earth as well as for planning for a sustainable future. In this paper, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model was developed to forecast the total ecological footprint (TEF) from 2006 to 2015. For a case study of Wuhan city, Hubei province in central China, per capita ecological footprint (EF) and biological capacity (BC) were calculated from 1988 to 2005. Partial least square (PLS) was used to select the important impact factors. We put the selected socio-economic factors as input and the TEF as output together to build RBFNN model and predict the development trends of the TEF in the following 10 years. Five-fold cross-validation was conducted to validate the model in the process of input selection and RBFNN model training. From the results, continuous increase of per capita EF (1988-2005) indicated stronger and stronger human effect on the district and Wuhan's ecological state is in the ecological deficit. Up to 2015, the district would have been bearing accumulative TEF of 24.782 million gha, which is near 2.5 times of that in 1988. Although the increase rate of gross domestic product (GDP) would be restricted in a lower level from 2006 to 2015, the urban ecological environmental burden could only respond to the socio-economic circumstances moderately.

AB  - The objective of this study was to measure and model the response time of the Eastern Canadian Diatom Index (IDEC: Indice Diatomees de l'Est du Canada), a diatom-based index of biological integrity, following substrate translocation from altered sites (nutrient-enriched) to pristine sites and vice-versa. The frequency of sampling, duration (time after substrate translocation), and variety of site conditions in the present study provide strong evidence for an accelerated response of diatoms to a degradation reflecting eutrophication (within a week in certain cases) and a slower path to recovery (up to 4 weeks). Diatom response varied as a function of trophic status; oligotrophic rivers responded rapidly to a degradation, and mesotrophic or eutrophic rivers responded more slowly to an amelioration of the conditions. Variation in response time as a function of trophic status seemed to be partly linked to the diversity and complexity of the assemblages. The less diverse assemblages observed in oligotrophic waters were highly sensitive to nutrient enrichment, whereas the more diverse assemblages sampled in mesotrophic-eutrophic rivers were less sensitive to nutrient fluctuations, and major variations in nutrient concentrations took a longer time to induce a change in index values.

AB  - Continental ostracode occurrences reflect salinity, solute composition, temperature, flow conditions, and other environmental properties of the water they inhabit. Their occurrences also reflect the variability of many of these environmental parameters. Environmental tolerance indices (ETIs) offer a new way to express the nature of an ostracode's environment. As defined herein, ETIs range in value from zero to one, and may be calculated for continuous and binary variables. For continuous variables such as salinity, the ETI is the ratio of the range of values of salinity tolerated by an ostracode to the total range of salinity values from a representative database. In this investigation, the database of continuous variables consists of information from 341 sites located throughout the United States. Binary ETIs indicate whether an environmental variable such as flowing water affects ostracode presence or absence. The binary database consists of information from 784 sites primarily from Illinois, USA. ETIs were developed in this investigation to interpret paleohydrological changes implied by fossil ostracode successions. ETI profiles may be cast in terms of a weighted average, or on presence/absence. The profiles express ostracode tolerance of environmental parameters such as salinity or currents. Tolerance of a wide range of values is taken to indicate shallow water because shallow environments are conducive to thermal variability, short-term water residence, and the development of currents from wind-driven waves.

AB  - 1. We tested ecological hypotheses about timing of breeding and reproductive effort in birds, by analysing > 15-year data sets for individually marked females in three species of Latvian ducks (northern shoveler, tufted duck, common pochard).
   2. Duckling survival and recruitment declined with advancing hatch date in pochard and tufted duck. after controlling for effects of female age and other factors with path analysis, a novel finding which indicates that fitness advantages associated with early hatching extended beyond the prefledging period. Logistic regression analysis suggested further that individual duckling prefledging survival was moderate in the earliest phase of the breeding season, greatest in mid-season and lowest later on.
   3. However. selection acting against early hatched ducklings was surpassed by strong directional selection favouring recruitment of the earliest hatching females, The absolute and relative numbers of female recruits produced by a breeding female declined sharply with advancing hatch date in all species.
   4. Unlike previous studies, an hypothesized intraspecific trade-off between duckling mass and brood size was detected, being very robust in two of three species.
   5. Unexpectedly, female age effects on recruitment were manifested only indirectly by several pathways. the most important being the earlier hatching dates of older females. Size-adjusted body mass (i.e. condition index) was positively related to reproductive success. and was 2-8-fold more influential than female size (indexed by wing length).
   6. Overall, fecundity-independent variables (e.g. hatching date, weather, indices of duckling production and habitat quality) generally had 2-10 times greater influence on recruitment rates than did fecundity-dependent variables such as female size or condition, duckling mass and brood size, suggesting a critical role for external environmental factors vs. individual female-specific traits in the recruitment process.

AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate effects of environmental sensitivity of milk production traits for several environmental parameters and to investigate the impact of combining traits with different environmental sensitivity in an economic index. Variance components and breeding values were estimated for milk, fat, and protein yield, and fat and protein percentage by applying a random regression on values of an environmental parameter for each sire. Fourteen environmental parameters were defined and fitted to data consisting of 151,696 heifers in 6780 herds in The Netherlands with first-lactation records for milk production, somatic cell count, body condition score, and number of inseminations. Milk, fat, and protein yield showed environmental sensitivity in combination with 12 environmental parameters. Herd-year averages of protein, body condition score, age at calving, calving interval, and peak date of calving explained most genotype by environment interaction, mainly resulting from scaling effects. Almost all genetic correlations across environments were 0.99 or higher. Although heterogeneity of genetic variances was considerable, heterogeneity of heritabilities was limited. Scaling had a large effect on the weights of the economic index, but environmental sensitivities of milk, fat, and protein yields were approximately of equal magnitude. Consequently, very little reranking occurred based on the economic index.

AB  - Comparisons involving 28 random F-2-derived F-6 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines from the cross, 'Nacozari'/'Seri 82', suggested that advanced derivatives with the 1BL/1RS chromosome translocation possess superior agronomic performance in both full and reduced irrigation conditions when compared with 1B derivatives. This performance advantage was attributed to high grain yield, above-ground biomass at maturity, grains/spike, 1000-grain weight and test weight. The 1BL/1RS lines were shorter with delayed flowering and maturity. The superiority of the 1BL/1RS translocation group on grains/m(2) was expressed only under the full irrigation environment. Higher harvest index, longer spike-length and grain-filling period were detected only under reduced irrigation conditions. A significant grain yield relationship with test weight was detected only among the 1BL/1RS genotypes, indicating that they possess heavier and plumper grains than the 1B genotypes.

AB  - Ecological regime shifts are rapid, Potentially devastating changes in ecosystem state that last for extended periods of time. Previous theoretical work has generated numerous early-warning indicators of regime shifts; some of which have been empirically demonstrated in closed ecological systems. Here we evaluated a suite of indicators using a previously studied three-species model under conditions likely to be observed in field studies of open ecological systems. Simulations included large correlated fluctuations in extrinsic noise and a rapidly changing driving variable, while indicators were calculated using sparsely sampled time series. All indicators performed poorly under these conditions, particularly during the beginning of the regime shift. Overall, the best performing indicator was a rise in variance. Future research should focus on methods for setting benchmark values of early warning indicators and for identifying indicators that work for sparsely sampled data sets.

AB  - Relevance. Quantitative assessment of ecological and geochemical state of surface waters and their formation factors is one of the most important stages of water resources management which determines the effectiveness of measures for integrated use and protection of waters.
   The aim of the research is the quantitative assessment of regional features of the current ecological and geochemical state of surface water bodies in the taiga zone of Western Siberia.
   Methods: methods of water chemical composition researches (titrimetric, turbidimetric, photometric, ion chromatography, inversion-voltamperometric, atomic absorption, mass spectrometric with inductively coupled plasma); statistical methods.
   Results and conclusions. The authors have considered regional features of ecological and geochemical state of surface water bodies in taiga zone of Western Siberia by the results of analysis of the materials of long-term hydrochemical observations of Roshydromet and other organizations. It is shown that chemical composition of surface waters in the region is largely determined by the natural wetland processes, resulting in an excess of fishery and drinking quality standards for the pH value, the content of NH4+, Fe, Al, Mn, phenols, substances identified as "petroleum products", as well as fishery standards - for the content of NO2-, phosphates, Cu, Zn and drinking - the value of bichromate and permanganate oxidability. It is established that anthropogenic influence is reliably detected by increasing the chloride ion content (within the maximum permissible concentrations, but 2-3 times higher than the background values). The authors developed the recommendations on hydrochemical monitoring. On the basis of regional background concentrations of pollutants and water discharge on the regime stations of Siberian rivers the degree of dilution of wastewater dropped into the rivers of strongly swampy watersheds can be determined. These calculations should be the basis for the approved standards of permissible impacts on the rivers of the taiga zone of Western Siberia.

AB  - This study was accomplished under field conditions, to evaluate the use and efficiency of nitrogen uptake, through various indexes, in pasture of Brachiaria brizantha. The experiment was conduced at the Model Farm of the Goias State University in a distrophic Dark Red Latosol, from 2003 July to 2006 March. The experimental design was randon blocks, with three replicates. The treatments were placed in parcels characterized by a 2x4 factorial, with two sources of N (ammonium sulfate and urea) and four doses of N (0, 100, 200 and 300 kg/ha/year). In sub - parcel, the treatments were represented per years (2004, 2005 and 2006) refering to time of pasture recovery. The use of nitrogen was divided in three times, after each cut evaluation of the forage pasture. Three cuts were made per year, evaluating dry mass and N accumulation in the tissue. Nitrogen Utilization Efficiency, Recovery from the N Applied, Agronomic Efficiency from the N Applied, Physiological or Biological Efficiency indexes were evaluated. The results showed that EUN increased, while RNA, EA and EF reduced with the increase in the N doses applied. In all cases, the indexes were influenced by the years of recovery the herbage, and not by the sources of N.

AB  - To assess the ongoing effects of anthropogenic pollutants on the Winter Quarters Bay (WQB) fauna, resident Trematomus hansoni and T. hansoni from a control site, Backdoor Bay (BDB) were caught. A suite of biomarkers, namely ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD), pentoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (PROD), as well as biliary naphthalene and phenanthrene were measured. EROD activity was significantly higher in the WQB resident T. hansoni, while the remaining parameters were unaffected, and no differences in the hepatosomatic index or condition factor were evident. Additionally, Trematomus bernacchii were collected from BDB and placed in cages within WQB and at Cape Armitage (another control site near McMurdo Station) for 2 and 4 weeks. No differences in EROD and PROD activities were found between any of the caged T. bernacchii. Naphthalene was significantly elevated in WQB caged T. bernacchii after both 2 and 4 weeks even though phenanthrene was elevated in WQB caged fish only after 4 weeks. Again, there were no significant morphological differences between groups. It is evident from both the resident and caged fish that the legacy left by the pollution in WQB is still affecting the local marine fauna. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indicators of sustainable development of the city represent the quality of the urban environment, creation of an eco-friendly urban environment is up-to-date trend of modernity. The preservation of soil fertility, the quality of land resources, their rational use, as well as the maintenance and conservation of vegetation cover are one of the indicators of the ecological aspects of sustainable development. The complex assessment of an urbanized environment state consists of condition assessments of many components, one of which is a soil cover. In the study of this component, a lot of attention was paid to microbiological research. The microbiota, the microbiological parameters of the soil cover, and its biological activity are first changed under the anthropogenic impact; so, many researchers consider them to be the most sensitive indicators of soil contamination.

AB  - This study discusses the influence of temperature on infrared optical system and introduced the principle and method of non-thermal design. Based on the requirements of orbital thermal environment and technical indexes of a space-based infrared imaging system, this study conducts the thermal environment adaptability design of an imaging system. The non-thermal design of the optical system is carried out by combining active and passive methods, and thermal design and thermal analysis are carried out for the thermal environment of space orbit in which the system works. Finally, the final imaging system is validated by the thermal imaging experiment. The experimental results show that the system can eliminate the influence of temperature change on image quality in the temperature range of -20 similar to+50 degrees C, and can adapt to the thermal environment of space orbit. The imaging quality can meet the application requirements under different temperature conditions.

AB  - Seminal work by Weitzman [Prices vs. quantities, Rev. Econ. Stud. 41 (1974) 477-491] revealed prices are preferred to quantities when marginal benefits are relatively flat compared to marginal costs. We extend this comparison to indexed policies, where quantities are proportional to an index, such as output. We find that policy preferences hinge on additional parameters describing the first and second moments of the index and the ex post optimal quantity level. When the ratio of these variables' coefficients of variation divided by their correlation is less than approximately two, indexed quantities are preferred to fixed quantities. A slightly more complex condition determines when indexed quantities are preferred to prices. Applied to climate change policy, we find that the range of variation and correlation in country-level carbon dioxide emissions and GDP suggests the ranking of an emissions intensity cap (indexed to GDP) compared to a fixed emission cap is not uniform across Countries: neither policy clearly dominates the other.

AB  - It is important to manage water resources of the upper Yellow River basin for the new Silk Road economic belt. In recent decades, under the combined human activities and influence of climate, the hydrologic regime of the upper Yellow River basin shows remarkable variations that have caused many issues. So potential human indicated influence has been drawing increasing attention from hydrologists and local governments. The aim of this study is to determine the changes in the hydrological characteristic parameters and mean annual runoff series of the upper Yellow River basin. This paper took the representative Lanzhou Station in the upstream Yellow River as an example, used the TFPW-MK mutation test and rank sum test to analyze the location of the variation points of hydrological series. By contrasting two different analysis results between natural and measured river runoff series, the impacts of human activities on the long-term hydrological regime were investigated. The variation range of hydrological ecological indexes before and after variation were analyzed by the method of indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA). The results show: a) the hydrological series of Lanzhou Station is a significant decreasing trend can be observed in the natural stream flow series in 1985 with a high degree of hydrological variability, while human activities play an important role; b) various ecological indicators have changed in different degrees that have caused the deterioration of ecological conditions around 1985; and c) continuous decreasing stream flow in the upper Yellow River basin will trigger serious shortages of fresh water in the future, which may challenge the sustainability and safety of water resource development in the river basin, and should be paid great attention before 2020. Variation analysis and diagnosis of eco-hydrological indexes in the upper reaches of the Yellow River can provide a basis for the development, utilization, and protection of water resources in this area.

AB  - We subjected neonate Desert Tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) that hatched inside fenced, predator-resistant field enclosures containing natural vegetation to either a natural rainfall regime or a regime of natural rainfall plus irrigation (supplemental precipitation) over a five-year period, to test the hypothesis that mimicking an above-average rainfall regime in years of average or low natural rainfall will improve rates of survival and growth. We also tested the hypothesis that survivorship of released 1-yr olds will be high, due to a decline in predation susceptibility once the vulnerable nesting and hatchling phases are completed. Survivorship inside the enclosures during the first year of life was high (averaging 90%) in both groups, even during a record low rainfall year, but growth rates were always substantially higher (2 to 16-x greater) in rain-supplemented juveniles. Body condition index (CI) measurements indicated that first-year juveniles without added rain were able to maintain body conditions similar to rain-supplemented juveniles during two average rainfall years, but not during a drought year. Older juveniles without added rain died during the latter part of the 16 mo drought, suggesting that the high drought survivorship of first-year non-supplemented juveniles may be related to the yolk they carried after hatching, along with possible behavioral and physiological differences. Nearly all yearlings that were set free (in autumn) were dead within 6 mo, regardless of whether they had supplemental rain or not during their first year inside enclosures, and regardless of whether they were released near the head-start enclosures or a kilometer away. The main cause of mortality was predation, primarily by ravens. The poor survival of released yearling tortoises and the drought-induced death of nearly all older captive juveniles raised without added precipitation lead us to recommend that rain supplementation and delayed release be incorporated in the protocol for head-starting Desert Tortoises.

AB  - The California Channel Islands (CCI) provide essential nesting habitat for a significant portion of the world's Ashy Storm-Petrel Oceanodroma homochroa (ASSP) breeding population, but true abundance at this locality is not well known. Land-based nocturnal mistnetting has been conducted sporadically in the CCI since 1976, with variation in techniques and methods. Using a standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is one of the few methods available to monitor trends in relative abundance, but there currently are no guidelines for a standardized, repeatable approach for the CCI. During 2004-2007, I conducted mist-netting for ASSP at three colony sites within the CCI: Scorpion Rock (SR), Santa Barbara Island (SBI). and Prince Island (PI). During 47 site-nights (22 sessions), I obtained 1 177 unique captures, including 34 recaptures (2.9%) of previously banded individuals. ASSP captured at all three islands showed peak proportions of fully developed incubation patches in July and August. ASSP captured in the CCI had 5%-9% lower body mass than individuals captured off central California during the early 1970s; it is not known whether this difference reflects natural inter-annual variation or differences in body condition. ASSP from SBI had the lowest body condition index (BCI) compared with those from PI and SR, indicating different foraging environments. Overall, 22 netting-sessions at three islands yielded a power of 84% to detect a 30% lesser CPUE; 19 sessions would be required in a future effort to evaluate this level of change. Evaluation of additional factors that affect CPUE and other independent measures of abundance or attendance should be included in future mist-netting efforts.

AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) resulting from extensive coal mining throughout Appalachia since the 1800s has caused a legacy of severe acid and dissolved metal loads to thousands of stream miles, which has critically impacted aquatic life and ecological attributes. Relationships of diatoms and macroinvertebrates with AMD have been established, but no index specifically designed to quantify AMD impacts using diatoms has been created, nor have the response of multiple organism groups been compared for their utility as indices assessing AMD severity.
   For the purpose of developing an effective assessment and management strategy for AMD impacted streams, this study created and tested a multi-metric AMD-diatom index of biotic integrity (AMD-DIBI) and compared its response to AMD severity with an already established multi-metric macroinvertebrate community index (ICI). In 2006,41 sites in southeast Ohio were sampled that represented an AMD impact gradient and non-AMD impacted reference sites. Metrics comprising the AMD-DIBI were selected based on their responsiveness to AMD and nutrient impacts. In the following year, the AMD-DIBI and its metrics were tested on a validation dataset consisting of 18 sites in an AMD impacted watershed. Results indicated a significant correlation between AMD-DIBI and ICI scores, and both indices and all metrics were strongly correlated with water chemistry variables indicative of AMD pollution (P < 0.05). Stepwise multiple regression selected alkalinity and conductivity as most influential to AMD-DIBI (adjusted r(2) = 0.70) and ICI scores (adjusted r(2) = 0.66). Narrative classes (e.g., Poor, Fair, Good, and Excellent) defined by index scores provided effective classifications of AMD severity. When tested on the watershed scale, AMD-DIBI and its metrics very successfully quantified AMD gradients and coal mining impacts as indicated by canonical correspondence analysis. This newly developed AMD-DIBI will be very useful for assessing impairment, sensitivity, and recovery of diatom communities in streams damaged or threatened by coal mining activities. In addition, because the AMD-DIBI was very responsive to a gradient of AMD pollution, it could be used in future studies measuring the long-term Status of streams and effectiveness of various remediation methods. This study highlights the responsive power of diatom-based metrics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Changes in sediment quality, with special reference to benthic habitat conditions resulting from macroalgae overgrowth, were studied in the Venice Lagoon, Italy Data were collected biweekly in spring and summer from 1993 to 1998 and from 2001 to 2002, as part of the macroalgae growth control strategies managed by the Venice Water Authority-Consorzio Venezia Nuova. Benthic habitat conditions were studied by means of Sediment Profile Imaging, which allowed the collection of several variables: aRPD (apparent redox potential discontinuity), prism penetration depth, presence of anoxia on the surface of the sediment, presence of reduced gas bubbles, stage of benthic colonization. All these variables led to the calculation of an environmental index (Organism-Sediment Index, OSI), which was then related to physical variables and macroalgae abundance. Until 1996, the overall benthic habitat of the Venice Lagoon showed almost stressed conditions; from 1997, the seaweed biomass rapidly declined and the OSI increased significantly. The OSI seemed to be affected by seaweed biomass, sediment compactness and water depth. Macroalgae biomass greater than 4.5 kg/m(2) led to the complete disappearance of stage III of benthic colonization; values as low as 0.70 kg m(2) already had a severe impact on recolonization. SPI attributes indicated the main mechanisms that could have contributed to the benthic quality: seaweed proliferation is often followed by rapid decay of macroalgae biomass, especially when present in large amounts. The decrease in seaweed biomass often results in oxygen depletion in the water column and thus in the sediment, preventing complete benthic colonization. This research confirms the importance of in situ rapid reconnaissance surveys to assess the impact of eutrophication on the benthic habitat. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spatial relationships between land uses and river-water quality measured with biological, water chemistry, and habitat indicators were analyzed in the Little Miami River watershed, OH, USA. Data obtained from various federal and slate agencies were integrated with Geographic Information System spatial analysis functions. After statistically analyzing the spatial patterns of the wafer qualify in receiving rivers and land uses and other point pollution sources in the watershed, the results showed that the water biotic qualify did not degrade significantly below wastewater treatment plants. However, significantly lower water quality was found in areas downstream from high human impact areas where urban land was dominated or near point pollution sources. The study exhibits the importance of integrating water-quality management and land-use planning. Planners and policy-makers at different levels should bring stakeholders together, based on the understanding of land-water relationship in a watershed to prevent pollution from happening and to plan for a sustainable future.

AB  - Spontaneous growth of native vegetation in abandoned metal(loid) mine tailings can be valuable for phytomanagement restoration projects. This study aimed to assess the degree to which spontaneous plant colonization of abandoned metal(loid) mine tailings from Mediterranean semiarid areas led to functional soil improvement, and to identify, if possible, a critical level indicating that this functionality was moving towards that of the vegetated soils from the surroundings. Vegetation ecological indexes, plant life forms and species functional roles, together with physicochemical and functional soils parameters, were studied in metal(loid) mine tailings abandoned similar to 40 years ago and surrounding forests in SE Spain. Vegetation patches showed only small differences in physicochemical parameters related to soil abiotic stress conditions (pH, salinity and metals), regardless of the vegetation. However, vegetation patches with greater species diversity and richness and presence of plants with contrasted life forms and functional traits that facilitate the growth of less stress-tolerant species showed an increase of the soil microbial functionality (higher microbial biomass C, (3-glucosidase activity, bacterial metabolic activity and functional diversity). Moreover, these vegetation patches showed a functional soil status comparable to that of the forests outside the mine tailings. In this sense, the present study showed the value of preserving these vegetation patches since they may act as nucleation spots favoring positive plant-soil feedbacks that may help to accelerate the functional recovery of these degraded areas. Furthermore, strategies to promote the creation of new vegetation patches including a variety of species with contrasted life forms and functional traits should be considered in phytomanagement restoration projects for abandoned metal(loid) mine tailings.

AB  - Biomonitoring of aquatic environments requires new tools to characterize the effects of pollutants on living organisms. Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) from the same site in north-eastern France were caged for two months, upstream and downstream of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the international watershed of the Meuse (Charleville-Mezieres "CM" in France, Namur "Nam" and Charleroi "Cr" in Belgium). The aim was to test H-1-NMR metabolomics for the assessment of water bodies' quality. The metabolomic approach was combined with a more "classical" one, i.e., the measurement of a range of energy biomarkers: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lipase, acid phosphatase (ACP) and amylase activities, condition index (CI), total reserves, electron transport system (ETS) activity and cellular energy allocation (CEA). Five of the eight energy biomarkers were significantly impacted (LDH, ACP, lipase, total reserves and ETS), without a clear pattern between sites (Up and Down) and stations (CM, Nam and Cr). The metabolomic approach revealed variations among the three stations, and also between the upstream and downstream of Nam and CM WWTPs. A total of 28 known metabolites was detected, among which four (lactate, glycine, maltose and glutamate) explained the observed metabolome variations between sites and stations, in accordance with chemical exposure levels. Metabolome changes suggest that zebra mussel exposure to field contamination could alter their osmoregulation and anaerobic metabolism capacities. This study reveals that lactate is a potential biomarker of interest, and 1H-NMR metabolomics can be an efficient approach to assess the health status of zebra mussels in the biomonitoring of aquatic environments.

AB  - Vegetation growth on the Tibetan Plateau is strongly affected by large-scale climate variability, particularly the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, potential temporal changes in both the direction and strength of relationships between regional vegetation growth and large-scale climate variability remain poorly understood. Here we quantify temporal changes in these relationships during 1982-2012, using satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index, global ecosystem model simulations of net primary productivity, regional tree ring chronologies, and PDO and NAO indexes. We found consistent weakening relationships between mean growing-season (April-October) normalized difference vegetation index and both PDO and NAO. A similar pattern was also found in the temporal relationship between net primary productivity and PDO. Such weakening relationships were partly attributable to weakening regional summer atmospheric circulation and its causal effects on changes in hydrothermal conditions over the Tibetan Plateau. These findings highlight a varying coupling of regional vegetation growth to large-scale climate variability at the interannual/decadal scale during past decades, and this feature should be considered in future prediction of terrestrial vegetation growth in response to shifting climate regime.

AB  - The present study was conducted to establish the seasonal changes of the macrozoobenthic communities in different habitats, within the Srebarna Lake, during the period 2009-2011. The lowest value of the total abundance was recorded during the spring of 2011 in the central open water body, where unfavorable environmental conditions were recorded.
   In the peripheral zones the more diversified habitat structure and availability of refuges against fish predation were prerequisites for higher species richness and diversity of the macrozoobenthos communities, as well as for higher total abundance. In the peripheral pools the highest values of both the total abundance and species richness were found in spring.
   Sorensen's similarity coefficient has shown clear differences between the taxonomic composition of macrozoobenthos in the main distinguished types of habitats - central open water body, peripheral pools within the lake area and a peripheral pool close to the lake. The maximum species similarity was found between spring and summer samples from the central part of the lake. Both indices, percentage of Oligochaeta and PETI, determined clear seasonal changes in ecological state assessment.

AB  - Exurban development (low-density development in rural areas) can significantly alter wildlife community composition, but it is largely unknown whether it also affects wildlife at the individual level. We investigated individual-level impacts of exurban development in New York State's Adirondack Park by comparing the physiological condition of 62 male oven-birds (Seiurus aurocapillus) breeding in forests with low-density housing development with those in contiguous forests. We used hematocrit (HCT) volume and plasma triglyceride (TRIG) levels to compare energetic condition, plasma uric acid (UA) and total plasma protein (TPP) levels to compare diet quality, and heterophil:lymphocyte ratios (H:L) to compare chronic stress. HCT was the only parameter to differ, with birds near houses exhibiting lower values. The comparable TRIG, UA, and TPP that we found between treatment types suggest that ovenbird food quality and availability are unaffected by exurban development in our study area. Similar H:L suggests that homeowner activities do not significantly change chronic stressors faced by breeding male ovenbirds. We also found no difference in body mass, body size, or age ratio to indicate that habitats in either treatment type were in higher demand or more difficult to acquire. Although our results suggest that exurban development does not reduce habitat quality for male ovenbirds in a way that affects their condition, we caution that it may still ultimately reduce fitness by attracting synanthropic predators. Further work is needed to better understand the impacts of exurban development on wildlife at all levels and provide science-based information needed to meet conservation challenges in rapidly developing exurban areas.

Sampling has been performed in sections located in the middle and in the storage dam in March, June and October in order to determine the ecological state of the Tismana Downstream Storage Reservoir. Environmental status assessment was based on the values obtained for quality indicators monitored and by applying methodologies for assessment under the Water Framework Directive 60/2000/EC. The ecological status was determined by the worst indicator. The followings physico-chemical quality elements such as lake acidification status, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen (COD-Cr), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) and nutrients regime have been monitored. The monitoring results showed that, in terms of the general physical-chemical indicators, Tismana Downstream Storage Reservoir has good ecological potential.

AB  - Understanding the future impacts of climate and land use change are critical for long-term biodiversity conservation. We developed and compared two indices to assess the vulnerability of stream fish in Missouri, USA based on species environmental tolerances, rarity, range size, dispersal ability and on the average connectivity of the streams occupied by each species. These two indices differed in how environmental tolerance was classified (i.e., vulnerability to habitat alteration, changes in stream temperature, and changes to flow regimes). Environmental tolerance was classified based on measured species responses to habitat alteration, and extremes in stream temperatures and flow conditions for one index, while environmental tolerance for the second index was based on species' traits. The indices were compared to determine if vulnerability scores differed by index or state listing status. We also evaluated the spatial distribution of species classified as vulnerable to habitat alteration, changes in stream temperature, and change in flow regimes. Vulnerability scores were calculated for all 133 species with the trait association index, while only 101 species were evaluated using the species response index, because 32 species lacked data to analyze for a response. Scores from the trait association index were greater than the species response index. This is likely due to the species response index's inability to evaluate many rare species, which generally had high vulnerability scores for the trait association index. The indices were consistent in classifying vulnerability to habitat alteration, but varied in their classification of vulnerability due to increases in stream temperature and alterations to flow regimes, likely because extremes in current climate may not fully capture future conditions and their influence on stream fish communities. Both indices showed higher mean vulnerability scores for listed species than unlisted species, which provided a coarse measure of validation. Our indices classified species identified as being in need of conservation by the state of Missouri as highly vulnerable. The distribution of vulnerable species in Missouri showed consistent patterns between indices, with the more forest-dominated, groundwater fed streams in the Ozark subregion generally having higher numbers and proportions of vulnerable species per site than subregions that were agriculturally dominated with more overland flow. These results suggest that both indices will identify similar habitats as conservation action targets despite discrepancies in the classification of vulnerable species. Our vulnerability assessment provides a framework that can be refined and used in other regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impact of the closed Kairiai municipal landfill located near the Siauliai City (Lithuania) on components (water, bottom sediments and macrophytes) of the neighboring aquatic ecosystem, into which the leachate from the landfill is probably released, was investigated. Heavy metals (HMs) were chosen as ones of the main persistent pollutants detected in the leachate. The contents of HMs in water, bottom sediments and macrophytes were measured and the HM migration and distribution between the ecosystem components were established. It was found that Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Fe are strongly and positively correlated with each other in the tested macrophytes and in bottom sediments. Calculation of the enrichment factor confirmed that the increase of BM concentration in sediments of the tested water body is obviously caused by the release of the leachate from the landfill. It was established that sediments and macrophytes perform the role of a natural filter or biogeochemical barrier which holds migration of permanent and persistent pollutants such as HMs in the water body. The investigation confirmed that macrophytes are very important element in the self-cleaning processes of water bodies and could be used as biogeochemical indicators for the assessment of ecological-geochemical state of the aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - In this paper, we report on the pollution in the coastal zone of the South-Eastern Baltic Sea (Russian coast). It was studied through a range of methods, including analyses potential water quality indicators (WQIs) and potentially harmful elements (PHEs). A contamination factor and modified degree of contamination were used for describing the contamination of the sediments by toxic substances. Special attention was paid to activity of the Kaliningrad Amber Combine (KAC), the biggest world amber mining company, located onshore close to the coastal zone (Kaliningrad Region). The amber extraction contribution to the ecological state of the coastal zone was estimated. Contamination of the quarry by metals (Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Pb, Zn) was comparable with contamination of abrasion bench. The pollution of the western coastal zone of the Sambia Peninsula is caused both by land-based anthropogenic developments (including KAC) and natural processes (coastal abrasion).

AB  - Predicted mean vote (PMV) is a well-known thermal comfort index with four environmental variables (air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, and average radiation temperature) and two human factors (metabolic rate and clothing thermal resistance). This paper presents a novel computer-aided thermal comfort measurement system with PMV, which combined the advanced sensors with the virtual instrument technology. The system software is developed using the LabVIEW platform. The measured data can be transmitted to the server-computer in a data center and displayed on a web page through the Internet. The impact of the measurement error of each environmental variable on PMV is analyzed via MATLAB. The system tests were conducted under the certain environmental conditions and Monte Carlo method is deployed to analyze the PMV measurement uncertainty. The experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system, and confirm that the measurement uncertainty of PMV is not a constant, and varies with the environment changes.

AB  - Intracranial pressure waveforms (ICPWF) in head injured patients vary with the nature and severity of injury.  Clinical interpretation of ICPWF shape is not defined.  Spectral analysis provides an objective method of measuring changes in waveform shape, but the indices most suitable for clinical use remain unknown.  Spectral analysis has been applied to ICPWF recorded from 30 patients with head injury, classified on clinical grounds into good, poor and intermediate groups.  Normalized indices derived from ratios of certain characteristics of the ICP waveform to those of the arterial pressure (AP) waveform, were different (P < 0.05) in all groups.  A simple index examined was the harmonic count ratio (Nc:Na) which decreased with increasing severity of injury.  ICP/AP harmonic transfer functions were derived, and demonstrated a peaked response in the range 10-12 Hz.  Increasing attenuation of this peaked response occurred with increasing severity of injury.  These results suggest that transfer functions may be a clinically useful index of intracranial conditions.

AB  - In this study, living (Rose Bengal stained) foraminiferal faunas from 31 stations along the entire French Mediterranean Sea coast except Corsica have been analysed. In the context of the Water Framework Directive, the aim was to develop a biotic index to evaluate the benthic ecosystem quality. Therefore, different faunal parameters (diversity indices, wall structure proportion, and indicative species groups) have been tested to determine their relevance as indicators of environmental conditions. The best results are obtained with a biotic index based on the relative proportion of stress-tolerant taxa. For ecosystem quality evaluation, it is essential to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic eutrophication phenomena. In order to do so, we applied a correction on our biotic index, using the expected percentage of stress-tolerant species in natural environments, in function of sediment grain size (percentage <63 mu m). Finally, a comparison of the different faunal parameters calculated for two different sediment intervals (0-1 and 0-4 cm) indicates clearly that the analysis of the uppermost centimetre of the sediment is sufficient to obtain relevant information needed for bio-monitoring purposes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance and the variability between parental lines of broiler chicken reared in different environments, considering the genotype and environment interaction. Performance and morphometric traits of parental lines of commercial broiler chicken reared up to the age of 42 days in a complete-controlled environment of a breeding farm, in usual conditions of broiler chicken production system and in stress environment conditions were evaluated. Indexes of thermal comfort (temperature and humidity and enthalpy) were used to evaluate the internal microclimate of the instalations, where the birds were reared. Comparison of averages of performance (body weight and carcass yield) and morphometric (back and leg featherings) traits of parental lines indicated they differed according to the rearing environment. Body weight and carcass yield were higher for male than for female lines, which presented better back and leg feathering than the male lineages.

AB  - Some biological aspects of Lutjanus peru (Pisces: Lutjanidae) collected from Bufadero Bay in Michoacan, Mexico, were analyzed. Scale analysis allowed determining four growth rings. Similar data were obtained with an indirect method (kernel density estimates). Results of von Bertalanffy's growth equation obtained by simple linear method were: L-infinity = 81.12 cm, W-infinity = 4,839 g, K = 0.24 years(-1) and t(o) = -0.39 years. The maximum values of the repletion index and condition factor occurred during February, April and June. Spawning peaks occurred between February and August. Recruitment periods in the area were from January to July for those born in August, and August to December for the ones born in February. Recruitment length of the fishing gear is 18 cm which occurs after age one. The gonadosomatic index is inversely proportional to the hepatosomatic index. Length of first sexual maturity is 25.45 cm. Longevity of L. peru is estimated to be at least 12 years. In Bufadero Bay, 65.84% of the catch is on sexually immature organisms, therefore we suggest that fishing captures should consider specimens larger than 45 cm (age 3 years) and a closed season for August and September.

AB  - Determination of the optimum harvest window plays a key role in the agro-food chain as the quality of fruit depends on the right harvesting time and appropriate storage conditions during the postharvest period. Usually, indices based on destructive measurements are used for this purpose, like the De Jager Index (PFW-1), FARS index and the most popular Streif Index. In this study, we proposed a biospeckle method for the evaluation of the optimum harvest window (OHW) of the "Ligol" and "Szampion" apple cultivars. The experiment involved eight different maturity stages, of which four were followed by long cold storage and shelf life to assist the determination of the optimum harvest window. The biospeckle activity was studied in relation to standard quality attributes (firmness, acidity, starch, soluble solids content, Streif Index) and physiological parameters (respiration and ethylene emission) of both apple cultivars. Changes of biospeckle activity (BA) over time showed moderate relationships with biochemical changes during apple maturation and ripening. The harvest date suggested by the Streif Index and postharvest quality indicators matched with characteristic decrease in BA. The ability of biospeckle method to characterize the biological state of apples was confirmed by significant correlations of BA with firmness, starch index, total soluble solids and Streif Index, as well as good match with changes in carbon dioxide and ethylene emission. However, it should be noted that correlations between variables changing over time are not as meaningful as independent observations. Also, it is a well-known property of the Pearson's correlation that its value is highly susceptible to outlier data. Due to its non-selective nature the BA reflected only the current biological state of the fruit and could be affected by many other factors. The investigations showed that the optimum harvest window for apples was indicated by the characteristic drop of BA during pre-harvest development. Despite this, at the current state of development the BA method cannot be used as an indicator alone. Due to rather poor results for prediction in OHW the BA measurements should be supported by other destructive methods to compensate its low selectivity.

AB  - In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm-based methodology to quantify agricultural and water management practices from remote sensing (RS) data in a mixed-pixel environment. First, we formulated a linear mixture model for low spatial resolution RS data where we considered three agricultural land uses as dominant inside the pixel-rainfed, irrigated with two, and three croppings a year; the mixing parameters we considered were the sowing dates, area fractions of agricultural land uses in the pixel, and their corresponding water management practices. Then, we carried out numerical experiments to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach. In the process, the mixing parameters were parameterized by data assimilation using evapotranspiration and leaf area index as conditioning criteria. The soil-water-atmosphere-plant system model SWAP was used to simulate the dynamics of these two biophysical variables in the pixel. The results of our numerical experiments showed that it is possible to derive some sub-pixel information from low spatial resolution data e.g. the existing agricultural and water management practices in a region, which are relevant for regional agricultural monitoring programs.

AB  - A combination of modelling tools was applied to simulate the impacts of the future Courseulles-sur-mer offshore wind farm (OWF) construction (Bay of Seine, English Channel) on the ecosystem structure and functioning. To do so, food-web models of the ecosystem under three scenarios were constructed to investigate the effect caused by the OWF of added substrate (reef effect), fishing restriction (reserve effect), and their combined effect. Further, Ecological Network Analysis indices and Mean Trophic Level were derived to investigate their suitability for detecting changes in the ecosystem state. Our analysis suggests changes in the ecosystem structure and functioning after the OWF construction, the ecosystem maturity was predicted to increase, but no alterations in its overall resilience capacity.

AB  - The present study investigated the impacts of urban geometry on incident solar radiation on building envelopes. A three-dimensional model was developed and applied to examine these relationships, with implications for building landscapes as a potential heat source for urban heat islands. In the model, we classified building envelopes into three types, including ground, roofs, and building facades. Satisfactory model performance was confirmed by comparing measured and predicted incident solar radiation results. Furthermore, we developed the Incident Solar Radiation Prediction Index (ISRPI) to address relationships between urban geometry and incident solar radiation. Our overall results showed the solar irradiance incident on building envelopes was significantly affected by urban geometry. Building facades consistently shared a large amount of the building landscape's total surface area and therefore determined more influence on variation in incident solar radiation. Weather conditions showed strong influence on incident solar radiation, primarily due to variation in atmospheric transmittance. Diffuse radiation demonstrated a larger share of incident solar radiation on the cloudy sampling day. ISRPI, which cumulatively combined the strengths of several traditional urban morphological metrics, exhibited a strong linear relationship with incident solar radiation under sunny and cloudy weather conditions. This index provided a more convenient approach to estimate the spatial-temporal variations of solar radiations at urban scale.

AB  - Microplastics have been found in all compartments of the environment, and numerous life forms are known to take up the anthropogenic particles. Marine filter feeders are particularly susceptible to ingest suspended microplastics, but long-term studies on the potential effects of this uptake are scarce. We exposed juvenile Mytilus spp. to environmentally realistic doses of irregularly shaped polyvinylchloride (PVC) particles (15, 1500, 15,000, 150,000, 1,500,000 particles/individual/week calibrated in the size range 11-60 mu m) and regularly shaped polystyrene (PS) beads (15, 1500, 15,000 particles/individual/week, 40 mu m) over 42 weeks. During this period, we monitored physiological traits such as clearance rate, byssus production, growth rate, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, and the condition index (CI). Negative effects of the tested microplastics on mussel performance emerged late in the experiment and were rather weak. Interestingly, even after having received the lowest particle dose of PS, SOD activity in the gill was significantly lower in mussels exposed to microplastics compared to a group of conspecifics that were kept in clean water. However, growth and CI, which are both closely related to the fitness of the mussels, were not found to be impaired at the end of the exposure phase. This is the so far longest laboratory microplastic exposure study on mussels and we worked with particle doses that reflect todays pollution levels. The small effect sizes we observed for the response variables assessed suggest that these specific microplastics pose only a minor threat to blue mussel populations.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are active transitional ecotones between land and ocean, and are considered as hot spots of organic matter processing within the global carbon cycle, which dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a critical role. In this study, combined use of ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and complementary optical techniques was conducted to assess the detailed molecular composition of DOM in the temperate Liaohe coastal wetland (LCW), NE China in respect to the differences in DOM composition from surface water to sediment pore water. Significant positive correlations between salinity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were observed in both surface waters and pore waters. Pore water DOM is generally characterized by lower protein-like fluorescence and biological index, but higher humification and humic-like fluorescent components than those in surface water DOM. Corresponding to the optical properties, FT-ICR MS measurements show that pore water DOM has higher proportions of heteroatoms, aromaticity index, O/C ratios, unsaturated aliphatics, and peptides, but lower average H/C ratios compared to surface water DOM across locations with different marsh plant species (rice (Oryza sativa), reed (Phragtnites australis), Seablite (Suaeda Salsa)) and salinity (0.5 to 51.5 psu). The results suggest that selective preservation for polyphenols, lignin degradation intermediates (highly unsaturated compounds), and microbial resynthesis of heteroatomic compounds are involved in the processing of DOM from surface water to pore water, leading to the formation of higher molecular weight containing molecules. The abundant CHOS compounds could be related to the early diagenetic sulfurization of DOM in sediments. Our unique data set should provide new clues for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular dynamics of DOM in coastal wetlands. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The suitability of using discards from artisanal fisheries as feed for wild-caught Chelidonichthys lucerna (L.) reared in submerged cages in the Adriatic Sea was investigated. Three-hundred juvenile tub gurnard (72.9 +/- 11 g, 18 +/- 1 cm) were captured and separated into four circular 35.3 m(3) submerged cages. Two stocking densities were used: two cages contained 60 fish each (1.7 fish m(-3;) CG-L) and two cages contained 90 fish each (2.55 fish m(-3); CG-H). Growth performance and survival rates were recorded over a 240 day period during which tub gurnard were fed with a variety non-target fishery discards, including common crab, sardine, Atlantic chub mackerel, anchovy, and salema. The survival rate was approximately 90% in both groups (CG-L = 91% and CG-H = 90%), with final stocking densities of 0.32 kg m(-3) and 0.49 kg m(-3) for the CG-L and CG-H groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in final mean body weight or length between the CG-L group (206 +/- 23 g, 24.6 +/- 2 cm) and the CG-H group (215.5 +/- 32 g, 24.8 +/- 2 cm). The condition index was similar between the two groups (1.38 and 1.42 for CG-L and CG-H, respectively). The feed conversion ratio was high in both the CG-H (2.39) and CG-L (2.32) cages. These results demonstrate that viable growth rates of tub gurnard may be obtained by feeding recycled fishery discards and rearing in cages placed on the seabed, which allows for the natural benthic behavior of this species.

AB  - In the Northern Amudarya delta (Uzbekistan), the regulated hydrological regime is one of the main factors determining the ecological state of riverine ecosystems, such as the characteristic tugai forests. Euphratica poplar (Populus euphratica, syn. ariana) is the dominant tree species of tugai forests in Central Asia. A habitat suitability index for P. euphratica is developed to provide a measure for the evaluation of future water management alternatives as to their effects on the ecological situation in the delta region.
   The following environmental variables are chosen as determining parameters for habitat suitability: geomorphology, groundwater level and flooding regime (i.e. flooding frequency, timing and duration of the last flooding). Here, flooding frequency is a dynamic variable that reflects the flooding history at a given site. Collected semi-quantitative and qualitative knowledge about the impact of those variables on suitability of a site for R euphratica is formalised using a fuzzy set approach. The resulting index is implemented in GIS and applied to a test period (1991-1999). The results are compared to the actual distribution of tugai forest in the year 2000 to check their plausibility. By these means a 'virtual expert' is created that enables a fast and simple evaluation of the habitat suitability for R euphratica on a landscape scale. As part of an integrated simulation tool, the HSI shall support the ecological impact assessment of future water management strategies on the Northern Amudarya delta. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Invertebrates play a major role in food chains, being the main feed stock for many vertebrates. So far, the benthic fauna communities are still poorly studied in many water body types, including wetlands in the River Amur basin. In 2015-2018, we conducted for the first time the study of zoobenthos in water bodies located in the Bolonsky State Nature Reserve (Khabarovsky Krai, Russia). We present data on the general taxonomic composition and occurrence of benthic invertebrates in rivers and lakes. In addition, information on the structure, density and biomass of their populations is provided. The environmental assessment of the water bodies of the Protected Area has been performed on the basis of zoobenthos composition. Quantitative samples of benthos were collected using the GR-91 rod bottom scoop from a depth from 50 cm to 400 cm and using the folding benthometer until a 25-cm depth. All sampled were fixed in a 4% formalin solution. Amphibiotic insect adults were collected using an entomological net and light traps. These samples were fixed in a 75-96% ethanol solution and processed according to the generally accepted methods. A total of 168 taxa from 15 systematic hydrobiont groups were recorded. The majority of them were Chironomidae (87 species), Trichoptera (18 species) and Ephemeroptera (16 species). Quantitative indicators of organisms were correlated with the seasonal fluctuations in the hydrological regime and the soil type. During floods, the quantitative sampling of zoobenthos was impossible. During a low-water period, studies were available predominantly in small and medium rivers and channels in which entry by boat is possible. In lakes, we found low quantitative values of density and biomass of benthos (297 +/- 91 individuals/m(2) and 0.1 +/- 0.1 g/m(2)). The average values of density and biomass were respectively 824 +/- 267 individuals/m(2) and 8.6 +/- 8.1 g/m(2) in streams, 1298 +/- 538 individuals/m(2) and 11.2 +/- 5.8 g/m(2) in small rivers, and 473 +/- 76 individuals/m(2), and 23.3 +/- 9.7 g/m(2) in medium rivers. Clean sand was the poorest soil in lakes and rivers. In areas with a slowed flow in springs and channels, the presence of silty-sandy soils with an admixture of detritus provides a higher number of habitats suitable for the aquatic organisms in contrast to the main riverbeds of lowlands. We demonstrated that in water bodies, the conditions favourable for the benthic communities are observed on plant root systems immersed in water along riverbeds, in channels and bays, and on silty sands with a rich admixture of detritus at an average depth of 1.7 m. The density and biomass of zoobenthos varied from 6 individuals/m(2) to 25 110 individuals/m(2) and from < 0.1 g/m(2) to 11 81.9 g/m(2). The average density of benthic populations was 692 +/- 119 individuals/m(2) and the average biomass - 16.9 +/- 5.8 g/m(2). High values of benthos density were recorded in the summer period, while high values of the benthos biomass was observed in the spring period. During the vegetative seasons, Chironomidae, Oligochaeta, Mollusca, and Trichoptera dominated in the zoobenthos composition. This is related with their life cycles and the influence of various abiotic factors (floods, current velocity, water temperature, oxygen regime, soil nature).
   We found that the proportion of Mollusca was 89% of the total zoobenthos biomass, while proportions of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae were respectively 60% and 26% of the total density. Higher values of the occurrence frequency were demonstrated for Chironomidae (100%) and Oligochaeta (95%). Hydra, Planaria, aquatic mites, Asellidae, Odonata, black flies, Ephydridae, and Coleoptera were rarely recorded (< 10%). Permanent components of the benthic communities were eurybionts and limnobionts belonging to Chironomidae, Oligochaeta and Nematoda, which inhabit preferably channels and sites with a slowed current velocity, namely lakes and mires. The absence of oxyphilic species of Plecoptera, Deuterophlebiidae, and Blephariceridae was characteristic. This is comparable with wetlands around the world. The most interesting records were Amuranodonta boloniensis and Cristaria herculea included in the various-rank Red Data Books, as well as Monodiamesa kamora known only in the Lower Amur River basin. Two Chironomidae species, Heterotrissocladius simmiensis, Propsilocerus amurensis, have been described for science for the first time on the basis of samples collected in the Bolonsky State Nature Reserve. Finally, Axarus fundorum is a new species in the Russian fauna. According to biological indication data, the water bodies of the Bolonsky State Nature Reserve belong to a clean type. They are characterised by high environmental status and meet the requirements of the European Framework Water Directive (WFD), which is required to create a network of reference targets. The presence of new and threatened species indicates the uniqueness of the wetlands in the Lake Bolon neighbourhood and the need for their conservation and further investigations.

AB  - A macroinvertebrate-based multimetric index was developed for River Chanchaga, North Central Nigeria. Macroinvertebrates and physicochemical variables were sampled seasonally between March 2017 and February 2018 from four stations: station 1 (least impacted control station) and three downstream stations 2, 3 and 4. A total of 29 macroinvertebrate metrics in four categories, richness, abundance, composition and diversity, were evaluated for their potential to discriminate between the stations, seasonal stability and redundancy. Of the 29 metrics, only 13 fulfilled all criteria and were then integrated into the final Chanchaga multimeric index (MMIchanchaga). Application of the newly developed multimetric index revealed that water quality at stations 2 and 3 was fair and that of station 4 was poor. Water quality deteriorated slightly during the rainy season compared with the dry season. In terms of the individual component metrics, EPT richness, EPT (%) and Shannon diversity were highly sensitive to water quality impairment. The Bray-Curtis similarity measure revealed that stations 2 and 3 were more similar compared with the similarity between other stations. Overall, the newly developed multimetric index proved useful and represents the first important step in such index development in Nigeria.

AB  - The Whitemouth croaker, Micropogonias furnieri, is commonly found in the estuary of Patos Lagoon, RS, Brazil. Like other cultivated Sciaenidae, M. furnieri has potential for aquaculture. However, several difficult-to-control ectoparasites have been shown to be serious fish culture pests. In this study, the parasite influence on M. furnieri is evaluated through examination of the relationship between abundance and host parasitism indexes, relative condition factor (Kn), and the hepatosomatic (RHS) and gonadosomatic relations (RGS). These indexes are qualitative fish welfare indicators. A total of 181 M. furnieri specimens were collected from the pre-limnic and estuarine sites of the Patos Lagoon. The parasites found were Gauchergasilus euripedesi (Copepoda). Myzobdella uruguayensis (Hirudinea). Neomacrovavitrema argentinensis and Neopterinotrematoides avaginata (both Monogenoidea). The relationship between the parasite abundance and the host indexes was verified, but no significant correlation was determined. This result suggests that the found parasite levels are tolerable. On the other hand, sample area differences affected the occurrence and intensity of parasitism, which suggests that the parasites have a preference for different salinities. This result suggests that different saline conditions could determine when the estuary would be optimal for M. furnieri aquaculture. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The assessment of ecological quality in freshwater ecosystems is a key issue in many countries, but conditions for the development of assessment methodologies are often country-specific. This study proposes a simple methodology for the assessment of the ecological potential of reservoirs based on fish communities using a dataset covering major environmental and pressure gradients in reservoirs in the Czech Republic. Fish data obtained by gillnet sampling were correlated with a proxy of eutrophication as a key indicator of anthropogenic pressure for selecting appropriate fish-based indicators, establishing scoring criteria and developing the index of ecological quality. Expert judgement was also used to select potential fish indicators. Nine indicators were selected for the final fish-based index, fulfilling the criteria required by the Water Framework Directive. Two steps were used to validate the fish-based index quantification of its inter annual stability and sensitivity analysis of individual indicators. Finally, the index was compared to a previously developed general index for Central and Western Europe. Our study demonstrates that a combination of expert judgement and strict validation methods can result in an informative assessment of the ecological conditions, which can help identify conservation and restoration priorities.

AB  - To study the problem of highway traffic safety in cold regions, a thorough statistical analysis using traffic accident historical data is used to evaluate the influencing factors on highway traffic safety. A road traffic safety indicator system for cold regions is developed to evaluate the weight of these influence factors, such as driver performance, vehicle capacity, road condition, and general impact of the traffic environment. An index system of highway traffic safety influencing factors for cold regions is developed, and an evaluation model for traffic road safety influencing factors in cold regions based on attribute recognition theory is proposed. The weight of the model is determined using an analytic hierarchy process combined with expert scoring. The evaluation model is based on single-index attribute measure values and multi-index comprehensive attribute measurement values, using the confidence criterion to identify the influence of road traffic safety factors on road traffic safety in cold regions. In addition, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used for comparative evaluation, and the evaluation results were consistent and verified the correctness and feasibility of the attribute recognition model. Results showed that the evaluation system was in good agreement with actual traffic conditions in cold regions.

TI  - MORPHOPHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES OF Piaractus mesopotamicus (OSTEICHTHYES, CHARACIDAE) IN THE TAIAMA ECOLOGICAL STATION AND SEPOTUBA RIVER, BRAZIL
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
LA  - Portuguese
AB  - This work was performed between the Taiama Ecological Station and the Sepotuba river, aiming to describe and compare the morphophysiological indices (hepatosomcitic index, gonadosomatic index and condition factor) of Piaractus mes-opotamicus among collection sites. Samples were collected over a period of 28 months between 2007 and 2012. Fish were caught with rods with lines, cast nets and gillnets. After capture, the fishes were identified, their biometric measurements and gonadal maturation stages recorded, and packaged in boxes with ice for further analysis. The gonadosomatic index showed significant differences (p<0.05) related to the seasonal periods of collections at the Taiama Ecological Station. The hepatosomatic index showed greater dispersion in the Sepotuba river, while at the Ecological Station it was more uniform. The condition factor, with b=3.05, showed a significantly higher value in the ecological station (1,412x10(-5)) when compared with the Sepotuba river (0,924x10(-5)). The length of the fishes in relation to two environments collection also showed a significant difference (p<0,5). Through observation of the morphophysiological indices it can be inferred that the reproductive activity of Piaractus mesopotamicus takes place during flooding periods, and that the Taiama Ecological Station offers a more balanced physical environment conducive to the development and well being of fish of this species.

AB  - The paper presents results of the study of cellular composition and biochemical parameters of blood in gray seal (Halichoerus grypus grypus) in the Kandalaksha State Nature Reserve (Bolshoy Ainov Island, Barents Sea). Animals have been studied in an early postnatal period of development, i.e. from birth to weaning. We have determined the following blood parameters: leukocyte blood differential count and indicators of the functional activity of the cells, describing a level of nonspecific bactericidal activity, i.e. content of myeloperoxidase and cationic protein in granulocytes. The set of biochemical parameters includes the basic indicators of metabolism: total protein and its fractions, urea, creatinine, uric acid, glucose, lactic acid, total lipids, triglycerides, cholesterol, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, magnesium, iron, enzymes (aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, alpha-amylase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, creatine kinase). The values of hematological and biochemical parameters are within the limits of a norm described for H. grypus of the same ages. This allows us to characterise a status of pups born in 2006 and 2013 as a normal one. We have determined that in the first month of H. grypus' life the bactericidal function of leucocytes is carried out, mainly, by myeloperoxidase. Cationic protein serves only as an addition in the bactericidal system. Changes of metabolic characteristics in H. grypus during an early postnatal period are similar to those in terrestrial mammals. At the same time, the level of some indicators should be served as a feature of pinniped metabolism. So, gamma-glutamyltransferase activity, being a marker of passive immunoglobulins transfer in newborns, is almost 10 times lower than in terrestrial animals. The activity of alkaline phosphatase acted as an animal fatness index and to differentiate the catabolic and anabolic statuses, is higher in young H. grypus than in terrestrial mammals of the same age. Newborn H. grypus individuals also have a high blood oxygenous capacity, which is comparable with the indices of adults. Halichoerus grypus individuals born in 2006 and 2013 had similar hematological and biochemical blood parameters. The obtained values of blood parameters could be accepted as reference indices. They could be used to evaluate animal status and influence of various natural and anthropogenic factors on H. grypus.

AB  - In this work, the relationship between sludge color and operational conditions was studied. It was found that the coordinates H and S of the HSV color space well correlated with biological status and the operational conditions of mixing and oxygen deficiency, and a coefficient of variation (CVH/S) of the ratio of H to S in sludge cake images was derived. A smaller CVH/S indicated better mixing conditions based on the observations of four laboratory-scale experiments and two full scale WWTPs, which can be used as a promising index for the monitoring of mixing condition. The coordinate oxygen uptake rate (OURq) of the respirogram space showed similar trend as CVH/S, and analysis of microbial community also showed that CVH/S could indicate changes of biological community including species and richness. These findings suggested that CVH/S is a biological meaningful index for detecting the effect of changing operational conditions, which gives a key to quantify a large number of empirical rules accumulated in the past. Furthermore, it promotes the Internet of Things (IoT) application to the management of WWTPs, as color is readily available with MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) sensors such as smart phones.

AB  - Climate change and modern slavery are two of the most significant human rights crises of our time. Women and children are disproportionately vulnerable to such crises, which are intensified under inequitable social conditions and driven by structural barriers to female equality. No research has yet looked at the complex relationship between climate crisis, structural gender inequality, human insecurity, and vulnerability to modern slavery. Our research examined the relationship between environmental stressors associated with climate change, selected structural inequalities, and the estimated prevalence of modern slavery cases across 180 countries. Regression analysis revealed significant results. These findings suggest that indicators of poor environmental health may exacerbate structural social inequalities and increase women's risk of falling victim to modern slavery. Results showed that women's share of seats in parliament, education for women, tree cover loss, agricultural management, and air quality assumed more substantial roles in this prediction. Awareness of the unique relationship between environmental indicators of climate change, gender inequality, and modern slavery provides a meaningful contribution to our understanding of factors driving human exploitation. Additionally, we propose a gender analysis of environmental stressors to address both the climate crisis and structural inequalities that increases female vulnerability to insecurity.

AB  - Temporal sequential analyses of the hydrological observational data in the Tarim Basin over the last forty years revealed an annual increase of 2 x 10(7)m(3) in the water quantities at the three headstreams of the upper courses and an annual decrease of 3 x 10(7)m(3) in the water flow from Alaer, which is on the upper main stream. A prediction of the trends indicates that there can be severe situations under which intermittent water interceptions occur. By means of approximate estimations on vegetative water consumption through phreatic evaporation combined with a quota assessment, the ecological water demands required to maintain the ecological environment in the mainstream area over the three different targeted years of 2005, 2010 and 2030 are defined as standing at 31.86 x 10(8)m(3), 36.27 x 10(8)m(3) and 41.04 x 10(8)m(3) respectively. Ecological fragility indexes are established on the basis of the selection of environmental sensitivity factors. Rational evaluations give proof that the lower reaches of the mainstream have already turned into zones where their ecological environments are gravely damaged. Multi-objective optimization should be conducted and protective schemes be framed within the threshold limits of the bearing capacities of water resources and the environment.

AB  - Increasing energy needs have led to soaring fossil fuel consumption, which has caused several environmental problems. These environmental aspects along with the energy demand have motivated the search for new energy systems. In this context, biofuels such as biodiesel have been developing into a substitute for conventional fuels. Microalgae are considered a promising option for biodiesel production due to their high lipid content. Therefore, it is important to analyze the technical aspects of the biodiesel production system. In this work, the inherent safety analysis of three emerging topologies for biodiesel production from microalgae was performed using the inherent safety index (ISI) methodology. Selected topologies include biodiesel production via lipid extraction and transesterification, in-situ transesterification, and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The results revealed that the processes are inherently unsafe achieving total inherent safety index scores of 30, 29, and 36. The main risks in the cases were associated with the chemical safety index. Operating conditions represented no risk for topologies 1 and 2, while for topology 3 pressure and temperature were identified as critical variables. In general, topology 2 showed better performance from a safety perspective.

AB  - In the summer of 2010, about half of the Kerzhensky State Nature Biosphere Reserve territory (total area is 467.9 km(2)) suffered from a wildfire. During the seven following years, monitoring of the terrestrial vertebrate populations was conducted there. In total, six amphibian species, six reptile species, 142 bird species, and 20 small mammal species were registered. The particular wildfire impact on different vertebrate species was dissimilar. In the first year after the wildfire impact, bird populations in the habitats affected by different wildfire types were similar according to the Sorensen-Chekanovsky's index. This similarity increased over time. The species richness changed in different directions. At first study years, the abundance of the nesting bird populations increased both in burnt and unburnt sites, while later this parameter decreased a bit and stabilised. The bird populations of the unburnt habitats differ by lower indicators for the last five years. We distinguished the species (e.g. Sylvia communis) recognised as indicators of damaging by fire. These are birds which became abundant in the burnt forest, but were very rarely dominant and less abundant in unburnt forest. Fringilla coelebs was dominant in all habitats studied. For the small mammal communities, the wildfire influence affected a decrease (by 2-3 times) in the abundance and biodiversity indexes, and a change of dominants (from Clethrionomys glareolus to Apodemus flavicollis). ANOVA showed that the fires with a high degree of reliability (0.445; p-level < 1) had a higher impact on the small mammal communities. In amphibians and reptiles, the wildfire caused only a decrease in abundance followed by subsequent recovery without changes in community composition. The most intense post-fire changes in terrestrial vertebrate (Tetrapoda) populations were observed within the first five post-fire years. The amphibian and the reptile populations recovered after three post-fire years, while the recovery of bird and small mammal communities noted 4-5 years after the fire.

AB  - The developing and utilizing of the renewable energy in the field of the building air conditioning is one of the effective environmental protection ways. This paper conducts the comprehensive environmental impact assessment of an absorption solar-ground source heat pump(ASGSHP) and a vapor compression ground source heat pump(VGSHP) using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. The three stages in the whole life cycle, i.e., the manufacturing, transportation/installation and operation phase of these two systems which meet the cooling demand of an office building in Beijing are analyzed, respectively. The comprehensive environmental assessment indexes including the pollutant emissions, the global warming potential(GWP), the acidification potential (AP), the dust potential and the environmental impact load(EIL) in the whole life cycle of the two systems are calculated and compared with each other. The environmental impact load, GWP, AP and the dust potential of the ASGSHP can be reduced by 42.20 %, 38.66 %, 45.73 %, 42.71 % compared with the VGSHP, respectively. The research results can provide the basic data and theoretical guidance for the further development and utilization of the GSHP system.

AB  - The peculiarities of sanitary and hygienic rationing of the oil products content in environmental components were analyzed. It was established that the general ecological situation in our country and abroad is unsatisfactory and the issue of finding modern methods of standardizing the quality of environmental components, which would cover the indicators and criteria of their composition and properties, is becoming increasingly urgent. Together, it would ensure ecologically sustainable development of the biosphere in all hierarchical levels of its organization. It was established that such an assessment system does not exist today and therefore, there is no generally accepted universal method for assessing the quality of the environmental components. For this purpose, it is necessary to develop a methodology, in particular a method of biotesting, which will provide a generalized qualitative assessment of the ecological state of the environment, without being based on the quantitative characteristics of the MPC. The possibility of applying a new method of phytotesting of soil that was artificially contaminated with different types of petrochemicals in different concentrations per unit volume of soil using flax seedlings (Linum usitatissimum L.) was investigated. The growth characteristics of the test plants grown on artificially contaminated soil with petroleum products were presented. In the course of research, the possibility of studying the effect of petrochemicals on plants directly in artificially contaminated soil was confirmed. On the basis of the analysis of the obtained results, it was found that when the soil is contaminated with oil products, the aviation fuel has a greater impact on the shoots, whereas gasoline and diesel fuel have a lower impact on the roots in lower concentrations. At higher concentrations, their depressant effect is almost equal.

T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
LA  - English
AB  - Biological monitoring programs to assess contaminant-induced impacts in aquatic systems are being developed and implemented by several federal agencies and many states. Genetic diversity and allozyme frequency may be valuable indicators of such impact because they are both sensitive to exposure and ecologically relevant in populations. The purpose of this study was to examine whether genetic diversity and structure of Campostoma anomalum populations could serve as effective biomarkers of exposure to anthropogenic stress by comparing genetic measures with other biological indicators of water quality. Fish were collected from 14 sites on seven streams by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency as part of their stream water quality evaluation program. Values for the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) and the Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) were determined for these 14 sites. Starch gel electrophoresis was used to collect genetic data for eight variable enzyme loci. Genetic diversity measures were not associated with site IBI or ICI values. However, the range of site IBI and ICI values was limited. Allele and genotype frequencies were significantly different at the point source compared to sites upstream and downstream indicating that genetic structure may be an indicator of water quality that is sensitive enough to detect change prior to species loss.

AB  - Assessing and broadcasting the Fire Danger Rating each day of the fire season is an important activity in fire-prone nations. For grasslands in Australia, grass curing and biomass are biological variables that are not usually archived yet as inputs, along with weather data, to the calculation of Grassland Fire Danger Index (GFDI) and potential fire intensity. To assess past changes in the index, the biological inputs for GFDI for Canberra in south-eastern Australia were obtained using a pasture simulator, GRAZPLAN. Shoot biomass (including leaf litter) and grass curing were modelled using three contrasting pasture models (exotic annual, exotic perennial and native perennial) in order to calculate two variants of McArthur's GFDI Mark 4 (the original and a modified version which includes fuel load); values were either capped at 100 as in the original (the 'worst possible' condition) or left open-ended. GFDI, and the potential fire intensity for fires burning with the wind each afternoon during a 54-year period were calculated. The native perennial grass model gave contrasting results to those from the exotic perennial grass model, whereas the annual grass model usually was intermediate in behaviour. GRAZPLAN outputs allow not only retrospective examination, but also provide a basis for predicting potential fire danger and behaviour as a result of climate change.

AB  - The use of nature areas as an effective tool for conservation of streams and their biota is a relatively unexplored option in urban stream management. Benthic macroinvertebrates and water quality in an urban stream, Poplar Creek, were monitored along a continuum within and downstream of a forest preserve in the western Chicago metropolitan area, USA. Taxa richness and a benthic macroinvertebrate index of biological integrity (MIBI) increased as the stream progressed within the preserve, but percentage of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera (%EPT) showed no improvement. Reductions in the amount of silt substrates and increases in gravel-dominated substrate were evident at sites within the preserve. There were no improvements in water-quality measures tested although trends may have been obscured by precipitation events between sampling occasions. The benefits in stream quality attained within the forest preserve extended beyond the downstream border of the preserve and were not diminished by the presence of a railway, which bisected the stream. The nature preserve provided an opportunity for increased macroinvertebrate biodiversity, likely through local reductions in impervious surfaces and improvements in stream substrate, despite lack of evidence that it improved water quality.

AB  - During the last 10 years, opposition by local communities against the development of industrial facilities, energy technologies and transport infrastructures has steadily grown. Negative externalities on the environment, quality of life and health are the most frequent motivations of the opponents. Disputes are typically grounded in environmental, social and economic concerns about the local impacts of new development proposals. Within this context, this paper aims to explore the existence of a potential relationship between the level of territorial vulnerability and the distribution of local conflicts surveyed by the local and national press in the Lombardy Region (Italy). This type of relationship is investigated using an empirical analysis based on an overlay mapping of different informative layers. The vulnerability index has been calculated according to the most recent conceptual and analytical frameworks developed in the scientific literature. It is a multidimensional index grounded in environmental, social and economic criteria. The outputs of the vulnerability assessment have been placed into thematic maps to provide a comprehensive overview of the environmental and socioeconomic state of the Lombardy Region. In addition to the general degree of vulnerability, the maps display the local conflicts surveyed by the NIMBY Forum, an Italian survey of territorial disputes managed by the Agency of Research and Information Society. The maps provide a means of i) putting forward some hypotheses about the oppositions that have emerged around the localization of new facilities, including mainly industrial facilities, waste disposals, energy plants and transport infrastructures, and the vulnerability of the Lombardy Region; ii) identifying the driving factors of territorial vulnerability; iii) investigating whether the local oppositions are directly proportional to territorial vulnerability. The first results indicate that a direct relationship among territorial vulnerability and conflicts does not exist. This outcome, even on a preliminary basis, provides a new analytical perspective for understanding the reasons behind local community protests. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several methods for calculating indices of biological integrity (IBIs) have been developed for different ecogeographic regions of the world. All of them calculate IBI scores by comparing against reference sites or historical data on fish assemblage composition. Because of intensive agriculture and urbanization in our study area, we located no reference sites, and historical information about fish assemblage composition did not exist. Instead, we developed hypothetical reference scores based on seasonal electrofishing surveys at six study sites in adjacent but geomorphologically different watersheds. Our IBI included 10 metrics that varied with degree of degradation. We found that Shannon - Wiener indices varied significantly between seasons, indicating significant changes in species composition. Therefore, we calculated seasonal IBI scores also, but these did not significantly differ from each stream's general IBI score, which was calculated on the basis of four samples per site. General stream IBI scores reflected differing levels of anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - A statistically derived disease reaction index based on parasitological, clinical and haematological measurements observed in 309 5 to 8-month-old Boran cattle following laboratory challenge with Theileria parva is described. Principal component analysis was applied to 13 measures including first appearance of schizonts, first appearance of piroplasms and first occurrence of pyrexia, together with the duration and severity of these symptoms, and white blood cell count. The first principal component, which was based on approximately equal contributions of the 13 variables, provided the definition for the disease reaction index, defined on a scale of 0-10. As well as providing a more objective measure of the severity of the reaction, the continuous nature of the index score enables more powerful statistical analysis of the data compared with that which has been previously possible through clinically derived categories of non-, mild, moderate and severe reactions.

AB  - Eco-certfication is widely perceived to bean increasingly important strategy to improve the environmental performance of agriculture in an era of global trade integration and apparent weakening of regulatory capacity of nation-states. Few analyses have sought to determine whether ecolabeled products are produced in a manner that conserves natural resources and mitigates risks to ecological integrity. The authors report on a 2003 audit of farming practices in banana production in Ecuador They find that certified farms significantly outperform noncertified farms on all environmental assessment criteria. In many cases, noncertiflied farms are out of compliance with Ecuadorian environmental law. Thus, there is evidence to support claims that ecocertfied products pose relatively lower ecological risks. In evaluating limitations of their study, the authors note a need to develop longitudinal data sets to assess if and how certification motivates behavioral change at the level of production.

AB  - Ecosystem or landscape health indices are important tools for land managers. While strong predictable relationships between these indices and biotic diversity are often generalized, they are seldom validated. Here we use data from a semi-arid eastern Australian woodland to examine the relationships between arthropod community structure and two sets of landscape health indicators: landscape function analysis (LFA), and a terrestrial index of ecological integrity based on common vegetation metrics (structure, composition and function; SCF). Hierarchical partitioning revealed that the ability of LFA or SCF to account for variation in arthropod richness was low, with the variable of importance taxon-dependent. Similarly, multivariate analyses indicated relatively weak and inconsistent relationships between LFA and SCF indices and arthropod assemblage structure. Results obtained for additional habitat attributes commonly used in terrestrial vegetation monitoring were similar. Our study indicates that strong predictable relationships are rarely apparent, particularly for arthropods. This indicates that these indices have limited use as surrogates of arthropod biodiversity. These results are contrary to the past literature, highlighting the need for additional research and the development of a conceptual and empirical framework linking health indices and arthropod biodiversity. This is necessary to further the theoretical and practical application of these measurements in environmental management.

KW  - LAWS
AB  - Nigeria has a plural legal system in which various sources of law govern simultaneously. Inconsistent and conflicting legal frameworks can reinforce pre-existing health disparities in sexual and reproductive health (SRH). While previous studies indicate poor SRH outcomes for Nigerian women and girls, particularly in Northern states, the relationship between customary and religious law (CRL) and SRH has not been explored. We conducted a state-level ecological study to examine the relationship between CRL and SRH outcomes among women in 36 Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja (n = 37), using publicly available Demographic and Health Survey data from 2013. Indicators were guided by published research and included contraception use among married women, total fertility rate, median age at first birth, receipt of antenatal care, delivery location, and comprehensive knowledge of HIV. To account for economic differences between states, crude linear regression models were compared to a multivariable model, adjusting for per capita GDP. All SRH outcomes, except comprehensive knowledge of HIV, were statistically significantly more negative in CRL states compared to non-CRL states, even after accounting for state-level GDP. In CRL states in 2013, compared to non-CRL states, the proportion of married women who used any method of contraception was 22.7 percentage points lower ([95% CI: -15.78--29.64], p<0.001), a difference that persisted in a model adjusting for per capita GDP (b[adj] = -16.15, 95% CI: [-8.64--23.66], p<0.001.). While this analysis of retrospective state-level data found robust associations between CRL and poor SRH outcomes, future research should incorporate prospective individual-level data to further elucidate these findings.

AB  - In this paper, excavated waste was added to sewage sludge for co-pyrolysis, aiming to stablize the heavy metals in sewage sludge. The effect of co-pyrolysis with various pretreatment (e.g. cooling, drying and hydrothermal pretreatment) on heavy metals stabilization was studied using orthogonal test. The results showed that the optimal conditions are 600 degrees C, nitrogen flow rate of 200 mL/min, mixing excavated waste with sewage sludge (25:75, wt%) and hydrothermal pretreatment. 90% of the heavy metals in the sewage sludge and excavated waste mixtures were transformed to biochars after co-pyrolysis. Moreover, the state of heavy metals changed from bio-available fractions to stable state, thereby reducing the potential ecological risk index (RI) from 116.8 to below 50, which represented a reduction in contamination levels and ecological risks from considerate to low. Finally, the study found that the synergy between hydrothermal and pyrolysis made full use of the moisture in sewage sludge and was more conducive to the solidification of heavy metals. This paper provides a good option to dispose multiple wastes and reduce their environmental risks. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, an attempt has been made to present the Co finite element formulation based on third order shear deformation theory for buckling analysis of functionally graded material skew plate under thermo-mechanical environment. Here, prime emphasis has been given to study the influence of skew angle on the buckling behavior of functionally graded plate. Two dissimilar homogenization schemes, namely Mori-Tanaka scheme and Voigt rule of mixture are employed to sketch their influence for the interpretation of data. Temperature-dependent material properties of the constituents of the plate are considered to perform thermal analysis. Numerical examples are solved using different mixture of ceramic and metal plates to generate the new results and relative imperative conclusions are highlighted. The roles played by the different factors like loading condition, volume fraction index, skew angle, boundary condition, aspect ratio, thickness ratio and homogenization schemes on buckling behavior of the FGM skew plates are presented in the form of tables and figures.

AB  - The performance and thermo-sustainability indicators (TSI) of non-hybrid organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) are considered at varying evaporator pressure (EVP) and heat source temperature (HST). The ORCs structures include the ORC-basic, ORC-internal heat exchanger (ORC-IHE), ORC-turbine bleeding and ORC-turbine bleeding/regeneration. The TSI considered exergy efficiency, waste exergy ratio (WER), exergetic sustainability index (ESI) and environmental effect factor (EEF). The calculated overall exergy efficiency varies from 35.35 to 47.23 for evaporator pressure between 2 and 3 MPa and 49.02 to 52.71 for HST between 500 and 650 K. Additionally, WER, ESI and EEF were found to vary from 0.253 to 0.278, 1.15 to 1.87 and 0.547 to 0.82, respectively while ESI decreases for all variants of HST. The results indicate high ESI and low WER in ORC-IHE and the ORC-turbine bleeding /regeneration for all variations in EVP and HST.

AB  - Species conservation status is commonly used as a broad-scale indicator of the state of biological diversity. To learn about its value for tracking trends, we examined provincial lists of terrestrial vertebrate species and subspecies at risk in British Columbia, Canada, for 1992 and 2002 to see whether changes in these lists reflected changes in the status of the taxa they represent. Examination of the case histories of individual species and subspecies showed that 65% of additions and deletions to the British Columbia Red List were the result of improvement in knowledge of species status, changes in assessment procedures, and refinements in taxonomy rather than actual changes in a species' status. Comparison to an alternate set of rank scores provided by NatureServe for taxa that appeared on both 1992 and 2002 British Columbia Red Lists revealed changes in status that were not reflected by movement from the list. Estimates of historical conservation status for species on the 1992 British Columbia Red List demonstrated ambiguity around the natural baseline with regard to tracking changes in list composition over time. We discourage the continued use of indicators based solely on conservation status as a means of tracking biodiversity. Instead we recommend advancing strategic indicators around species at risk based on long-term monitoring data, deliberate and explicitly stated baselines, and consistent methods of conservation ranking.

AB  - Throughout the life cycle of organisms, nutrient intake is necessary for the maintenance of the functions of daily life and in preparation for a variety of biological events, such as molting, migration, hibernation, and reproduction. One of the most energetically costly events is reproduction. Present study sought to elucidate the seasonal variations in the markers of intermediate metabolism (total proteins, uric acid, glucose, total lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, and glycogen) and body condition indices (gonadossomatic, hepatosomatic, and abdominal fat index) in Tropidurus catalanensis, in order to know the physiological costs of reproduction in this species, also allowing these parameters to be used as markers in studies of environmental alterations. During the study period, 38 males and 35 females were collected. Tropidurus catalanensis is a lizard that inhabits the Pampa grasslands, a biome that stretches across Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. Results obtained reveal that this lizard exhibits a clear pattern of seasonal variation in its metabolism, as reflected mainly in levels of plasma total protein, liver glycogen, total lipids, and triglycerides in males and females; and in blood glucose and lipid, and liver protein levels in females. It bears stressing that all body condition indices analyzed varied over the course of the year. The parameters studied can be used to evaluate the impact of changes in environmental conditions on these animals. Winter months appear to trigger a reduction in overall metabolism, most intensely in males. Reproductive period seems to be the biological event that demands greater energy demand, leading to the mobilization of energy stocks mainly in females, where the search for food may be reduced in the months of reproductive peak (spring). The response pattern observed during the reproductive period suggests that this time represents a critical point in terms of the animal's adaptation to its life cycle.

AB  - Biological monitoring of marine contaminants often involves the analysis of metals accumulated in mussel tissues. Critiques of this type of monitoring suggest that although relatively good indications of ambient metal concentrations are determined, actual biological harm is not elucidated. Biomarkers, techniques originally developed in medicine, have recently been employed in an attempt to ascertain the health of marine mussels, Biomarkers have been used with good effect in temperate marine pollution monitoring programmes. The use of biomarkers in the toxicological evaluation of tropical and subtropical waters is, however, generally lacking, which is somewhat surprising, as considerable industrialisation and environmental degradation is taking place in the Pacific-rim countries of Southeast Asia. In the present study, a suite of cytological and physiological biomarkers have been measured from mussels (Perna viridis: Mytilidae) transplanted within the coastal waters of Hong Kong, Mussels from contaminated sites, had labile lysosomal membranes, whereas animals from a cleaner reference site had more stable membranes. These cytological responses have been related to metal-induced stress and are simple, cost-effective markers of pollution, Cardiac activity from mussels transplanted to polluted sites was generally similar to that of individuals from the reference site, although a mild tachycardia was associated with one site. The cause of the tachycardia and the use of heart rate in mussels as a biomarker is discussed. Integrated physiological responses to stress, condition indices, revealed mussels from a clean reference site had higher indices than animals from contaminated sites. The relative sensitivities of the cytological and physiological biomarkers deployed in this study and their application to pollution monitoring is discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the potential suitability of forest stands of the Mt. Baek-un region in South Korea as habitats for Kirengeshoma koreana by determining essential biotic and abiotic environmental factors using MaxEnt. Presence data were collected from 16 plots in the study area, and a forest stand map was used to assess the potential suitability of the plot as habitat for the species. The topographic site characteristics were analyzed using GIS, and the terrain relief conditions were measured using the topographic position index. The site environmental factors that significantly influenced the potential suitability of the forest stands as habitats for K. koreana were chosen using MaxEnt. The results indicated that landform types, soil depth, and water and light availability at the forest floor were the factors that most strongly influenced K. koreana habitat suitability. These significant environmental factors were assessed to determine the forest stand sites that were most suitable as potential habitats for the species in the study area.

AB  - Northern mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus macrolepidotus) have been widely considered to be suitable for environmental effects monitoring despite concerns of spatial variability observed in energy reserves and reproductive indices. In this study, temporal and spatial variability in gonadosomatic index (GSI), liversomatic index (LSI), and condition factor (K) were examined across two sites in 2006 and 10 sites (four sites exposed to wastewater discharge; six reference sites) in 2007. In 2006 GSI, LSI, and K appeared highly variable and significantly different for both males and females. In 2007, female K and gonad weight were significantly different among all sites. For males, significant differences in K and liver weight were observed among sites. Extensive spatial variation in GSI, LSI, and K observed between reference sites suggests current standardized Canadian Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) methods, including effect size and duration of sampling, should not be adopted for use with the northern mummichog F. h. macrolepidotus.

AB  - In the western United States, riparian ecosystems are among the highest priorities for improved management and restoration. Riparian vegetation has been widely destroyed or seriously degraded by livestock grazing, water diversions, altered flood regimes, and other human activities. Riparian degradation has led to a major federal initiative to assess riparian areas and prioritize them for restoration. Proper Functioning Condition (PFC) assessment has served as the main methodology for assessing riparian health by the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM), United States Forest Service (USFS), and United States Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). PFC is a quantitative rapid assessment method whose purpose is to assess "how well the physical processes are functioning" (BLM 1998a:1). Here, I propose a simple method for incorporating in assessment of the breeding land-bird community into the PFC methodology. This would bring PFC assessment closer to an evaluation of biotic integrity. Experts identified 77 species as obligate or dependent breeding riparian land birds in the western United States, and their occurrence serves as the standard to which site data can be compared. The method is illustrated with sample data from the Boise River in southwestern Idaho. The first step was to construct a list of riparian obligate and dependent land-bird species that should occur on the site during the breeding season. Relative abundance data from the Breeding Bird Survey could be used to fine-tune the list of expected obligate and dependent species. The simplest scoring was to calculate the percentage of potential obligate and dependent species that actually occurred on the site (i.e., 44% [n=25] in this example). Knowledge of the ecology of those species actually on the site and those missing should be used along with the score to help determine conservation priority.

AB  - In this work, a physically reasonable metric potential g and a specific choice of the anisotropy has been utilized to obtain closed-form solutions of the Einstein field equation for a spherically symmetric anisotropic matter distribution. This class of solution has been used to develop viable models for observed pulsars. Smooth matching of interior spacetime metric with the exterior Schwarzschild metric and utilizing the condition that radial pressure is zero across the boundary leads us to determine the model parameters. A particular pulsar 4U1820-3having current estimated mass and radius (mass=1.58M circle dot km) has been allowed for testing the physical acceptability of the developed model. The gross physical nature of the observed pulsar has been analyzed graphically. The stability of the model is also discussed given causality conditions, adiabatic index and generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equation under the forces acting on the system. To show that this model is compatible with observational data, few more pulsars have been considered, and all the requirements of a realistic star are highlighted. Additionally, the mass-radius (M-R) relationship of compact stellar objects analyzed for this model. The maximum mass for the presented model is approximate to 4M circle dot which is compared with the realization of Rhoades and Ruffini (Phys Rev Lett 32:324, 1974).

AB  - Viral diseases are not only responsible for health related issues but also exert pressure on the Stateeconomy. Tropical and subtropical countries have more prevalence of virus associated pathological conditions such as chickenpox, adenovirus related infections, dengue, chickengunya, infectious mononucleosis, etc. Treatment options with effective antiviral drugs are limited and are unfortunately not free from undesirable effects. The Asian Green Mussel, Perna viridis (Linn.) (Mytilidae) are not only important for their evolutionary significance, high caloric index, ecological role in the sequestration of environmental pollutants especially heavy metals, but also are potential source for extraction of therapeutic and bioactive compounds. On the other hand, generally in bivalves, virus mediated mortality is not uncommon. In this study, we made a maiden attempt of exploring DNAse like bioactivity for natural non-protenacious compound(s) extracted from P. viridis. Crude Methanol Extract (CME) of soft tissue of P. viridis and subsequently its partially purified component (PPC) possess exceptional ability to degrade indiscriminately both low and high molecular weight DNAs. In vitro digestions for1, 2 and 3 h with CME and PPC were found to be comparable to commercial (Sigma-Aldrich) enzyme, DNase I. Bioactive assays conducted to evaluate antimicrobial property, have shown that CME and PPC exclusively inhibit viral propagation. Nonetheless, CME & PPC have no effect on the propagation of bacteria (0 mm ZOI). These results indicate the possibility of a source of potential antiviral drug against DNA Group I viruses. Although our study does not provide any data to correlate to any physiological functions of these substances but provides a clue towards an important role in the biology of mussels. Any conclusion at this stage is premature. However, taking into consideration the significantly high virus mediated mortality in bivalves and the antiviral bioactivity of these substances, it appears that mussels have evolved some mechanisms to counteract some viruses.

AB  - Environmental and economical constraints in Europe will favour low nitrogen (N) input systems and wheat varieties adapted to moderate N deficiency. In this context, we studied the dynamics of genetic parameters according to N stress intensity and characterized the genetic determinants for plant tolerance to N deficiency. Thus, we combined N stress modelling with a genetic approach. Two hundred and twenty-two doubled haploid lines were experimented in the field for a range of nitrogen conditions. Those conditions were characterized by the Nitrogen Nutrition Index (NNI) of Recital. Grain Yield (GY) and Kernel Number (KN) were assessed. For GY and KN, and for each line, factorial regressions using NNI of Recital as environmental index were performed. In addition, we assessed the sensitivity to N stress (slopes of the regression) and the performances under low N conditions (predicted values for a NNI of 0.5). QTL detection was performed on these parameters as well as on KN and GY measured in each environment. G x N variance increased with N stress intensity whereas heritability and genetic variance decreased. 11 QTL regions were detected: 3 were N supply-specific QTL (on linkage groups 2A2, 3A and 4B) while 4 contained QTL detected under N+ and under N- (2D1, 4B and 5A1). Out of these four, 2 coincided with QTL for factorial regression parameters (2D1 and 4B). Finally, 4 QTL were specific for factorial regression parameters (3B, 5A2 and 7B2). The role of genes commonly used in breeding programs (rht-B1 on 4B, and Ppd1 on 2D1) in plant adaptation to nitrogen constraint was highlighted. Future studies should focus on grain protein yield, another target for low-N breeding scheme.

AB  - Significant ecological effects of run-of-river dams on stream chemistry, benthic algae, phytoplankton, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes and fish have been found. However, the quantitative impacts and intensity of such impacts on aquatic ecosystems are still unclear and there was no assessment system to examine such impacts effectively. We investigated benthic diatom communities of 23 run-of-river dams in a Chinese river during the dry season with the goal of developing a diatom-based index of biotic integrity (D-IBI) that would be sensitive to such impacts. Four metrics were selected from 110 diatom attributes of training-site data set to construct the D-IBI based on: (1) significant differences between reference and impaired sites, (2) high separation power and (3) a low coefficient of variation (CV). We then calculated the total D-IBI scores by summing metrics for each site after transformation by 0-10 scaling system. The D-IBI and its metrics were tested using an independent testing-site data set from a tributary of the study catchment. The test results, calculated using the same criteria and scaling system as the training-site data set, indicated significant differences between reference and impaired sites. The developed D-IBI was powerful in terms of separation powers, % sites correctly classified, box-separation ratios, correlation index (Col) and Cumulative_R-2. Then the ecological conditions of the sampling sites were evaluated based on the total D-IBI scores. Overall, the ecological conditions of references sites were "Good". D-IBI scores were significantly reduced at impaired sites, where affected by the dams, compared with references sites. The newly developed D-IBI effectively signaled impairment of flow regulations in the Xiangxi River of China, and it could be used in future studies measuring the long-term status of streams and the effectiveness of various remediation measures. However, further testing and assessment of their applicability in other regions impacted by small run-of-river dams are still needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Grasslands are characteristic physiognomies of the Brazilian Cerrado domain. One of last remnants of these threatened environments in the state of Sao Paulo is located in Itirapina Ecological Station, considered as an Important Bird Area (IBA). We investigated bird assemblages that use seasonally flooded grasslands, and predominantly dry grasslands, from August 2010 until July 2011. We focused on aspects of assemblage structure, and possible responses of birds to environmental changes. We recorded 76 species, of which 23.7% are threatened. Some basic aspects of assemblages were similar between environments, such as diversity descriptors, and the tendency of increase richness in the same periods. Other parameters differed between environments, such as absolute richness, recorded monthly (lower in seasonally flooded grasslands). Considering time dimension in analyses, we observed differences in assemblage structure over time, within and between environments. When birds were grouped in guilds, assemblage structure did also differ. We identified significant correlations between the abundance of some guilds and environmental variables. Changes in the availability of resources and microhabitats may affect structure and organization of the studied bird assemblages.

AB  - Field experiments were conducted in India at Shalimar Campus of Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir during 2015 and 2016 to study the growth and yield of maize at different planting dates and nitrogen levels. Maize was simulated at different agro-ecological zones (altitudes) of Kashmir valley. Further, maize was evaluated at fixed dates with varied nitrogen levels and at fixed nitrogen level with varied dates of sowing. Experiment was laid in split plot design with three dates of sowing, i.e. 22nd May, 30th May and 8th June, assigned to main plot and four levels of nitrogen, i.e. 80 kg N ha(-1) (N-1), 120 kg N ha(-1)(N 2), 160 kg N ha(-1) (N-3) and 200 kg N ha(-1), assigned to sub plot. Genetic coefficients of maize crop variety (Shalimar Maize composite-4) were generated, calibrated and validated in CERES Maize model using DSSAT 4.5. Simulated studies carried at different locations indicated that sowing of Maize on 30th May (D-2) with 200 kg N ha(-1) (N-4) predicted highest grain yield in location Kokernag which was followed by location Srinagar on same date 30th May (D-2) with 160 kg N ha(-1)(N-3) and lowest yield was recorded in district Kupwara. Maximum Biological yield was also recorded at 30th May with 160 kg N ha(-1) (N-3). Among the district Kokernag recorded maximum biological yield with delayed maturity (160 days) simulation studies were carried out with 7 dates of sowing at fixed level of Nitrogen in all the districts. Simulated studies of maize showed that sowing on 30th May with 160 kg N ha(-1) (N-3) recorded maximum Leaf Area Index Biological yield and grain yield. However, highest grain yield was recorded at location Kokernag and lowest was recorded at location Kupwara.

AB  - Background: The fat horsemussel Modiolus capax is a commercially important resource in northwest Mexico; however, few studies evaluate its reproduction. Goals: Compare the reproductive cycle of M. capax in two beds at different depths in Ensenada de La Paz, B.C.S., Mexico, and its relationships with the environmental variables. Methods: Approximately 25 (+/- 4.5) specimens were collected between October 2008 and December 2010, in a shallow bed in the intertidal zone (Bed A), and 23 (+/- 4) at a five meters deep bed (Bed B), in Ensenada de La Paz, B.C.S., Mexico. Monthly assessments of individual biological information were complemented by histological analyses of the gonads at different moments of the reproductive cycle, taking in environmental changes. The size at the first sexual maturity (L50) was estimated using a logistic model to obtain the size at 50% maturity. The relationship between gonad development stages and the gonadosomatic index was estimated, as well as the relationship between these stages with temperature and chlorophyll. Results: A peak spawning occurred in March in Bed A and in January in Bed B. In both beds, mature and post-spawning females showed follicular atresia, up to 82% in Bed B. The estimated L50 was 74.12 mm for Bed A and 71.74 mm for Bed B. The gonadosomatic index differed between beds, and was positively correlated with the increase in chlorophyll-a (Bed A). A significant negative correlation was observed between temperature and the frequency of the maturing stage (Bed A). Conclusions: The reproduction of M. capax revealed that the beds have a different reproductive periodicity and that environmental changes affect the activity and favor the development of follicular atresia.

AB  - The effects of multiple stressors on estuarine organisms are not well understood. Using cage experiments we measured the survival and growth of the pulmonate gastropod Amphibole crenata at five locations which differed contaminant levels. Water nutrients came from a nearby sewage treatment works and the sediment contained low levels of trace metals. Over 6 weeks of exposure, sediment surface chlorophyll levels varied amongst locations. The Chl a values were positively correlated with sediment N and P and trace metals As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn. Pulmonate survival depended on location, highest mortality was from a site close to the treatment plant and mortality rate of large individuals decreased significantly with distance away from it. For four locations, medium A. crenate had higher survival than small (juveniles) or adults. Growth rates of small individuals exceeded those for medium and large A. crenata. The mean length increment/week for medium gastropods ranged between 0.49 and 1.11 mm and was negatively correlated with the amount of Chl a in the surface sediment, suggesting the negative effects of eutrophication on gastropod growth. Growth rate of the pulmonate was not correlated with nutrient concentration or trace metal concentrations in the sediment. The dry weight condition index (Cl) did not correlate with the growth rate, and for medium individuals, was unaffected by any of the environmental variables. The Cl of small individuals was negatively affected by increasing water. nutrient levels and the Cl of large individuals negatively affected by increasing sediment nutrients and trace metal concentrations. The results from this study suggest that gastropod growth and survival could be used as tools to monitor the effects of changing nutrient levels and recovery from eutrophication within temperate estuaries.

AB  - Feeding strategies and diet patterns have been extensively investigated in vertebrates and, more specifically, in snakes. Although it has been hypothesized that prey species may differ in terms of energy content, almost no theoretical or practical study has been carried out to determine actual nutritional values of the common prey types of wild snakes. Our model taxa were a selection of widely distributed and well known European snake species, which have all been studied in depth: approximately 76% of their diet is composed of mammals, reptiles, and insects. We therefore selected a single model species for each of these categories and proceeded with the analyses. Nutritional values were determined using a standard procedure: lizards and mice were richer in proteins than insects (crickets); insects and mice were richer in lipids than lizards, and mice and crickets have a higher energy content than lizards; lizards were rich in ashes. We then applied our experimental results to a selected sample of European terrestrial snakes (11 populations, ten species, seven genera, two families) characterized by different body size (50-160 cm total length) and reproductive strategies (oviparous versus viviparous), aiming to correlate these parameters with patterns of energy income. A direct relationship was found between body mass/body length ratio (BCI, body condition index) and meal energetics: the higher the BCI, the higher was the metabolic requirement, whereas BCI was independent of species or of reproductive system effect. Large-sized snakes thus need a highly diversified and more energy-rich diet than smaller snakes, supporting previous hypotheses. The simple applicability of this method could be of valuable support in further comparative research work, reducing experimental costs and stimulating further ecological, behavioural, and, possibly, phylogenetic comparisons.

AB  - Based on the Reddy-Bickford beam theory (RBBT), a comprehensive study on high-order bending, buckling and free vibration of two-directional functionally graded (FG) nanobeams is presented. The variation of the material properties is assumed to obey arbitrary power-law form in both axial and thickness directions. The equations of motion are derived using Hamilton's principle, and small-scale effects are captured by nonlocal elasticity theory of Eringen. The RBBT formulation leads to complicated governing equations, and 2D FGM introduces additional stiffness terms. Accordingly, the governing equations cannot be solved by classical analytical schemes, and thus, symmetric smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SSPH) meshless method is adopted as an efficient numerical solution approach. The revised super-Gauss function is used as the kernel function. To validate the developed SSPH code, benchmark problems are studied and the results are compared to the analytical solutions. In this context, excellent agreement is observed. Several numerical examples are included to illustrate the effects of gradient indexes, boundary conditions, size scale parameters, aspect and elastic modulus ratios on static and dynamic responses of two-directional FG nanobeams.

AB  - Power generation via a biogas-driven Brayton cycle (BC) can be regarded as the best scenario for electricity supply of decentralized complexes or small communities. However, the central problem associated with such technology is the high temperature of its exhaust gases, which can be recovered via appropriate waste heat elimination schemes. Although various studies have previously discussed optimal operating conditions of the enhanced biogas-driven BC in terms of thermodynamics and economic, no comprehensive investigation in terms of selecting the best bottoming cycle for the biogas-driven BC has been carried out up to yet. This spurs the current investigation to recommend the it best bottoming cycle between a close supercritical BC (CSBC) and an inverse BC (IBC) for waste heat recovering of a biogas-driven BC around the optimum point. Another novelty of the present study is the inclusion of the environment index (EI) along with energy, exergy, and economic metrics in the performed multi-objective optimization scheme, resulting in the design of a highly sustainable energy system. The results indicated that no single optimal solution exists in selecting the best bottoming cycle by accounting energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental metrics, simultaneously. Hence, a trade-off should be deliberated in selecting the best case in the design process. Accordingly, the integrated BC/CSBC system is superior to the BC/IBC system in terms of thermodynamics (i.e., both energy and exergy metrics) around both base and optimal design points; however, it is not commendable in terms of economic and exergoenvironmental viewpoints. Quantitatively speaking, selecting the BC/CSBC system can lead to thermal and exergetic performance enhancement of around 3.3%, while degrading economic and exergoenvironmental metrics around 7.2% and 8.3%, respectively.

AB  - Baseball has gained popularity at Taiwanese colleges over the last twenty years. The quality of coaching and training is the key factor in the performance of young players during competition. Wireless sensor network (WSN) technology has been developed to index, navigate, store, and analyze data in sports. We investigated the correlations between the performance of college baseball players during a competition game and the following three factors: (1) athletes' physical fitness, (2) athletes' psychological state, and (3) the training environment. Wireless wearable devices were applied in this research to construct the indicators for monitoring the development of players in terms of the three aforementioned factors during routine training. The statistics software SPSS 20.0 was employed to test the correlations between the factors raised in this present research. The findings showed (1) correlations among the physical fitness, psychological state, and training environment and (2) correlations between the effect of training on the competition event performance of baseball players during a competition event and the physical fitness, psychological state, and training environment. In the future, the above indicators can be applied to wearable sensing devices to enhance the effect of training on the performance of the players.

AB  - An effective biodiversity conservation in Protected Areas (PAs) requires that they are seen as part of larger ecosystems and that the ecological connectivity is maintained beyond PA administrative boundaries. The study of ecological processes that link PAs to their surrounding landscapes is thus of great importance to understand which actions should be implemented to promote inside-outside ecological connectivity. In this paper, we used a system of indicators and a mathematical model (PANDORA model) to describe in a quantitative way the present and the foreseen ecological state of a Regional Nature Park (Parc Naturel Regional de la Montagne de Reims) and its surrounding area. The landscape ecological quality was assessed in terms of the capability of the system to transmit its biological energy all around its territory, thus highlighting the degree of ecological connectivity in landscapes situated both inside and outside the Park. The outcomes showed how the areas situated outside the Park are characterized by a less positive evolutionary trajectory with respect to those situated inside the Park. This is mainly due to urbanization processes that are taking place precisely outside the Parks' boundary. To avoid the risk of Park's "insularization", the need and ways of developing integrated inside-outside planning and management policies, both by the Park Authority and external authorities, is highlighted. The mathematical approach presented here could be replicated also in other PAs, to sustain and address an integrated spatial planning of PAs and their context.

AB  - The shift in emphasis away from the single-species focus of traditional fisheries management towards an ecosystem approach to management requires application of indicators, of ecosystem state. Further, an ecosystem approach to management requires the identification of ecological reference points against which management objectives might be set. In applying indicators, identifying reference points, and setting objectives, an obvious requirement is that the indicators respond primarily to the anthropogenic activity being managed and are sufficiently sensitive that impacts of the activity and the responses to management action are clearly demonstrable. Here we apply a suite of 12 indicators to Scottish August groundfish survey data collected in the northern North Sea over the period 1925-1997. These include indicators of size structure, life-history character composition, species diversity, and trophic structure within the community. Our choice of analytical design has two purposes; first to show that fishing has unequivocally affected these various aspects of the structure of the groundfish community, and second to illustrate an approach by which long time-series data sets might be used to identify possible management reference points. The results are discussed in the context of selecting ecological indicators in support of an ecosystem approach to management and determining appropriate reference points for objective-setting.

AB  - The paper deals with opportunities of remote probing as a method to assess the environmental condition of hard-to-reach areas. The dynamics of changing the condition of the vegetation cover of anthropogenically disturbed areas of the Tomsk region under conditions of the negative impact of oil recovery was investigated using freely distributed satellite MODIS images of medium spatial resolution. Vegetation cover condition was assessed according to the value of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Condition dynamics for vegetation cover in the vegetation season was analysed over the 9-year period from 2010 to 2018. The work stepwise stated the processing algorithm of satellite data using geographic information system ArcGis 10.2.2. Analysis was performed for NDVI values of the background territory of the Oglatsky wildlife reserve and five territories of oil and gas fields in the Tomsk region. The latter include Luginets, Olenie, Lomovoye, Katylginsky, and West Katylginsky fields. As determined, the trend of changing index values for all investigated areas is single-type: high and minimum magnitudes in 2016 and 2012, respectively. As demonstrated by the analysis of the dynamics of changing average NDVI values during vegetation, there are improved but significantly reduced NDVI magnitudes in all investigated areas from 2012 to 2016 and 2016 to 2018, respectively.

AB  - This research article discusses the legal and cultural dimensions of a proposed solid waste mega-landfill in Farmersville, a rural Western New York community. The author argues that a corporation's and state environmental bureaucracy's development efforts and definitions of space dominate and decontextualize a local community's and region's own understandings and uses of space and land. This results in a colonial process of domination over large-scale local citizen and government opposition. Using ethnographic, legal, and documentary data, as well as the author's own citizen participation activities as a research basis, the article focuses on state notions of rural territory as legal space instead of cultural landscape. Locals' space is differently bounded, conceptualized and used as a place of and for community, morality, spirituality, and communality. Protracted bureaucratic procedures and still on-going legal battles between, on one side, local citizenry and legislators, and on the other, technocratic and corporate executives and attorneys, are ultimately traceable to the official ignoring of sociocultural issues in environmental impact assessments.

AB  - Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) crops are important agricultural commodities in water-limited environments across the globe, yet modelling of CAM productivity lacks the sophistication of widely used C3 and C4 crop models, in part due to the complex responses of the CAM cycle to environmental conditions. This work builds on recent advances in CAM modelling to provide a framework for estimating CAM biomass yield and water use efficiency from basic principles. These advances, which integrate the CAM circadian rhythm with established models of carbon fixation, stomatal conductance and the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, are coupled to models of light attenuation, plant respiration and biomass partitioning. Resulting biomass yield and transpiration for Opuntia ficus-indica and Agave tequilana are validated against field data and compared with predictions of CAM productivity obtained using the empirically based environmental productivity index. By representing regulation of the circadian state as a nonlinear oscillator, the modelling approach captures the diurnal dynamics of CAM stomatal conductance, allowing the prediction of CAM transpiration and water use efficiency for the first time at the plot scale. This approach may improve estimates of CAM productivity under light-limiting conditions when compared with previous methods.

AB  - This study investigates the petrographic analysis, microlithotype, and palaeoenviroment of deposition of the upper Triassic Olang coal deposits in northeastern Iran. The average maceral composition of the studied coals consisted of 82.3, 8.9, 0.4 (vol.%), vitrinite, inertinite and liptinite groups, respectively. Vitrinite macerals include equal portions of collotelinite and; collodetrinite and a small quantity of corpogelinite also is present in all coal seams. Semifusinite and fusinite are the most abundant inertinite macerals.
   The Ground Water Index (GWI) suggests that these coal seams have evolved in a limnic coal fades (a bog palaeomire system) under ombrotrophic hydrological conditions, except the K(6)G coal seam, which evolved a limnic coal facies (a bog palaeomire system) under mesotrophic hydrological conditions. The Vegetation Index (VI) values are indicative of the dominance of herbaceous plants in the formation of coal seams of the Olang area. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Invasive species can exert rapid depletion of resources after introduction and, in turn, affect their own population density. Additionally, management actions can have direct and indirect effects on demography. Physiological variables can predict demographic change but are often restricted to snapshots-in-time and delayed confirmation of changes in population density reduces their utility. To evaluate the relationships between physiology and demography, we assessed metrics of individual and demographic stress (baseline and 1-h corticosterone (CORT), body condition and bacterial killing ability) in the invasive snake Boiga irregularis on Guam collected in intervals of 10-15 years. We also assessed potential discrepancies between different methods of measuring hormones [radioimmunoassay (RIA) versus enzyme immunoassay (EIA)]. The magnitude of difference between RIA and EIA was negligible and did not change gross interpretation of our results. We found that body condition was higher in recent samples (2003 and 2018) versus older (1992-93) samples. We found corresponding differences in baseline CORT, with higher baseline CORT in older, poorer body condition samples. Hormonal response to acute stress was higher in 2018 relative to 2003. We also found a weak relationship between circulating CORT and bacterial killing ability among 2018 samples, but the biological significance of the relationship is not clear. In an effort to develop hypotheses for future investigation of the links between physiology and demography in this and other systems, we discuss how the changes in CORT and body condition may reflect changes in population dynamics, resource availability or management pressure. Ultimately, we advocate for the synchronization of physiology and management studies to advance the field of applied conservation physiology.

AB  - 1. Growth hormone (GH) treatment increases the growth rate and competitive ability of salmonids under laboratory conditions. Since fast growth should increase fitness, why is endogenous secretion of GH not higher in wild fish? To address this question, three hypotheses were suggested. H(1): high GH levels reduce antipredator responses and may therefore increase mortality from predation. H(2): high GH levels reduce longterm (e.g. over winter) survival by reducing allocation to critical energy reserves. H(3): GH is not beneficial for growth under natural conditions.
   2, To test these hypotheses, the performance of GH-treated juvenile Brown Trout (Salmo trutta) and control (placebo) trout was compared in an enclosed stream section subjected to natural predation. Four experiments were conducted during winter, spring, summer and autumn, respectively.
   3, Mortality rates were not significantly different between GH-treated and control trout in any of the four experiments so H(1) was not supported. Energy reserves were generally lower in GH-treated fish, which is consistent with H(2), whereas growth rates in mass were higher in GH-treated fish than in controls so H(3) was not supported. This suggests that GH promotes growth at the expense of investment in maintenance.
   4. Judging from growth and mortality rates, the fitness of GH-treated and control trout appeared similar. Thus, escaped GH-manipulated fish may compete successfully with wild fish.
   5. Hatchery-raised trout with higher initial condition index suffered higher mortality rates than more slender fish. This novel finding may be explained by reduced escape ability related to body morphology, reduced behavioural responses towards predators by high-condition trout, or predator preferences for high-condition fish.

AB  - An integrative biomarker approach was employed to evaluate the environmental quality of the north coast of Shandong Peninsula along the southern Bohai Sea of China, where pollution is an imminent threat due to rapid urbanization and industrialization. A battery of biomarkers and the metal bioaccumulation in tissues of native oyster Crassostrea gigas were measured under field conditions. Integrative biomarker index (IBR) and metal body burden were calculated to differentiate the pollution status of seven sampling sites. According to our results, Xinzhuang (XZ) site was the most severely contaminated, with the highest IBR value of 3.58, while the lowest IBR value (0.04) was obtained at Penglai (PL). Such an integrated biomarker approach was proved as a useful method for environmental quality assessment in the study area. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Stress biomarkers, which can outline impacts of contaminants in aquatic biota at the biochemical level, are increasingly used as early warning tools in environmental monitoring. Reliable biomarker based assessment schemes, however, request appropriate knowledge of baseline levels of selected endpoints, and the potential influence of a range of natural influencing factors (both abiotic and biotic) as well. In this study, we examined the interspecies variability of various biomarkers (metallothioneins (MT), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity (EROD), lipid peroxidation (LPO), DNA strand breaks (DNA_sb), vitellogenin-like proteins (Vtg)) in Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis inhabiting either pristine- or moderately impacted sites of Lake Balaton (Hungary). Levels of all biomarkers considered revealed low interspecies variability in the two dreissenid species at all sampling sites, with consistently higher (but statistically insignificant) values in Dreissena polymorpha. Levels of all biomarkers varied within the two investigated seasons, with significant influence of the reproduction cycle particularly on the levels of metallothioneins and vitellogenin-like proteins. Each biomarker considered was elevated by October, with significantly higher values in the mussels inhabiting harbours. Insignificant spatial and temporal variability in the general health indicators (condition index, total protein content) of dreissenids was observed, which, in parallel with evident rise in biomarker levels, apparently suggest that the anthropogenic impactsin harbours affect mussel fitness yet at sub organismal level. Our data might serve useful basis for future environmental monitoring surveys, especially in habitats where the progressive replacement of Dreissena polymorpha by Dreissena bugensis is taking place, as the interspecies variability in susceptibility to chemical stress of the two species is well comparable.

AB  - The great majority of marine protected areas (MPAs) fail to meet their management objectives. So MPAs can be effective conservation tools, we recommend two paradigm shifts, the first related to how they are located and the second related to how they are managed. MPAs are unlikely to be effective if they are located in areas that are subject to numerous, and often uncontrollable, external stressors from atmospheric, terrestrial, and oceanic sources, all of which can degrade the environment and compromise protection. MPA effectiveness is also limited by low institutional and community capacity for management and inappropriate size with respect to ecological needs. In particular, the check list approach to management does not ensure that key threats are dealt with, or that management expenditures provide a quantifiable return. We recommend a business planning approach to MPA management, in which managers focus on the viability of the management system, i.e., the ability of the MPA to provide ecological goods and services to its target users over the long term.

AB  - The objective of the study presented herein is to provide an accurate climate classification on the basis of aridity in northern Algeria. The aridity indices used in this study were the De Martonne index (I-DM), the Emberger index (I-Emberger), and the United Nations Environment Program index (I-UNEP), generally admitted in the Mediterranean region. The data required for their calculation were taken from 37 meteorological stations, and processed in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment to generate climate classification maps according to each index. Generally, the three indices revealed the prevalence of semi-arid conditions in the study area. Similar climate classifications were identified with theI(UNEP)and theI(DM), while theI(Emberger)has identified larger arid extent. The obtained maps were then validated against the long-term soil moisture data extracted from a gridded global data set. The validation results indicated that the three indices gave very satisfactory results since they showed strong correlation coefficients with the soil moisture data. However, theI(Emberger)slightly outperformed theI(UNEP)and theI(DM)with coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.80, 0.78, and 0.77, respectively. The seasonal investigation of aridity allowed to identify regions and seasons in which irrigation is needed for the main crops cultivated in the study area.

AB  - A high-pressure polymorph of chromite, the first natural sample with the calcium ferrite structure, has been discovered in the shock veins of the Suizhou meteorite. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction analyses reveal an orthorhombic CaFe2O4-type (CF) structure. The unit-cell parameters are a = 8.954(7) Angstrom, b = 2.986(2) Angstrom, c = 9.891(7) Angstrom, V = 264.5(4) Angstrom(3) (Z = 4) with space group Pnma. The new phase has a density of 5.62 g/cm(3), which is 9.4% denser than chromite-spinel. We performed laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments to establish that chromite-spinel transforms to CF at 12.5 GPa and then to the recently discovered CaTi2O4-type (CT) structure above 20 GPa. With the ubiquitous presence of chromite, the CF and CT phases may be among the important index minerals for natural transition sequence and pressure and temperature conditions in mantle rocks, shock-metamorphosed terrestrial rocks, and meteorites.

AB  - Clear, accessible, objective metrics of species status are critical to communicate the state of biodiversity and to measure progress towards biodiversity targets. However, the population data underpinning current species status metrics is often highly skewed towards particular taxonomic groups such as birds, butterflies and mammals, primarily due to the restricted availability of high quality population data. A synoptic overview of the state of biodiversity requires sampling from a broader range of taxonomic groups. Incorporating data from a wide range of monitoring and analysis methods and considering more than one measure of species status are possible ways to achieve this.
   Here, we utilise measures of species' population change and extinction risk to develop three species status metrics, a Categorical Change metric, a Species Index and a Red List metric, and populate them with a wide range of data sources from the UK, covering thousands of species from across taxonomy. The species status metrics reiterate the commonly reported decline in freshwater and terrestrial species' status in the UK in recent decades and give little evidence that this rate of decline has slowed.
   The utility of species status metrics is further improved if we can extrapolate beyond the species sampled to infer the status of the community. For the freshwater and terrestrial species status metrics presented here we can do this with some confidence. Nevertheless, despite the range and number of species contributing to the species metrics, significant taxonomic bias remained and we report weighting options that could help control for this.The three metrics developed were used in the State of Nature 2016 report and indications are they reached a large number of audience members. We suggest options to improve the design and communication of these and similar metrics in the future.

AB  - The objective of the current study was the investigation of specific relationships between crop coefficients and vegetation indices (VI) computed at the water-limited environment of Lake Karla Watershed, Thessaly, in central Greece. A Mapping ET (evapotranspiration) at high Resolution and with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model was used to derive crop coefficient values during the growing season of 2012. The proposed methodology was developed using medium resolution Landsat 7 ETM+ images and meteorological data from a local weather station. Cotton, sugar beets, and corn fields were utilized. During the same period, spectral signatures were obtained for each crop using the field spectroradiometer GER1500 (Spectra Vista Corporation, NY, U.S.A.). Relative spectral responses (RSR) were used for the filtering of the specific reflectance values giving the opportunity to match the spectral measurements with Landsat ETM+ bands. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2) were then computed, and empirical relationships were derived using linear regression analysis. NDVI, SAVI, and EVI2 were tested separately for each crop. The resulting equations explained those relationships with a very high R-2 value (>0.86). These relationships have been validated against independent data. Validation using a new image file after the experimental period gives promising results, since the modeled image file is similar in appearance to the initial one, especially when a crop mask is applied. The CROPWAT model supports those results when using the new crop coefficients to estimate the related crop water requirements. The main benefit of the new approach is that the derived relationships are better adjusted to the crops. The described approach is also less time-consuming because there is no need for atmospheric correction when working with ground spectral measurements.

TI  - Linkages between Chiropteran diversity and ecosystem services for sustainable fragmented forest conservation
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
LA  - English
AB  - This data article informs about Chiropteran diversity, new records, ecosystem services and possible pathogen carriers in fragmented forests (sub-divided by utility corridors, man-made structures, untouched and secondary plantations) within districts Setiu (Setiu Research Station), Hulu Terengganu (Saok and Lasir waterfalls) and Besut (Gunung Tebu Forest Reserve) of state Terengganu, Peninsular Malaysia. These bats were captured using harp traps and mist nets that were set 10 m apart across flyways, streams and less cluttered trees in the 50 m x 50 m transect zones (identified at each site). All animals were distinguished by morphology and gender before their release at the site of capture. The data comprise of five bat family groups Hipposideridae, Megadermatidae, Pteropodidae, Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae. It is interesting to note that untouched Saok Waterfalls is home to wide variety of bats listed (68.8%), followed by secondary forests of Gunung Tebu Forest Reserve (24.8%), untouched Lasir Waterfalls (4.8%) and lastly, Setiu Research Station as least favored (1.6%). Chiroptera like Cynopterus brachyotis (n = 23, 37.7%), Hipposideros bicolor (n = 6, 9.8%) and Scotophilus kuhli (n = 6, 9.8%) were most dominant in the checklist whereas Hipposideros armiger, Murina suilla and Scotophilus kuhlii are new data records in the fragmented forests of Terengganu. The data were interpret into Shannon, Simpson, Margalef, Menhinik and Evenness indices to individually or collectively distinguish chiropteran variety in Terengganu State whereas weight -forearm length (W/FA) informs about chiropteran Body Condition Index (-0.25 to 0.25). The function of bats were also identified to distinguish service providers (pollination and forests regeneration) and zoonotic pathogen carriers (in particular to Leptospira bacteria, Nipah virus and Sindbis virus).

AB  - Aims Indicators of pending state-shifts carry value for policy makers. Predator-prey relations reflect key ecological processes that shape ecosystems. Variance in predator-prey relations may serve as a key indicator of future state-shifts.
   Methods Lion (Panthera leo) diet in the Kruger National Park was evaluated as such an indicator. Over the three-decade time span reviewed, variance in diet in relation to rainfall, prey abundance, management strategies and disease emergence were reviewed.
   Key results Rainfall patterns, both seasonal and cyclical, were identified as key drivers of predator-prey selection. However, the intensity of management in the form of artificial waterpoints overrode and confounded natural process. The results suggest that savanna systems are stable and punctuated by climatic events in the form of extreme above-average rainfall that temporarily destabilises the system. However, droughts are a cyclical part of the savanna system.
   Conclusion Lion prey selection did fluctuate with changing environmental conditions. Abrupt state shifts did occur; however, the ecosystem returned to a stable state.
   Implications State shifts in ecosystems pose key challenges to conservation managers. State shifts appear to be primarily associated with management interventions and environmental factors.

AB  - Interannual variability (2003-2008) of meiofaunal assemblages were analyzed in sediments beneath fish cages (Impact group) and in areas not affected by aquaculture activities (Control group). Organisms responded with spatial and seasonal variation in meiofauna assemblages, with an abrupt increase of abundances in locations beneath fish cages throughout the study period. This increase was greater during the last sampling year (2008) and mainly due to high abundances of nematodes. Univariate analyses showed differences between control and impacted sites at both sites, however, only significant variations were found in Los Gigantes, which are consistent with seasonal meiofauna variations throughout the study period. These results are partially explained by differences in current velocity between both sampling areas. The Ne/Co index showed the same trend and it seems to be a reliable index in sediment slightly affected by aquaculture wastes. This index is especially recommended in oligotrophic areas (e.g. Canary Islands) where meiofaunal assemblages are poorly represented in terms of abundances. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Despite the important ecosystem and hydrological roles of coastal and inland waters, there are no established biomonitoring protocols for evaluating environmental, wildlife and human health for these coastlines in Nigeria. In the present study, contaminants tissue burden and effects at molecular and physiological levels, were investigated in Tilapia guineensis from a man-made lake (Eleyele Lake) that is used for municipal domestic water supply and compared to a reference site (Igboho Lake). Gene expression of phase I and II biotransformation systems, oxidative stress and obesogen responses were analyzed using real-time PCR, and these results were related to general health index (condition factor: CF) and muscle burden of trace metals, aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We observed a significant increase in phase I and II biotransformation systems, oxidative stress and obesogen responses in male and female fish from Eleyele lake compared with the reference site. Overall, our data showed significant relationships between biological responses and tissue concentrations of metals and PAHs for the Eleyele lake compared with the reference site. Given that a positive influence on genes and pathways associated with metabolic status has been previously associated with peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), xenobiotic compounds that activate PPARs may produce changes in energy and metabolic processes, leading to obesity. The high CF (> 1 = good health condition) observed, coupled with the high muscle burden of inorganic and organic contaminants in fish from Eleyele lake, suggest a potential obesogenic effect in these fishes. These findings represent co-relational evidence that the Eleyele lake is contaminated and consequently affecting biological and physiological integrity of organisms inhabiting the lake. These findings also suggest potential health risks for humans, since the lake is extensively used for domestic water supply and fisheries.
