AB  - The article provides a comparative study of the possibility of entrepreneurship development based on fuzzy signals of business activity and applied elements of artificial intelligence. The principal research methods that determine the logic and practical basis of the application of fuzzy logic in entrepreneurship are highlighted. It has been determined that fuzzy modeling is effective when technological processes are too complex for analysis using generally accepted quantitative methods, or when available sources of information in the business environment are interpreted poorly, inaccurately, and indefinitely. It has been shown experimentally that fuzzy logic gives better results compared to those obtained with generally accepted algorithms for analyzing the quality of doing business. A model of a neuro-fuzzy regulator has been developed and measures for its implementation in the business environment have been proposed. A neural network model in entrepreneurial development has been formed. Studies have shown the possibility of effective use of the principles of artificial intelligence and modeling in solving problems of developing entrepreneurial potential and making business decisions under conditions of uncertainty. This ensures objective and well-grounded decision-making in solving various applied problems of business development and taking into account environmental factors. The applied tasks of supporting the adoption of entrepreneurial decisions in the conditions are formulated; uncertainty; indicating that approaches to decision-making under conditions of uncertainty based on artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic tools are universal and require appropriate careful study and adaptation to a specific applied problem in the business environment.

AB  - Capillary imbibition is an oil recovery mechanism in naturally fractured reservoirs if rock matrix is water wet and there is enough water in fractures in contact with matrix. It, however, may not yield an effective recovery under certain circumstances even if these conditions are maintained. Heavy matrix oil, high interfacial tension (IFT), oil-wet matrix sample, and limited contact area of matrix with water in fractures require additional effort to enhance the oil recovery by capillary imbibition. Chemicals and heat can be injected into naturally fractured reservoirs to improve the capillary imbibition recovery performance. With the involvement of low IFT fluid, heat, and polymer solution in the process, capillary imbibition dynamics may change and this entails an identification of the dynamics of the process through laboratory experiments before injection of these expensive fluids into oil reservoirs. In this study, the dynamics of capillary imbibition was studied experimentally. Static imbibition experiments were conducted on oil- and water-wet rock samples under different boundary conditions and saturated with different types of oil. The analyses were conducted using three indicators, namely the capillary imbibition rate, ultimate oil recovery, and shape of the recovery profile. Based on these indicators, the dynamics of capillary imbibition of different aqueous phases were evaluated for different oil types and matrix properties. The conditions that cause weak or strong capillary imbibition were identified. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science.

AB  - The microbiological quality of urban wastewaters presents important environmental, sanitary, and political challenges. However, the variability of untreated wastewater quality is seldom known when it comes to microbial parameters. This study aims to evaluate the variability of microbiological quality in wastewater influents from different wastewater treatment plants connected to combined and partially separate sewer networks in the Parisian area and to evaluate the impact of this variability on the treatment efficiency and on the accuracy of wastewater effluent monitoring. The densities of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci, and their partitioning on settleable particles were analyzed at the inlet of two wastewater treatment plants during dry weather (130 composite samples and 7 days sampled every 2 hours) and storm events (39 composite samples, and 7 rain courses) from 2008 to 2012. The results showed that fecal indicator densities vary according to the network characteristics and according to the meteorological conditions. During storm events, a significant dilution of E. coli and enterococci was observed, as well as a decrease in the settleable fraction of E. coli during the maximal impact of the storm. However, storm events did not significantly impact the regular FIB monitoring. FIB removals by primary and secondary treatment were significantly correlated with FIB densities in influent wastewater; however, meteorological conditions also influenced the removal of FIB.

AB  - Infant mortality is an indicator of the population's health and of the degree of economic development. It is a sensitive indicator to changes in environmental, social and economical conditions and is commonly used to express the degree of overall development of a society or a country's quality of life. In CEE countries, infant mortality, although it decreased in the past 20 years, is still high compared to other EU countries, since there are groups of countries with specific issues and for which it reflects the state of their economic and social development. One of EU goals is to reduce the level of this indicator and GEE countries must make a concerted effort in this regard The paper's objective is the empirical evaluation of the relationship between infant mortality and socio-economic conditions for 8 EU countries from CEE which have an infant mortality rate (IMR) larger that the EU27 average. We use econometric modelling for panel data to identify the main determinants of infant mortality for these countries and to test if the decrease of IMR is determined not only by economic growth but also by social and health factors. The results support, on one hand, the assumption of a negative impact of the level of economic development, and on the other hand it indicates the presence of specific determinant factors for this group of European countries, such as abortion rate, unemployment or average age of female at first birth.

AB  - The aim of the work - to analyze modern scientific and practical achievements in the effectiveness of implants in planned and emergency hernia surgery and to identify promising areas for further research.
   The literature review presents modern views on the assessment of biocompatibility, effectiveness and appropriateness of the use of implants in planned and urgent hernia surgery. The importance of determining the main factors of ventral hernia occurrence, assessing the prognostic components of the reparative process course in the field of hernioplasty and methods of correction has been substantiated. Physicochemical characteristics of implants, which both historically and on an up-to-date level are used according to planned or urgent conditions for performing surgical intervention in patients with ventral hernias, are given. The necessity of using an integrated approach to choosing a method for correction or reconstruction of the abdominal wall, taking into account the biological and dynamic conditions of its state, is shown. The need for a selective approach to the choice of therapeutic tactics in patients, especially if hernia repair is necessary in conditions of a clean-contaminated or infected surgical wound, is emphasized.
   Conclusions. In order to improve the consequences of hernioplasty, it is necessary to assess patient's reserves and risks more thoroughly and comprehensively, as well as to make absolute indications for the use of implants. An improvement in the results of urgent and planned repair of ventral hernias is to perform surgical interventions only in surgery departments constantly provided with modern world achievements.

AB  - The Miocene-Pliocene lacustrine units comprises bituminous shale, coal seam, conglomerate, siltstone, sandstone and claystone were deposited in a graben developed along the Eskisehir Fault Zone at the east of Eskisehir. The geological, mineralogical and geochemical analyses were performed on samples obtained from ES4 and ES7 core drilling holes at the Alpu coal basin. Abundant smectite associated with kaolinite, illite, quartz, feldspar, dolomite, siderite, accessory amphibole, gypsum, alunite and pyrite. the muscovite, chlorite, feldspar, serpantine crystals and their groundmass are partly to completely argillized in host rocks. Micromorphologically, development of smectite flakes and platy illite crystals on relicts of feldspar suggest dissolution and a precipitation mechanism under alkaline micro-environmental conditions during diagenesis. Enrichment of light rare-earth elements relative to middle rare-earth elements and heavy rare-earth elements and positive Eu anomalies reflect alteration of feldspar. Alteration of feldspar, biotite and serpentine resulted in the concentration of Al, F and Mg in a stagnant envrionment and precipitation smectite and in an alkaline environment. The low to moderate Ni/Co and high V/(V+Ni) ratios are indicative of oxic to dysoxic and anoxic to dysoxic conditions, respectively. TiO/Ni and SiO2 versus (Al2O3+K2O+Na2O) discrimination diagram show that weathered samples is indicative of formation from the locally basic igneous rocks and alteration formed predominantly via sedimentation process under arid and semiarid conditions and formation of clay minerals.

AB  - To understand the ecological effects of forest restoration treatments on several old-growth forest stands in the Flathead National Forest of western Montana, USA, we surveyed birds at 72 points in treatment and control stands, and at more than 50 points in each of five potential reference stand conditions. We used a Before-After/Control-Impact design to assess treatment effects based on data collected 3 years before and 2 years after treatment. We also examined the similarity in bird community composition among all stand types by using a nonmetric multidimensional scaling approach. Relative abundances of only a few bird species changed significantly as a result of restoration treatments, and these changes were characterized largely by declines in the abundances of a few species associated with more mesic, dense-forest conditions, and not by increases in the abundances of species associated with more xeric, old-growth reference stand conditions. Thus, bird communities in treated stands were more similar to those in untreated stands of the same forest type than to those found in any of the potential old-growth reference stands. Although more time may be required for some bird species to respond to treatments, our results suggest that treatment plot sizes were either too small to affect bird communities or that the forest type selected for treatment was not within the range of forest types that are well suited for this type of forest restoration.

AB  - Electric distribution systems can present faults that affect the quality of service and create discomfort among users. This type of breakdown generally requires maneuvers that require time to restore. In this sense, the implementation of ADVC-IOEX SCHNEIDER cards was evaluated to restore the power circuits of the Celso Castellanos Electric Substation to their normal service conditions without resorting to complicated manual maneuvers. For this, the current state conditions of each recloser were analyzed, such as: load regime, fault occurrence, alert and communication protection systems, event log, among others; that allow to carry out the programming logic of the equipment and under visual inspection data mechanical and electrical plans were designed, taking into account the environmental conditions of the area, adequacy of space and feasibility of the substation facilities that allow the modification and maintenance of the system implemented, lastly, maneuver tests were carried out with electrical equipment through primary injection tests to verify the output signals required on the Remote Control panel of Feeders. The results found show that the implementation and development of the ADVC-IOEX cards are essential to improve security, reliability, speed, and the support of maneuver for the restoration of the distribution of the electrical circuits of the Celso Castellanos Electric Substation, given that the previous diagnosis of the national electrical system reflects that the failures of the electrical distribution systems are important and affect the performance of economic activities in the agro-industrial sector.

AB  - The study set out to determine changes in the soil air-water properties, the water-stable aggregate share and organic carbon content as effects of a five-year application of effective microorganisms (EM-A). The hypothesis that long-term applied EM-A biopreparations have a positive effect on the soil physical condition has not been confirmed. Haplic Luvisols originating from silt were studied in a field experiment after EM-A biopreparation treatment. The soil samples with the natural structure preserved intact were collected three times each year. The properties of the soil determined in the study were: particle density, total organic carbon content, bulk density, total porosity, air capacity, air permeability, soil moisture at sampling, field water capacity, available water content, unavailable water content, and water-stable aggregate content. The ratio of field water capacity and total porosity (FC/TP) was calculated. It was found that EM-A application primarily leads to a decrease in the content of organic carbon and water-stable aggregates. This was an adverse effect. Total organic carbon (TOC) and water-stable aggregates proved to be very sensitive indicators for assessing the soil physical condition. However, changes in soil compaction and air-water properties did not show significant deterioration. Our research addresses the data gaps about EM application to soil.

AB  - A recurrent interrogation when imaging soft biomolecules using atomic force microscopy (AFM) is the putative deformation of molecules leading to a bias in recording true topographical surfaces. Deformation of biomolecules comes from three sources: sample instability, adsorption to the imaging substrate, and crushing under tip pressure. To disentangle these causes, we measured the maximum height of a well-known biomolecule, the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), under eight different experimental conditions positing that the maximum height value is a specific indicator of sample deformations. Six basic AFM experimental factors were tested: imaging in air (AIR) versus in liquid (LIQ), imaging with flat minerals (MICA) versus flat organic surfaces (self-assembled monolayers, SAM), and imaging forces with oscillating tapping mode (TAP) versus PeakForce tapping (PFT). The results show that the most critical parameter in accurately measuring the height of TMV in air is the substrate. In a liquid environment, regardless of the substrate, the most critical parameter is the imaging mode. Most importantly, the expected TMV height values were obtained with both imaging with the PeakForce tapping mode either in liquid or in air at the condition of using self-assembled monolayers as substrate. This study unambiguously explains previous poor results of imaging biomolecules on mica in air and suggests alternative methodologies for depositing soft biomolecules on well organized self-assembled monolayers.

AB  - Spiders can suppress populations of some important crop pests. Although dispersal is essential to their survival in the disturbed farmland environment, accounts of their dispersal activity over several seasons are few. Spiders dispersing across a landscape of mixed farmland were sampled over an 18-month period using Stick, Net and Bottle traps (SNB traps). Traps were located in a two year old grass ley where ground densities of spiders and wind speed data were also recorded. SNB traps were effective at sampling large numbers of dispersers; Linyphiidae were the most abundant family sampled (93%). Numbers of adult linyphiids dispersing were found to increase in autumn and winter with dispersal activity occurring frequently throughout the study period. Dispersal patterns were similar for congeners (Erigone spp., Oedothorax spp.) although differences were evident between common agrobiont species. Weather conditions associated with stable high-pressure systems appeared important for stimulating mass dispersal in Oedothorax Bertkau, 1883 species. Erigone atra Blackwall, 1833 dispersed more frequently and under more variable conditions. Winter and spring dispersal was low for adult Tenuiphantes tenuis (Blackwall, 1852) and Bathyphantes gracilis (Blackwall, 1841) compared to common erigonids. Ground populations correlated positively with dispersing spiders for some species indicating that dispersal activity was in part a function of population size. For Oedothorax fuscus (Blackwall, 1834) it is suggested that life history traits and weather conditions may interact to influence the sex ratio of dispersers over time.

AB  - As almost all Mediterranean countries are facing water scarcity problems today, water losses in drinking water supply networks have grown to an urgent problem, needing immediate confrontation, representing a too valuable to be neglected water potential. The first step towards water losses reduction is the water supply network performance assessment process. The most commonly used methodology is the one introduced by the International Water Association (IWA), including the International Standard Water Balance and a list of Performance Indicators (PIs). Five years after the second PIs handbook edition was launched increasing the PIs included to 170 from 133 of the first edition, there is a need to re-evaluate them, including also new PIs adapted/focused to regional conditions and addressing other important topics such as environmental issues. The paper presents a new set of water losses-related PIs, focused on areas facing water scarcity conditions met in the Mediterranean countries, forming a solid basis for an integrated Decision Support System (DSS) to evaluate water supply networks and prioritize alternative water losses reduction strategies. The new set includes 75 out of the 170 IWA PIs and 42 new proposed PIs. The new PIs set is formed, selecting the most appropriate existing PIs and suggesting new ones. An integrated approach using a survey among local stakeholders in each partner's country is used. The platform and the basic components of this user-friendly DSS tool are also being presented here.

AB  - The effect of a stormwater conveyance system on indicator bacteria levels at a Florida beach was assessed using microbial source tracking methods, and by investigating indicator bacteria population structure in water and sediments. During a rain event, regulatory standards for both fecal coliforms and Enterococcus spp. were exceeded, contrasting with significantly lower levels under dry conditions. Indicator bacteria levels were high in sediments under all conditions. The involvement of human sewage in the contamination was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the esp gene of Enterococcus faecium and for the conserved T antigen of human polyomaviruses, all of which were negative. BOX-PCR subtyping of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus showed higher population diversity during the rain event; and higher population similarity during dry conditions, suggesting that without fresh inputs, only a subset of the population survives the selective pressure of the secondary habitat. These data indicate that high indicator bacteria levels were attributable to a stormwater system that acted as a reservoir and conduit, flushing high levels of indicator bacteria to the beach during a rain event. Such environmental reservoirs of indicator bacteria further complicate the already questionable relationship between indicator organisms and human pathogens, and call for a better understanding of the ecology, fate and persistence of indicator bacteria.

AB  - The lichens Rainalina celastri (Spreng.) Krog & Swinsc., Punctelia microsticta (Mull. Arg.) Krog and Canomaculina pilosa (Stizenb.) Elix & Hale were transplanted simultaneously to 17 urban-industrial sites in a northwestern area of Cordoba city, Argentina. The transplantation sites were set according to different environmental conditions: traffic, industries, tree cover, building height, topographic level, position in the block and distances from the river and from the power plant. Three months later, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, phaeophytin a, soluble proteins, hydroperoxy conjugated dienes, malondialdehyde concentration and sulfur accumulation were determined, and a pollution index was calculated for each sampling site. Redundancy analysis was applied to detect the variation pattern of the lichen variables that can be 'best' explained by the environmental variables considered. The present study provides information about both the specific pattern response of each species to atmospheric pollution, and environmental conditions that determine it. As regards pollutants emission sources R. celastri showed a chemical response associated mainly with pollutant released by the power plant and traffic. P. microsticta and C. pilosa responded mainly to industrial sources. Regarding environmental conditions that affect the spreading of air pollutants and their incidence on the bioindicator, the topographic level and tree cover surrounding the sampling site were found to be important for R. celastri, tree cover surrounding the sampling site and the building height affected P. inicrosticta, while building height did so for C. pilosa.

AB  - In this article biodegradability is considered as a combination of an inherent substance property, defined as the maximum specific growth rate, mu (max) and a condition of the environment defined as a specific fraction (f(s)) of the total viable biomass. By proper analysis of test results it is possible to quantify both parameters by one single standard test, Calculations with Literature data indicate that for the majority of the degradable substances, mu (max) may vary bet treen 0.5 and 10 per day. The specific fractions, however, may vary 5 or 6 orders of magnitude and can be as low as 10(-8). This concept gives a valuable tool in environmental risk assessment. As the results will be less influenced by test conditions, data will be more reproducible and can be more predictive for a specific environment. The results allow predicting the time needed to achieve adaptation in a treatment plant and, in particular, the behavior under conditions with discontinuous discharge, By using threshold criteria for mu (max), f(s), and percentage mineralization, a new classification scheme,vith eight different classes for biodegradability is proposed. Compared to the currently used system with two classes, the prediction of biodegradation will be more sophisticated. The proposed system differentiates for sis types of inherently degradable substances and identifies those substances with an abnormal growth curve, due to inhibition or toxicity, poor water solubility, or incomplete mineralization, For these classes the proposed equations are not directly applicable and more research will be required to predict their behavior.

AB  - We used paleoecological methods to infer environmental conditions in Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A) of the Everglades before impoundment in 1961, and we compared pre-impoundment environmental conditions to present conditions. Abundances of siliceous microfossils (diatoms, chrysophyte cysts, sponge gemmoscleres, and plant phytoliths) were analyzed in two sediment cores from nutrient-enriched northern WCA-2A and in two sediment cores from unenriched southern WCA-2A. Nutrient enrichment in northern WCA-2A after 1961 was associated with an increase in relative abundance of eutrophic diatoms. A pH increase in much of WCA-2A after 1961 was indicated by a decrease in relative abundance of acidic indicators (Eunotia diatoms and the sponge Anheteromeyenia ryderi) and a decrease in richness of chrysophyte cysts. An increase in anoxia in nutrient-enriched northern WCA-2A, during about 1961-1980 when high water depth was maintained, was suggested by an increase in visible dissolution of siliceous microfossils. A decrease in palm phytolith abundance after 1961 and lack of recovery after water depth was lowered suggest either that water depth is still maintained high enough to adversely affect vegetation or that there has been insufficient time for recovery. Numbers of sponge gemmoscleres decreased to less than 1% of preimpoundment numbers, suggesting that there has been a dramatic decrease in sponge abundance. The environmental changes discovered in this study suggest directions for future management of the Everglades.

AB  - Electron transport rate (ETR), estimated from chlorophyll fluorescence, is a widely-used indicator of photosynthetic activity. However, net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rate (A) does not linearly correlate with ETR when the fraction of electron partitioning into photosynthesis and photorespiration changes under fluctuating environmental conditions (CO2, light, temperature and soil moisture).
   Here, we propose a practical approach to estimate A based on ETR with integration of stomatal conductance (g(s)) and leaf temperature, taking intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i)- and temperature-dependent electron partitioning into account.
   A estimated with the present approach was in good agreement with A measured under i) various CO2 concentrations and light intensities in seedlings of Japanese beech and Japanese white birch, and ii) under 400 and 800 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 and temperatures of 15-40 degrees C, and iii) in progress of drought stress after a water withholding in seedlings of Japanese white birch. Furthermore, canopy-level CO2 uptake could be estimated based on the spectroscopic and flux observations over a Japanese beech stand, under a wide range of environmental conditions.
   The present approach is advantageous because it does not require biochemical information, such as the maximum rates of Rubisco carboxylation and electron transport, providing a more forward approach to estimate terrestrial carbon flux through remote sensing approaches.

AB  - Bog petroleum-contaminated soils have been remediated ex situ in conditions close to natural ones. It was found that during the first 30 days in natural conditions, the decomposition of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) was 30 +/- 5%. On the 60th and 90th days, the process of TPH decomposition was 45 +/- 5% and 60 +/- 5%, respectively. The effect of various stimulant supplements was negligible. For the entire observed period, bog soil showed a very high self-cleaning potential with pollution concentration of 5 g of petroleum per 100 g of soil sample. Such diagnostic indicators of soil condition as urease and cellulase activities turned out to be most sensitive in the bog soil. The introduction of mineral fertilizers to stimulate the TPH decomposition increased the activity of urease in comparison with the background soil. On the other hand, the nonionic surfactant acted as an inhibitor of microorganisms involved in nitrogen metabolism, even in the presence of mineral fertilizers. The introduction of mineral fertilizers to petroleum-polluted bog soil stimulated the cellulases activity, while surfactants suppressed them in the early stages. The simultaneous introduction of surfactants and fertilizers kept the cellulase activity at the background level. It is concluded that in the case of petroleum pollution of infertile soils, the introduction of the upper layers of the phytomass of lowland bogs by providing looseness and long-term supply of nutrients from the dying parts of the moss will accelerate the self-cleaning processes.

AB  - The byproducts of anaerobic biogeochemical processes, many mediated at the sediment-water interface, can degrade water quality in the bottom of reservoirs. Using both experimental sediment-water chambers and field monitoring, this study assessed nutrient and metals cycling in the profundal zone of hypereutrophic Hodges Reservoir, San Diego (maximum depth = 29.1 m; maximum surface area = 6.0 km(2)). A focus of the study was methylmercury (MeHg), a toxic form of mercury that bioaccumulates in aquatic food webs. Results confirmed that oxic conditions repressed release of redox-sensitive compounds (e.g., MeHg, ammonia, phosphate, manganese) from profundal sediment, though high sediment oxygen demand complicated experimental efforts to maintain a well-oxygenated sediment-water interface. In both experimental chambers and in the reservoir, patterns of MeHg cycling correlated with manganese cycling, suggesting that moderately low redox conditions that stimulate reductive dissolution of manganese also enhance net Hg methylation. Sediment MeHg flux was tightly coupled with sulfate uptake under moderately reduced conditions, reinforcing the link between sulfate-reducing bacteria and Hg methylation. Results highlight the fact that hypolimnetic oxygenation in Hodges Reservoir using pure oxygen gas, which is planned for spring 2020, must maintain high oxygen concentrations at the profundal sediment-water interface. In addition, results indicate that the presence of manganese in surface water can be used as an indicator of oxygenation's effectiveness in lowering rates of internal nutrient and MeHg loading.

AB  - A new method for culturing rodent whole embryos at the late organogenesis stage was developed using a roller-bottle system with intermittent gassing. Rat embryos were cultured for 24 h from gestational day (GD) 13.5 to 14.5. Growth and metabolic comparisons were made between in vivo embryos and embryos of the same GD cultured under various media and conditions. Crown-rump length, head length and protein content were used as growth indicators. Biologic markers such as embryonic tissue concentration of glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and lipid peroxidation were used as assessments of metabolic activity in terms of oxidative stress. Embryos cultured with media consisting of either 15% or 20% male rat serum and balanced with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) were found to most closely match in vivo embryos. 6 h gassing intervals and 5 mL medium volume/embryo provided optimal conditions for cultured embryos. By shortening the 24 h embryo culture period to 12 h, embryonic haemorrhaging was avoided. Moreover, the 12-h cultured embryos showed similar redox GSH/GSSG ratios and similar GSH content to the in vivo embryos, which was not observed in the embryos cultured under 24 h culture conditions. The present work demonstrates the utility of late organogenesis stage embryo culture as a model for the assessment of in vivo embryonic growth and oxidative stress indices. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The main goal of the current manuscript is the experimental outdoor testing of a Vacuum Multi-Effect Membrane Distillation (V-MEMD) System, the evaluation of the performance and energy efficiency under real operating conditions and the overall design of system components under local economic conditions. This system has a nominal capacity of 30-50 L/h and operating temperature range of 50-85 degrees C. The MD system utilizes the memsys V-MEMD modules with four effects. Supporting equipment and systems such as heating, cooling, feed, brine, distillate, recirculation and vacuum loops (cycles) were designed, purchased, installed and tested as an integrated system under outdoor environmental conditions. Experiments were conducted with tap and artificial saline water 30 mS/cm as feed streams. The system performance testing showed that the distillate production can reach 50 L/h at 80 degrees C of inlet heating water. The system distillate production was found to increase mainly with the increase of heating water temperature and flow rate. The energy efficiency indicators of the system was calculated based On the obtained experimental data, namely Specific Thermal Energy Consumption (STEC) ranged between 300-700 kWh/m(3), Gained Output Ratio (GOR) was recorded to vary between 1-2.2 and Performance Ratio (PR) was calculated to be 0.4-0.9 kg/Mj.

AB  - A comparison of the ergonomic performance of 13 harvesting machine models was assessed from an ergonomic viewpoint. The main objective of the study was to compare ergonomic performance to harvesting machine operators' work and propose viable solutions to improve the work environment. The principal assessed ergonomic requirements were operators' workspace, operators' seats, visibility, work postures, whole-body vibration and noise in the cab, all as related to the tasks involved in typical harvesting cycles. Altogether, more than 120 different parameters that impact ergonomics and work conditions were measured directly at workplaces in the actual working conditions. The results were then compared to the effective norms and the degree of compliance with the stipulated values was determined. The obtained estimates for the degree of compliance were integrated. This permits a direct comparison of the work-load on operators with a single integrated indicator (severity). In many respects the ergonomic standard is now good, except for skidders. Visibility and work postures were considered to be the most critical features influencing the operator's performance. Even in highly mechanized harvesting work, problems still exist despite extensive development Of cabs. The best working conditions in terms of harvesting systems were provided by "harvester + forwarder" in cut-to-length harvesting and "feller buncher + grapple skidder" in full-tree harvesting. The traditional Russian tree-length harvesting done with cable skidders showed the worst results in terms of ergonomics. When a partially mechanized harvesting system is employed, use of cable skidders should be as limited as possible, because, as a whole, they do not comply with the present ergonomic requirements.

AB  - A greater than 98% decline in Arundinaria gigantea (Walt.) Muhl. (giant cane or river cane) canebrake communities have resulted in a critically endangered ecosystem. Historical accounts suggest loss of canebrake habitat has resulted in the extirpation (and perhaps extinction) of many species. Thus, canebrake restoration is necessary for maintaining and enhancing biodiversity in the southeastern United States. The purpose of this study is to facilitate reestablishing A. gigantea canebrakes by optimizing growth and survivorship conditions for seedlings. To this end, we developed a lab experiment to test the effects of soil moisture (periodic drought, periodic flooding, and well-drained) and nitrogen fertilization on A. gigantea seedling growth and physiology. Arundinaria gigantea, while able to survive both drought and flooding, had significantly greater growth under well-drained conditions. Shoot growth averaged 28 cm and root growth averaged 11 cm in well-drained pots. Seedlings grown in flooded and drought treatments were not significantly different, averaging 20 cm in shoot growth and 4 cm in root growth. Biomass results mirrored shoot and root growth; biomass of roots and shoots was 30% greater under well-drained conditions. Nitrogen fertilization did not significantly affect seedling growth or physiology. Neither stomatal conductance nor net photosynthesis was significantly affected by moisture regime or nitrogen fertilization. However, results imply soil moisture regime as a significant factor controlling the growth and distribution of A. gigantea, and thus canebrake restoration will likely be most successful on well-drained soils.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) and N fractions are considered important indicators of soil health due to their multifunctional roles in storing and supplying nutrients, enhancing soil physical properties, and feeding soil biological activity and plant nutrition. Soil health condition from 120 fields under cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivation in North Carolina was assessed from soil analyses associated with a survey of historical management. Surface residue was collected, and soil was sampled at 0-to-10-cm, 10-to-30-cm, and 30-to-60-cm depths. Soil properties varied by physiographic region of Piedmont, Coastal Plain, and Flatwoods. Conservation tillage was the dominant form of cotton cultivation, but many farms used inversion tillage for other crops in the rotation sequence. Soil-test biological activity averaged 138 and 92 mg kg(-1) 3 d(-1) under continuous conservation tillage and frequent tillage, respectively, in the surface 10-cm depth (p < .001), and the tillage effect persisted into the 10-to-30-cm depth (44 and 37 mg kg(-1) 3 d(-1), p < .05). Cover cropping and animal manure had fewer and smaller effects on soil properties. History of animal manure application elevated (p < .05) soil-test P (229 vs. 179 g m(-3)), Cu (4.3 vs. 1.6 g m(-3)), and Zn (10.0 vs. 4.0 g m(-3)). Intermittent tillage in the rotation sequence was the largest impediment to sustained SOC, total soil N accumulation, and soil microbial properties. This assessment illustrated positive soil health condition from farmer adoption of conservation tillage, but further improvements will be possible only with more continuous practice of conservation approaches.

AB  - Recovery of physical conditions and processes is increasingly emphasized in ecosystem restoration. We examined a restoration project aimed at recovery of groundwater levels and base flows on an undammed desert river. we sampled streamside plant communities and hydrology annually (2003-2008) at six restoration sites at two farms (Three Links Farm and H&E Farm) after groundwater pumping was curtailed for restoration purposes, and at six reference sites. Vascular plant cover was recorded, and species were classified into functional groups based on water needs and life history. Synthetic vegetation metries and community composition were compared between restoration sites and perennial-flow reference sites representing, target conditions. Perennial sites had hi-her cover, species richness, relative cover of hydric perennials and hydric annuals, and lower wetland indicator scores than non-perennial sites, but did not differ in relative cover of non-native species. perennial sites had distinct species composition and high species constancy among years. Streamside vegetation was similar at Three Links Farm and perennial reference sites, indicating restoration success: streamside vegetation at ME Farm differed from target conditions according to most measures. Hydrology is a key factor shaping desert streamside plant communities. However, single river sites may respond differently to hydrologic restoration. Contrasts in site response were likely due to differences ill hydrogeomorphic context, exacerbated by drought. Understanding the constraints oil restoration response is critical for setting realistic restoration goals and anticipating time frames of ecosystem change. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons. Lid.

AB  - An effective risk assessment and response to flood disasters will help ensure the sustainable development of a region. A perfect flood disaster assessment index system should consider the interactions between indexes. The Choquet integral method can effectively solve the problems of index interactions and information overlap and can be used to aggregate relevant decision criteria and express the preferences of decision makers, making it a useful supplement to traditional indicator integration methods. A flood disaster risk assessment model based on the Choquet integral was constructed by considering the meteorological factors, geographical conditions, economic development, population status, medical conditions, education level, and crop sowing in the Yangtze River Delta region (including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui) from 2006 to 2017. The model quantified the interaction between the evaluation indexes, taking the minimum information redundancy as the goal; subsequently, a flood disaster risk assessment was performed. The results showed that the meteorological conditions, geographical factors, exposure, and vulnerability have negative interactions with emergency and recovery capabilities. Because of the influence of the first three criteria, the information contained in the criteria for emergency and recovery capabilities is weakened or underestimated. Anhui Province was the largest flood disaster risk area in the Yangtze River Delta region from 2006 to 2017. Zhejiang Province ranked second, and Jiangsu Province and Shanghai City ranked third and fourth, respectively. The assessment results can provide a useful reference for flood disaster risk management in the Yangtze River Delta region.

AB  - Holocene vegetation changes are good indicators of climate change/and or human impacts. The environmental history in the semi-arid region with Caatinga vegetation in Northeast Brazil has been still little studied. A 420 cm-long sediment core collected in a mire at the Catimbau National Park, State of Pernambuco, has been analyzed for pollen, spores, charcoal, and sedimentological characteristics. The core is dated by three AMS radiocarbon dates and is at the bottom of the core about 2800 cal yr BP old. Results indicate three different periods of sedimentological and environmental characteristics. The first period from 2800 to 2150 cal yr BP is characterized by the dominance of the pioneer tree Cecropia, and high charcoal amounts, indicative of strong environmental disturbances due to frequent fires. The vegetation compositions with less frequent ferns suggest the predominance of relatively dry conditions. In the following period between 2150 and 450 cal yr BP, the Moraceaedominated forest with ferns suggesting wetter conditions. The increased occurrence of the Orbignya palm, as well as the bean Phaseolus, combined with abundant charcoal, suggest even stronger influence of Amerindians in the area. During the last period, after 450 cal yr BP, arboreal species were replaced by herbaceous taxa, indicating more open vegetation. The fire regime has been reduced. This evidence points to the return of drier conditions and the complete decline of the Amerindian population in the area, after the arrival of European colonizers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bridge infrastructures are always subjected to degradation because of aging, their environment, and excess loading. Now it has become a worldwide concern that a large proportion of bridge infrastructures require significant maintenance. This compels the engineering community to develop a robust method for condition assessment of the bridge structures. Here, the simultaneous identification of moving loads and structural damage based on the explicit form of the Newmark-beta method is proposed. Although there is an extensive attempt to identify moving loads with known structural parameters, or vice versa, their simultaneous identification considering the road roughness has not been studied enough. Furthermore, most of the existing time domain methods are developed for structures under non-moving loads and are commonly formulated by state-space method, thus suffering from the errors of discretization and sampling ratio. This research is believed to be among the few studies on condition assessment of bridge structures under moving vehicles considering factors such as sensor placement, sampling frequency, damage type, measurement noise, vehicle speed, and road surface roughness with numerical and experimental verifications. Results indicate that the method is able to detect damage with at least three sensors, and is not sensitive to sensors location, vehicle speed and road roughness level. Current limitations of the study as well as prospective research developments are discussed in the conclusion.

AB  - Trust, as a key element of security, has a vital role in securing vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Malicious and selfish nodes by generating inaccurate information, have undesirable impacts on the trustworthiness of the VANET environment. Obstacles also have a negative impact on data trustworthiness by restricting direct communication between nodes. In this study, a trust model based on plausibility, experience, and type of vehicle is presented to cope with inaccurate, incomplete and uncertainty data under both line of sight (LoS) and none-line of sight (NLoS) conditions. In addition, a model using the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification algorithm based on feature similarity and symmetry is developed to detect the NLoS condition. Radio signal strength indicator (RSSI), packet reception rate (PDR) and the distance between two vehicle nodes are the features used in the proposed kNN algorithm. Moreover, due to the big data generated in VANET, secure communication between vehicle and edge node is designed using the Cuckoo filter. All obtained results are validated through well-known evaluation measures such as precision, recall, overall accuracy, and communication overhead. The results indicate that the proposed trust model has a better performance as compared to the attack-resistant trust management (ART) scheme and weighted voting (WV) approach. Additionally, the proposed trust model outperforms both ART and WV approaches under different patterns of attack such as a simple attack, opinion tampering attack, and cunning attack. Monte-Carlo simulation results also prove validity of the proposed trust model.

AB  - Aim of the study
   The physiological impact of drought on the crop is reflected in the dendrological changes of the tree or plant body. In this study, we installed automatic dendrometers and we investigated the effect of irrigation dose at different intervals on the growth of sunflower and maize in laboratory conditions.
   Material and methods
   For our research, we have chosen sunflower (Helianthus annus L.) and maize (Zea Mays L.) sown in a laboratory equipped with Mars Hydro 400 LED lights as a substitute source of natural sunlight for 12 hours. Both crops were divided into containers A (irrigation dose of 5 mm was applied each day) and B (the same irrigation dose was applied at a 3-day interval). In every container, we have measured volumetric soil water content with 10HS sensors (by Decagon Devices) and dendrometric measurements of plants diameter with DD-S sensors (by Ecomatik).
   Results and conclusion
   A comparison of sunflower and maize irrigated at different intervals showed an increase in the diameters of stems at 1-day irrigation compared to 3-day by 0.8 mm (sunflower) and 12.0 mm (maize). The growth of plant mass was continuous at 1-day irrigation with minor fluctuations during the alternation of the dark and light phases. During the 3-day irrigation, greater shrinkage of the stems occurred, indicating the onset of water stress for the crops. The results of the work can be the basis for determining the appropriate application of irrigation bag in conditions of changing climate.

AB  - There is substantial evidence on the advantages of using crumb rubber in enhancing conventional bitumen properties, gaining environmental protection and boosting industrial-economical benefits. Thus, the use of this ingenious additive in bitumen modification through sustainable technology is highly advocated. The main objective of this research is to investigate the effects of different blending conditions (of time and temperature) and various crumb rubber contents on the properties of bitumen binders. Testing was conducted using the Dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) test and softening point test. The results showed that differing crumb rubber contents and blending temperature have significant effects on modified binder properties whereas the blending time showed an insignificant effect. Higher blending temperature and crumb rubber content were found to influence the interaction of bitumen-rubber blends and also increased the swelling rate of rubber particles, resulting in an increase in complex shear modulus (G*), storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G '') and softening point as well as a decrease in phase angle (delta). Thus, the modified bitumen became less susceptible to deformation after stress removals. The study also presented a considerable relationship between rheological parameters (G*, G', G' and delta) and softening point in terms of predicting physical-mechanical properties regardless of blending conditions. Thus, in terms of elasticity for the softening point data, the storage modulus and phase angle were found to be good indicators of binder elasticity. When softening point is made available, a prediction about binder ability to recover its original shape after stress removals can be done.

AB  - Indicators of environmental adequacy relevant to the well-being of small felids are developed by examining, in 4 captive leopard cats, interrelationships between behavioral and adrenocortical responses to changes in housing conditions. Singly housed cats were moved from their barren home cage (Cage 1, baseline) sequentially to 2 new, barren housing situations (Cages 2 and 3; almost-equal-to 10 weeks/cage). Urinary cortisol concentrations, stereotypic pacing, and hiding frequencies were transiently increased for 1 week after translocation to Cage 2. After translocation to Cage 3, cortisol concentrations and hiding also were increased for the first week. However, conditions in Cage 3 were determined to be aversive to the cats, as evidenced by cortisol concentrations that remained chronically elevated for the entire 10-week period. Exploratory behavior was suppressed during this period. When Cage 3 was enriched with a complex of branches and hiding places, urinary cortisol concentrations and stereotypic pacing decreased, and exploration increased. Concealment locations that camouflage were more often used for lying down when urinary cortisol was elevated. These results suggest that reduced exploratory behavior is an indicator of chronic exposure to aversive environmental conditions. Stereotypic pacing may not necessarily increase when adrenocortical activity increases. The results also suggest that enrichment facilitates coping with aversive stimulation by providing behavioral options to confined felids. To promote the welfare of small felids, appropriate camouflaged hiding places should be provided and enrichment programs developed to stimulate exploratory behavior. (C) 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Compared to the well-studied the grain-size depositional process in hydraulic and aeolian sediments, the process in wetlands is still poorly understood. In this study, the grain-size components of a well-dated mud/peat profile (SJ2) in the Sanjiang Plain were partitioned using a lognormal distribution function. The results suggest that the lacustrine deposits contain four distinct unimodal grain-size distributions, C-1 through C-4, with their modal sizes ranging 0.7-1.6, 2.4-8.7, 15.7-27.8, and 380.2-529.6 mu m respectively. Only the C-1 and C-3 were identified in the peat layers. A grain-size depositional modal was introduced to explain the environmental meanings of the four components. C-3, as a nearshore suspension component, was the most sensitive component to the variation of local hydraulic conditions. Based on the variation of C-3 percentages of the profile SJ2, the local hydraulic conditions were tentatively reconstructed, and the results showed a close relation with the monsoon variations during the Holocene. Accordingly, we suggest the relative coarse component of the polymodal peat deposits in monsoonal regions can be used as a sensitive indicator for the hydraulic conditions and the monsoon circulations in the geological past.

AB  - A total of 74 crude oils and condensates originating from various deposits were collected in Tarim, Junggar, Beibuwan and Bohai Bay basins and analyzed by comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS) in order to investigate the occurrence and distributions of C-9 and C-10 hydrocarbons. 3-Ethyl-2-methylheptane and 1,1,2,3-tetramethylcyclohexane, two C10 compounds possibly derived from monoterpenoids via cracking and reduction, may be formed under anoxic conditions during diagenesis. We suggest that the ratio of 3-ethyl-2-methylheptane to 3-methylnonane (MT1) coupled with the ratio of 1,1,2,3-tetramethylcyclohexane to propylcyclohexane (MT2), are useful parameters to infer depositional environments and to distinguish oil families. The oils and condensates formed from source rocks deposited under anoxic conditions show high 3-ethyl-2methylheptane and 1,1,2,3-tetramethylcyclohexane levels (both MT1 and MT2 > 0.5). Whereas, the hydrocarbons derived from source rocks deposited in oxic conditions contain low amounts of 3-ethyl-2-methylheptane and 1,1,2,3-tetramethylcyclohexane (both MT1 and MT2 < 0.5). These monoterpane parameters may be useful in petroleum exploration, especially for light oils and condensates where most high molecular weight biomarkers could be cracked or eliminated through fractionation.

AB  - In this study, Tianjin's 36 practical residential areas were classified into four main categories and nine subcategories of layout modes based on actual planning methods. The wind conditions of each layout mode were evaluated with ENVI-met software and compared using three wind environment factors: wind speed, calm wind area ratio and wind speed dispersion. Further, correlations between spatial morphological factors and wind environment factors were established. Results indicate that the classification method of layout modes used in this study can fully reflect spatial differences between real residential areas. From comparison of the three wind environment factors, the mid-rise enclosed mode was found to exhibit the worst wind environment due to its low wind speed while the mid-rise parallel and mid high-rise modes are recommended as the most suitable for Tianjin's climate. The wind environment of high-rise layout modes are not as favourable as the wind environments of the mid-rise and mid high-rise modes. Frontal area density and average building height are shown to be key spatial morphological factors which affect the pedestrian-level wind environment. They can be used in residential planning practices to improve the wind condition. This research presents an opportunity to assist urban planners and researchers in developing a comprehensive understanding of pedestrian-level wind conditions in different residential layout modes.

AB  - In order to substantiate the principles and to extend the cattle breeding systems to ensure the welfare of the herds and the profit of the breeders, numerous research programs have been carried out, which have scientifically demonstrated that the animals must be healthy and feel comfortable, to live in conditions. safe, well fed, able to express natural behaviour and not be threatened. The study carried out on a dairy farm in the southern part of the country looked at: the health status of the acropodium through the walk score (Gait Score), the condition of the animals (BCS - Body Condition Score), body hygiene (body hygiene index) and the determination in the laboratory of blood serum from 12 Holstein breed cows in different gestation periods of 13 biochemical parameters (BUN, PHOS, URIC, Ca, TP, ALB, GLOB, ALT, AST, GGT, TRIG, GLU and LDH). Milk samples were also collected from the study cows from which the physicochemical (fat, protein, NCS, urea, lactose, conductivity and dry matter) and microbiological (NTG) parameters were determined. Blood biochemical parameters were determined with WetTest 8008 - dry biochemistry analyzer, and milk quality parameters were determined with EKOMILK TOTAL and Bentley (for NCS), and for NTG the standardized method of serial dilutions with rate 10 was used. Correlating the results of the indicators for assessing the welfare of cows in the general needs grid with the results of laboratory tests on blood bio-chemical parameters and milk quality, it is found that the welfare of the cows studied is average.

AB  - Using a tame animal, the impact of otter (Lutra lutra) disturbance on over-wintering carp (Cyprinus carpio) was monitored in two experiments, 133 and 140 days, respectively, over two consecutive winters (November-April). The level of stress in over-wintering carp exposed to various intensities of disturbance by otters was quantified using biological indicators of stress (cortisol, cortisone, indices of nitrogen, carbohydrate, lipid and mineral metabolism and activity of basic blood plasma enzymes) taken from blood plasma of stocked carp at the end of the winter seasons (when the photoperiod was 12 light:12 dark, respectively, 13L:10D). Moreover, condition (Fulton's coefficient of condition and fat content in muscles) and mortality rate of that carp were measured after over-wintering and also after the subsequent vegetation period. The analysis of blood and tissue samples of experimental fish showed changes in nitrogen, carbohydrate and mineral metabolism as well as levels of hormones and fat reserves. Higher response to stress in metabolism of carp with lower intensity of disturbance by otter suggests that high level of disturbance can lead to metabolic adaptation of carp to stress. The effect of stress on the mortality rate of carp during the over-wintering is not clear. Nevertheless, the negative effect of stress on survival, condition and growth rate of carp in the subsequent vegetation period was not observed.

AB  - Past research on AGS (aerobic granular sludge technology) has mainly focused on macro-environment factors, such as settling time, feeding pattern, OLR (organic loading rate), SRT (sludge retention time), among others, and their effects on the granulation process. The biomass granulation process, however, is significantly affected by the micro-environment surrounding these biomass aggregates. In this research, an in silico computational approach was adopted to study the impact of the micro-environment on the biomass granulation process. A 2-D biofilm model based on the cellular automata algorithm and computational fluid dynamics was used to simulate the development of an individual biomass aggregate under specific hydrodynamic and substrate availability conditions. The simulation results indicated that shear and bulk substrate concentration combined to create the optimal conditions for aerobic granule formation. This process can be characterized by the RT (reversed Thiele) modulus value, which is the ratio of the maximum substrate transport over the maximum substrate reaction rate and an indicator of substrate availability. For AGS formation, the RT value should be greater than 0.1. Many common strategies, such as the application of batch reactors, selection for slow-growing microorganism, F/M (food/mass) ratio adjustment, feast and famine condition, and short settling time, for biomass granulation production can be explained by the RT value. The results suggest that rethinking unit process configurations in wastewater treatment facilities will be required to achieve reliable AGS formation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The low-level presence (LLP) of genetically engineered (GE) seeds that have been approved in the country of origin but not the country of import presents challenges for regulators in both seed importing and exporting countries, as well as for the international seed trade and the farmers who rely on it. In addition to legal, financial and regulatory challenges, such LLP situations in seed may also require an environmental risk assessment by the country of import. Such assessments have typically been informed by the national framework established to support decisions related to wide scale cultivation, and frequently do not take into account the low environmental exposure and prior regulatory history of the GE plant. In addition, such assessment processes may not be well suited to the decision-making timeframe that is necessary when dealing with an LLP situation in imported seed. In order to facilitate regulatory decision making, this paper proposes a set of scientific criteria for identifying GE crop plants that are expected to pose a low or negligible risk to the environment under LLP conditions in seed. Regulatory decision makers in some importing countries may decide to use these criteria to assist in risk analysis associated with LLP situations they are experiencing or could experience in the future, and might choose to proactively apply the criteria to identify existing GE plants with regulatory approvals in other countries that would be expected to pose low risk under conditions of LLP in seed.

AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the metabolism of plasma serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), an important neurotransmitter, in Fresian dairy cows, a breed of zootechnical interest, using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The subjects under study were at the stage of early lactation (n=10; mean body weight 375 +/- 50 kg; average age of 3 years; body condition score 2.5), bred in a farm at an altitude of 150 m a.s.l. To evaluate animal welfare on this farm, which is closely connected to an animal's physiological status, tryptophan and cortisol levels (measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), together with levels of certain blood components [total proteins (TP), albumin, creatinine, glucose (Glu), triglycerides, phospholipids, total cholesterol, and aspartate transaminase, measured by spectrophotometry] were analyzed. The results obtained are discussed in comparison with reference values, taking into account the environmental living conditions. Measured plasma serotonin concentrations, which were lower than values reported for Brown Swiss dairy cows of a comparable age and diet, appeared to be affected by breed, temperature, blood sampling season, and altitude. Additional differences between the levels of plasma tryptophan, the amino acid precursor of serotonin, of the two breeds were comparable. Negative correlations between plasma tryptophan and plasma cortisol levels (r=-0.83, P<0.005), plasma serotonin and plasma TP levels (r=-0.72, P<0.05), or Glu levels (r=-0.77, P<0.05) highlight the existence of a stress condition, which is connected to an energetic deficit related to lactation.

AB  - The use of Raphanus sativus L. as a model crop for studies on plant response to environmental stresses is reviewed with emphasis on the effects of different atmospheric pollutants (O3, SO2, NO2, acidic precipitation) and their combinations. Responses to temperature, light supply, water stress, and atmospheric CO2 are also studied and discussed. In addition, the references reviewed are evaluated in terms of their experimental protocols on growth conditions and recommendations for optimal ranges of environmental and cultural variables, i.e. light, temperature, nutrient supply are given. Its distinct pattern of biomass partitioning, the small dimensions along with short and easy culture make radish an excellent experimental plant. The fleshy below-ground storage organ, formed by the hypocotyl and upper radicle, acts as the major sink during vegetative development. Abundant assimilate supply due to elevated levels of CO2 along with high irradiation frequently promote hypocotyl growth more than shoot growth, whereas under conditions of stress shoot growth is maintained at the expense of the hypocotyl. This makes the hypocotyl:shoot ratio of radish a very sensitive and suitable indicator for various environmental stresses. Potential weaknesses and short-comings of radish in its role as a model crop, particularly the high variability of injury and growth responses, are discussed along with possible solutions. Future research needs are derived from the summarized results presented and from some disparities among findings within the literature reviewed.

AB  - Diatoms are universally recognized as good bio-indicators due to their high diversity and rapid response to environmental and climate changes. This paper explores whether the sedimentary diatom record from Sanjiaolongwan Maar Lake (SJML), northeastern China, reveals variations in seasonal pattern over the past 1000 years. The observed succession in diatom assemblages reveals that between 980 and 1310 CE the small-celled planktonic diatom Discostella pseudostelligera was abundant. Its relative abundance peaked during 1020-1060 CE, indicating that the duration of summer conditions over this interval was the longest within the last millennium. By contrast, the interval between 1470 and 1850 CE was marked by an increase in benthic diatoms pointing to a shortened duration of the ice-free season, and generally cold conditions. During the twentieth century warm period, the succession of eutrophic diatoms and changes in diatom cell size also reveal temperature-controlled seasonal variations in limnological conditions. The differences observed between the diatoms assemblages associated with the two warm periods indicate that the summers of the warmest part of the Medieval Climate Anomaly were longer than that of the current warm period. This result is supported by the diatom record from Erlongwan, another maar lake in the region that differs from SJML by its topographic features and in the level of human impact on its catchment.

AB  - Climatic conditions are an important factor affecting mineralogical and chemical compositions of soils and paleosols with the formation of paleosol archives that reflect major stages of the evolution of biogeosphere systems in the Quaternary period. In the steppe zone of the south of the East European Plain, two types of the time capsules storing information on paleoecosystems and paleoclimate of the Quaternary period are found. First, these are loess/paleosol complexes in coastal zone of the Sea of Azov and in the North Caucasus; their environmental records extend back into the Pleistocene for about 800 ka. Second, these are Holocene paleosols of archeological sites; they are buried under kurgans constructed in different periods of the Middle and Late Holocene. The completeness and reliability of paleoenvironmental reconstructions depend on the chosen study objects. For quantitative reconstruction of the environmental parameters in the past, independent methods based on the assessment and interpretation of soil solid-phase propertiesmagnetic. mineralogical, geochemical, isotopic, etc.are to be applied. Detailed mineralogical study of paleosols coupled with the analysis of their organomineral complexes and variations in the concentrations of biophile and lithophile elements significantly increase the reliability of soil indicators of the paleoclimatic conditions. The sets of soil indicators obtained from the study of Holocene paleosols and loess/paleosol sequences in the Sea of Azov region allow us to estimate parameters of the paleoenvironment: paleotemperature, paleoprecipitation, and aridity of the climate.

AB  - Bacteria use different adaptation strategies to survive environmental perturbations. In this minireview, adaptation strategies of new red-pigmented Vibrio ruber isolated from coastal environments to different environmental stresses (i.e. salinity, viscosity, UV light, mitomycin C, nutrient availability and temperature) are reviewed. To cope with environmental stresses Vibrio ruber uses several different adaptive strategies. For example, lipid composition as well as phase behaviour are strongly dependent on salt concentration. Vibrio ruber membrane has no hydroxy fatty acids, but exceptionally high lysolipid content compared to other related Vibrio species. Inorganic nutrient uptake by bacteria is selective, depends on environmental conditions and varies several fold with environmental perturbations. Protein composition, carbon flow through the central metabolic pathways, energy generation as well as secondary metabolite production adapt readily to stress conditions. The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase proved to be a good indicator of Vibrio ruber stress. Cells are able to modulate their local viscosity in response to variations of environmental viscosity. The bacterium harbours several viral genetic elements in its genome, which could be induced by mitomycin C. Environmental conditions during growth of bacteria have a significant effect on lysate carbon turnover. Secondary metabolite prodigiosin confers protection against UV in the environment, which adds to the known repertoire of prodigiosin ecophysiological functions. In conclusion, Vibrio ruber in its short acquaintance with the scientific community (less than ten years) has proven to be an immensely valuable model system for ecophysiological studies of bacteria.

AB  - The main goal in the present study is to study the adaptability and productivity of common wheat varieties. The study was conducted in 2017-2019, in the Department of Plant Breeding at the Faculty of Agriculture at the Trakia University, Stara Zagora. The object of study are the productivity and structural elements of yield in several varieties of common wheat -]ngenio, Dalara, Moison, Falado, Gabrio, Pibrak (from the variety list of Syngenta) and Factor (Bulgarian selection). According to the two-factor analysis of variance, both the influence of the two factors (conditions of the year and variety) separately and their interaction, statistically proven with a very high degree of reliability (p <= 0.001) is the impact on the indicator -yield. The strongest influence on the variation of the trait is exerted by the factor year (37%), followed by the interaction between them (35%) and the factor variety (28%). ]n terms of the yield of wet gluten with the highest content, Dalara (30.8) stands out, on average for the period. Climate conditions have a great influence on DMG and it is expressed in the fluctuations of its values in ]ngenio (from 22.9 to 32.4), in Gabrio (from 31.6 to 21.6) and in Factor (25.6-29.0). Despite the changing environmental conditions, a small range of DMG variation was reported in Dalara (30.5-31.0), in Moyson (27.1-28.0), in Falado (30.1-30.0), Pibrak (28.2-29.3).

TI  - Use of bacteria community analysis to distinguish groundwater recharge sources to shallow wells
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
LA  - English
AB  - In this study, bacteria community analysis was performed to supplement a preexisting evaluation of nitrate contamination in drinking water wells at a coastal site in Old Lyme, CT. Given well usage and coastal hydrogeologic conditions, the source(s) of nitrate contamination in domestic wells could not be discerned between local septic systems or a nearby farm where organic fertilizers were used. Groundwater bacteria communities are known to be sensitive to a variety of environmental conditions. As such, they are potentially useful in distinguishing groundwater recharge sources. Groundwater samples collected from wells were analyzed using polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and 16S rRNA sequencing to determine the bacteria distributions in each well. The biostatistical analysis of the data using Bray-Curtis nonmetric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance revealed three distinct bacteria community distributions that coincided with three different areas on the site. Additionally, principal component analysis (PCA) of the water quality data revealed that wells with similar bacteria shared similar water quality, all of which was indicative of local recharge. These findings suggested that the domestic well nitrate contamination was derived from local septic systems rather than the farm. Septic indicator analysis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry determined the presence of caffeine in domestic wells, which was consistent with the conclusions from the bacteria analysis, PCA, and the known hydrogeologic conditions. The low cost, ease of sample collection, and growing availability of bioinformatics laboratory services and software are conducive to the application of microbial community analysis as a supplemental tool for groundwater investigations.

AB  - Peatlands are recognized as important landscape elements and their disturbance, followed by the loss of their ecohydrological functions, leads to falling water tables and degradation. Sometimes, the shortage of hydrological monitoring data impedes the detection of degrading peatland areas. The application of cost-effective remote sensing methods for assessment of humidity conditions permits monitoring of a large area and longer periods of time. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the links between hydrological parameters and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as well as identifying spatio-temporal patterns in the condition of raised bog vegetation, according to NDVI, in the epkeliai raised bog, a semipristine peatland in south-eastern Lithuania. Time series of NDVI (2000-2018) were obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and compared with field measurements. A strong positive correlation between NDVI and water table depth was found. Moderate (for the whole raised bog) and strong (for control subbasin) positive correlations between NDVIavg and annual minimum flow over 30 and 7 days were found. This confirms that NDVI could be treated as an appropriate indicator, showing the degradation processes of the raised bog ecosystem and could be applied in its management. Analysis of the interannual NDVIavg variation confirmed the prevalence of stable favourable conditions during the growing season with a slight decrease in NDVImax over last 4 years. Meanwhile, analysis of spatial NDVI variation revealed obvious spatial patterns where possible degradation processes tend to appear.

AB  - Thermal unit indices have a strong correlation with the phenology, growth and yield of crops and can be effectively used to select suitable crop cultivars for specific environmental conditions especially temperature. In this study, four mustard varieties (viz., 'BARI Sharisha-14', 'BARI Sharisha-15', 'BARI Sharisha-16' and 'Tori-7') were grown in two consecutive growing to assess the impact of thermal unit indices on crop growth and development, and to select the suitable variety for better yield under optimum sowing condition. Thermal unit indices viz., growing degree-day (GDD), helio-thermal units (HTU), phenothermal index (PTI) and heat use efficiency (HUE) were estimated from daily temperature and sunshine hours. Role of GDD on different growth indicators and seed yield (SY) were estimated through association and dependence of the traits. Significant variations in studied genotypes were observed for different traits. Among the studied varieties, 'BARI Sharisha-16' produced higher dry matter and seed yields (1.82 t ha(-1)) while accumulated maximum GDD at different growth stages. A strong positive association was obtained between GDD and the studied traits. Thermal unit indices had a strong influence in attaining different phenophases and other growth indicators. Therefore, results suggest that those indices could be used for growth prediction; further 'BARI Sharisha-16' is expected to use heat energy more efficiently for increasing the seed yields which indicated that the crop can perform better under global warming scenarios.

AB  - Research background: Stable and reliable access to a variety of energy carriers is undoubtedly a basis for the development of any economy. Therefore, the primary condition for the security of the state and its citizens is to ensure the essential minimum of energy on its territory. We can observe, however, an increasing dependence of the Polish energy sector on external sources.
   Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to examine and evaluate the economic aspects of the Polish energy security considering the fact of growing de- pendency on foreign supplies of energy carriers.
   Methods: In this paper we analyze the Polish energy security using several indicators: fuel/price efficiency ratio, energy intensity of the economy and Herfindahl- Hirschman rate of market concentration. For calculations we use statistical data provided by Energy Market Agency publications, including "Energy Situation in Poland" covering the years of 2000-2015.
   Findings & Value added: On the one hand, the Polish energy security depends on its internal conditions and resources - in this context, the available resources of coal and lignite play an extremely positive role because they provide access to a reliable source of energy. On the other hand, Poland is becoming dependent on external commitments that restrict the free use of domestic resources, thus lowering the energy security of the country, speaking in particular of oil and natural gas resources. The analysis carried out in this paper will allow to evaluate the effectiveness of using various energy carriers with respect to their price, market structure and geopolitical conditions.

AB  - A combined investigation of molecular geochemistry, elements and carbon isotopic composition of carbonate distribution was carried out on the Early Cretaceous mudstones of the Tengger Formation in the Erlian Basin, northern China, to define source rock geochemical characteristics, depositional environment and tectonic setting of small faulted basin. The biomarkers of mudstone extracts are characterized by short to middle chain n-alkanes, high CPI values (>1.12), a wide range of Pr/Ph (0.4-1.94), relatively high concentrations of C-29 sterane and the presence of relatively low tricyclic terpanes and low gammacerane index values (0.01-0.25), which is consistent with a relatively oxic to anoxic depositional environment of fresh to brackish water conditions, with a major contribution of terrigenous organic matter input and a low contribution of aquatic algal-bacterial organic matter. The oxic to anoxic depositional environment of small fault basins and a fresh and brackish water conditions are also confirmed by reduced sulphur/organic carbon ratio and element distribution. In these small fault basins, the cross-plots of delta C-13(carb) and TOC show that productivity has an obvious control on source rock development. The differences in tectonic settings cause variations in productivity, redox conditions and terrigenous organic matter input, which account for the distinctly different geochemical characteristics and depositional environment of source rocks in small fault basins.

AB  - Aims: To determine suitable target genes for detection of the pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
   Methods and Results: Potential genes used as indicators for viability included rfbE,fliC, stx1, stx2, mobA, eaeA, hly and 16S rRNA. Under normal growth conditions, rfbE, stx1, hly and 16S rRNA amplicons were detected in association with all growth phases. The products of 16S rRNA, mobA, rfbE and stx1 were readily visualized in RNA isolated from viable but non-culturable cells. The 16S rRNA gene was not amplified following heat treatment of cells at 121degreesC for 15 min and mRNA targets were not amplified after treatment at 60degreesC for 20 min. In this instance, genes that are not amplified are good targets for determining viability.
   Conclusions: The results of RT-PCR amplification indicate that, under the conditions examined, the rfbE gene is the most appropriate target for detection of viable E. coli O157:H7.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Prior to detection or identification from an environmental or food sample E. coli O157:H7 may be exposed to many harsh conditions that influence nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) stability. This study gives an insight into the effects of temperature and nutrient deprivation on identification of viable cells using RT-PCR. It also suggests that, if RT-PCR is to be used for detection of live cells in a sample without enrichment, 10(7) cfu of the target organism are required.

AB  - The housing conditions and environments experienced during the rearing period can influence the development of feather pecking in chickens during this time and in the subsequent laying period. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a reduced stocking density and the provision of enrichment materials on the occurrence of feather pecking in hen chicks under commercial rearing conditions. Three groups, identical in age, laying strain, and management but kept with different stocking densities and varying availability of enrichment (pecking stone, pecking block, and lucerne bale), were observed. Group 1 had a high stocking density (22.9 animals per m(2)) and no access to enrichment, group 2 had a lower stocking density (18.1 animals per m(2)) plus enrichment, and group 3 had a high stocking density (22.9 animals per m(2)) plus the same enrichment as group 2. Behavioral observations from video recordings were made on the occurrence of enrichment pecking, gentle feather pecking (GFP), severe feather pecking (SFP), and aggressive pecking. Furthermore, the influence of enrichment pecking on the occurrence of GFP, SFP, and aggressive pecking and the effect of SFP on the plumage condition were examined. The comparison of the 2 groups with enrichment demonstrated that the group with the higher stocking density showed a higher rate of SFP (95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference: [0.001-0.015]). The comparison of the 2 groups with and without enrichment but with equal stocking densities showed that the group with access to enrichment had significantly lower rates of GFP (95% CI: -0.019 to -0.006), SFP (95% CI: -0.036 to -0.020), and aggressive pecking (95% CI: -0.004 to -0.001). The group with a combination of a lower stocking density and enrichment had significantly lower rates of GFP (95% CI: -0.022 to -0.009), SFP (95% CI: -0.044 to -0.028), and aggressive pecking (95% CI: -0.004 to -0.001) compared to the group with a high stocking density without enrichment. Additionally, the occurrence of enrichment pecking had a significantly reducing effect on the occurrence of GFP (95% CI: -0.046 to -0.031), SFP (95% CI: -0.030 to -0.016), and aggressive pecking (95% CI: -0.003 to -0.0003). Finally, a high rate of SFP had a deteriorating effect on the plumage condition (95% CI: -0.859 to -0.084). Thus, we conclude that a lower stocking density and the provision of enrichment, such as pecking stones, pecking blocks, and lucerne bales, can reduce the prevalence of feather pecking and aggressive pecking in laying hen chicks. The evaluation of the plumage condition can be a valid indicator of feather pecking. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stable carbon isotopes of sediment organic matter (delta C-13(OM)) are widely applied in paleoenvironmental studies. Interpretations of delta C-13(OM), however, remain challenging and factors that influence delta C-13(OM) may not apply across all lakes. Common explanations for stratigraphic shifts in delta C-13(OM) include changes in lake productivity or changes in inputs of allochthonous OM. We investigated the influence of different oxygen conditions (oxic versus anoxic) on the delta C-13(OM) values in the sediments of Lake Tiefer See. We analysed (1) a long sediment core from the deepest part of the lake, (2) two short, sediment-water interface cores from shallower water depths, and (3) OM in the water column, i.e. from sediment traps. Fresh OM throughout the entire water column showed a relatively constant delta C-13(OM) value of approximately -30.5 parts per thousand. Similar values, about -31 parts per thousand, were obtained for well-varved sediments in both the long and short, sediment-water interface cores. In contrast, delta C-13(OM) values from non-varved sediments in all cores were significantly less negative (-29 parts per thousand). The delta C-13(OM) values in the sediment-water interface cores from different water depths differ for sediments of the same age, if oxygen conditions at the time of deposition were different at these sites, as suggested by the state of varve preservation. Sediments deposited from AD 1924 to 1980 at 62m water depth are varved and exhibit delta C-13(OM) values around -31 parts per thousand, whereas sediments of the same age in the core from 35m water depth are not varved and show less negative delta C-13(OM) values of about -29 parts per thousand. The relation between varve occurrence and delta C-13(OM) values suggests that delta C-13(OM) is associated with oxygen conditions because varve preservation depends on hypolimnetic anoxia. A mechanism that likely influences delta C-13(OM) is selective degradation of OM under oxic conditions, such that organic components with more negative delta C-13(OM) are preferably decomposed, leading to less negative delta C-13(OM) values in the remaining, undegraded OM pool. Greater decomposition of OM in non-varved sediments is supported by lower TOC concentrations in these deposits (similar to 5%) compared to well-varved sediments (similar to 15%). Even in lakes that display small variations in productivity and terrestrial OM input through time, large spatial and temporal differences in hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations may be an important factor controlling sediment delta C-13(OM).

AB  - Projecting changes in snow cover due to climate warming is important for many societal issues, including the adaptation of avalanche risk mitigation strategies. Efficient modelling of future snow cover requires high resolution to properly resolve the topography. Here, we introduce results obtained through statistical downscaling techniques allowing simulations of future snowpack conditions including mechanical stability estimates for the mid and late 21st century in the French Alps under three climate change scenarios. Refined statistical descriptions of snowpack characteristics are provided in comparison to a 1960-1990 reference period, including latitudinal, altitudinal and seasonal gradients. These results are then used to feed a statistical model relating avalanche activity to snow and meteorological conditions, so as to produce the first projection on annual/seasonal timescales of future natural avalanche activity based on past observations. The resulting statistical indicators are fundamental for the mountain economy in terms of anticipation of changes.
   Whereas precipitation is expected to remain quite stationary, temperature increase interacting with topography will constrain the evolution of snow-related variables on all considered spatio-temporal scales and will, in particular, lead to a reduction of the dry snowpack and an increase of the wet snowpack. Overall, compared to the reference period, changes are strong for the end of the 21st century, but already significant for the mid century. Changes in winter are less important than in spring, but wet-snow conditions are projected to appear at high elevations earlier in the season. At the same altitude, the southern French Alps will not be significantly more affected than the northern French Alps, which means that the snowpack will be preserved for longer in the southern massifs which are higher on average.
   Regarding avalanche activity, a general decrease in mean ( 20-30 %) and interannual variability is projected. These changes are relatively strong compared to changes in snow and meteorological variables. The decrease is amplified in spring and at low altitude. In contrast, an increase in avalanche activity is expected in winter at high altitude because of conditions favourable to wet-snow avalanches earlier in the season. Comparison with the outputs of the deterministic avalanche hazard model MEPRA ( Modele Expert d'aide a la Prevision du Risque d'Avalanche) shows generally consistent results but suggests that, even if the frequency of winters with high avalanche activity is clearly projected to decrease, the decreasing trend may be less strong and smooth than suggested by the statistical analysis based on changes in snowpack characteristics and their links to avalanches observations in the past. This important point for risk assessment pleads for further work focusing on shorter timescales. Finally, the small differences between different climate change scenarios show the robustness of the predicted avalanche activity changes.

AB  - Peat deposits, which outcrop in the southern Agadia region in Trabzon, Northern Turkey, were studied by using chemical, organic geochemical, petrographic and palynological characteristics of peats. Palynological data indicate that the peats were deposited in terrestrial or lacustrine environments, comprising organic matter with an average composition of 70% woody, 19.3% herbaceous and 10.7% amorphous material. The peats are Holocene-recent in age. The peat organic matter that has been interpreted as immature based on the SCI (spore color index) analyses suggests that the peat organic matter was immature.
   Rock Eval analyses show that the average total organic carbon (TOC) content of the peat is 42%, and the average HI value is 315 mgHC/gTOC, which is very high for peat. The high 01 values (avg. 134 mgCO(2)/gTOC) point that the depositional environment of peats were deposits under oxic or suboxic conditions.
   The selected sample (ABY-13) with the highest extractable yield has TAR (Terrigenous/Aquatic Ratio) and CPI (Carbon Preference Index) index values of 2.4 and 3.4, respectively. These values reflect high levels of n-alkanes, supporting a terrestrial organic matter input. The P-aq (aquatic plant n-alkane proxy) ratio (0.6) indicates that there was a contribution from mixtures of submerged/floating, emergent and terrestrial plant mixtures. The P-wax (vascular plant n-alkane proxy) ratio (0.6) is a sign of moist and wetter conditions. The TOC, ACL, Q(wood/grass):C-27/C-31, Q(wood/plant) (C-27 + C-29)/(C-27 + C-29 + C-31) and Q(grass/plant):C-31/(C-27 + C-29 + C31) values indicate that woody plants were the dominant vegetation in the peat mire was woody plants, and the climate was relatively wet and cold.
   According to the m/z 191 and m/z 217 fragments tracking from GC-MS chromatogram data obtained using biomarker analyses, the lack of C-34 and C-35 homohopanes was interpreted as that organic matter was deposited under oxic or suboxic conditions. Moretane/hopane, Tm/Ts and Tm/C-30 pentacydic triterpane ratios also point indicate oxic and acidic conditions during the formation of the peat. The absence of 17 alpha(H)-28,30-bisnorhopane from the m/z 191 chromatograms support the interpretation that the Agacbasi Yayla peat was deposited in a terrestrial or lacustrine environment under oxic or suboxic conditions. The dominance of C-29 steranes indicates significant terrestrial organic matter input. Using sterane carbon number distributions the extract of the peat sample plots in the terrigenous region. Additionally, C-30 steranes, which imply marine environments, were not detected. The Ts/(Ts + Tm), ratios also suggest that the peat contained immature organic matter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Differing human activities which have lead to different nations' economic development (excellent scientific, technological consequences and innovation) and caused changes which have not seemed to be the most suited for preserving the resources necessary for sustaining the lives of human beings living in the present or for those of future generations. The wasteful use of different power resources is leading to their exhaustion and substances and waste are being generated leading to environmental contamination. On the other hand, inadequate sanitary conditions are also being produced which can cause difficulties in the field of public health. The Central University of Venezuela has thus proposed dealing with and satisfactorily resolving solid-waste management by exploiting the organic fraction of the waste produced by the university's dining room for making compost. This requires implementing the composting and ensuring that the quality of the materials produced is reproducible. A useful tool for achieving the latter lies in producing a statistical design for composting, leading to a mathematical equation determining factors (independent variables) influence on response (dependent variable) (i.e. the likely power which initially mixed waste may have on nitrogen quality). This methodology leads to obtaining an equation allowing a response surface to be generated. This information would make it possible to control the quality of the product obtained (compost) according to the conditions laid down. This study was aimed at applying the Box-Behnken experimental design in drawing up a response surface model allowing conditions in producing compost to be considered where nitrogen contribution is reproducible. This statistical tool uses four factors or independent variables at three levels; they were: added waste portions (D), amount of sawdust (C) and added humidity (A), as well as aeration period (B). Response measured as nutrient input indicator was nitrogen (N). This design was based on 29 different trials combining the factors being considered. The surface model led to obtaining a quadratic function, as shown in the following equation:
   Y - beta(0)+ Sigma(k)(i-1) beta (i) X (i) + Sigma(k)(i=1) beta (ii) X (2)(i) + Sigma(4)(i=1) Sigma(i) (k) beta X-i X-i + epsilon for all i
   where Y corresponded to analysed factors and epsilon was random error. The following equation was thus obtained: In(N-ammoniac) - Iny(2) - 2,17 - 0.069 A - 0.24 B - 0.48 C + 0.15 D. The maximum point for the amount of nitrogen on the response surface was located by using the estimated equation. The model so obtained was verified by making more compost according to the maximum conditions indicated by the response surface model, finding that the quantity of nitrogen was that expected according to the model. This led to setting the optimum conditions for preparing compost from university dining room waste,- its nitrogen contribution was reproducible.

AB  - Geochemical analyses (major and trace elements) and palaeontological studies were carried out based on rock samples and thin sections collected from three outcrop sections (Goulmima, Ziz and Tazzouguert) in the upper Cenomanian-lower Turonian in the carbonate platform of the Preafrican Trough (South Morocco), in order to determine if oxygen-depleted conditions affected the platform, and to highlight the possible impact of oxygen variation on carbonate production, particularly during the Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2), which took place in the late Cenomanian.
   During this interval, the carbonate platform was composed of two contrasting environments. A shallow-water environment (peritidal to mid-ramp) was developed in the East (Ziz and Tazzouguert sections), characterized by a high diversity and abundance of benthic organisms, and in some cases, by a high diversity of planktonic organisms, associated with low concentrations of authigenic markers (U, Mo, V and Cr: redox proxies), indicating oxic conditions. In the West (Goulmima section), the environment was deeper (mid ramp/outer ramp) and redox proxies record a high enrichment an indicator of reducing conditions, associated with a low diversity and abundance of organisms and the presence of Buliminidae. Bottom waters were dysoxic and the palaeoproductivity was low at the sea surface. Thus, during the late Cenomanian, oxygenation conditions were relatively good over the area of the Preafrican Trough, even during the OAE2, except in the deeper environments toward the West, where bottom waters were depleted in oxygen. During the Cenomanian transgression, and more precisely during the OAE2, this dysoxia was linked to the influx of poorly-oxygenated waters from the deeper anoxic basins of the Atlantic and/or Tethys oceans.
   Geochemical, palaeontological and sedimentological disturbances are recorded in the lower Turonian everywhere in the outer-ramp environments of the platform. Palaeontological proxies show a huge decrease in group diversity, with the disappearance of benthic foraminifera - except for the Buliminidae which proliferated - and only shallow-water planktonic foraminifera survived. Geochemical proxies of redox conditions and palaeoproductivity show a marked enrichment in all three outcrop sections, with higher values in the West. This dysoxia occurred in response to a climatic change, from warm with contrasting seasons to hot and wet, which induced an increase of chemical weathering in the Anti-Atlas to the southwest of the platform. This substantial input of nutrients increased the palaeoproductivity, which finally enhanced the consumption of O-2 owing to the decay of organic matter. Moreover, the late Cenomanian transgression led to the supply of additional nutrients to the platform, due to the leaching of soils. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wastewater disinfection is practiced with the goal of reducing risks of human exposure to pathogenic microorganisms. In most circumstances, the efficacy of a wastewater disinfection process is regulated and monitored based on measurements of the responses of indicator bacteria. However. inactivation of indicator bacteria does not guarantee an acceptable degree of inactivation among other waterborne microorganisms (e.g., microbial pathogens).
   Undisinfected effluent samples from several municipal wastewater treatment facilities were collected for analysis. Facilities were selected to provide a broad spectrum of effluent quality, particularly as related to nitrogenous compounds. Samples were subjected to bench-scale chlorination and dechlorination and UV irradiation under conditions that allowed compliance with relevant discharge regulations and such that disinfectant exposures could be accurately quantified. Disinfected samples were subjected to a battery of assays to assess the immediate and long-term effects of wastewater disinfection on waterborne bacteria and viruses.
   In general, (viable) bacterial populations showed an immediate decline as a result of disinfectant exposure; however, incubation of disinfected samples under conditions that were designed to mimic the conditions in a receiving stream resulted in substantial recovery of the total bacterial community. The bacterial groups that are commonly used as indicators do not provide an accurate representation of the response of the bacterial community to disinfectant exposure and subsequent recovery in the environment. UV irradiation and chlorination/dechlori nation both accomplished measurable inactivation of indigenous phage; however, the extent of inactivation was fairly modest under the conditions of disinfection used in this study. UV irradiation was consistently more effective as a virucide than chlorination/dechlorination under the conditions of application, based on measurements of virus (phage) diversity and concentration.
   Taken together, and when considered in conjunction with previously published research. the results of these experiments illustrate several important limitations of common disinfection processes as applied in the treatment of municipal wastewaters. In general, it is not clear that conventional disinfection processes, as commonly implemented, are effective for control of the risks of disease transmission, particularly those associated with viral pathogens. Microbial quality in receiving streams may not be substantially improved by the application of these disinfection processes; under some circumstances, an argument can be made that disinfection may actually yield a decrease in effluent and receiving water quality. Decisions regarding the need for, effluent disinfection must account for site-specific characteristics, but it is not clear that disinfection of municipal wastewater effluents is necessary or beneficial for all facilities. When direct human contact or ingestion of municipal wastewater effluents is likely, disinfection may be necessary. Under these circumstances, UV irradiation appears to be superior to chlorination in terms of microbial quality and chemistry and toxicology. This advantage is particularly evident in effluents that contain appreciable quantities of ammonia-nitrogen or organic nitrogen.

AB  - Paleoclimate traits are highly varied at the diverse paleoflora of the Rio Genoa Formation in Patagonia. They are thoroughly analyzed in order to define macroclimate parameters that ruled the terrestrial vegetational growth during the early Permian. Plant-climate relationships have been historically used for understanding the distribution of present/past vegetation since they represent a continuous feedback along the terrestrial environments on Earth. Most of the indicators found in Patagonia clearly suggest warm and humid conditions during the entire deposition of the studied unit. Such conditions, related to subtropical climates, cannot be correlated with paleoclimate approaches originated from other proxies. This is due to several imprecisions that affect the interpretation of the paleogeographic position of Patagonia. Different hypotheses are erected in order to explain the paleofloristic and paleoclimatic anomaly present in southern South America, which should encourage new efforts to better understanding the geological dynamics of southwestern Gondwana.

AB  - Development of an unconventional test method involves usually the comparison of biological responses under a variety of test conditions. The quality of these biological methods relies on an appropriate experimental design. The Daphnia magna heartbeat rate as a physiological endpoint for assessing aquatic pollution has been of minor interest so far; nonetheless, this could be an early and sensitive indicator of the harmful effect of micropollutants. Our aim was to set up the optimal experimental design of the heartbeat rate test. The studied factors were the composition of the test medium, the age of the test organism, and the exposure time, at triclosan concentrations between 0.2-2000 mu g/L. According to the evaluation of test results the optimal test condition for the heartbeat rate test assumes tap water as test medium, 10-day-old test organisms and 48 h exposure time.

AB  - Drought monitoring and drought planning are complex endeavors. Measures of precipitation or streamflow provide little context for understanding how social and environmental systems impacted by drought are responding. Here the authors report on collaborative work with the Hopi Tribe-a Native American community in the U.S. Southwest-to develop a drought information system that is responsive to local needs. A strategy is presented for developing a system that is based on an assessment of how drought is experienced by Hopi citizens and resource managers, that can incorporate local observations of drought impacts as well as conventional indicators, and that brings together local expertise with conventional science-based observations. The system described here is meant to harness as much available information as possible to inform tribal resource managers, political leaders, and citizens about drought conditions and to also engage these local drought stakeholders in observing, thinking about, and helping to guide planning for drought.

AB  - In the context of construction of the Wlodzienin Reservoir in Poland, the water quality of the main tributaries (Troja River - five sampling points, Braciszowski Brook and Levicki Brook - one sampling point each) was investigated from January to December 2006. The following physico-chemical parameters were measured: NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, PO43-, BOD5, pH, conductivity, and water temperature. Statistical analysis of the data allowed the classification of the water pollution indicators according to ordinances of the Polish Ministry of the Environment. Strong pollution of the streams was revealed and consequences for water quality of the Wlodzienin Reservoir were assessed. The reservoir will be stabilized and thermally stratified in summer. Because of the polytrophic conditions, it will be strongly affected by mass developments of phytoplankton in the epilimnion and anaerobic conditions in the hypolimnion. Some measures that can be taken to improve the trophic situation of the reservoir are discussed.

AB  - Pollen data from Lake Maliq, the first from Albania, contribute new information to the discussion of the vegetational, hydrological, and climatological history of the Balkans since 12,000 yr B.P. During late-glacial time, a perennial lake expanded at Maliq. It was surrounded by a complex vegetation association composed of steppe and mixed forest elements. The highly diverse forest flora suggest that late-glacial forest refugia were more developed here at middle altitude, rather than at higher altitude as previously suggested. The forest developed after 9800 yr B.P., while the water level remained high in the Korce basin until 5000 yr B.P. Different environmental conditions, characterized by lower available moisture and warmer winters, progressively took place after this date. Human activity in the Korce basin ca. 4500 yr B.P. was coeval with conditions characterized by an increase in winter temperatures and a decrease in summer moisture. (C) 2000 University of Washington.

AB  - This review article discusses recent analytical developments with respect to the determination of the geographic origin of raw meat. The main emphasis is laid on lamb, beef and poultry. So far, some methods have shown quite promising potential (e.g. stable isotope ratios, trace elements), others have remained unsatisfactory in their discriminating power to authenticate the geographic origin of meat (e.g. microbiological profile, sensory traits, volatile compounds). Other methods (e.g. animal genotype, gross chemical composition) could be auxiliary criteria as they help to determine related indicators such as feeding or housing conditions but not directly the origin. The complexity of this question is large. An integrated approach simultaneously addressing various species and production characteristics such as environment, animal husbandry conditions, breed, feeding and drinking water has to be developed. Strategies have to be different for global and micro-regional scales.

AB  - A comparative study has been made of the haptoral morphology of four species of diplozoon (Monogenea: Diplozoidae) from the gills of fish exposed to different levels of water pollution in two river systems in eastern Europe. An examination of the haptors of Paradiplozoon homoion (Bychowsky & Nagibina 1959), Paradiplozoon ergensi (Pejcoch 1968) and Paradiplozoon megan (Bychowsky & Nagibina 1959) from chub caught in the River Morava, Czech Republic and of Diplozoon paradoxum (Nordmann 1832) from bream recovered from the River Volga, Russia has revealed abnormalities to the attachment clamps. Two abnormal conditions were found: structural alterations to the attachment clamps and changes in the number of attachment clamps; these occurred both singly and in combination. A higher frequency of abnormal attachment clamps was found in diplozoons from fish caught in the more polluted localities of both rivers. The abnormalities have been recorded and their morphology compared in the light of conditions of environmental stress.

TI  - Chemiluminescence method with potassium permanganate for the determination of organic pollutants in seawater
T2  - ANALYTICAL SCIENCES
LA  - English
AB  - A chemiluminescence method with potassium permanganate was developed for use as an indicator of organic pollutants in fresh water. This method could be applied to the determination of organic pollutants in seawater as well. However, the flow chemiluminescence method suffered from the interference of chloride ions at the same concentration of seawater because of the production of manganese dioxide in the oxidation of chloride ions with permanganate. The conditions (concentrations of potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid and sample volume, i.e. flow injection method) were chosen to minimize the interference of chloride ions. The chemiluminescence method shows a good correlation with the chemical oxygen demand method on fresh water added artificial sea salt and seawater samples. Natural seawater was analyzed by the chemiluminescence method. The results obtained were compared with those obtained by chemical oxygen demand under the alkaline condition and total organic carbon methods. The chemiluminescence method has higher sensitivity and reproducibility than the conventional chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon methods.

TI  - Plankton communities in the Neva Bay during the 20th century
T2  - AMBIO
LA  - English
AB  - This study provides an overview on the phyto- and zooplankton studies made of the Neva Bay and of the changes that have taken place in the plankton community during the 20(th) century. It is known that plankton respond to changes in water quality, especially to changes in the content of organic matter. Comparisons of the literature data reveal the value of species as indicators of different conditions. Many plankton species in the Neva Bay show great year-to-year fluctuations due to varying environmental conditions. According to the results of studies conducted in 1911-1990, freshwater plankton species have dominated in the Neva Bay. The plankton community has essentially consisted of species transported from Lake Ladoga. Brackish-water species occasionally occurred in the plankton samples of the Neva Bay. High turbidity and rapid throughflow of water limit algal production in the bay and, due to the high outflow, the europhication effects of the catchment area are mainly conducted into the Gulf of Finland.

AB  - The nitrogen mineralization capacity of soils characterizes the rate of organic nitrogen-containing compounds decomposition and reflects their ability to accumulate mobile mineral nitrogen, an objective indicator of the availability of this major nutrient to plants. We have studied gray forest soil (Luvic Greyzemic Phaeozem), widespread among Siberian crop fields, using laboratory (composting under optimal conditions) and field (fallow under natural conditions) techniques to get new agrochemical data on the quantitative and qualitative changes in soil nitrogen compounds and nitrogen-containing fertilizers. The decomposition kinetics of available nitrogen and its release from plant residues (melilot, rapeseed, winter rye, and straw) during the interaction with gray forest soil are determined. The CO2 emission, nitrogen content in microbial biomass, cellulolytic bacterial activity, and accumulation of mineral nitrogen species have been monitored. The role of plant biomass in maintaining the nitrogen status in field agrocenoses is experimentally shown.

AB  - Arc furnaces, due to their high unit power and load nature, belong to the receivers affecting the power quality. A dynamically changing electric arc is the main source of disturbances generated by arc devices. This current article presents the results of model tests of disturbances caused by arc furnaces. It also presents the attempts to estimate the power supply conditions for arc furnaces, so that they do not generate unacceptable disturbances to the power system. Various models of the electric arc are proposed. The values of the elements making up the furnace supply system were based on actual parameters. In these networks, measurements of electricity quality indicators were carried out, which allowed us to refer to the obtained results of model tests with the real values. Accordingly, to the real conditions, the values of the short-circuit power of the network and the power of furnace transformers were also adopted in the tests.

AB  - This work introduces a. Multiobjective optimization approach to integrate :the design and control Of multicomponent distillation sequences. The evaluation of the control properties and the deign of the distillation systems were evaluated through the calculation of the condition number and the total annual cost of each design, respectively. Three distillation systems, including the direct sequence, the indirect sequence, and the dividing wall column along with three mixtures with representative ease of separation index (ESI) values and three different feed compositions, were studied. In addition, in a posterior stage to the optimization process, the Eco-indicator 99 for each design was estimated to quantify the environmental impact of the:distillation systems. The results offer the trade-offs between the control properties and the design, which is shown through Pareto optimal solutions that enable selection of the solutions that establish the proper balances between both objectives.

AB  - Impact indicators are systems/organisms, the vitality of which alters in response to changes in environmental condition. The indicators assessed in this review fall within the impact category of the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework. Instrumental records have shown unequivocal changes in climatic conditions over the past 30 years at a global level but impact indicators allow these changes to be monitored at a finer resolution. Our main aim was to review sets of indicators of climate change currently used in various countries and to make recommendations for their use in the Irish environment. We review a preliminary set of climate change impact indicators in five sectors: agriculture; plant and animal distribution,patterns; phenology; palaeoecology and human health. Currently, the most effective impact indicators of climate change have proved to be phenological observations of tree developmental stages. The strongest factor limiting the use of indicators is the lack of long-term data sets from which a climatic signal can be extracted.

AB  - Sustainable agricultural growth is the key to rural system changes that include changes in rural bio-physical environment, economic infrastructure and social conditions. The present study has examined the temporal changes in 18 selected indicators of rural systems in Bangladesh during the period 1975-2000, and explored the influences of demographic, market forces, environmental, institutional and technological factors inducing and mediating such changes. An analysis of 64 district level published census data showed significant increase in agricultural intensity, cropping patterns, land productivity and farm income; decline in labor and technological productivities; and major improvement in rural housing, economic and social conditions during this period. Spatially, major agricultural growth and rural development were observed in districts with high population density, less constrained environments, and better access to markets, irrigation canals, and capital loans.

AB  - The Norse colonisation or landnam of the North Atlantic islands of the Faroes, Iceland, and Greenland from the ninth century AD onwards provides opportunities to examine human environmental impacts on 'pristine' landscapes on an environmental gradient from warmer, more maritime conditions in the east to colder, more continental conditions in the west. This paper considers key environmental contrasts across the Atlantic and initial settlement impacts on the biota and landscape. Before landnam, the modes of origin of the biota (which resulted in boreo-temperate affinities), a lack of endemic species, limited diversity, and no grazing mammals on the Faroes or Iceland, were crucial in determining environmental sensitivity to human impact and, in particular, the impact of introduced domestic animals. Gathering new data and understanding their geographical patterns and changes through time are seen as crucial when tackling fundamental questions about human interactions with the environment, which are relevant to both understanding the past and planning for the future.

AB  - A new index, phyto-indicator of variation of environment (PHIVE), is introduced based on the normalized lengths of the intersection of the amplitudes (intervals) of an ecological scale of all plant species that grow in a given habitat. It reflects the diversity of niches colonized by plants at the given point in time. The index can be applied to each scale separately or can represent averaged data for a number of scales. The method is suitable for various habitats (from relatively homogeneous to extremely heterogeneous ones), which is demonstrated through the example of the ecological scales developed by D.N. Tsyganov. It is shown that there is no causal relationship between the PHIVE value and the number of species in the site, i.e. they evaluate different features of diversity. The PHIVE can be used to assess changes in plant habitats on par with other parameters of the population structure.

AB  - Because islands and archipelagos are often said to present distinct characteristics, there is a need to develop indicator systems for guiding and evaluating the sustainable development of island cities. This methodologically oriented study considers existing standards for urban sustainable development and uses these as the basis for selecting 70 indicators to assess the sustainability of China's Zhoushan Archipelago, bearing in mind Zhoushan's specific island and archipelago environment. The indicators are classified into ecological, social, economic, cultural, and scientific and technological dimensions. Present conditions in Zhoushan Archipelago are evaluated using statistical data. The results shows that the sustainability of Zhoushan's ecology, economic and social performance is good, while the cultural and science and technology dimensions perform relatively poorly. This study suggests future focus areas for Zhoushan's urban sustainable development as a maritime garden city.

AB  - In order to know the performance of pasture and soil stability indicators, a study was developed between 2002 and 2003 in a system with dairy heifers on hydrated red ferralitic soil, based on Cynodon nlemfuensis as basic pasture and a tree mixture (Lysiloma bahamensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia falcatoria, Gmelina arborea, Terminalia sp, Azadirachta indica (Neem) and Eritrina mysorensis). The following indicators were measured: botanical composition, density and frequency of appearance of species, macrofauna, biological diversity of the edaphic fauna, biomass availability and aggregate distribution in humid and dry conditions. The analysis of principal components permitted determining the indicators that explained the best the variability in the system. Between the plant variables, those explaining the best the variability were the percentage of star grass, legumes and weeds, as well as the biomass availability. The highest aggregates on soil were of 3 mm and from 0.5 to 0.2 mm of diameter in the sieving in humid conditions, whereas in the sieving in dry conditions, from I to 0.5 mm, from 2 to I mm and higher than 10 mm. In the dry season, the percentage of star grass and legumes was increased in the sampling years whereas the weeds disappeared. In the rainy season, there was decrease of Cynodon nlemfuensis and legumes, as well as an increment from 21.6% to 35.1% of weeds. However, in both seasons, Cynodon nlemfuensis was kept as predominant species with more than 55%. The system availability had significant difference between seasons. The aggregates higher than 3 mm were increased between the years for the depth from 0 to 15 mm whereas for more than 30 cm, they decreased between 0.5 and 0.2 mm. This improves the soil structure. Besides, the resistance to penetration had adequate values and was kept stable, while the biological diversity of the edaphic fauna increased in the second year. It is concluded that the biomass availability tended to be stable in the system, the biological diversity was increased and the physical conditions of the soil were improved. Despite the fluctuations in the botanical composition, Cynodon nlemfuensis was preserved as predominant species. It is recommended to continue the systematic control of the indicators selected to know the effects of the management and validate their effectiveness to monitor the plant and edaphic performance.

AB  - Red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) has become increasingly rare across large portions of its range in eastern North America as a result of a general and widespread decline over the past century. Genetic diversity, population genetic structure, outcrossing rates in the filled seeds, and actual inbreeding levels were characterized in five small, isolated, remnant red spruce populations from the disjunct northwestern limits of its range in Ontario and five populations from the larger, more extensive Maritime populations of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to determine genetic and reproductive status, to provide some benchmarks for monitoring genetic changes resulting from isolation and restricted population sizes, and to assist the development of restoration and conservation strategies. Thirty-seven allozyme loci coding for 15 enzymes were used for genetic diversity assessments, and six of the most polymorphic loci were used for mating system determination. On average, 29.1% (95% criterion) of the loci were polymorphic, the number of alleles per locus was 1.60, and the observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.097 and 0.100, respectively. The Ontario populations were comparable to or slightly less genetically variable than those from the Maritimes. Only 4.7% of the detected genetic variation was among stands; the remainder was among individuals within stands. The Maritime populations were genetically less differentiated from each other than those in Ontario. With the exception of three Maritime populations clustering tightly in one group, there was no clear separation of Ontario red spruce populations from Maritime red spruce populations based on genetic distance as well as canonical discriminant analyses. The average multilocus (t(m)) and single-locus (t(s)) population outcrossing rates were 0.595 and 0.558, respectively, indicating a comparatively high tolerance for inbreeding up to the filled seed stage of development in red spruce. The Ontario populations, on average, showed higher outcrossing rates (t(m) = 0.654, t(s) = 0.641) than the Maritime populations (t(m) = 0.535, t(s) = 0.475). Individual family outcrossing rates were similar to their respective population outcrossing rates and no significant differences were observed among families within populations for the multilocus estimates. When such high levels of inbreeding in filled seeds were combined with the proportions of empty (post-pollination-aborted) seeds, it appears that actual inbreeding levels may vary from 48 to 86%. The highest inbreeding levels occurred in the smallest, most isolated Ontario populations and in those populations most likely to have been affected by poorer pollination conditions. Allozyme variation indicates that in the short term, extant remnants of Ontario red spruce have maintained their genetic diversity and integrity. For artificial restoration of red spruce in Ontario, local seed sources could be used without undue concern over losses of genetic diversity. However, over the longer term, genetic drift and inbreeding may be expected to result in further losses of genetic diversity and (or) reproductive fitness if population sizes, numbers, and distribution continue to decline.

AB  - Different packaging techniques such as modified atmosphere, oxygen-barrier packaging material and active packaging (oxygen scavengers) have been developed to delay food oxidation processes. The addition of natural or synthetic antioxidants to packaging materials has also been recently investigated.
   The present work was carried out to evaluate the effect of different storage conditions of nuts. Nuts were chosen as a model food due to their particular sensitivity to oxidative processes. Grounded nuts were stored under controlled conditions of light and temperature with and without oxygen scavengers.
   Hexanal was chosen as indicator of lipid oxidation and product shelf life. Oxygen and carbon dioxide were monitored during storage time as well as hexanal content in order to establish a correlation between shelf-life indicator and product oxidation.
   Oxygen scavengers were shown to reduce the oxidation; however the analysis of pouch content revealed that volatile compounds from the package headspace were also absorbed.

AB  - The critical chloride content (C-crit) of reinforcement corrosion in concrete is of great importance for the condition assessment of existing structures and for the service life design of new structures in chloride exposure environments. Here, we review the extensive body of literature on C-crit published in Chinese since the 1960s. In agreement with earlier reviews considering European and North American literature, we find that C-crit scatters widely and cannot be predicted on the basis of parameters such as w/b ratio, binder type, steel surface condition, etc. It appears that the stress state of the reinforcing steel may play a more important role than generally assumed. On the basis of this review, complementing earlier reviews, we conclude that the state-of-the-art on C-crit has advanced negligibly over the last decades. The time is now to change the way corrosion initiation in concrete is scientifically addressed. Recommendations for further work are made.

AB  - The heat production rate in the suspension of unicellular alga (Chlorella vulgaris) was studied by the method of microcalorimetry during adaptation of the alga to stress conditions (NaCl and 45degreesC). The heat production rate slightly increased after the addition of 75 mM NaCl to cell suspension. A two-phase response was observed at 150 and 450 mM NaCl and at elevated temperature. The heat production rate was high during the first 3-4 h; then, it decreased and leveled off. This characteristic dramatically decreased at a high salt concentration (500 mM). Cell was unable to adapt to a high NaCl concentration (550 mM), which led to energy dissipation manifested in a high heat production rate. We conclude that the heat production rate, an integral indicator of plant cell activity can be used to assess plant cell adaptation to the impact of stress factors.

AB  - The change Delta T(R) in electronic kinetic energy on bringing two atoms from infinity to separation R plays an essential role in the formation of the covalent bond (Slater). The scaling properties Delta T(R) are studied for X(2) molecules, with emphasis on the universality of a relative kinetic energy change Delta T/D-e = t as a function of the relative separation distance R/R(e) = s, D-e being the bond dissociation energy and R(e) the equilibrium bond length. The virial theorem yields Delta t(s = 1) = 1 and partial derivative Delta t/partial derivative s\(s=1) = -(kR(e)(2)/D-e), where k is the molecular force constant. A necessary condition for universality is that kR(e)(2)/D-e is constant. This condition is usefully satisfied within periods n = 2-4 for multiple bonds. Al-2 fits into a sequence as a covalent molecule.

AB  - The connection between drought early warning information and the timing of rangeland managers' response actions is not well understood. This study investigates U.S. Northern Plains range and livestock managers' decision-making in response to the 2016 flash drought, by means of a postdrought survey of agricultural landowners and using the Protective Action Decision Model theoretical framework. The study found that managers acted in response to environmental cues, but that their responses were significantly delayed compared to when drought conditions emerged. External warnings did not influence the timing of their decisions, though on-farm monitoring and assessment of conditions did. Though this case focused only on a one-year flash drought characterized by rapid drought intensification, waiting to destock pastures was associated with greater losses to range productivity and health and diversity. This study finds evidence of unrealized potential for drought early warning information to support proactive response and improved outcomes for rangeland management.

AB  - The contemporary forestry preoccupation with non-declining even-flow during yield simulations detracts from more important questions about the constraints that should bind the end of a simulation. Whilst long simulations help to convey a sense of sustainability, they are inferior to stronger indicators such as the optimal state and binding conditions at the end of a simulation. Rigorous definitions of sustainability that constrain the terminal state should allow flexibility in the planning horizon and relaxation of non-declining even-flow, allowing both greater economic efficiency and better environmental outcomes. Suitable definitions cannot be divorced from forest type and management objectives, but should embrace concepts that ensure the anticipated value of the next harvest, the continuity of growing stock, and in the case of uneven-aged management, the adequacy of regeneration.

AB  - A process optimization method has been developed for the design of reverse osmosis (RO) processes. RO process configurations are systematically generated using a flexible superstructure and evaluated by economical (investment and operating costs), technical (energy requirement, water recovery rate) and environmental performance indicators (Life Cycle Assessment). The simultaneous optimization of the RO process layout and operating conditions constitutes a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is solved using a multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach. The MOO identifies the best technological alternatives for the set of selected objectives. In a given context, it allows to define a set of optimal solutions representing the trade-off between conflicting objectives such as economical costs and environmental impacts. As a case study, the methodology is applied on a brackish water reverse osmosis (BWRO) desalination project, for which the optimal design is characterized depending on the economical conditions.

AB  - Temperature of leaves or canopies can be used as an indicator of stomata] aperture, which is considered a sensitive response to soil water deficit. In this paper we analyse the robustness and sensitivity of thermal imaging for detecting changes in stomata] conductance and leaf water status in a range of plant species. Thermal imaging successfully distinguished between irrigated and non-irrigated plants of a variety of species under greenhouse or controlled chamber conditions, with strong correlations between thermal indices and stomatal conductance measured by porometry. Our results also highlighted issues that need to be addressed in order to be confident of always detecting drought stress using this technique. These include variability in leaf angles and the limited reliability of 'wet' and 'dry' leaves to represent leaves with stomata fully open or stomata fully closed. These results should assist the design of protocols for application in crop production or ecosystem monitoring.

AB  - The analysis of plant competition experiments with variable plant density is discussed based on three published data sets. It is shown how conclusions regarding plant community dynamics from typical plant competition experiments can be extended and based on a statistical framework. The data are tested in hyperbolic competition models of decreasing complexity by a standard hierarchical statistical procedure. Hypotheses on the shape of the response surface curves, the number of necessary parameters, and the effects of competition on plant growth were tested using maximum likelihood ratio tests. The conditions for coexistence in a hyperbolic competition model were examined analytically. Using the found conditions for coexistence and Bayesian statistics, the probability of the four possible outcomes of two-species competition was estimated in a competition experiment with Avena fatua and A. barbata.

AB  - Archaeological resources in the coastal zone are subjected to a variety of cultural, social, and environmental conditions that affect a site's stability, which can be defined in physical (e.g. structure, geophysical environment), sociocultural (e.g. looting, vandalism), and regulatory (e.g. federal, state, and local mandates) terms. To effectively manage resources within this dynamic environment requires a holistic understanding of what drives stability (or instability) at each site. The systematic development of indices for archaeological site stability aggregates a large number of complex conditions, both drivers and pressures, into a smaller set of key indicators that can be used to evaluate site stability, and to monitor changes over time. This system of indices provides an integrated framework for evaluation of site-specific stability that allows for adaptive management and the prioritisation of resources (e.g. funding, time, staff).

AB  - This paper introduces a new composite index - the financial supply index (FSI) - measuring the level of supply of foreign capital to small open economies. FSI is estimated on a sample of 11 EU new member states (NMS) applying Kalman filtering, principal components and variance-equal weights. Results indicated that the main drivers of financial supply to NMS are externally determined, with economic sentiment and business climate in the Eurozone carrying the highest weight. FSI proved to have a good predictive power for debt inflow dynamics. In addition, we create a new indicator - the Refinancing Risk Ratio, which relates the supply and demand for foreign capital - to quantify the external refinancing conditions and risk faced by the government. We distinguish between two recent episodes of high refinancing risk - one during the global crisis, and the other during the European sovereign debt crisis - but the episodes significantly differ in nature.

AB  - In conservation, earth renders can be used as sacrificial coatings. However, earth presents vulnerability when in contact with water. The application of ecological surface treatments on earth renders can be of great relevance, ensuring their durability while increasing eco-efficiency and extending its range of applications. The behaviour of a ready-mixed earth render applied in situ, on adobe and concrete block masonry experimental walls exposed outdoors with protection, and under controlled laboratory conditions, on hollow bricks, was evaluated after four years. Several superficial treatments were applied on the renders: linseed oil, mucilage of aloe vera and pasta and rice cooking water. The renders were characterized by non-destructive tests. The surface treatment with linseed oil presents good results and improves the durability of the earth render, giving it adequate protection against natural degradation.

AB  - Currently daylight studies are focused on visual amenity. This new trend arises from the need of professionals and researchers to define indicators of daylight quality. One such indicator is the correlated color temperature (CCT). In this paper, the influence of windows orientation and shading systems in color perception of the environment (CCT) is discussed. To achieve this goal a dynamic (spatial and temporal) characterization methodology of daylight source CCT is proposed. The analysis was performed on a scale model of an indoor space, under clear sky conditions. Results showed the importance of the window orientation in the indoor CCT of daylight, obtaining variations of up to 50 %. It is also noted that shading device cause changes in indoor configurations and sensations. Also here the impact of shading systems and glass on the TCC of natural light entering a space was analyzed.

AB  - Over the last four centuries several botanists have analysed the Colosseum flora, and by using modern ecological and biogeographical approaches to these same floras, we have observed similar trends with respect to the climatic phenomena as those of the historic Torre Calandrelli Observatory and by other older historical records. The elements of which can be summarised as follows: 1) a substantial reduction of all the biogeographical components taken as indicators of cooler and damper habitats, such as the Euro-Asiatic and Boreal areas starting from the 17th Century in particular; 2) a decrease in numbers of all the species more dependent on water (independent of their chorology); 3) similar clear-cut increases in the species belonging to phytosociological classes typical to Mediterranean climatic conditions, to the detriment of those typical to Middle-European temperate bioclimates. All of which can be interpreted as clear indicators of non-negligible climatic changes towards hotter and drier conditions independent of local variations due to urbanisation.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) leaf traits as a measure of developmental instability in polluted and unpolluted habitats. We aimed to evaluate the potential of this method as a biomarker and its applicability on widely distributed species under in situ conditions. Leaf samples were taken from seven sites-three categorized as unpolluted (natural protected and rural) and four categorized as polluted covering the broad spectrum of intense pollution (industrial and traffic), from 1,489 individual trees in total. Results revealed significant differences in FA with expected higher values in polluted environments. Applicability of FA of R. pseudoaccacia leaf traits as a biomarker for testing potential pollution level, as well as the amount and distribution of sampling effort needed for its application, are discussed.

However, high-throughput techniques are now being exploited to address a variety of pharmacological and cellular signaling research questions, including the regulation and role of intracellular Ca2+ in a plethora of biological systems. Although an awareness of specific assay conditions is crucial for reliable and reproducible measurements of intracellular free Ca2+ whichever system of study is used, the complex temporal nature of Ca2+ signals has posed some unique limitations for its measurement in high-throughput mode. Progress in high-throughput design has overcome many of these limitations and will complement other technical approaches to understanding the underlying regulation and role of intracellular Ca2+.

AB  - The relevance of the study is due to the need to determine the factors of the stakeholder and institutional environment that stimulate the development of industrial production. The study is based on materials from state authorities on the situation and the development of institutional conditions for doing business, as well as materials from companies collected in the SPARK-interfax information and analytical database. A multiple regression model is used as a method for determining the dependence of the formation of stakeholder value due to the factors of the institutional environment. In this model, the performance indicators of network stakeholders are used as the resulting indicator, and the characteristics of the institutional environment are recognized as factor indicators. The results allow us to identify several factors of the institutional environment that affect the stakeholders of the strategic network of the Titanium cluster, such factors include the availability of funding and simplification of administrative procedures.

AB  - Proliferating cells need to evaluate the environment to determine the optimal timing for cell cycle entry. However, how this is achieved is not well understood. Here, we show that, in budding yeast, the G1 inhibitor Whi5 is a key environmental indicator and plays a crucial role in coordinating cell growth and division. We found that, under a variety of nutrient and stress conditions, Whi5 amount in G1 is proportional to the cell's doubling time in the environment, which in turn influences the timing for the next cell cycle entry. In addition, the coordination between division and environment is further fine-tuned in G1 by environmentally dependent growth rate, G1 cyclin-Cdk1 contribution, and Whi5 threshold at the start. Our results show that the cell stores the past environmental information in Whi5, which works together with other mechanisms sensing the current environmental condition to achieve an adaptive cellular decision making process.

AB  - This paper explores the relationship between innovation and competition in 380 Norwegian SMEs. In contrast to a large portion of the empiric literature, we utilized the managers' perception of their firm's innovation activities and competitive environment as measures. In particular, this paper aimed to shed some light on this widely debated topic by examining several aspects of innovation and competition, along with including the effects of demand conditions. The results indicate that competition in the form of rapid changes in production technology has the largest overall impact on innovation, and is positively correlated with most innovation indicators. An inverse-U shaped relationship between completion and innovation is only detectable in one out of 60 possible settings. The combination of low levels of competition and high market demand is identified in one group of firms; these are also characterized by a high focus on the development of new products.

AB  - Partial discharge (PD) measurement is a promising method for condition assessment of insulation systems in high voltage equipments. Conventional PD measuring systems have some difficulties in the measurements especially in online conditions and noisy environments. There is a growing tendency to use new measuring systems for separation of PD pulses from different sources and rejection of external noises. In this investigation a new ultra wideband PD measuring system and relevant methodology are discussed. The proposed system uses an efficient detection method for extracting PD pulses embedded in noisy signal, meanwhile, a wavelet multiresolution analysis is applied to reduce background and communication noise level. In this paper some new and modified features for pulse classification procedure have been proposed. The proposed system, methodology and features have been implemented on a hydrogenerator and also a power transformer. Finally performance of the system is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Systematic transect and grid surveys of ventifact presence/absence were made in order to assess palaeo-ventifact abundance/distribution through Denmark and southern Sweden. The transects reveal a continuous ventifact distribution from western Denmark to south-central Sweden giving evidence for the existence of significant palaeo-wind action in extensive areas previously thought lacking in such evidence. Based on ice recession dates and vegetation development, ventifact formation is interpreted as having occurred mainly contemporaneously with the receeding Weichselian ice-sheet. A grid survey in Scania, southern Sweden, demonstrates a continuous ventifact distribution irrespective of surface materials and topography. The ventifact occurrence outside areas with sandy soils indicates that suspended particles were effective abrading agents. Stable ventifacts confirm previous observations of easterly wind abrasion in Scania and exhibit an extremely small directional variability within, and between, sites. Ventifacts in southern Scandinavia are probably more indicative of transitory paraglacial conditions than periglacial conditions as such.

AB  - Phyllosphere - the world on a leaf, contains an interesting symbiotic association of a photobiont and a mycobiont, called foliicolous lichens. These are widely distributed in wet or moist, highly humid or foggy tropical and subtropical forests, on leaf surfaces of plants called phorophytes and are characterized by low endemism and short life cycle, corresponding to the leaf lifespan. Species diversity of foliicolous lichens is remarkable, with a single phorophyte individual supporting 65-84, and a single leaf as many as 81 lichen species. They exhibit marked structural diversity and ecomorphological adaptations to light conditions, and tire potentially sound indicators of environmental conditions. In India, so far only 116 species of these lichens have been recorded, mainly from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Palni and Nilgiri Hills, and the Northeast. This article highlights conspicuous lack of information on the ecology and life history of these interesting organisms.

AB  - The palaeobiota from a middle to late Holocene succession in Tom Thumbs Lagoon, N.S.W., Australia, reflects a range of environmental conditions caused by sea-level changes and active estuarine sedimentation. At the base of the succession (similar to -0.4 m AHD) a thin bed, containing molluscs dated at 6.7 ka B.P. by radiocarbon and amino acid racemisation, and foraminifers is indicative of open estuarine conditions. From +0.35 m AHD towards the top of the sequence the charophyte Lamprothamnium succinctum occurs in subrecent deposits. This species is characterised here by statistical measurements, and new characters are described and illustrated. The charophytes record a drop in sea level and the establishment of a lower salinity artificial wetland. The investigation has also established that decalcification in charophytes can be related to acidification produced by the release of organic acids, aggravated after 1928 by anthropogenic pollution.

T2  - WATER SA

AB  - The effect of simultaneous ferric chloride (FeCl3) dosing on biological phosphorous (P) removal as investigated in an activated sludge system at pilot scale. Additional removal due to chemical precipitation was measured as the difference in system P removal between parallel test and control systems. Both systems strongly exhibited biological excess P removal (BEPR). The extent of P release in the anaerobic reactors of the two systems was compared by mass balance, as one indicator of the "magnitude" BEPR. Phosphorus fractionation of the mixed liquor also served as an indicator of the biological and chemical mechanisms. Evidence was found that the BEPR mechanism is partially inhibited by simultaneous FeCl3 addition, even in the absence of effluent phosphate Limitation. However, the degree of inhibition was relatively low, ranging from 3 to 20% (approximately) for FeCl3 doses in the range ca. 10 to 20 mg/l as Fe, with a system P removal of 20 to 30 mgP/l in the control. FeCl3 dosing in this range was sufficient to produce additional P removal of the order of 2 to 12 mgP/l over periods of one to three sludge ages per experimental period, depending on the point of chemical addition and sludge age of the system. Sustained operationof the BEPR mechanism in the presence of FeCl3 was possible over a continuous period of 7 to 12 sludge ages, under conditions-in which effluent phosphate was both non-limiting or limiting. Under effluent P limiting conditions, the chemical and biological mechanisms appear to be "disadvantaged'' to approximately the same extent, as evidenced by the apparent stoichiometry of Fe:P for the chemical precipitation and magnitude of the polyP containing fractions measured for the biological mechanism. This suggested that the biological mehanism is able to compete effectively with the chemical mechanism under conditions of low reactor phosphate concentrations (<0.5 mgP/l orthoP) for sustained periods. However, the presence of simultaneous chemical precipitant significantly reduces the extent to which the biological P removal potential is utilised under P-limiting conditions. This could explain the difficulty sometimes reported in the control of full-scale activated sludge systems with simultaneous precipitant addition where a:very low effluent P concentration (<1 mgP/l) has to be achieved.

AB  - The Historic England Zooarchaeology Reference Collection includes more than 3470 mammal, bird, amphibian, reptile and fish specimens, the majority of which are complete skeletons. It comprises important research collections that support internal, national and international projects, and is being continuously developed, mainly through in-house specimen preparation. The collection is housed in different locations at Fort Cumberland, an eighteenth-century military monument, and is therefore subject to varying environmental conditions, requiring tailored curation. This paper reports on an audit of the collection carried out in December 2016, in response to a perceived increase in the presence of insects, mould and grease, and the subsequent actions taken. The audit involved visual assessment and condition recording of each accessioned specimen. New specialist storage solutions were then implemented as part of the on-going collection curation, within the context of an integrated pest management strategy.

AB  - The sustainability of an extensive cow-calf model in General Alvear, Mendoza, was assessed. A multi-criteria method was used, using indicators based on information supplied by field visits and interviews with key actors. For this purpose, ecological, economic and social characteristics were considered. The main critical points were found in the social sphere, due to limitations on the access to public services, poor training and associativity. Regarding the economic sphere, profitability was acceptable; however, the economic risk was at the sustainability threshold due to the lack of marketing channels, high dependence on external inputs and low production efficiency. Concerning the ecological sphere, all indicators were above the sustainability threshold. Based on the research outcomes, management alternatives are proposed in order to contribute to the improvement of social conditions, range preservation and long-term economic results. In addition, the results confirm the need of assessing the sustainability of extensive cow-calf systems through appropriate indicators according to the local conditions.

AB  - Biological impairments in streams are typically defined by regulatory agencies in terms of altered invertebrate or fish assemblages. While nutrients, canopy cover, and sediment fines contribute to these impairments, these stressors are often defined, at least in part, by their impacts on periphyton. Path analysis can extend these assessments to impacts on invertebrates and fish by characterizing the direct and indirect relationships among variables along defined model pathways. With data from headwater tributaries in the Little Miami River, Ohio, we tested models of the impacts of nutrients [total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and the nitrogen to phosphorus (N/P) ratio], the percentage of (%) open canopy, and the % sand and fines on three periphyton metrics [periphytic ash-free dry mass (AFDM), the percent abundance of cyanobacteria (% cyanobacteria), and the percent abundance of Chlorophyta (% Chlorophyta)] and, in turn, on selected invertebrate or fish metrics. Our objective was to develop and evaluate a statistical model that assesses the direct and indirect impacts of excess nutrients on macroinvertebrate and fish in these streams and demonstrate how this approach might be applicable elsewhere. The results suggest indirect pathways for the influences of nutrients, canopy cover, and fine bedded sediments on invertebrates or fish that are mediated by their influences on periphyton. This is in addition to any direct impacts of these stressors on the invertebrate and fish metrics. In most models, all three periphyton metrics increased with % open canopy. Periphytic AFDM increased with TN, while % cyanobacteria decreased. The % cyanobacteria also decreased with % sand and fines, but % Chlorophyta increased. The metrics, percent abundance of (%) three most dominant (macroinvertebrate) taxa, % Trichoptera, and % herbivorous fish all increased with periphytic AFDM, while % climbers, % swimmers, and %Lepomis cyanellus Rafinesque decreased. Lepomis cyanellus is an indicator species, because it is generally common in these streams and relatively tolerant to various common environmental stressors. The % three most dominant macroinvertebrate taxa increased while % Hydropsychidae (Trichoptera) and %L. cyanellus decreased with % cyanobacteria. The % Trichoptera and %L. cyanellus increased with % Chlorophyta. Some macroinvertebrate metrics, such as the % burrowers and number of burrower taxa, did not have any statistically significant relationships with the periphyton metrics but did exhibit a direct pathway with % sand and fines. These analyses illustrate how path analysis can be used to estimate the relationships among the variables in a conceptual model, modify the model, assess the relative importance of different paths, and explore responses resulting from stressors with interacting and indirect impacts.

AB  - Carbide slag generated from industrial sites can contain many organic and inorganic impurities such as toxic metals and organic compounds, which should be treated before disposal. Bioleaching using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and their combination was investigated. The effects of important factors including pH and pulp density were assessed. It was found that under optimal conditions 100% Zn, 41.9% Ba, 98.5% Ni and 97.8% Li were extracted with the mixed culture of Acidithiobacillus at pH 1 with pulp density 0.5% (w/v) after 14 days. To ensure risk reduction of the carbide waste for the soil environment, ecological risk criteria and plant seed germination potentials were evaluated. The results showed that bioleaching significantly reduced slag toxicity, and plant seed germination from leached waste was observed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Various specialists draw attention on the conflict between the industrial civilization and the environment and mention two aspects:
   1. The tendency of depletion of natural energy resources, raw materials and food, or consumption of renewable into a rhythm superior to their capacity of regeneration
   2. Physical damage and pollution of the environment: water, air and land.
   It can be said that a sustainable society is the one that shapes its economic and social system so that natural resources and support systems of life are maintained.
   It is known the need of economic development of regions, but this should be achieved in harmony with the environment.
   The paperwork contains actions of economic development (particularly in the DKMT Euroregion, in the area Triplex Confinium), taking into account the environmental conditions. Another explanation to be made is related to the natural reserve Beba Veche, in which arc found endangered animals (e.g. bustard).

AB  - Vector-borne diseases are particularly responsive to changing environmental conditions. Diurnal temperature variation has been identified as a particularly important factor for the development of malaria parasites within vectors. Here, we conducted a survey across France, screening populations of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) for malaria (Plasmodium relictum). We investigated whether variation in remotely-sensed environmental variables accounted for the spatial variation observed in prevalence and parasitemia. While prevalence was highly correlated to diurnal temperature range and other measures of temperature variation, environmental conditions could not predict spatial variation in parasitemia. Based on our empirical data, we mapped malaria distribution under climate change scenarios and predicted that Plasmodium occurrence will spread to regions in northern France, and that prevalence levels are likely to increase in locations where transmission already occurs. Our findings, based on remote sensing tools coupled with empirical data suggest that climatic change will significantly alter transmission of malaria parasites.

AB  - This article presents an example of the interpretation of morphotopochores together with other landscape indicators from the aspect of water and material motion dynamics on a slope in a particular territory. The interpretations are focused on: -the specification of admissible slope length in homogeneous and inhomogeneous slope conditions, -the specification of the anticipated tendency of water and material motion along the slope (according to relief forms and topographic position), -the specification of the soil erodibility, -the specification of the integration of water run-off and material removal along the slope.
   Based on the determination of the anticipated water and material motion and their integration along the slope it was possible to propose 4 various alternatives of arable soil conservation against erosion. The present proposals are first of all based on both a thorough evaluation of natural conditions and the current exploitation of the territory for the sake of soil fertility preservation.

AB  - We synthesize the information available from the peer-reviewed literature on the ecological status of lakes and rivers in the oil sands region (OSR) of Canada. The majority of the research from the OSR has been performed in or near the minable region and examines the concentrations, flux, or enrichment of contaminants of concern (CoCs). Proximity to oil sands facilities and the beginning of commercial activities tend to be associated with greater estimates of CoCs across studies. Research suggests the higher measurements of CoCs are typically associated with wind-blown dust, but other sources also contribute. Exploratory analyses further suggest relationships with facility production and fuel use data. Exceedances of environmental quality guidelines for CoCs are also reported in lake sediments, but there are no indications of toxicity including those within the areas of the greatest atmospheric deposition. Instead, primary production has increased in most lakes over time. Spatial differences are observed in streams, but causal relationships with industrial activity are often confounded by substantial natural influences. Despite this, there may be signals associated with site preparation for new mines, potential persistent differences, and a potential effect of petroleum coke used as fuel on some indices of health in fish captured in the Steepbank River. There is also evidence of improvements in the ecological condition of some rivers. Despite the volume of material available, much of the work remains temporally, spatially, or technically isolated. Overcoming the isolation of studies would enhance the utility of information available for the region, but additional recommendations for improving monitoring can be made, such as a shift to site-specific analyses in streams and further use of industry-reported data.

AB  - An eco-efficiency analysis has been conducted, as a sustainability performance indicator, by combining the life cycle costs (LCC) and the environmental impacts of diverse plasma-assisted ammonia and nitric acid synthesis routes, for which a detailed process design for small-scale production has been previously reported. The proposed design of the specific plasma processes involves new upstream and downstream activities, which are independent of conventional natural resources and comprise less equipment. In the context of this study, the impact of the product yield and plasma power consumption on the eco-efficiency profiles of the selected plasma processes is evaluated and benchmarked against that of the established synthesis pathways. Results show a relatively improved environmental profile of the plasma-assisted NH3 (5% NH3 yield), considering a power consumption of 17.2 g NH3 kWh(-1) and energy recovery of 5%, against that of the contemporary production route. In the case of the plasma-assisted HNO3 (6% NO yield) synthesis, incorporating a power consumption of 7.77 kWh kg(-1) NO and a 20% energy recovery, a better ecological footprint is displayed as compared to the conventional chemical process. Both plasma processes are characterized by higher LCC than the conventional ones, with the plasma-assisted nitric acid displaying a more competitive LCC profile. A clear contribution of the utilities (upstream and downstream equipment) to both the environmental and cost benefits is shown, and the plasma plant is the enabler of such integration. The contribution is related to both the number reduction of equipment (process simplification) and improved operation (process intensification). Given the outcomes of this study, the concept of developing modular plants incorporating the plasma technology and renewable energy sources-e.g. wind power-for synthesizing ammonia and nitric acid demonstrates promising potential and promotes a new window of opportunities for future sustainable decentralized fertilizer production; such as distributed production at the farm site, with the opportunity to react immediately to weather changes and to local conditions (soil, climate, crops, farming business model).

AB  - Natural ecological variability and analytical design can bias the derived value of a biotic index through the variable influence of indicator body-size, abundance, richness, and ascribed tolerance scores. Descriptive statistics highlight this risk for 26 aquatic indicator systems; detailed analysis is provided for contrasting weighted-average indices applying the example of the BMWP, which has the best supporting data. Differences in body size between taxa from respective tolerance classes is a common feature of indicator systems; in some it represents a trend ranging from comparatively small pollution tolerant to larger intolerant organisms. Under this scenario, the propensity to collect a greater proportion of smaller organisms is associated with negative bias however, positive bias may occur when equipment (e.g. mesh-size) selectively samples larger organisms. Biotic indices are often derived from systems where indicator taxa are unevenly distributed along the gradient of tolerance classes. Such skews in indicator richness can distort index values in the direction of taxonomically rich indicator classes with the subsequent degree of bias related to the treatment of abundance data. The misclassification of indicator taxa causes bias that varies with the magnitude of the misclassification, the relative abundance of misclassified taxa and the treatment of abundance data. These artifacts of assessment design can compromise the ability to monitor biological quality. The statistical treatment of abundance data and the manipulation of indicator assignment and class richness can be used to improve index accuracy. While advances in methods of data collection (i.e. DNA barcoding) may facilitate improvement, the scope to reduce systematic bias is ultimately limited to a strategy of optimal compromise. The shortfall in accuracy must be addressed by statistical pragmatism. At any particular site, the net bias is a probabilistic function of the sample data, resulting in an error variance around an average deviation. Following standardized protocols and assigning precise reference conditions, the error variance of their comparative ratio (test-site: reference) can be measured and used to estimate the accuracy of the resultant assessment.

AB  - Risk assessment methods are used worldwide to evaluate threats posed by fisheries and other impacts on living marine resources, and to prioritize management of these threats. We derive a simplified risk analysis for aggregate fish communities as a preliminary tool to identify priorities for further detailed assessment. Because some of the largest observed rates of sea surface temperature increase are on the northeast US continental shelf, we focused on climate change-driven risks to marine communities in this region. We evaluated climate vulnerability for six communities across two ecosystems: both commercial and non-commercial demersal fish, pelagic fish, and benthic invertebrates in the Gulf of Maine (GOM) and Mid-Atlantic bight (MAB). We first evaluated the probability that anticipated climate changes (e. g. warming water, decreased salinity, increased acidity, altered boundary currents) would occur in these regions, and rated the potential severity of change over the next 10 years. Then, we evaluated the sensitivity of each biological community in each region using 12 attributes (e. g. habitat and prey specificity, temperature and acidity sensitivity, larval dispersal, adult mobility, population productivity, etc.). Exposure to the key climate risks was related to community sensitivity in each region for an overall assessment of climate vulnerability. Climate risks from increased surface water temperature, sea level rise, and earlier spring were rated moderate to high in both regions, with additional moderate to high risks in the GOM from increased bottom temperature, stratification, and river inputs. Benthic invertebrates were rated most sensitive, with demersals intermediate and pelagics lowest. Two MAB communities were rated more sensitive than corresponding GOM communities, but greater short-term climate risks in the GOM indicated increased exposure for GOM communities. Overall, this simple analysis may help prioritize short-term regional climate risk management action, thus addressing key conditions related to fishery fluctuations beyond fishing itself.

AB  - The Skeena River estuary supports commercial and culturally important salmon fisheries. However, considerable development has occurred in the area, and more has been proposed. If anthropogenic development degrades this critical habitat, the Skeena salmon run, that every year contributes $110 million to local economies, may be negatively impacted. Benthic invertebrates are common indicator species, as they often respond to disturbances before commercial species, warning of potential impacts. Unfortunately, invertebrates in the Skeena estuary have not been extensively studied, and we lack the detailed understanding of their community structure and dynamics for them to serve as indicator species in this region. Therefore, present conditions of the Skeena estuary are established here (invertebrate community, sediment conditions and food availability), in order to provide the data required both to anticipate changes associated with potential anthropogenic disturbances and to detect changes in this system if development occurs.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the combined effect of microalgal concentration and temperature on the shell growth of the bivalve Pinctada margaritifera and the molecular mechanisms underlying this biomineralization process. Shell growth was measured after two months of rearing in experimental conditions, using calcein staining of the calcified structures. Molecular mechanisms were studied though the expression of 11 genes encoding proteins implicated in the biomineralization process, which was assessed in the mantle. We showed that shell growth is influenced by both microalgal concentration and temperature, and that these environmental factors also regulate the expression of most of the genes studied. Gene expression measurement of shell matrix protein thereby appears to be an appropriate indicator for the evaluation of the biomineralization activity in the pearl oyster P. margaritifera under varying environmental conditions. This study provides valuable information on the molecular mechanisms of mollusk shell growth and its environmental control.

AB  - This work proposes an environmental analysis based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. LCA was applied to determine if energy savings are large enough to balance the environmental impact caused during phase change material (PCM) manufacture and its installation on tiles. Inputs and outputs of each management stage have been defined and the inventory emissions were calculated by SIMAPRO v 7.3.2. Emissions were classified into several impact categories; climate change, human toxicity, acidification, ozone depletion, particulate matter formation and eutrophication. Three commercial PCMs, evaluated using five different Spanish weather climates, were studied to explore a wide range of conditions. The main results conclude that the use of PCM can reduce the overall energy consumption and the environmental impacts. This reduction is strongly influenced by the climate conditions and the PCM introduced. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The salinisation of many coastal ecosystems is underway and is expected to continue into the future because of sea-level rise and storm intensification brought about by the changing climate. However, the response of soil microbes to increasing salinity conditions within coastal environments is poorly understood, despite their importance for nutrient cascading, carbon sequestration and wider ecosystem functioning. Here, we demonstrate deterioration in the productivity of a top-tier microbial group (testate amoebae) with increasing coastal salinity, which we show to be consistent across phylogenetic groups, salinity gradients, environment types and latitude. Our results show that microbial changes occur in the very early stages of marine inundation, presaging more radical changes in soil and ecosystem function and providing an early warning of coastal salinisation that could be used to improve coastal planning and adaptation.

AB  - Scholarly attention to the nature and extent of negative campaigning in nonmajoritarian multiparty systems is steadily growing. While prior studies have made commendable progress in outlining the conditions and consequences of negative campaigning, they have typically disregarded the complex interdependencies of multiactor communication environments. The present study focuses on network-structural determinants of negative campaigning. It does so by relying on unique data from the 2013 Austrian federal election and using exponential random graph models to investigate patterns of mediated negative campaigning. We find that-above and beyond common determinants of negative campaigning-indicators of network structure are important predictors of campaign communication. This suggests that network models are crucial for accurately representing campaign communication patterns in multiparty systems.

AB  - The environmental sensitivity to oil pollution is addressed in the Loire estuary, an area of very high economical and recreational value. The first part of the paper deals with the evaluation of remote sensing images (SPOT, Landsat Thematic Mapper and ERS-1 radar). The availability of the right images with respect to low tide conditions is discussed. Well-established classifications are used for both visible and radar images, which produce mainly geomorphological information: coastline, sediments, vegetation. Living resources at risk are compiled mostly out of ancillary data, i.e., maps and reports. These two types of information lead to ranking the shoreline in terms of its ecological sensitivity. Man-made objects and human activities are also incorporated. After collecting all relevant data, we examine in a second part how to merge them and produce environmental sensitivity maps, using both CAD (Computer Assisted Design) and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) tools.

AB  - The standard framework for ecological risk assessment does not explicitly address multiple activities. Although this has not prevented its use for assessments of risks from multiple agents, the routine assessment of complex programs or of multiple agents acting on a site, watershed or region would be aided by use of a framework that is designed for that purpose. The framework proposed in this paper is modular with respect to the individual activities which makes the assessment more manageable and more efficient when the same activities are addressed in multiple programs or at multiple sites. It explicitly allows for analysis of indirect effects in terms of causal chains. It includes links to other risk assessments for which changes in ecological conditions are the hazardous agent. For example, changes in ecological condition may create risks to agricultural economies or to the cultural resource values of a site. Finally, the framework includes a standard approach to estimating the combined effects of the multiple agents acting on a receptor.

AB  - Floods are one of the most dangerous natural hazards in Mediterranean regions. Flood forecasting tools and early warning systems can be very beneficial to reducing flood risk. Event-based rainfall-runoff models are frequently employed for operational flood forecasting purposes because of their simplicity and the reduced number of parameters involved with respect to continuous models. However, the advantages related to the reduced parameterization oppose to the need of a correct initialization of the model, especially in areas characterized by strong climate seasonality. In this case, the use of continuous models could be desirable but it is very problematic in poorly gauged areas where continuous rainfall and temperature data are not available. This paper introduces a Simplified Continuous Rainfall-Runoff model (SCRRM), which uses globally available soil moisture retrievals to identify the initial wetness condition of the catchment, and, only event rainfall data to simulate discharge hydrographs. The model calibration involves only three parameters. For soil moisture, besides in situ data, satellite products from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth observation (AMSR-E) sensors were employed. Additionally, the ERA-Land reanalysis soil moisture product of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) was used.
   SCRRM was tested in the small catchment of the Rafina River, 109 km(2), located in the eastern Attica region, Greece. Specifically, sixteen recorded rainfall-runoff events were simulated by considering the different indicators for the estimation of the initial soil moisture conditions from in situ, satellite and reanalysis data. By comparing the performance of the different soil moisture products, we conclude that: (i) all global indicators allow for a fairly good reproduction of the selected flood events, providing much better results than those obtained from setting constant initial conditions; (ii) the use of all the indicators yields similar results when compared with a standard continuous simulation approach that, however, is more data demanding; (iii) SCRRM is robust since it shows good performances in validation for a significant flood event that occurred on February 2013 (after calibrating the model for small to medium flood events). Due to the wide diffusion of globally available soil moisture retrievals and the limited number of parameters used, the proposed modelling approach is very suitable for runoff prediction in poorly gauged areas.

AB  - Four groups of dogs, which had been subjected to housing conditions of varying quality for years, were assumed to experience different levels of stress. The groups were compared for behavioural and hormonal parameters in order to identify measures that indicate chronic stress in the dog and which may help to identify, poor welfare in this species. As a standard for comparison, one of the four groups was composed of privately owned dogs; we assumed that chronic stress levels were relatively low in this group (GI). The three remaining groups of dogs (GII, GIII and GIV) were kept under conditions of low to relatively high austerity, and had basal urinary ratios of cortisol to creatinine, adrenaline to creatinine and, to a lesser extent, noradrenaline to creatinine, that varied from low to high, respectively. Significant differences (P < 0. 05) were found in cortisol to creatinine ratios when comparing GI to GII, GIII and GIV and when GII was compared to GIV. Statistical analyses indicated that the mean adrenaline to creatinine ratio in GI differed from that in the remaining groups and that the ratio in GII differed from that in GIII. Noradrenaline to creatinine ratios differed significantly only between GI and GIII. Dopamine to creatinine ratios and noradrenaline to adrenaline ratios did not differ significantly between groups. When dogs were not disturbed those that were kept under the most austere conditions typically had high levels of locomotor activity nosing, urinating and paw lifting. After mild disturbance by a slamming door or in the presence of a researcher these animals reacted actively, with increased locomotor activity, circling and nosing, and they showed high levels of behaviours that have previously been associated with acute stress: body shaking, yawning, ambivalent postures and displacement behaviours. Chronic stress in dogs may be identified by increased paw lifting when animals are not disturbed and by ample behavioural expressions of arousal when they are mildly stimulated. Since some behaviours may occur in contexts not related to stress, behavioural data are easily misinterpreted with regard to chronic stress. Interpretation will only be meaningful when physiological measures such as urinary adrenaline to creatinine ratios and, especially, urinary cortisol to creatinine ratios are also determined.

AB  - The copper-zinc smelter at Flin Flon (Manitoba) operated between 1930 and 2010 and emitted large amounts of metal (loid)s and sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, damaging the surrounding terrestrial landscapes and depositing airborne industrial pollutants into aquatic ecosystems. However, the extent of biological impairment in regional lakes is largely unknown. Here, we analysed biological and geochemical proxies preserved in a dated sediment core from Phantom Lake, collected seven years after the smelter closed in 2010. Our objectives were to determine how smelting history affected long-term trends in (1) sedimentary elements, (2) biota across multiple trophic levels, and (3) spectrally-inferred chlorophyll a and lake-water total organic carbon. The effects of smelting activities were clearest in the diatom record, in concordance with modest responses in chironomid and cladoceran assemblages. Several metal (loid)s were naturally high and exceeded sediment quality guidelines during the pre-smelting era. With the opening of the smelter, metal(loid) concentrations in sediments increased through the 1930s, peaked in the 1960s, and declined thereafter with technological improvements but remained above background to this day. Although modest declines in inferred lake-water total organic carbon indicate reduced terrestrial carbon supply following sulphate deposition in the catchment, the diatom record showed no evidence of acidification as the lake was and remained well-buffered. Presmelting diatom and invertebrate assemblages were diverse and indicated oligo-mesotrophic conditions. Smelting was associated with the loss of metal-sensitive biological indicators and the emergence of assemblages dominated by metal-tolerant, generalist taxa. Diatoms tracked substantial reductions in aerial emissions since the 1990s, particularly after the smelter closed, but also indicated that the biological effects of metal pollution persist in Phantom Lake. Examining the effects of a base metal smelter on a well-buffered lake offered insights into multi-trophic level responses to severe metal contamination and potential recovery without the confounding effects of concurrent changes in lake acidity.

AB  - One of the most important pieces of climate change evidence is ocean acidification. Acidification effects on marine organisms are widely studied, while very little is known regarding its effects on assemblages' beta-diversity. In this framework, shallow hydrothermal vents within a Marine Protected Area (MPA) represent natural ecosystems acting as laboratory set-ups where the continuous carbon dioxide emissions affect assemblages with consequences that can be reasonably comparable to the effects of global water acidification. The aim of the present study is to test the impact of seawater acidification on the beta-diversity of soft-bottom assemblages in a shallow vent field located in the Underwater Archeological Park of Baia MPA (Gulf of Naples, Mediterranean Sea). We investigated macro- and meiofauna communities of the 'Secca delle fumose' vent system in sites characterized by sulfurous (G) and carbon dioxide emissions (H) that are compared with control/inactive sites (CN and CS). Statistical analyses were performed on the most represented macrobenthic (Mollusca, Polychaeta, and Crustacea), and meiobenthic (Nematoda) taxa. Results show that the lowest synecological values are detected at H and, to a lesser extent, at G. Multivariate analyses show significant differences between hydrothermal vents (G, H) and control/inactive sites; the highest small-scale heterogeneities (measure of beta-diversity) are detected at sites H and G and are mainly affected by pH, TOC (Total Organic Carbon), and cations concentrations. Such findings are probably related to acidification effects, since MPA excludes anthropic impacts. In particular, acidification markedly affects beta-diversity and an increase in heterogeneity among sample replicates coupled to a decrease in number of taxa is an indicator of redundancy loss and, thus, of resilience capacity. The survival is assured to either tolerant species or those opportunistic taxa that can find good environmental conditions among gravels of sand.

AB  - Reducing the impact on vulnerable species through changes in fishing practices, such as the spatial or temporal avoidance of certain areas, is key to increase the ecological sustainability of fisheries. However, it is often hampered by the availability of sufficiently detailed data and robust indicators. Existing trawl surveys are a cost-effective data source to assess the vulnerability of fishing areas based on the quantities of vulnerable species caught. We developed a biological traits-based approach to the vulnerability of demersal assemblages using commercial trawl catch data. An expert-based approach identified a set of biological traits that are expected to condition the species' response to trawling impact and are combined to produce the vulnerability index ranked into four levels (low, moderate, high, and very high vulnerability). The approach was tested in four southern European fishing grounds showing evidence of over-exploitation, through catches being dominated by species of relatively low vulnerability to fishing impacts. The general distribution of species' biomass amongst vulnerability groups was highly homogenous across case studies, despite local differences in fishing fleet structure, target species and fishing depths. Within all areas the species with moderate vulnerability dominated and, in most instances, species of "very high" vulnerability were not recorded. Nevertheless, differences emerged when comparing the proportions of highly vulnerable species in the catches. Variability in vulnerability level of the catch was also observed at small spatial scales, which was principally explained by differences in habitat type and depth and, secondarily, by fishing effort. In fine mud in the shallower areas there was a higher presence of low vulnerable fauna. Furthermore, vulnerable organisms decreased in their presence in sandier substrates on the continental shelf. The spatial heterogeneity in assemblage vulnerability composition encourages the potential for adoption of this index in the spatial management of fishing grounds aiming at ensuring a sustainable exploitation by mitigating trawl impacts on the most vulnerable components of the demersal assemblages.

AB  - Highland cattle are lighter, slower-growing and less demanding on forage than most production-oriented cattle breeds, which may affect vegetation composition. This study aimed at identifying the importance of breed-dependent impact on the composition of pasture vegetation in comparison to well-investigated factors such as site properties and grazing management. Vegetation was investigated in 50 paired pastures at 25 locations ranging from Swiss mountain areas to lowlands in southern Germany. Pastures in a pair had been grazed by either Highland cattle or a more production-oriented cattle breed for at least 5 years. Plant species composition was assessed on 150 subplots, three per pasture in areas representing different grazing intensities. Generalized linear mixed-effects models, (partial) constrained correspondence analysis and structural equation models were used for data analysis. Despite similar site conditions between the paired pastures at each location, plants on pastures of Highland cattle showed significantly lower indicator values for grazing and trampling tolerance. Both, grazing and trampling were strongly connected and had a common negative effect on plant species diversity. Moreover, Highland cattle had a direct positive influence on diversity, likely due to reduced woody plant species cover and a higher cover of epizoochoric species. This resulted in significantly higher plant species richness (alpha and gamma) on pastures of Highland cattle than those of production-oriented breeds. The observed differences in plant species richness between pastures of different grazing breeds increased with duration of adaptation, i.e. the time a pasture was grazed by a certain breed. The study demonstrates a clear impact of cattle breed on vegetation, which is consistent with the phenotypical differences of the animals. Largely overlooked, cattle breed may explain some of the frequently contrasting responses of vegetation to grazing. The findings have important implications for management decisions and breeding endeavours which go beyond mere productivity objectives. They highlight the potential of low-production Highland cattle to sustain and promote ecosystem services on species-rich, semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Cold-water coral and sponge (CWCS) communities are important indicators of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) and are used to delineate areas for marine conservation and fisheries management. Although the northeast Pacific region of Canada (NEPC) is notable for having unique CWCS assemblages and is the location of > 80% of Canadian seamounts, the extent of potential CWCS-defined VMEs in this region is unknown. Here, we used a diverse set of environmental data layers (n = 30) representing a range of bathymetric derivatives, physicochemical variables, and water column properties to assess the primary factors influencing the niche separation and potential distributions of six habitat-forming groups of CWCS in the NEPC (sponge classes: Hexactinellida, Demospongiae; coral orders: Alcyonacea, Scleractinia, Antipatharia, Pennatulacea). The primary environmental gradients that influence niche separation among CWCS are driven by total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, and dissolved oxygen. Significant niche separation among groups indicates CWCS to be primarily specialists occurring in rare habitat conditions in the NEPC. Species distribution models (SDMs) developed for each CWCS group shared severely low dissolved oxygen levels ([O-2] < 0.5 ml L-1) as a top predictor for habitat suitability in the NEPC. Niche separation is further emphasized by differences in the model-predicted areas of suitable habitat among CWCS groups. Although niches varied among taxa, the general areas of high habitat suitability for multiple CWCS groups in the NEPC occurred within the 500-1400 m bottom depth range which is strongly associated with the extensive oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) characterizing this region. As a result, the largest continuous area of potential CWCS habitat occurred along the continental slope with smaller, isolated patches also occurring at several offshore seamounts that have summits that extend into OMZ depths. Our results provide insight into the factors that influence the distributions of some of the most important habitat forming taxa in the deep ocean and create an empirical foundation for supporting cold-water coral and sponge conservation in the NEPC.

AB  - With the increasing demand for medicinal plants there is a danger that some populations may be destroyed by over collection. Cultivation of medicinal plants may address this problem, but many traditional healers believe that cultivated plants are not as active as plants growing in nature. There is uncertainty around the extent to which environmental stress affects the biological activity of plant extracts. We determined the effects of different annual rainfalls on antibacterial activity of tree leaf extracts of Terminalia sericea, Combretum collinum and Sclerocarya birrea growing under annual rainfalls of >= 870 mm, 650 mm and <= 480 mm in the Lowveld, South Africa. The minimum inhibitory concentration of acetone leaf extracts was determined by a serial microplate dilution technique using tetrazolium violet as growth indicator on four nosocomial bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MICs of leaf extracts of different trees varied between 60 and 1460 mu g/ml. Variations were for T. sericea (60-820 mu g/ml), for C collinum (70-820 mu g/ml) and for S. birrea (70-1460 mu g/ml). Total activity values of the same extracts ranged between 48 ml/g and 539 ml/g. Antibacterial activity and total activity of plant extracts against test bacteria generally significantly (P <= 0.05) increased under lower rainfall. In some cases there were no clear correlations. There were varying sensitivities of different bacteria of leaf extracts of plants grown under different annual rainfalls. This variation suggests that possible water stress caused by different rainfalls did not exclusively affect antibacterial activity of plant extracts. It is possible that other factors such as genetic, edaphic, microclimate, herbivory and pathogens could also have had an effect. More experiments using clonal plant material under well controlled environmental conditions are required to provide a more definitive answer. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Invertebrate communities are central to many environmental monitoring programs. In freshwater ecosystems, aquatic macroinvertebrates are collected, identified and then used to infer ecosystem condition. Yet the key step of species identification is often not taken, as it requires a high level of taxonomic expertise, which is lacking in most organizations, or species cannot be identified as they are morphologically cryptic or represent little known groups. Identifying species using DNA sequences can overcome many of these issues; with the power of next generation sequencing (NGS), using DNA sequences for routine monitoring becomes feasible.
   Results: In this study, we test if NGS can be used to identify species from field-collected samples in an important bioindicator group, the Chironomidae. We show that Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and Cytochrome B (CytB) sequences provide accurate DNA barcodes for chironomid species. We then develop a NGS analysis pipeline to identifying species using megablast searches of high quality sequences generated using 454 pyrosequencing against comprehensive reference libraries of Sanger-sequenced voucher specimens. We find that 454 generated COI sequences successfully identified up to 96% of species in samples, but this increased up to 99% when combined with CytB sequences. Accurate identification depends on having at least five sequences for a species; below this level species not expected in samples were detected. Incorrect incorporation of some multiplex identifiers (MID's) used to tag samples was a likely cause, and most errors could be detected when using MID tags on forward and reverse primers. We also found a strong quantitative relationship between the number of 454 sequences and individuals showing that it may be possible to estimate the abundance of species from 454 pyrosequencing data.
   Conclusions: Next generation sequencing using two genes was successful for identifying chironomid species. However, when detecting species from 454 pyrosequencing data sets it was critical to include known individuals for quality control and to establish thresholds for detecting species. The NGS approach developed here can lead to routine species-level diagnostic monitoring of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - European frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae) grows mainly in stagnant, eutrophic and mesotrophic waters. It is found in various water ecosystems, but finds the optimal conditions for development in ecosystems formed with water soldier (Stratiotes abides). The shortage of detailed literature data on the properties of water bodies where European frogbit and water soldier grow has stimulated this study, whose aim has been to determine the values of selected water quality parameters and concentrations of some metals in tissues of both hydrophytes.
   The study was conducted in the late spring and summer of 2007 and 2008 and relied on environmental samples of water and plants (9 locations, including a field pond, a draining ditch on Pucka Isle, watercourses in Swidwie Nature Reserve, an oxbow lake of the Bug River and a flood pool near Glebokie Lake). The concentrations of N-NO3, N-NO2, N-NH4 and PO43- as well as the elements K, Na, Mg, Ca, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe were measured in the water samples. Furthermore, the percentage of oxygen dissolved in water and the pH and electrolytic conductivity of water were determined. In order to assess the accumulation of metals by plants, the content of the same metals was measured in the water.
   It was determined that Hydrocharitetum morsus-ranae L. associations grow in physiochemically very diverse aquatic environments. The range of differences in the examined water quality indicators was broader for European frogbit than for water soldier. With respect to the concentration of Zn, N and P compounds, pH and the content of dissolved oxygen in water, the ranges were the same for both species. Hydrocharis morsus-ranae and Stratiotes abides differed in the accumulation of the metals.
   The range of the accumulation of most metals (except of K and Ca) was broader for Europen frogbit than for water soldier. In respect of Na, the range of accumulation for both plant species was the same. European frogbit spreads in water bodies in which the water is considered contaminated due to the concentrations of Cd, Pb, Cu and P.

AB  - Policy to guide ecological restoration needs to aim toward minimizing the causes of ecosystem degradation; where causes cannot be eliminated or minimized, policy needs to shift toward accommodating irreversible landscape alterations brought about by climate change, nitrogen deposition, altered hydrology, degraded soil, and declining biodiversity. The degree to which lost diversity and ecosystem services can be recovered depends on the extent and nature of landscape change. For wetlands that occur at the base of watersheds that have been developed for agriculture or urban centers, the inflows of excess water, sediment, and nutrients can be permanent and can severely challenge efforts to restore historical services, including biodiversity support. In such cases, the historical state of downstream wetlands will not be completely restorable. Wetland restoration policy should promote watershed planning, wherein wetland and upland restoration is prioritized to achieve multiple, specific ecosystem services. For downstream wetlands, it is realistic to aim to enhance nitrogen removal and to establish native plants that are matrix dominants, namely, those that facilitate rather than displace other natives. More ambitious objectives such as maximizing diversity would be suitable for less-altered, upstream wetlands. Policy should also call for adaptive restoration and long-term assessments. For large sites and multiple sites of a given wetland type within a region, experimental tests can determine a wetland's ability to support high levels of ecosystem services. Once projects are underway, long-term monitoring of structural and functional indicators can characterize progress toward each objective. Managers can then learn which targets are unachievable based on data, not just opinion. Where an experimental treatment shows limited progress, practitioners would shift to more promising treatments and targets, thereby adapting restoration efforts to changing landscapes. Rather than ensuring duplication of historical conditions, an adaptive restoration framework allows practitioners to aim high while using field tests to identify unachievable targets and adapt ecological restoration to landscape change.

AB  - Evaluating contributions of forest ecosystems to climate change mitigation requires well-calibrated carbon cycle models with quantified baseline carbon stocks. An appropriate baseline for carbon accounting of natural forests at landscape scales is carbon carrying capacity (CCC); defined as the mass of carbon stored in an ecosystem under prevailing environmental conditions and natural disturbance regimes but excluding anthropogenic disturbance. Carbon models require empirical measurements for input and calibration, such as net primary production (NPP) and total ecosystem carbon stock (equivalent to CCC at equilibrium). We sought to improve model calibration by addressing three sources of errors that cause uncertainty in carbon accounting across heterogeneous landscapes: (1) data-model representation, (2) data-object representation, (3) up-scaling. We derived spatially explicit empirical models based on environmental variables across landscape scales to estimate NPP (based on a synthesis of global site data of NPP and gross primary productivity, n=27), and CCC (based on site data of carbon stocks in natural eucalypt forests of southeast Australia, n=284). The models significantly improved predictions, each accounting for 51% of the variance. Our methods to reduce uncertainty in baseline carbon stocks, such as using appropriate calibration data from sites with minimal human disturbance, measurements of large trees and incorporating environmental variability across the landscape, have generic application to other regions and ecosystem types. These analyses resulted in forest CCC in southeast Australia (mean total biomass of 360 t C ha-1, with cool moist temperate forests up to 1000 t C ha-1) that are larger than estimates from other national and international (average biome 202 t C ha-1) carbon accounting systems. Reducing uncertainty in estimates of carbon stocks in natural forests is important to allow accurate accounting for losses of carbon due to human activities and sequestration of carbon by forest growth.

AB  - Worldwide aquatic ecosystems have been impacted by broad-scale environmental pressures such as agriculture, point and non-point-source pollution and land-use changes overlapping in space and time, leading to the disruption of the structure and functioning of these systems. The present paper examined the applicability of a holistic Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) in predicting the tendencies of phytoplankton communities and physicochemical conditions in reservoirs as a response to the changes in the respective watershed soil use. The case of the Douro's basin (Portugal) was used to test the StDM performance in this multi-scale approach. The StDM is a sequential modelling process developed in order to predict the ecological status of changed ecosystems, from which management strategies can be designed. The data used in the dynamic model construction included true gradients of environmental changes and was sampled from 1995 to 2004. The dynamic model developed was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure performed to discriminate the significant relationships between the selected ecological components. The model validation was based on independent data, for all the state variables considered. Overall, the simulation results are encouraging since they seem to demonstrate the StDM reliability in capturing the dynamics of the studied reservoirs. The StDM model simulations were validated for the most part of the twenty-two components selected as ecological indicators, with a performance of 50% for the physicochemical variables, 75% for the phytoplankton variables, and 100% for the Carlson trophic state indices (TSI). This approach provides a useful starting point, as a contribution for the practical implementation of the European Water Framework Directive, allowing the development of a true integrated assessment tool for water quality management, both at the scale of the reservoir body and at the scale of the respective river watershed dynamics.

AB  - Sludge from mining exploitation can be a source of land and water contamination in the adjacent zone. Accidents such as the break of waste mining pools in the Aznalcollar Mine (Seville, Spain) in 1998 produce important ecological disasters. In this work is presented a study of the evolution of aqua regia leachable concentration and mobility of metals in sediment samples of Guadiamar River basin from the accident date up to 2001. The application of BCR standard extraction procedures provides valuable information about the mobility and toxicity of the spill and the metal mobility in Guadiamar River polluted sediments. As a rule, the mobility of several metals in the initial sludge (sulphides) is low, except for copper. Otherwise, the results of aqua regia leachable concentration and mobility of metal obtained for sediments samples indicate that the cleaning and inertisation works carried out in the zone have been adequate but insufficient, being the metal levels observed in the zone are higher than natural levels. To establish the initial impact of the spill and the mobility changes with time, mineralogical composition of the pyritic sludge and its evolution after the natural weathering and after the induction, of accelerated ageing processes by light and temperature was studied in the laboratory. Oxidation of initial sulphides to sulphates was observed. Both environmental and laboratory oxidation of the metallic sulphides increase the mobility of all metals, especially of copper, zinc and lead. The proposed laboratory procedure allows to predict the changes in mobility and therefore in toxicity that can occur at short or long term after exposure of sludge at environmental conditions. The mobility results in sludge and sediment samples are interpreted in terms of the mineral composition of the samples. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the advances in restoration methods for newly created road habitats such as roadcuts and embankments, implementation in different parts of the world is limited by high cost and lack of knowledge of naturally formed plant communities. However, a cheaper alternative is to relay in natural successional process in sites under optimal conditions. Thus, the first steps should focus on identifying plant species that colonize roadways and road habitats as well as optimal colonization sites. Our study aimed to describe species composition, exotic species presence, and diversity among four roadways (Jeongok-Youngjung, JG; Seolma-Gueup, SM: Singal, SG: and Samga-Daechon, DC) and three habitat types (embankments, plain areas, and roadcuts) in South Korean peninsula. The effect of some environmental factors on plant composition was also examined (soil type, soil slope, and surrounding landscape). Our results showed that established plant species composition was influenced by the interaction between roadways and habitats types, which was also the main interaction affecting plant richness and evenness. Surprisingly, environmental variables had no effect on plant species composition, with a residual amount of explained variation. A total of 48 plant species were described as indicator of different roadways and habitat types, and 50% of them were invasive or cultivated species. It appeared that different regional-dependent processes, such as northern vs. southern roadways, interact with local process in new-road habitats, producing complex patterns of plant species colonization and composition. Thus, ecological restoration solutions should be targeted at site-specific needs (local) while taking into consideration the differences between northern and southern roadways (regional). Here, regional-pool and local-constraints interaction controls plant composition and diversity during road construction in South Korea. Finally, new restoration actions should be based on plant species that have been established spontaneously in these degraded areas. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The European Union has introduced agri-environmental measures (AEM) as one key policy tool to counteract the adverse impact of modern agriculture on the environment. Payments for AEM currently account for about 7% (i.e. nearly 20 billion EUR) of total EU funding for the Common Agricultural Policy programming period 2014-2020. It has been argued that the conditions for disbursing these payments are not rigorous enough to generate environmental benefits. A lack of spatial targeting as well as insufficient consideration of synergies and trade-offs among policy objectives has also been criticized. Here we present the first nationwide analysis on the spatial distribution of agri-environmental payments and their correlation to selected environmental pressure and land use indicators in Germany. We focused on the AEM payments of the financial year 2014. The results revealed spatial mismatches between the distribution of AEM payments and some indicators for environmental pressures. Uptake of AEM tended to be low in regions with high ammonium deposition or high shares of utilized agricultural area on organic soils. In contrast, AEM uptake was high in regions with a high risk of soil erosion and habitat fragmentation. Moreover, agri-environmental payments varied significantly in relation to land-use attributes across Germany. More farmers received AEM payments in regions with high shares of grassland and Natura 2000 protected areas than did those in regions characterized by intensive agriculture (high numbers of livestock, high area of utilized agricultural area per farm and high natural yield potential). In general, there was a tendency towards spatial separation between highly specialized, productive agricultural areas exposed to comparatively severe environmental pressures and regions with small-scale, low-input farming exposed to lower environmental pressures that maintained a more balanced supply of regulating and cultural ecosystem services. We conclude that AEM need to be more attractive to land managers, especially in productive agricultural regions, in order to increase their effectiveness for environmental impact reduction.

AB  - The econometric model can be a precise instrument for analysing the impact of natural environment deterioration on the fishing economy. The paper presents the results of empirical studies regarding the influence of water quality changes (water pollution) in Charzykowskie Lake on the fisheries management. We have developed the economic-ecological models, which explain, from the point of view of the fisheries management, the changes of economic yield of fishing in the conditions of increased water pollution and optimum content of various substances in the water of the lake. In the empirical studies we conducted, we have analysed the impact of environmental factors on the natural structure of fish caught in Charzykowskie Lake. The empirical results show that most measures of water pollution cause changes in the structure of caught fish. Also, it can be clearly concluded that the increase in the pollution level of the lake supports the increase in proportion of the caught species that yield lower economic benefits, while it inhibits the increase in the caught volume of species that are more economically valuable. Hence the conclusion that the actions aimed at limiting the pollution of the lake will stimulate the increase in the share of species that are much more economically viable. This type of structural changes testify to a particular kind of competition between fish species having different environmental requirements, although the empirical results of econometric modelling suggest the existence of such competition also in the group of fish sharing similar needs regarding the quality of their habitat. Consequently, this situation determines the nature of the impact on the fisheries management of Charzykowskie Lake. When we take into account the changes in the structure of fish population in Charzykowskie Lake within the observed variability range of the model's variables, there also exist neutral factors that were potentially considered to be actively impacting the changes in the caught fish structure indicators. The proposed procedures of optimisation can serve as an instrument for programming the effectiveness of fisheries management in order to maintain ecological balance.

AB  - The Russell Cycle is one of the classical examples of climate influence on biological oceanography, represented as shifts in the marine plankton over several decades with warm and cool conditions. While the time-series data associated with the phenomenon indicate cyclical patterns, the question remains whether or not the Russell Cycle should be considered a "true cycle". Zooplankton time-series data from 1924 to 2011 from the western English Channel were analysed with principal component (PC), correlation and spectral analyses to determine the dominant trends, and cyclic frequencies of the Russell Cycle indicators in relation to long-term hydroclimatic indices. PC1 accounted for 37.4% of the variability in the zooplankton data with the main contributions from non-clupeid fish larvae, southwestern zooplankton, and overall zooplankton biovolume. For PC2 (14.6% of data variance), the dominant groups were northern fish larvae, non-sardine eggs, and southern fish larvae. Sardine eggs were the major contributors to PC3 (representing 12.1% of data variance). No significant correlations were observed between the above three components and climate indices: Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and local seawater temperature. Significant 44- and 29-year frequencies were observed for PC3, but the physical mechanisms driving the cycles are unclear. Harmonic analysis did not reveal any significant frequencies in the physical variables or in PCs 1 and 2. To a large extent, this is due to the dominant cycles in all datasets generally being long term (>50 years or so) and not readily resolved in the examined time frame of 88 years, hence restricting the ability to draw firm conclusions on the multidecadal relationship between zooplankton community dynamics in the western English Channel and environmental indices. Thus, the zooplankton time-series often associated and represented as the Russell Cycle cannot be concluded as being truly cyclical.

AB  - The aim of this work is to investigate sunflower plants response on stress induced by silver(I) ions. The sunflower plants were exposed to silver(I) ions (0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mM) for 96 h. Primarily we aimed our attention to observation of basic physiological parameters. We found that the treated plants embodied growth depression, coloured changes and lack root hairs. Using of autofluorescence of anatomical structures, such as lignified cell walls, it was possible to determine the changes of important shoot and root structures, mainly vascular bungles and development of secondary thickening. The differences in vascular bundles organisation, parenchymatic pith development in the root centre and the reduction of phloem part of vascular bundles were well observable. Moreover with increasing silver(I) ions concentration the vitality of rhizodermal cells declined; rhizodermal cells early necrosed and were replaced by the cells of exodermis. Further we employed laser induced breakdown spectroscopy for determination of spatial distribution of silver(I) ions in tissues of the treated plants. The Ag is accumulated mainly in near-root part of the sample. Moreover basic biochemical indicators of environmental stress were investigated. The total content of proteins expressively decreased with increasing silver(I) ions dose and the time of the treatment. As we compare the results obtained by protein analysis-the total protein contents in shoot as well as root parts-we can assume on the transport of the proteins from the roots to shoots. This phenomenon can be related with the cascade of processes connecting with photosynthesis. The second biochemical parameter, which we investigated, was urease activity. If we compared the activity in treated plants with control, we found out that presence of silver(I) ions markedly enhanced the activity of urease at all applied doses of this toxic metal. Finally we studied the effect of silver(I) ions on activity of urease in in vitro conditions.

AB  - Biological responses and contaminant levels in biological tissues were investigated in fish specimens of grass goby (Zosterisessor ophiocephalus) collected in spring 2000 in a moderately polluted brackish ecosystem, the Orbetello lagoon (southern coast of Tuscany, Italy). The complexity of harmful effects that contaminants may cause in fish over time was assessed. General condition indices (somatic liver index, and gonadal somatic index), cytochrome P450 enzymes, acetylcholinesterase activity and ovarian morphology were integrated with the content of organochlorines (OCs-hexachlorobenzene, DDTs and polychlorinated biphenyls) in liver and ovaries and p-nonylphenol (NP) and lower ethoxylate (NPE1-2) content in muscle and ovaries as well. Samples collected from the western basin of the lagoon near the Orbetello sewage treatment plant had somatic liver index values and two P450 activities significantly higher than those collected from the same basin at the Albegna river delta and in the Ansedonia canal in the eastern basin (P < 0.05). On the other hand, while muscle content of p-NP and NPE1-2 was significantly higher in samples from the Orbetello and Albegna river sites than in samples from the Ansedonia canal site, OC levels in liver (DDTs > PCBs > HCB) were particularly lower in samples from STP compared to levels detected in sites AC and AR. Light microscopy of ovaries revealed that although the gonads were sexually mature, the diameter of the oocytes and eggs was smaller than that commonly reported. High levels of M and NPs were, in fact, observed in grass goby ovaries, and the differences observed between acetylcholinesterase activities among investigated sites suggest exposure to insecticides as well. The integration of biological responses and contaminant tissue content reveals that certain areas of the lagoon are selectively impacted by various human activities and helps in distinguishing relationships between biological responses and contaminant load in the lagoon environment.

AB  - Spatial variation in environmental conditions can elicit predictable size and morphological responses in marine organisms through influences on physiology. Thus, spatial and temporal variation in marine organism size and shape are often used to infer paleoenvironmental conditions, such as dissolved oxygen concentrations. Benthic foraminifera commonly serve as a tool for reconstructing past ocean oxygen levels. For example, benthic foraminiferal species assemblages, within- and among-species patterns of test morphology, and geochemical analyses of carbonate tests are often employed to reconstruct past marine conditions. In this study, we measured the sizes and shapes of modern foraminifera representing four species that inhabit a steep oxygen gradient in the Santa Monica Basin on the Southern California Borderland with the aim of quantifying the influence of oxygen availability on foraminiferal morphology, both within and among species. Most foraminifera rely on aerobic respiration, but the four benthic foraminifera from the Santa Monica Basin do not show the predicted size and morphological responses to variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations based on first principles of cell physiology: Bolivina spissa shows no volume or volume-to-surface area response, Uvigerina peregrina increases in both test volume and volume-to-surface area ratio with decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations, and both Bolivina argentea and Loxostomum pseudobeyrichi decrease in test volume, but only L.pseudobeyrichi shows a decrease in test volume-to-surface area ratio with decreasing oxygen concentrations as expected from physiological predictions. These findings imply that the morphological responses of individual foraminiferal species are not necessarily representative of the responses of other foraminiferal species within the community. Our findings further suggest that these species use physiological strategies such as depressed metabolic rates and alternative energy metabolisms to persist in low oxygen environments and, therefore, cannot be used in any simple way as paleo-oxygen indicators. Should Proterozoic (1,000-542 million years ago) protists have possessed metabolic strategies similar to foraminifera, the sizes and shapes of protists in the fossil record may not usefully constrain ambient oxygen conditions during the appearance and initial taxonomic radiation of heterotrophic eukaryotes.

AB  - In all branches of toxicology, the biologically effective dose (BED) is the fraction of the total dose of a toxin that actually drives any toxic effect. Knowledge of the BED has a number of applications including in building structure-activity relationships, the selection of metrics, the design of safe particles, and the determination of when a nanoparticle (NP) can be considered to be "new" for regulatory purposes. In particle toxicology, we define the BED as "the entity within any dose of particles in tissue that drives a critical pathophysiogically relevant form of toxicity (e.g., oxidative stress, inflammation, genotoxicity, or proliferation) or a process that leads to it."
   In conventional chemical toxicology, researchers generally use the mass as the metric to describe dose (such as mass per unit tissue or cells in culture) because of its convenience. Concentration, calculated from mass, may also figure in any description of dose. In the case of a nanoparticle dose, researchers use either the mass or the surface area. The mass of nanoparticles is not the only driver of their activity: the surfaces of insoluble particles interact with biological systems, and soluble nanoparticles can release factors that interact with these systems. Nanoparticle shape can modify activity.
   In this Account, we describe the current knowledge of the BED as it pertains to different NP types. Soluble toxins released by NPs represent one potential indicator of BED for wholly or partially soluble NPs composed of copper or zinc. Rapid dissolution of these NPs into their toxic ions in the acidic environment of the macrophage phagolysosome causes those ions to accumulate, which leads to lysosome destabilization and inflammation. In contrast, soluble NPs that release low toxicity ions, such as magnesium oxide NPs, are not inflammogenic For insoluble NPs, zeta potential can serve as a BED measurement because the exposure of the particle surface to the acidic milieu of the phagolysosome and interactions with the lysosomal membrane can compromise the integrity of the NPs. Researchers have explored oxidative potential of NPs most extensively as an Indicator of the BED: the ability of an NP to cause oxidative stress in cells is a key factor in determining cell toxicity, inflammogenicity, and oxidative DNA adduct formation. Finally we discuss BEDS for high aspect ratio nanoparticles because long fibers or nanoplatelets can cause inflammation and further effects. These consequences arise from the paradoxically small aerodynamic diameter of fibers or thin platelets. As a result, these NPs can deposit beyond the ciliated airways where their extended dimensions prevent them from being fully phagocytosed by macrophages, leading to frustrated phagocytosis. Although knowledge is accumulating on the BED for NPs, many questions and challenges remain in understanding and utilizing this important nanotoxicological parameter.

AB  - Monitoring-enhanced resilience in transport management is emerging together with the new technologies and digital data, however have not been fully explored yet. Digital technologies have the potential to provide rapid resilience assessments in a quantifiable and engineered manner for transport infrastructure, which is exposed to multiple natural and human-induced hazards and diverse loads throughout their life-cycle. Physical damage and disruption of networks and interdependent systems may cause tremendous socioeconomic impact, affecting world economies and societies. Nowadays, transport infrastructure stakeholders have shifted the requirements in risk and resilience assessment. The expectation is that risk is estimated efficiently, almost in real-time with high accuracy, aiming at maximising the functionality and minimising losses. Nevertheless, no integrated framework exists for quantifying resilience to diverse hazards, based on structural and functionality monitoring (SHFM) data, and this is the main capability gap that this paper envisages filling. Monitoring systems have been used widely in transport infrastructure and have been studied extensively in the literature. Data can facilitate prognosis of the asset condition and the functionality of the network, informing computer-based asset and traffic models, which can assist in defining actionable performance indicators, for diagnosis and for defining risk and loss expediently and accurately. Evidence exists that SHFM is an enabler of resilience. However, strategies are absent in support of monitoring-based resilience assessment in transport infrastructure management. In response to the above challenge, this paper puts forward for the first time in the international literature, a roadmap for monitoring-based quantification of resilience for transport infrastructure, based on a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art. It is a holistic asset management roadmap, which identifies the interactions among the design, monitoring, risk assessment and quantification of resilience to multiple hazards. Monitoring is embraced as a vital component, providing expedient feedback for recovery measures, accelerating decision-making for adaptation of changing ecosystems and built environments, utilising emerging technologies, to continuously deliver safer and resilient transport infrastructure.

AB  - The Galapagos sea lion, Zalophus wollebaeki (GSL), is endemic to the Galapagos Archipelago and is considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Population status has undergone a drastic decline over the last four decades, partially due to oceanographic anomalies like El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. To assess the impact of the strong 2015-2016 ENSO on GSLs, their diet diversity, trophic niche breadth, and trophic level (TL) from 2014 to 2016, were evaluated through scat analysis (N = 360; 120 samples per year) in San Cristobal Island. The overall trophic spectrum comprised 72 species, mainly fish species and one squid species; the most important prey (IIMP) during the study period were Opisthonema berlangai (11.51%), Vinciguerria lucetia (8.82%), and Symphurus spp. (8.17%). There were no significant interannual differences (F=2.15, p=0.104) in the abundance of prey from six different habitats; however, GSLs consumed a greater abundance (47%) of benthic prey in 2015. The PERMANOVA analysis detected interannual dietary differences (F=11.9, p=0.001) and the NMDS test indicated that, GSL consumed a greater proportion of benthic prey in 2015. The GSL can be classified as a specialist consumer (B-i = 0.21), with the lowest value in 2015 (B-i = 0.06). The overall TL was 4.6, indicating a secondary-tertiary consumer. The presence of prey from different habitats (benthic, epipelagic, reef, and mesopelagic) suggests a diversification strategy to reduce resource overlap between individuals. This apex predator exhibited trophic flexibility during ENSO, evidenced by a rapid response to anomalous environmental conditions that included reducing the foraging niche and increasing the consumption of prey from greater depths. These findings highlight the importance of this species as a bio-indicator for environmental changes around Galapagos Islands, a unique ecosystem that is a marginal habitat for this endangered species.

AB  - Aim We aim to use species attributes such as distributions and indicator values to reconstruct past biomes, environment, and temperatures from detailed plant-macrofossil data covering the late glacial to the early Holocene (ca. 14-9 ka). Location Krakenes, western Norway. Methods We applied attributes for present-day geographical distribution, optimal July and January temperatures, and Ellenberg indicator values for plants in the macrofossil data-set. We used assemblage weighted means (AWM) to reconstruct past biomes, changes in light (L), nitrogen (N), moisture (F), and soil reaction (R), and temperatures. We compared the temperature reconstructions with previous chironomid-inferred temperatures. Results After the start of the Holocene around 11.5 ka, the Arctic-montane biome, which was stable during the late-glacial period, shifted successively into the Boreo-arctic montane, Wide-boreal, Boreo-montane, Boreo-temperate, and Wide-temperate biomes by ca. 9.0 ka. Circumpolar and Eurasian floristic elements characteristic of the late-glacial decreased and the Eurosiberian element became prominent. Light demand (L), soil moisture (F), nitrogen (N), and soil reaction (R) show different, but complementary responses. Light-demanding plants decreased with time. Soil moisture was relatively stable until it increased during organic soil development during the early Holocene. Soil nitrogen increased during the early Holocene. Soil reaction (pH) decreased during the Allerod, but increased during the Younger Dryas. It decreased markedly after the start of the Holocene, reaching low but stable levels in the early Holocene. Mean July and January temperatures show similar patterns to the chironomid-inferred mean July temperature trends at Krakenes, but chironomids show larger fluctuations and interesting differences in timing. Conclusion Assigning attributes to macrofossil species is a useful new approach in palaeoecology. It can demonstrate changes in biomes, ecological conditions, and temperatures. The late-glacial to early-Holocene transition may form an analogue for changes observed in the modern arctic and in mountains, with melting glaciers, permafrost thaw, and shrub encroachment into tundra.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera have long served as indicators of environmental conditions - both natural and anthropogenically impacted. To better understand the responses of benthic foraminifera to specific heavy metal contaminants (Cd, Pb, Zn), assemblages of coastal benthic foraminifera were grown from propagules (tiny juveniles) in the lab with exposure to a single heavy metal over a range of concentrations, based on the US Environmental Protection Agency's Critical Maximum Concentration (CMC) values. Foraminiferal propagule banks were collected from relatively pristine mudflats, located on the southern end of Sapelo Island, Georgia (USA). Consistent with the findings of numerous field-based studies, foraminifera were found to respond negatively to Cd, Pb, and Zn. Overall, assemblages grown with exposure to higher concentrations of these metals are characterized by decreased abundances, species richness, and evenness. All of the acute responses observed in these metrics occur at concentrations equal to or somewhat higher than the USEPA's CMC values. Foraminiferal responses vary by metal, though the four most common species (two monothalamids: Ovammina opaca Dahlgren, Psatrunophaga sapela Altin Ballero, Habura, Goldstein; and two rotaliids: Haynesina germanica (Ehrenberg), Ammonia tepida (Cushman)) responded in a broadly similar fashion. The monothalamid species however may be more sensitive to high concentrations of each metal. Of the metals examined, exposure to Pb had the most deleterious effect, followed by Zn, then Cd. These four most abundant species appear to be more tolerant of Cd than the other metals. Zn was the only metal in the study that produced abundant aberrant test morphologies. Ammonia tepida grew abnormally more frequently than any other species encountered and exhibited a distinctive enlarged aperture as well as aberrant patterns of calcification, chamber arrangement, and enlarged pores. Abnormal tests were also found in H. germanica and a miliolid. The monothalamid species did not produce aberrant test morphologies. Results support the application of foraminifera as bio-indicators in polluted environments.

AB  - The textile sector is 14% of total industrial production in India and contributes to about 4% of the gross domestic product and earns about 27% of India's total foreign exchange. Worldwide, up to 10,000 dyes are available and their annual production is above 7 x 105 metric tons, which are being used not only in textile sector but also applied in paper, food and pharmaceutical industries. Textile industries in India have been consuming more than 100 L of water to process 1 kg of textiles, and have contributed heavily in polluting surface and ground water resources in many regions of the country. The toxic and carcinogenic effect of untreated textile effluent is well understood. The decolorization and detoxification of industrial dye effluents is most important aspect and is major concern to meet environmental regulations. This paper presents a review of literature on the significance of bioremediation technologies over other physico-chemical methods for efficient removal of textile dyes from industrial waste effluents to improve the fragile ecosystems in different regions of the world.
   The present review paper (a) symbolizes the applications of existing conventional physical and chemical approaches for the decolorization/degradation of textile dyes, (b) describes their merits and demerits, (c) emphasizes on the existing literature on microbial decolorization of textile dyes precisely by using bacteria (aerobic and anaerobic conditions), fungi and algae, and (d) involvement of various enzymes from different biological sources for the decolorization of various textile dyes and their mechanism of action.
   Over the years, researchers have developed several bioremediation technologies to treat textile effluents, but little effort has been made to put the entire literature review of these technologies in one refereed paper, our review paper is an attempt to compile the existing information on various treatment technologies of textile effluent, so that these technologies can be shared widely for site specific situations.

AB  - This work intends to implement the use of native soil nematode communities in ecotoxicological tests using a model pesticide and two geographically nematode communities (Mediterranean and subtropical) in order to obtain new perspectives on the evaluation of the toxic potential of chemical substances.
   The environmental condition of the nematode communities was described using a trait-based approach (grouping the organisms according to their feeding traits) and a traditional taxonomic method (identification to family level). Effects on total nematode abundance, number of families and abundance of nematode feeding groups as well as potential shifts in both trophic and family structure were assessed.
   Agricultural soils from Curitiba (Brazil) and Coimbra (Portugal) were sampled and the corresponding nematode communities were extracted. Part of the collected soil was defaunated and spiked with four doses of a carbofuran commercial formulation. Afterwards each of the replicates was inoculated with a nematode suspension containing approximate to 200 or 300 nematodes. After 14 and 28 d of exposure the nematodes were extracted, counted and identified at family level and separately classified according to their feeding traits. The patterns of nematode responses revealed a decrease in the total abundance and a reduction in the number of families. Despite the similar effects observed for both communities, statistically significant toxic effects were only found within the Portuguese community. The total nematode abundance was significantly reduced at the highest carbofuran concentrations and significant shifts in the family structure were detected. However, the trophic structure, i.e., the contribution of each feeding group for the overall community structure, did not significantly change along the contamination gradient. Results showed that using such a trait-based approach may increase the ecological relevance of toxicity data, by establishing communalities in the response to a chemical from two different taxonomic communities, although with potential loss of information on biodiversity of the communities.

AB  - The studies were carried out in the years 2004 and 2005 and concerned the lakes Mielno, Maroz, Swiete and Lanskie, all of which constitute part of a river-lake system of the Marozka River, the main tributary of the Lyna River. The studies included a taxonomic analysis of algal community and its dynamics in particular reservoirs. Based on the recorded data, characteristics of phytoplankton were measured as an indicator of changes in environmental conditions in the lakes.
   The analyses of taxonomic structure and intensity of planktonic association development revealed changes in the functioning of the studied reservoirs and indicated the progressing eutrophication of their waters. However, the pace of the process as well as the pattern of phytoplankton dynamics and structure differed between the groups of lakes. Lakes Swiete and Lanskie were similar, while lakes Mielno and Maroz each had their different characteristics.

AB  - Monitoring of soil quality and health provides critical insights into the performance of ecosystems. Nematodes are useful indicators of soil condition because they are ubiquitous, represent different trophic levels of a soil food web and are convenient to work with. Several quantitative analyses of nematode assemblages have been developed and used in monitoring programs and by individual researchers. However, the calculations of the metrics involved are quite complicated. Since they are done manually using spreadsheet software, the calculations are time-consuming and error-prone and usually involve a significant learning curve for the user. We have developed an R code to perform these calculations. The code is compiled in html and deployed over the web. It is and will remain freely accessible and has a user-friendly interface. It requires only an input table with taxonomic inventory data and provides output within a few seconds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper proposes a simple and fast method for static voltage security assessment utilizing indices based on the system Jacobian and its inverse. The list of critical contingencies is dynamic in nature therefore a combination of a screening and ranking neural network is employed to filter out the non-critical contingencies, and rank the critical ones, on-line, under randomly changing loading conditions. Weak buses of the system are also identified and ranked in order of their sensitivity to voltage collapse. A novel feature selection method, which exploits the coherency existing between load buses with respect to voltage dynamics, is used to reduce the dimension and training time of neural network. The proposed method has been tested on IEEE 30-bus test system and a practical 75-bus Indian system and is found to produce accurate results for previously unseen operating conditions almost instantaneously.

AB  - In Mexico, millions of tons of mining wastes are deposited in the open pit. Their content in potentially toxic elements (PTE) represents an environmental risk. In the tailings, pioneer plant communities are established, associated with a determined diversity of fungi; plants, and fungi are fundamental in the natural rehabilitation of mining wastes. The objective was to evaluate the impact of the natural establishment of two plant species on the microbial activity, on the composition of the fungal community, and on the mitigation of the effect of PTE in a contaminated mine tailing. In a tailing, we selected three sites: one non-vegetated; one vegetated by Reseda luteola, and one vegetated by Asphodelus fistulosus. In the substrates, we conducted a physical and chemical characterization; we evaluated the enzymatic activity, the mineralization of the carbon, and the concentration of PTE. We also determined the fungal diversity in the substrates and in the interior of the roots, and estimated the accumulation of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and PTE in plant tissues. The tailings had a high percentage of sand; the non-vegetated site presented the highest electric conductivity, and the plant cover reduced the concentration of PTE in the substrates. Plants increased the carbon content in tailings. The enzymatic activities of beta-glucosidase and dehydrogenase, and the mineralization of carbon were highest at the site vegetated with A. fistulosus. Both plant species accumulated PTE in their tissues and exhibited potential in the phytoremediation of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and copper (Cu). Fungal diversity was more elevated at the vegetated sites than in the bare substrate. Ascomycota prevailed in the substrates; the substrates and the plants shared some fungal taxa, but other taxa were specific. The plant coverage and the rhizosphere promoted the natural attenuation and a rehabilitation of the extreme conditions of the mining wastes, modulated by the plant species. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Passive restoration and applied nucleation are important strategies for large-scale gains and cost reduction in ecological restoration projects. Passive restoration uses the natural regeneration potential while applied nucleation recreates microhabitats, which facilitates ecological succession. In this study, we assessed floristic composition, structure and functional groups as ecological indicators to compare passive restoration (fenced site 12 year ago), applied nucleation (7 years of dense seedling planting) and riparian forest. The study was carried out in a Seasonal Semi-deciduous Forest region in the Pampa biome, in the South of Brazil. We measured and identified all shrub and tree individuals greater than 30 cm in height. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey test (p < .05) was performed to compare composition (richness, abundance, diversity and evenness), structure (average height, maximum height, canopy cover, soil cover, leaf litter depth) and functional group variables (dispersion syndrome and shade tolerance). Riparian forest showed greater richness and diversity. Passive restoration and applied nucleation did not differ statistically in richness, abundance, maximum or average height, or for zoochoric species and zoochoric individual indicators. The leaf litter depth was statistically higher in the riparian forest. The applied nucleation presented a canopy cover similar to riparian forest, demonstrating ability to form habitats which are favorable to ecological succession. We can conclude that passive and applied nucleation restorations have been occurring in a slow process. This is the natural condition of the ecological succession in the Pampa biome, which is probably due to the subtropical climate. Although we could not verify the facilitation effect by functional groups in applied nucleation and expansion of the nuclei size, the floristic composition, diversity, canopy cover and leaf litter depth indicators suggest an acceleration in the ecological succession process. Long-term monitoring should be considered to assess the dynamics of ecological restoration in the subtropical region of Brazil.

AB  - Questions European pasture landscapes have been shaped by grazing and alternate husbandry. They are structurally characterised by mosaics of open habitat patches, individual trees and groups of trees or shrubs. We investigated whether these semi-open habitats may act as stepping stones and thus as dispersal corridors for both plants from woodlands and open habitats to mitigate habitat fragmentation effects. We (a) contrasted the plant communities in semi-open habitats with those of woodlands and open habitats, and (b) explored which life-history traits or environmental requirements are associated with the presence or absence of species in semi-open habitats. Location Swabian Jura, South Germany; Lueneburg Heath, North Germany. Methods We selected four study sites in two contrasting landscapes and conducted vegetation surveys and analysed canopy closure and soil chemical properties in four different habitat types: woodlands, semi-open habitats with high and low canopy closure and open habitats. We tested whether habitat type affected species composition, identified habitat-specific indicator species and compared Ellenberg indicator values for light and moisture and species' dispersal and establishment traits across these habitat types. Results Plant communities of woodlands were significantly different from those of all other habitat types, whereas open habitats showed some similarities to semi-open habitats. On average, 73% of open habitat and 39% of woodland species were present in semi-open habitats. Habitat requirements as well as dispersal and establishment traits of woodland species were often more specialised and differed from those of species of the other habitat types, making them less capable to disperse into semi-open habitats. Conclusions Semi-open corridors have the potential to connect patches of open habitats and to a lesser extent also of woodlands without creating new barriers for either habitat type. Thus, semi-open corridors may counteract habitat fragmentation effects and are a promising tool for biodiversity conservation, particularly in fragmented pasture landscapes.

AB  - Few test organisms are employed for sediment toxicity assessments in Tropical regions, including Brazil. We assessed the ability of the clam Anomalocardia flexuosa to respond to contamination in sediment bioassays using dredging materials of a semi-arid region (Ceara State, NE Brazil), with attention to sublethal responses. Sediments were collected during and after dredging (survey 1 and 2, respectively) and animals exposed in laboratory over 28 days, with responses measured at 7 days. Bioaccumulation of contaminants was determined in whole-body soft tissues as a metric of bioavailability, and biomarkers' changes were monitored in terms of enzymes of phase I and II metabolism, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and antioxidant responses, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and DNA damage (strand breaks). Clams accumulated aliphatic (AHs) and aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) compared to control conditions (day 0), with increased amounts of As, Cd, Cu, and Zn observed in some samples. The enzyme glutathione S-transferase was enhanced in animals exposed to samples, indicating activation of phase II metabolism. Changes observed in glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), LPO and strand breaks were related to oxidative stress. AChE enzymatic activity also changed, as an indicator of neurotoxicity caused by sediment exposure. The computed integrated biomarker response index (IBR) ranked sites according to the contamination status and proximity to its sources. Correlations found for biomarkers and bioaccumulation of hydrocarbons indicated the influence of harbor activities, effluent discharges, and urban runoff on the sediment pollution of Mucuripe Bay. Data also showed that SQGs are unable to predict bioaccumulation and subchronic effects. Based on our results we consider that biomarkers responses in A. flexuosa are important endpoints to be applied in sediment toxicity bioassays in tropical regions.

AB  - The status of the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) has long been a matter of concern in Everglades National Park (ENP) due to its classification as a federal and state listed species, its recognition as a flagship species, and its function as an ecosystem indicator. Survival and recovery of American crocodiles has been linked with regional hydrological conditions, especially freshwater flow to estuaries, which affect water levels and salinities. We hypothesize that efforts to restore natural function to Everglades ecosystems by improving water delivery into estuaries within ENP will change salinities and water levels which in turn will affect relative density of crocodiles. Monitoring ecological responses of indicator species, such as crocodiles, with respect to hydrologic change is necessary to evaluate ecosystem responses to restoration projects. Our objectives were to monitor trends in crocodile relative density within ENP and to determine influences of salinity on relative density of crocodiles. We examined count data from 12 years of crocodile spotlight surveys in ENP (2004-2015) and used a hierarchical model of relative density that estimated relative density with probability of detection. The mean predicted value for relative density (lambda) across all surveys was 2.9 individuals/km (95% CI: 2.0-4.2); relative density was estimated to decrease with increases in salinity. Routes in ENP's Flamingo/Cape Sable area had greater crocodile relative density than routes in the West Lake/Cuthbert Lake area and Northeast Florida Bay areas. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that restored flow and lower salinities will result in an increase in crocodile population size and provide support for the ecosystem management recommendations for crocodiles, which currently are to restore more natural patterns of freshwater flow to Florida Bay. Thus, monitoring relative density of American crocodiles will continue to be an effective indicator of ecological response to ecosystem restoration.

AB  - Functional traits and diversity indices have provided new insights into community responses to stressors. Most traits of aquatic organisms have frequently been tested for predictability and geographical stability in response to environmental variables, but such tests of functional diversity indices are rare. We sampled macroinverte-brates at 18 reference sites (RS) and 35 disturbed sites (DS) from headwater streams in the upper Mekong River Basin, Xishuangbanna (XSBN), China. We selected 29 qualitative categories of eight traits and then calculated five functional diversity indices, namely functional richness (FRic), functional evenness (FEve), functional dispersion (FDis), functional divergence (FDiv) and Rao's Quadratic Entropy (RaoQ), and two trait diversity indices, namely trait richness (TR) and trait diversity (TD). We used combination of RLQand fourth-corner to examine the response of traits and functional diversity to the disturbance and environmental variables. We used variance partitioning to explore the relative role of environmental variables and spatial factors in constraining trait composition and functional diversity. We found that the relative frequency of ten trait categories, and the values of TD, TR, FRic and FDis in RS were significantly different (p < 0.05) from DS. In addition, the seven traits (except for "habit") demonstrated a predictable response of trait patterns along the integrative environmental gradients. Environmental variables significantly contributed to most of the traits, functional diversity and trait diversity. However, spatial variables were mainly significant in shaping ecological traits, FRic and FEve. Our results confirm the dominant role of environmental variables in the determination of community trait composition and functional diversity, and substantiate the contribution of spatial vectors in explaining the variance of functional traits and diversity. We conclude that the traits "Refuge", "External protection", "Respiration" and "Body shape", and diversity indices FDis, TD, and TR are promising indicators of stream conditions at XSBN.

AB  - When the activated sludge process was developed, operators and scientists soon recognized protists as valuable indicators. However, only when Curds et al. (1968) showed with a few photographs the need of ciliates for a clear plant effluent, sewage protistology began to bloom but was limited by the need of species identification. Still, this is a major problem although several good guides are available. Thus, molecular kits should be developed for identification. Protists are indicators in two stages of wastewater treatment, viz., in the activated sludge and in the environmental water receiving the plant effluent. Continuous control of the protist and bacterial communities can prevent biological sludge foaming and bulking and may greatly save money for sludge oxygenation because several protist species are excellent indicators for the amount of oxygen present. The investigation of the effluent-receiving rivers gives a solid indication about the long term function of sewage works.
   The literature on protist bioindication in activated sludge is widely distributed. Thus, I compiled the data in a simple Table, showing which communities and species indicate good, mediocre, or poor plant performance. Further, many details on indication are provided, such as sludge loading and nitrifying conditions. Such specific features should be improved by appropriate statistics and more reliable identification of species. Then, protistologists have a fair chance to become important in wastewater works.
   Activated sludge is a unique habitat for particular species, often poorly or even undescribed. As an example, I present two new species. The first is a minute (similar to 30 mu m) Metacystis that makes an up to 300 pm-sized mucous envelope mimicking a sludge floc. The second is a Phialina that is unique in having the contractile vacuole slightly posterior to mid-body. Finally, I provide a list of species which have the type locality in sewage plants.

AB  - Assessments of ecosystem services have been proposed as one way of incorporating concerns about environmental change and ecosystem conditions into subnational development planning. In Thailand a policy window for such initiatives is opening because of a transition in national policy toward area-based planning combined with broader political reforms to expand public participation and encourage more evidence-based decision making. We explored three case studies in Thailand in which central and local government agencies and research organizations partnered to engage local communities and other stakeholders in assessments of ecosystem services and human well-being. The analysis focused on the role ecosystem assessments play in building and creating demand for coproductive capacity. By coproductive capacities we mean the ability to combine scientific resources and governance capabilities in ways that bring about informed social change. We found evidence that the assessments built capacities for governance actors to explore scientific and research-based evidence, to consult scientific experts, and then to evaluate existing policies and plans using this newly acquired information. At the same time, scientific experts also learned to explore public policy issues, to consult planners and decision makers in government, and based on this knowledge to evaluate scientific evidence and revise the scope and goals of their research and analytical activities to better meet policy needs and demands. Coproductive capacities were built when various stakeholders jointly engaged in compilation and interpretation of evidence. Doing so helped legitimize the assessment process with positive feedback on both governance and science capacities. We also found evidence, however, of significant cultural and institutional constraints to designing and making better use of ecosystem services assessments. These constraints included insufficient resources for both knowledge making and decision making. Power relations and organizational culture likewise had implications for capacities to govern and do science. Nevertheless, by creating demand for greater capacities, assessments contribute to improving the quality of evidence-based social change.

AB  - P> Species assemblages of diatoms, rotifers, chydorids, planktonic crustaceans and chironomids were studied in 235 alpine lakes in the Alps, Pyrenees, Tatras (Western Carpathians), Retezat (Southern Carpathians) and Rila Mountains (Balkans).
   For all taxonomic groups we found a hierarchical structure in the community assemblage using distinct scales of lake clustering (number of k-means groups) based on species composition similarity (Hellinger distance). We determined the optimal partition in assemblage types (i.e. number of lake clusters) for each taxonomic group by maximising the sum of the taxon indicative value (IndVal) and performed discriminant analyses, using environmental variables not conditioned by geographical patterns. Relevant environmental variables differed among and within taxonomic groups. Therefore the assemblages respond to a complex environmental mosaic, with the exception of diatom assemblages, which followed an acid-base gradient.
   The significant environmental variables could be grouped into four general factors: lake size, tropho-dynamic status, acid-base balance and ice-cover duration (i.e., altitudinal gradient). Lake size was significant for the highest number of assemblage types; however, the most significant factor differed among taxonomic groups: acid-base balance for diatoms, lake size for rotifers, ice-cover duration for chydorids and planktonic crustaceans and tropho-dynamic status for chironomids. No single environmental typology accounted for the assemblage structure of all taxonomic groups.
   However, defining ecological thresholds as values within environmental gradients at which the rate of change in assemblages is accelerated relative to points distant from that threshold, we were able to find specific threshold values for each of the four main general environmental factors identified, which were relevant across several taxonomic groups: 3 ha for lake area; 0.6 mg L-1 for dissolved organic carbon; 190 days for ice-cover duration and 200 mu eq L-1 for acid neutralising capacity. Above and below these values ecosystem organisation change substantially. They have direct applications in establishing lake typologies for environmental quality and biodiversity conservation programmes, and in improving predictions about global change impacts.

TI  - STUDIES ON THE SITUATION OF POLLUTION AND COUNTERMEASURES OF CONTROL OF THE OCEANIC ENVIRONMENT IN ZHOUSHAN FISHING GROUND - THE LARGEST FISHING GROUND IN CHINA
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA  - English
AB  - Zhoushan fishing ground is located in the eastern part of Hangzhou Bay of China close to the continental scashore of Zhejiang Province and Shanghai Municipality; and links up the Yangtze River, Qiantang River, Young river and Caoc River. The total length of continental coastline is 1500 km and the total sea area of the fishing ground is about 100,000 km2. It is a spawning and growing place for various fishes, shrimps and crabs; and the species of fish are as many as 360 with hairtail, larger yellow croaker, little yellow croaker and cuttlefish well-known throughout the country. The annual catch of fish is about 800 thousand ton, occupying one-third of the national total. However, of the late years, the product of the fishing ground goes straight downwards, and drops by 50% at present. Besides the problem of overfishing, another important factor is the pollution of occanic environment. Coastline is the most developed economic area in China, where the waste water discharged into the sea area of fishing ground comes up to two billion ton causing serious organic pollution and the heavy metals such Cu, Zn, Pb and Cr violating the standards in different degrees and directly affecting the structure and stability of oceanic ecosystem, changing the migration route of fishes and the emigration of spawning ground, and the continuous increase of residual toxics in the aquatic products. These problems have brought to the attention of Chinese government; and measures are under way to improve the oceanic environmental quality of the fishing ground. The present paper describes in detail the natural conditions and the pollution situation of the fishing ground, and also the contents of studies on the comprehensive programme of environmental protection, including prediction of the developing trend of seawater pollution, the characteristics of ocean current and the route of transference and conversion of petroleum, COD and heavy metals and the receiving capability of sea area for main pollutants; the impact assessment of environmental pollution on the aquatic resources and the countermeasures of oceanic environmental protection.

AB  - The presence of ants in school kitchens and canteens may pose a risk of food contamination. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of the ants as carriers of microorganisms indicating hygienic and sanitary conditions in school kitchens and canteens in the western region of Santa Catarina. Ten samples were collected with up to ten ants in the kitchen and canteen environments in nine urban schools. The ants were evaluated using microbiological analyses regarding Staphylococcus aureus, aerobic mesophilic bacteria, total coliforms and thermotolerant coliforms/Escherichia coli. Twenty ant species were sampled. Four species presented counts for S. aureus, eight for aerobic mesophilic bacteria and three for total coliforms. The results evidenced the potential of ants as indicators of contamination and the risk of ants to carrier microorganisms in school environments and an important diversity occurring in indoor environments.

AB  - A biosensor is a device that uses biological materials to detect and monitor the presence of specific chemicals in an area. Traditional methods of volatile detection used by law enforcement agencies and rescue teams typically consist of reliance on canine olfaction. This concept of using dogs to detect specific substances is quite old. However, dogs have some limitations such as cost of training and time of conditioning. Thus, the possibility of using other organisms as biosensors including rats, dolphins, honeybees, and parasitic wasps for detecting explosives, narcotics and cadavers has been developed. Insects have several advantages unshared by mammals. Insects are sensitive, cheap to produce and can be conditioned with impressive speed for a specific chemical-detection task. Moreover, insects might be a preferred sensing method in scenarios that are deemed too dangerous to use mammalian. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the biosensors used in forensic sciences.

AB  - The coasts of the island of Crete, which has a long history of human presence and a recent increase in tourism industrialization, and urbanization, were surveyed and their condition assessed.  The surveyed coastal areas were separated into various categories according to their ecological and aesthetic value and according to the intensity of human activities. The northern coasts have a different set of values and are subject to a different level of activities, some higher and others lower, than the southern coasts. The presence of people and trampling, the movement of vehicles on the beaches, the presence of houses and cultivation next to the coasts, and grazing by sheep and goats are the main human activities. The results of the survey show that the coasts of Crete retain many of their original natural characteristics and, with some planning, protection is still possible.

AB  - Upper Cenomanian-lower Turonian carbonates from the Preafrican Trough (South Morocco) and Agadir Basin contain biological (benthic and planktonic organisms) and chemical (redox sensitive trace metals) markers indicating the occurrence of dysoxic conditions with a significant increase in productivity in shallow water areas on the NW African margin during the Oceanic Anoxic Event 2.
   The geochemistry of carbonate rocks from three sections along a W-E transect, perpendicular to the margin, is studied here to elucidate the origin of the increased productivity and to test the applicability of cerium anomalies as markers of redox-sensitive and/or indicators of paleoenvironmental or paleoceanographic conditions.
   The rare earth element (REE) data show typical seawater patterns and negative Ce/Ce* anomalies which appear to indicate the persistence of oxic conditions during the late Cenomanian-early Turonian. This interpretation is in contradiction with that inferred from chemical data (ratios of various redox-sensitive elements to aluminum) and paleontological assemblages.
   To resolve this paradox, our data are compared with current oceanographic data and examined using a geochemical model that simulates the REE patterns of seawater, specifically the cerium anomaly. There is a satisfactory agreement between measured and calculated REE values for the three studied sections which allows us to distinguish Cenomanian and Turonian water masses. Taking all these geochemical data together, we suggest that the Cenomanian-Turonian stratigraphic interval in the Preafrican Trough and the Agadir Basin records a change of water mass during a transgressive event on an upwelling margin. The intense upwelling of nutrient-rich waters explains the high marine productivity throughout the studied area during the Turonian.
   The dissolved-oxygen concentrations in waters arc not straightforwardly recorded in the trace-metal contents of carbonates. Nevertheless, these data can be deconvoluted by taking account of the saturation state of seawater and the role of particles. Even if negative cerium anomalies in carbonates are classically correlated with dissolved-oxygen concentration, this study proposes that they are also dependent, possibly to a large extent, on particle concentration and water mass circulation. This would explain why several proxies are required to reconstruct pateo-redox conditions in carbonate facies.

AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate early plant community development in two sites (i.e., higher and lower elevation sites-LC1 and LC2, respectively) of the Loudoun County (LC) mitigation wetland created in the Virginia Piedmont. The effects of hydrologic design elements incorporated during the construction (i.e., disking-induced microtopography-MT and site level elevation difference) on vegetative and hydrologic attributes (e.g., species richness, biodiversity, plant cover, floristic quality assessment index, wetland indicator status, soil moisture content, and water table depths) were investigated. The study was conducted at the end of two growing seasons in 2008 and 2009 (i.e., second and third growing seasons). Drought conditions that persisted into the second growing season resulted in the abundance of a seeded cover grass, Lolium multiflorum (Italian ryegrass), intentionally planted during initial seeding for erosion control. L multiflorum was subsequently phased out and replaced by facultative wet and obligate wetland species by the third growing season when above-average precipitation occurred, leading to a decrease in total percent cover. Prevalence index changed in both LC1 and LC2, dropping from overall facultative status in 2008 to obligate status in 2009 when obligate species such as Bidens cernua, Carex frankii, and Juncus effusus thrived and expanded with the change of hydrologic regime in 2009. Microtopographic treatment (i.e., disked or undisked) positively influenced vegetation development for LC1 site in 2008, but the positive influence was not consistent for LC2, which experienced an additional month of standing water conditions in the same year, nor for either site in 2009 when above-average precipitation occurred. The site differences in elevation, and thus hydrologic regime, seemed to overwhelm the effects on vegetation of disking-induced microtopography in each site when precipitation was at or above average range. Although shown on short spatial and temporal scales in this study, incorporation of micro- and macrotopographic design elements in creating a mitigation wetland can be beneficial to the early development of diverse vegetation communities wetland under varying climate conditions.

AB  - 1. In this study we predict stream sensitivity to non-point source pollution based on the non-linear responses of hydrological regimes and associated loadings of non-point source pollutants to catchment properties. We assessed two hydrologically based thresholds of impairment, one for catchment storage (5-10%) and one for mature forest (<50% versus >60% of catchment in mature forest cover) across two different hydrogeomorphic regions within the Northern Lakes and Forest (NLF) ecoregion: the North Shore [predominantly within the North Shore Highlands Ecological Unit] and the South Shore (predominantly within the Lake Superior Clay Plain Ecological Unit). Water quality samples were collected and analysed during peak snowmelt and baseflow conditions from 24 second-order streams grouped as follows: three in each region x catchment storage x mature forest class.
   2. Water quality was affected by a combination of regional influences, catchment storage and mature forest. Regional differences were significant for suspended solids, phosphorus, nitrogen: phosphorus ratios, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and alkalinity. Catchment storage was significantly correlated with dissolved silica during the early to mid-growing season, and with DOC, specific conductance and alkalinity during all seasons. Total nitrogen and dissolved nitrogen were consistently less in low mature forest than in high mature forest catchments. Catchment storage interacted with the influence of mature forest for only two metrics: colour and the soluble inorganic nitrogen : phosphorus ratio.
   3. Significant interaction terms (region by mature forest or region by storage) suggest differences in regional sensitivity for conductance, alkalinity, total organic carbon, and colour, as well as possible shifts in thresholds of impact across region or mature forest class.
   4. Use of the NLF Ecoregion alone as a basis for setting regional water quality criteria would lead to the misinterpretation of reference condition and assessment of condition. There were pronounced differences in background water quality between the North and South Shore streams, particularly for parameters related to differences in soil parent material and glacial history. A stratified random sampling design for baseflow and snowmelt stream water quality based on both hydrogeomorphic region and catchment attributes improves assessments of both reference condition and differences in regional sensitivity.

AB  - Globally accelerating frequency and extent of wildfire threatens the persistence of specialist wildlife species through direct loss of habitat and indirect facilitation of exotic invasive species. Habitat specialists may be especially prone to rapidly changing environmental conditions because their ability to adapt lags behind the rate of habitat alteration. As a result, these populations may become increasingly susceptible to ecological traps by returning to suboptimal breeding habitats that were dramatically altered by disturbance. We demonstrate a multistage modeling approach that integrates habitat selection and survival during the key nesting life-stage of a bird species of high conservation concern, the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter, sage-grouse). We applied these spatially explicit models to a spatiotemporally robust dataset of sage-grouse nest locations and fates across wildfire-altered sagebrush ecosystems of the Great Basin ecoregion, western United States. Female sage-grouse exhibited intricate habitat selection patterns that varied across regional gradients of ecological productivity among sagebrush communities, but often selected nest sites that disproportionately resulted in nest failure. For example, 23% of nests occurred in wildfire-affected habitats characterized by reduced sagebrush cover and greater composition of invasive annual grasses. We found survival of nests was negatively associated with wildfire-affected areas, but positively associated with higher elevations with increased ruggedness and overall shrub cover. Strong site fidelity likely drove sage-grouse to continue nesting in habitats degraded by wildfire. Hence, increasing frequency and extent of wildfire may contribute disproportionately to reduced reproductive success by creating ecological traps that act as population sinks. Identifying such habitat mismatches between selection and survival facilitates deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving reduced geographic niche space and population decline at broad spatiotemporal scales, while guiding management actions to areas that would be most beneficial to the species.

AB  - This study presents the results and interpretations of biological (floral and faunal) and geochemical (isotopic and chemical element composition) investigations of the Late Glacial and Holocene sediment accumulated in the Kaniewo palaeolake. These data allowed us to determine the indicators of environmental changes in this lake ecosystem, such as zooplankton and vegetation development, trophic state, water temperature, and water level. We documented the three cold periods (Oldest, Older, and Younger Dryas) separated by two warm periods (Bolling, Allerod). Additionally, we found traces of cold oscillations within the Allerod, lasting approximately 150 years, probably the Intra-Allerod-Gerzensee oscillation, recorded in western and southern Europe. Our data show that sediment accumulation began at the end of the Oldest Dryas period before ca. 13,900 yr cal BP. The top of the studied sediments represented the transition from the Late Glacial to the early Holocene (Preboreal period, ca.10,500 yr cal BP). The lithology of the sediments changed from silty sands at the bottom, then calcareous detritus gyttja partially interbedded by lake marl to peat at the top. Organic matter occurring in the deposits reflects algae and terrestrial sources. In the cold periods, small number of both Cladocera individuals and species (e.g. Bosmina (E.) longispina, Chydorus sphaericus, Alona affinis), corroborate the unfavourable conditions for the development of zooplankton. Cladocera species indicated the initial oligotrophic status of the lake and the subsequent increase in trophic status. Plant and animal macrofossils indicate initial shallow lake ecosystem. Chara meadow developed at the bottom of the lake with a belt of vascular plants (Carex sp., Hippuris vulgaris, Scirpus sp.) in the littoral zone of the lake. Rich shallow vegetation was accompanied by animals, such as Mollusca (e.g. Valvata piscinalis, Pisidium obtusale, Bithynia tentaculata) and Oribatidae sp., Cristatella mucedo, and Plumatella type.

AB  - Modern conservationists call for long term genetic monitoring datasets to evaluate and understand the impact of human activities on natural ecosystems and species on a global but also local scale. However, long-term monitoring datasets are still rare but in high demand to correctly identify, evaluate and respond to environmental changes. In the presented study, a population of the riverine dragonfly, Orthetrum coerulescens (Odonata: Libellulidae), was monitored over a time period from 1989 to 2013. Study site was an artificial irrigation ditch in one of the last European stone steppes and "nature heritage", the Crau in Southern France. This artificial riverine habitat has an unusual high diversity of odonate species, prominent indicators for evaluating freshwater habitats. A clearing of the canal and destruction of the bank vegetation in 1996 was assumed to have great negative impact on the odonate larval and adult populations. Two mitochondrial markers (CO1 & ND1) and a panel of nuclear microsatellite loci were used to assess the genetic diversity. Over time they revealed a dramatic decline in diversity parameters between the years 2004 and 2007, however not between 1996 and 1997. From 2007 onwards the population shows a stabilizing trend but has not reached the amount of genetic variation found at the beginning of this survey. This decline cannot be referred to the clearing of the canal or any other direct anthropogenic impact. Instead, it is most likely that the populations decay was due to by extreme weather conditions during the specific years. A severe drought was recorded for the summer months of these years, leading to reduced water levels in the canal causing also other water parameters to change, and therefore impacting temperature sensitive riverine habitat specialists like the O. coerulescens in a significant way. The data provide important insights into population genetic dynamics and metrics not always congruent with traditional monitoring data (e.g. abundance); a fact that should be regarded with caution when management plans for developed landscapes are designed.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are constantly being threatened by contaminants produced by human activities. There is an urge to better understand their impacts on marine organisms and develop reliable tools for biomonitoring studies, while also assessing their potential impacts on human health. Given their position on top of food webs, sharks are particularly susceptible to bioaccumulation, making them potential sentinel species of marine contamination. The main objective of this study was to find suitable biomarkers for future marine pollution biomonitoring studies by correlating biochemical responses with tissue contaminant body burden in blue sharks (Prionace glauca), a species heavily caught and consumed by humans, while also addressing their general health. The chemical contaminants analysed comprised different persistent organic pollutants (POPS) families from polychlorinated compounds to brominaled flame retardants (BERN) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and different trace and heavy metals. Concentrations of some contaminants in sharks' tissues were found to be above the legally allowed limits for human consumption. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed and some strong associations were found between biochemical responses and contaminants' accumulation levels. DNA damage and lipid peroxidation levels, as well as the inhibition of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, were the main effects and consequences of contamination. The impact of contamination on these vital macromolecules underlines the suboptimal conditions of the sampled P. glauca, which can ultimately lead to the degradation of core ecological aspects, such as swimming, feeding, and reproduction. It can be concluded that P. glauca demonstrates great potential to be used as environmental sentinel and suitable biomarker candidates were identified in this work. Moreover, this study also highlights the risks that the consumption of blue shark derived products can pose to human health, which is of upmost interest as the sampled organisms were still juveniles and already presented values above regulatory limits.

AB  - Understanding the evolution of scleractinian corals on geological timescales is key to predict how modern reef ecosystems will react to changing environmental conditions in the future. Important to such efforts has been the development of several skeleton-based criteria to distinguish between the two major ecological groups of scleractinians: zooxanthellates, which live in symbiosis with dinoflagellate algae, and azooxanthellates, which lack endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. Existing criteria are based on overall skeletal morphology and bio/geo-chemical indicators-none of them being particularly robust. Here we explore another skeletal feature, namely fine-scale growth banding, which differs between these two groups of corals. Using various ultra-structural imaging techniques (e.g., TEM, SEM, and NanoSIMS) we have characterized skeletal growth increments, composed of doublets of optically light and dark bands, in a broad selection of extant symbiotic and asymbiotic corals. Skeletons of zooxanthellate corals are characterized by regular growth banding, whereas in skeletons of azooxanthellate corals the growth banding is irregular. Importantly, the regularity of growth bands can be easily quantified with a coefficient of variation obtained by measuring bandwidths on SEM images of polished and etched skeletal surfaces of septa and/or walls. We find that this coefficient of variation (lower values indicate higher regularity) ranges from similar to 40 to similar to 90% in azooxanthellate corals and from similar to 5 to similar to 15% in symbiotic species. With more than 90% (28 out of 31) of the studied corals conforming to this microstructural criterion, it represents an easy and robust method to discriminate between zooxanthellate and azooxanthellate corals. This microstructural criterion has been applied to the exceptionally preserved skeleton of the Triassic (Norian, ca. 215 Ma) scleractinian Volzeia sp., which contains the first example of regular, fine-scale banding of thickening deposits in a fossil coral of this age. The regularity of its growth banding strongly suggests that the coral was symbiotic with zooxanthellates.

Three soil uses were evaluated: 1-Fifty year old naturalized grasslands, low use intensity; 2-Recent agricultural fields, intermediate use intensity, and 3-Fifty year old intensive agricultural fields, high use intensity. Three different sites for each soil use were evaluated from winter 2008 through summer 2011. Nine earthworm species were identified across all sampling sites. The sites shared five species: the native Microscolex dubius, and the introduced Aporrectodea caliginosa, A. rosea, Octalasion cyaneum, and O. lacteum, but they differed in relative abundance by soil use. The results show that the earthworm community structure is linked to and modulated by soil properties. Both species abundance and diversity showed significant differences depending on soil use intensity. A principal component analysis showed that species composition is closely related to the environmental variability. The ratio of native to exotic species was significantly lower in the intensive agricultural system when compared to the other two, lower disturbance systems. Microscolex dubius abundance was related to naturalized grasslands along with soil Ca, pH, mechanical resistance, and microbial respiration. Aporrectodea caliginosa abundance was related to high K levels, low enzymatic activity, slightly low pH, low Ca, and appeared related to the highly disturbed environment. Eukerria stagnalis and Aporrectodea rosea, commonly found in the recent agricultural system, were related to high soil moisture condition, low pH, low Ca and low enzymatic activity. These results show that earthworm assemblages can be good indicators of soil use intensities. In particular, Microscolex dubius, Aporrectodea caliginosa, and Aporrectodea rosea, showed different temporal patterns and species associations, due to the changes in soil properties attributable to soil use intensity, defined as the amount and type of agricultural operations.

AB  - A structurally dynamic model (STDM) based on nutrient cycling within the food web was developed for Baiyangdian Lake in North China. The model was calibrated and validated based on the data of four types of water areas with different ecological conditions. Moreover, the model combined with ecosystem health assessment was applied to predict the state of health of Baiyangdian Lake's water areas. The indicators used for ecosystem health characterization included phytoplankton biomass, ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass, eco-exergy and structural eco-exergy. The results indicated that the health states of the four types of water areas had relatively intense responses to the changes of the nitrogen loading and meanwhile there were discrepancies found in the health state responses to the changes of nutrient loadings between the four types of water areas. Water area A with relatively good health state showed a certain degree of resistance to the changes of nutrient loadings. For water area B, the health state had further degraded when the nutrient loadings were increased or reduced to some extent and only improved following the great decline in nutrient loadings. The health state of water area C had degraded and improved following the increase and decrease in nutrient loadings, respectively. For water area D, the health state had degraded to some extent when the nutrient loading was increased and improved a little at relatively low loading level. Furthermore, based on the prognosis results under different scenarios, suggestions for improving the health states of impaired water areas in Baiyangdian Lake were presented as guidelines for lake restoration and management in this specific region. The STDM established could reasonably reflect the health state responses of different water areas to the changes of forcing functions and the results from the prognoses laid the quantitative foundation for making the restoration and management plans of Baiyangdian Lake.

AB  - Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and Escherichia coli counts are important hygiene indicators and may be pathogenic. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine microbiological contamination in head meat, the esophagus, diaphragm, and boning scraps and evaluate the hygienic conditions of the processing of these products. The Petrifilm (R) (3M) method for determining Enterobacteriaceae, total coliforms, and E. coli was applied for 104 samples. APHA, European Union, PAHO/WHO, and Brazil/MAPA recommendations were followed. Bleeding and skinning knives were contaminated with E. coli (61.5%). Regarding the meat cuts, 30.76% samples from head meat, the esophagus and the boning flap showed the presence of E. coli in counts up to 2 log CFU/g, while 15.3% of the diaphragm samples showed up to 1.85 log CFU/g. The analyzed comminuted meat was, therefore, shown to be contaminated with E. coli during processing, indicating that endproducts from this raw material can offer biological risks.

AB  - Based on the concept of the new drought index called Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI) using data-mining technology, an Integrated Surface Drought Index (ISDI) was established in this study. ISDI improved the original model, adding remote sensed temperature information into the input factors. This index attempt to describe drought from a more comprehensive perspective, the integrated information including: traditional meteorological data, satellite-derived earth surface water and heat environments, vegetation conditions, and inherent properties of the earth's surface. The Cross-validation results indicated that ISDI construction models for three phases of growth season have very high regression accuracy. The practical application of ISDI in mid-eastern China during the reported dry year 2009 also demonstrated that it can provide accurate and detailed drought condition both at regional and local scale. This investigation showed that ISDI has good application potential for drought monitoring across China.

AB  - This paper proposes a simple and fast method for static voltage security assessment utilizing indices based on the system Jacobian and its inverse. The list of critical contingencies is dynamic in nature therefore a combination of a screening and ranking neural network is employed to filter out the non-critical contingencies, and rank the critical ones, on-line, under randomly changing loading conditions. Weak buses of the system are also identified and ranked in order of their sensitivity to voltage collapse. A novel feature selection method, which exploits the coherency existing between load buses with respect to voltage dynamics, is used to reduce the dimension and training time of neural network. The proposed method has been tested on IEEE 30-bus test system and a practical 75-bus Indian system and is found to produce accurate results for previously unseen operating conditions almost instantaneously.

AB  - The structural and functional diversity of nematode communities from Pinus mugo sites in Pirin Mountain was assessed. The sampling plots represent different levels of disturbance - next to and outside ski runs. Nematode assemblages from this habitat can be characterised with high diversity (in total, 104 taxa and richness ranging from 41 to 65 genera per site). In general, the trophic structure was dominated by omnivorous and bacterial feeders coupled with low proportion of plant feeding nematodes. The high values of Maturity indices and the results from faunal analysis indicate relatively stable environment and undisturbed conditions for all sites. No clear correlation between the nematode assemblages' characteristics and the level of disturbance (position of the site in relation to ski runs) was revealed.

AB  - Atmospheric pollution due to emissions of harmful gases from different sources is one of modern society's critical problems. Resolving the consequences of air-pollutants is part of the risk management process aimed at monitoring the crisis, restoration and remediation of the environment, returning to its original state, and removing the risk of a re-emergence of accidents. The need for environmental risk assessment emerged due to increased awareness of the necessity for environmental protection. Modeling air polluter dispersion processes is an essential mathematical tool for exploring pollution's impact on the natural environment. This work describes an analytical and numerical solution to the two-dimensional transport equation of turbulent diffusion in a stationary state. We present a software-based visualization of a numerical model of the harmful gas concentration distribution, depending on weather conditions, terrain configuration, and urbanization.

AB  - Regarding migration changes between Mexico and the USA, this study focuses on the increase and diversification of migration between Chiapas and the USA during the period 2000-2007. This paper argues that not only economic conditions are the explanation to these migrations but also, in certain regions, political processes and impacts of natural disasters were important drivers for migration - a combination of causes in the context of migration-. Based on different sources (indicators of migration intensity, index on the remittance reception, migratory censuses, demographic surveys, quantitative and qualitative migratory studies), the increase in migration is shown at a state and regional level. Furthermore, the increase of migration in certain regions is assessed in relation with its causes (social, environmental, political and economical) showing that, migrations are multi-causal processes spatially differentiated on the basis of the migrants' place of origin.

AB  - Sustainability research in the macromarketing literature has been largely limited to exploring sociocultural values and norms, business practices, public policies, and economic conditions. Although the concept of 'values' constantly recurs in the literature, religious perspectives have received little attention. By presenting an alternative interpretation of what have traditionally been construed as anthropocentric religions, this study highlights the underutilized potential of religions as effective vehicles for initiating cultural transformation towards sustainability. The article calls for contextualized approaches to ecological sustainability that take into account the values and worldviews of target communities, which are often shaped by religious systems. The article concludes that including religions in the sustainability discourse can benefit macromarketing theory and practice in a variety of ways.

AB  - A major aspect of the analysis of biological remains from many archaeological sites is recognizing past activities and ecological conditions at the context or feature level in order to build up an overall picture of site usage and development. This demands investigation of very large numbers of samples, which, if carried out fully, may be prohibitively expensive. It is suggested that characteristic and easily recognized suites of organisms preserved in archaeological deposits form ''indicator groups'' associated with particular activities or circumstances in the past, and that these, in turn, may be seen as part of ''indicator packages'' encompassing biological, stratigraphical, artefactural, and structural evidence. Indicator groups may provide a means of obtaining archaeological information economically. This proposition is illustrated with particular reference to stable manure, a frequent component of Roman-modern occupation deposits. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - Ostracoda (bivalved Crustacea) comprise a significant part of the benthic meiofauna in the Pacific-Arctic region, including more than 50 species, many with identifiable ecological tolerances. These species hold potential as useful indicators of past and future ecosystem changes. In this study, we examined benthic ostracodes from nearly 300 surface sediment samples, >34,000 specimens, from three regions-the northern Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas-to establish species' ecology and distribution. Samples were collected during various sampling programs from 1970 through 2018 on the continental shelves at 20 to similar to 100m water depth. Ordination analyses using species' relative frequencies identified six species, Normanicythere leioderma, Sarsicytheridea bradii, Paracyprideis pseudopunctillata, Semicytherura complanata, Schizocythere ikeyai, and Munseyella mananensis, as having diagnostic habitat ranges in bottom water temperatures, salinities, sediment substrates and/or food sources. Species relative abundances and distributions can be used to infer past bottom environmental conditions in sediment archives for paleo-reconstructions and to characterize potential changes in Pacific-Arctic ecosystems in future sampling studies. Statistical analyses further showed ostracode assemblages grouped by the summer water masses influencing the area. Offshore-to-nearshore transects of samples across different water masses showed that complex water mass characteristics, such as bottom temperature, productivity, as well as sediment texture, influenced the relative frequencies of ostracode species over small spatial scales. On the larger biogeographic scale, synoptic ordination analyses showed dominant species-N. leioderma (Bering Sea), P. pseudopunctillata (offshore Chukchi and Beaufort Seas), and S. bradii (all regions)-remained fairly constant over recent decades. However, during 2013-2018, northern Pacific species M. mananensis and S. ikeyai increased in abundance by small but significant proportions in the Chukchi Sea region compared to earlier years. It is yet unclear if these assemblage changes signify a meiofaunal response to changing water mass properties and if this trend will continue in the future. Our new ecological data on ostracode species and biogeography suggest these hypotheses can be tested with future benthic monitoring efforts.

AB  - Mobile Bay, the fourth largest estuary in the USA located in the northern Gulf of Mexico, is known for extreme hypoxia in the water column during dry season caused by NH4+-rich and anoxic submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Nutrient dynamics in the coastal ecosystem point to potentially elevated microbial activities; however, little is known about microbial community composition and their functional roles in this area. In this study, we investigated microbial community composition, distribution, and metabolic prediction along the coastal hydrological compartment of Mobile Bay using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We collected microbial samples from surface (river and bay water) and subsurface water (groundwater and coastal pore water from two SGD sites with peat and sandy lithology, respectively). Salinity was identified as the primary factor affecting the distribution of microbial communities across surface water samples, while DON and PO(4)(3-)were the major predictor of community shift within subsurface water samples. Higher microbial diversity was found in coastal pore water in comparison to surface water samples.Gammaproteobacteria,Bacteroidia, andOxyphotobacteriadominated the bacterial community. Among the archaea, methanogens were prevalent in the peat-dominated SGD site, while the sandy SGD site was characterized by a higher proportion of ammonia-oxidizing archaea.Cyanobium PCC-6307and unclassifiedThermodesulfovibrioniawere identified as dominant taxa strongly associated with trends in environmental parameters in surface and subsurface samples, respectively. Microbial communities found in the groundwater and peat layer consisted of taxa known for denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). This finding suggested that microbial communities might also play a significant role in mediating nitrogen transformation in the SGD flow path and in affecting the chemical composition of SGD discharging to the water column. Given the ecological importance of microorganisms, further studies at higher taxonomic and functional resolution are needed to accurately predict chemical biotransformation processes along the coastal hydrological continuum, which influence water quality and environmental condition in Mobile Bay.

AB  - The current understanding of how ecosystem services flow affects human well-being is not sufficient. As an important component of the biogeochemical cycle, carbon flows through various natural and artificial processes. Therefore, carbon can be used as a research vector to explore the relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being. This study proposed a method for a quantitative assessment of "ecosystem services-human well-being" based on carbon flows. The assessment of the changes in ecosystem services and human well-being based on carbon in the Manas River Basin from 1990 to 2015 revealed the complex relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being. The results were as follows: (1) The development of ecosystem services was uneven, with increasing provisioning services and decreasing regulating, supporting and cultural services. (2) The basic materials for a good life and health in human well-being showed an upward trend, and the security indicator showed a downward trend. (3) The indicators of the basic materials for a good life and health were significantly positively correlated with provisioning services and were significantly negatively correlated with the other three services. Moreover, the internal structure of the security and health indicators were malformed. (4) Over time, the impact of provisioning services on the well-being indicators has gradually weakened, and the influence of regulating, supporting and cultural services has continually increased. In general, this study evaluated the complex relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being through carbon flow quantification, which can not only unify the dimensions for comparison, but also eliminate the impact of subjective factors to achieve a scientific nature. It is not only helpful to provide theoretical and practical basis for scientific management of Manas River Basin, but also to explore a larger scale and a wider area in the world through selecting indicators according to local conditions.

AB  - With a view to conducting a comprehensive assessment of pollution of the water bodies within the Lake Baikal drainage basin using dimensionless indicators of the water chemical composition, the problems of identifying and testing the indicators were dealt with, which are necessary for determining the sources and levels of pollution and assessing the contributions of the tributaries to lake pollution and the self-cleaning ability of the waters. The methodology of geoecological monitoring as suggested by these authors is based on identifying correlations between polluters and environmental sites by examining technogenic material of from the sites as mixtures, and material from the sources as their components. Identification of the spatio-temporal structure of pollution involves analyzing the landscape organization of the lake drainage basin and the distribution patterns of pollutants. Substantiation of the observation and monitoring network, extrapolation of monitoring results and display of real-time data used landscape mapping methods. An analysis was made of the landscape and geochemical differentiation of the Lake Baikal drainage basin, and the unified indicators of water composition relating water pollution to natural conditions were ranked. The study revealed areas of geosystems with different rates of organic matter decomposition, i. e. the water areas of the lake with a different self-cleaning ability of the waters, and the areas of the drainage basin, the soils of which are responsible for the formation of waters of different types. The resulting contours were generalized in accordance with the scale of the map for the spatial differentiation of biogeochemical parameters of the landscape organization of the drainage basin. The highest decomposition rate of organic matter is characteristic for taiga dark-coniferous geosystems of optimal development, submontane and intermontane depressions and valleys of Khamar-Daban Range, and the lowest rate is typical for goletz and subgoletz geosystems as well as for taiga forests along the western coast of Lake Baikal.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a leading contaminant across U.S. water bodies, warranting concern for wildlife species that depend upon food from aquatic systems. The risk of Hg toxicity to large herbivores is little understood, even though some large herbivores consume aquatic vascular plants (macrophytes) that may hyper-accumulate Hg. We investigated whether total Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) in aquatic forage may be of concern to moose (Alces alces) and beaver (Castor canadensis) by measuring total Hg and MeHg concentrations, calculating sediment-water bioconcentration factors for macrophyte species these herbivores consume, and estimating herbivore daily Hg consumption. Abiotic factors impacting macrophyte Hg were assessed, as was the difference in Hg concentrations of macrophytes from glacial lakes and those created or expanded by beaver damming. The amount of aquatic-derived Hg that moose move from aquatic to terrestrial systems was calculated, in order to investigate the potential for movement of Hg across ecosystem compartments by large herbivores. Results indicate that the Hg exposure of generalist herbivores may be affected by macrophyte community composition more so than by many abiotic factors in the aquatic environment. Mercury concentrations varied greatly between macrophyte species, with relatively high concentrations in Utricularia vulgaris (>80 ng g(-1) in some sites), and negligible concentrations in Nuphar variegata (similar to 6 ng g(-1)). Macrophyte total Hg concentration was correlated with water pH in predictable ways, but not with other variables generally associated with aquatic Hg concentrations, such as dissolved organic carbon. Moose estimated daily consumption of MeHg is equivalent to or below human reference levels, and far below wildlife reference levels. However, estimated beaver Hg consumption exceeds reference doses for humans, indicating the potential for sub-lethal nervous impairment. In regions of high moose density, moose may be ecologically important vectors that transfer Hg from aquatic to surrounding terrestrial systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on a review of available models for ecological risk estimation, most are site-specific and their applications are limited. However, general models, which can be easily adapted to other sites, remain few, in addition, they are simple and associated with significant uncertainties. In this paper, an approach is introduced for an ecological risk assessment ( ERA) model that can be modified for site-specific conditions. Using computer simulation as a screening tool for ecological risk assessment can assist environmental managers and policy decision-makers in the planning and implementation of potentially highly focused assessments and remediation, should the ERA dictate the need. The model was integrated with a Windows-based interface and interactive database management system (DBMS) as a user-friendly software package. In addition, based on trophic sources, a food web has been integrated into the framework of the DBMS. In an effort to evaluate the model, a case study was implemented to characterize the effects on an ecosystem of replacing electroplated chromium coatings with sputtered tantalum at U. S. Army Yuma and Aberdeen Proving Grounds. Potential exposure pathways included ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption for terrestrial animals; root and foliar uptake for plants; and direct absorption for aquatic species. Overall, results showed that the most significant exposure resulted from molybdenum and hexavalent chromium, which posed higher risks to select aquatic and terrestrial species at both sites. On the other hand, tantalum ( with vanadium as the surrogate) resulted in the least risk to all receptors within the studied areas. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that soil-water distribution coefficients have a significant impact on the results. Based on the results, neither molybdenum nor chromium are recommended as a coating in gun barrels, and further study would be essential to address any affected firing range area. Tantalum is recommended for use, although for those species receiving a slight adverse risk, field investigations that include receptor sampling maybe necessary once soil/sediment and water sampling validates projected concentrations.

AB  - Changes in macrobenthic communities were studied over a 3.5 yr period following restoration activities in Alewife Cove, a small estuary located in southeastern Connecticut, U.S. Development around this estuary had resulted in reduced freshwater and tidal inflows, loss of critical habitats such as salt marshes, and eutrophication. Early in 1988, the lower reach of the estuary was dredged to increase tidal flushing and enhance environmental quality. Following dredging, tidal range within the Cove increased from 52 to 83 cm. Due to erosion within the Cove's lower channel and sediment migration into the Cove, tidal flows and ranges approached pre-dredge levels by 1991. Despite these changes, the percentage of silt/clay in the surface sediments in the middle and upper basins of the Cove declined by 30-45% over the study period. Changes in infaunal community structure in the lower reach following dredging were not great, primarily comprising shifts in the relative abundances of species typical of sandier versus muddier sediments. Directional changes in community structure were most evident in the middle and upper basins, away from the dredged area. Infaunal species richness increased significantly, with many species previously found only in the sand habitats of the lower reach establishing populations in the middle and upper basins. There was a significant decrease in the summer abundances of the pollution indicator polychaete Capitella capitata throughout much of the middle and upper basins. Restoration efforts in Alewife Cove centering on altered hydrology resulted in selected positive changes, increases in tidal flow altered environmental conditions in the middle and upper basins where shifts in infaunal community structure indicated decreases in organic loading of sediments over 2-3 yr. Continued changes in the physical dynamics of the lower reach reduced tidal flow, arresting the positive ecological changes that were beginning to occur. This type of restoration approach of small estuaries can have positive results, but there may be a lag in the ecological response of the system. Macrobenthic communities, in particular summer abundance patterns of selected species, provided an integrated assessment of ecological changes in the Cove.

AB  - In this research, a technical-economic analysis of two possible alternatives for the recovery of wastewater in the sand washing process is carried out, taking as a case study a plant in the province of Cienfuegos, Cuba. The Hand's method was used to estimate the required investment, and the Net Present Value, the Discounted Cash Flow Rate of Return and the Payback Period were analyzed as profitability indicators. The uncertainty of the results was considered from a Monte Carlo analysis. It was found that for local conditions the introduction of centrifugal classification is economically attractive conditioned by an increase in productivity and savings in energy carriers. On the other hand, the recovery of water from sewage sludge by filtration is not economically feasible. In this way, it was demonstrated that with the introduction of cleaner production practices, the analyzed system can be improved, achieving a more rational use of natural resources without giving up potential economic benefits.

AB  - Grain quality is considered an important indicator of the level of development of grain production in any country. Thus, as a result of analyzing the technological indicators of grain quality, we can summarize that in different meteorological conditions, winter rye forms grains of class 3-4 quality, winter wheat and winter triticale - class 3. Dry development and ripening of the grain (HTC less than 1) ensures grain better in nature and vitreousness compared to over moistened years, but does not affect its classiness. The quality of the grain depends on the correct choice of the sowing time of winter crops. In the present study, the experiments were laid out according to generally accepted methods. To determine the technological qualities of grain, samples of the harvest of 2015 and 2016 were taken. Analyses were carried out in the testing laboratory of Perm Agro Service LLC.

AB  - Small lakes, being less stable systems as compared to large lakes, are sensitive to climate variations and are characterized by high sedimentation rates, and thus, they represent important archives of paleoenvironmental information. Lipid biomarkers in bottom sediments provide data on the environmental conditions in and around lakes and can be used as additional indirect indicators for paleoreconstruction of lake sedimentogenesis. The distribution of lipid biomarkers in sediments of Gusinoe Lake was determined for the first time using gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass-spectrometry. The main lipid biomarkers of the terrestrial (long-chain fatty acids, alcohols, dicarboxylic acids, and beta-sitosterol) and aquatic (short-chain fatty acids, hydroxy acids, etc.) origins of organic matter were revealed. The distribution of the carbon preference index (CPI) in the core of bottom sediments of Gusinoe Lake testifies to the transition from cold and dry (lower core layers) to warm and humid climatic conditions.

AB  - The influence of primary kaolin moisture on the duration of bucket unloading is proven, and the analytical dependence for the estimation of this ratio in the form of a second-degree polynomial is obtained. Three main technological schemes for different technological conditions substantiate the procedure for evaluating the productivity of the primary kaolin excavation for cases of selective development of curvilinear sections on the basis of the first proposed technological coefficient of the contact form, which takes into account the fractal nature of the section's shape, are suggested in the article. It is first proposed to include the specific time of shifting in the working cycle of backhoe type excavators. The mathematical models of the primary kaolin excavation process on the curved face of the conditioned area with a backhoe type excavator for different varieties of the mutual arrangement of the hydraulic excavator and the hauler are developed.

AB  - Enzyme activity is a sensitive indicator of fertility, metabolic processes and circulation of matter as well as soil environment processes and circulation of matter as well as soil environment contamination. Dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.1) are the kind of enzymes belonging to oxidoreductases class, which catalyzes oxidation and reduction reaction. Their activity give information on soil microflora oxidative activity and intensive matabolism of soil microorganisms. Heavy metals, PAH's or pesticides decrease the soil dehydrogenase activity. Glyphosate is the most common herbicide used worldwide and as other pesticides is toxic for living organisms. The aim of the study was to determinate dehydrogenase activity (DHA) in the soils enriched with glyphosate (1 mu g and 10 mu g g(-1) of pesticide doses) during time (42 days), under laboratory conditions at temperature 20 degrees C. The decrease of DHA activity was observed that depended on the pesticide dose.

KW  - REGION
AB  - While tropical multistrata home gardens (or tree home gardens) are classically said to be sound, efficient and sustainable land-use systems, there is little quantitative evidence and detailed analysis of home gardens in the literature to support this. In order to strengthen the basis of this assumption and to contribute to an operational understanding of sustainability, a literature review was applied to home gardens, covering different bio-physical and socio-economic conditions. For this, a series of sustainability descriptors were identified, hypotheses formulated on what should be the effect of home gardens on these descriptors, and possible indicators confirming the hypotheses mentioned, when found in the literature.
   Home gardens possess a number of sustainability attributes, with regard not only to their ability to meet a number of farmers' needs without negatively affecting the resource base, and in many cases even improving it, but also to their potential to meet several economic, social, ecological and institutional conditions which contribute to their sustainability.

LA  - German
AB  - The Federal Veterinarian Regulation and Animal Welfare Law of Germany require the prevention of animal suffering. Suffering, as well as all other conditions which animals should be protected against (e. g. pain, fear) are sensations not provable as such. Therefore, indicators originating from the animal's behavior must frequently be relied upon. Due to analogous conditions of man and mammal, it seems to be permissible to draw conclusions regarding animal protections relevance, in particular from that of behavior. To deal with it in such a manner, however, one requires a good knowledge of the species of animal involved and relevant training in ethological matters. The latter does not yet seem to be adequately guaranteed in agricultural science and veterinary medicine. If animals are actually to be accepted as fellow creatures (sectional sign 1 of the Animal Welfare Law), if accommodation suitable to its behavior and the safeguarding of the particular animals mobility needs are terms taken seriously, then these concepts exclude many of the intensive animal keeping systems still common today.

AB  - Smoking, alcohol consumption and diet were among the criteria selected to screen health status among the residents of the urban migrant council-built hostels of Langa, Nyanga and Guguletu outside Cape Town.  Smoking patterns fell within the range found elsewhere.  Problems associated with alcohol consumption were exacerbated by the overcrowded hostel living conditions.  Dietary patterns were not examined against the concept of an 'ideal diet'.  They are understood in the context of the poverty of the hostel dwellers and in the context of limited space available in the hostel environment for cooking and storage.  In comparison with a home-based migrant population, the urban migrant hostel dwellers eat more frequently, more regularly and have more variety in their diet.  In the light of the findings on the lifestyle indicators of the hostel dwellers, it is concluded that improved living conditions, rather than health education that focuses on individual behaviour, will have a greater impact on improvements in their health status.

AB  - Intensive aquaculture is an important source of organic waste and antibiotics into the marine environment. Yet, their impacts on benthic marine ecosystems are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the ecological impacts of fish feed waste alone and in combination with three different antibiotics (i.e., oxytetracycline, florfenicol and flumequine) in benthic ecosystems of the Mediterranean Sea by performing a field experiment. We assessed the fate of the antibiotics in the sediment and their accumulation in wild fauna after two weeks of exposure. Moreover, we investigated the impact of the feed waste alone and in combination with the antibiotics on sediment physico-chemical properties, on benthic invertebrates, as well as on the microbiota and resistome of the sampled sediments. One week after the last antibiotic application, average oxytetracycline and flumequine concentrations in the sediment were <1% and 15% of the applied dose, respectively, while florfenicol was not detected. Flumequine concentrations in wild invertebrates reached 3 mu g g(-1), while concentrations of oxytetracycline were about an order of magnitude lower, and florfenicol was not detected. Feed waste, with and without antibiotics, increased the concentration of fine particulate matter, affected the pH and redox conditions, and significantly reduced the biodiversity and abundance of benthic invertebrates. Feed waste also had a significant influence on the structure of sediment microbial communities, while specific effects related to the different antibiotics ranged from insignificant to mild. The presence of antibiotics significantly influenced the normalized abundance of the measured antibiotic resistance genes. Florfenicol and oxytetracycline contributed to an increase of genes conferring resistance to macrolides, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol, while flumequine had a less clear impact on the sediment resistome. This study demonstrates that feed waste from aquaculture farms can rapidly alter the habitat and biodiversity of Mediterranean benthic ecosystems, while an-tibiotic residual concentrations can contribute to the enrichment of bacterial genes resistant to antibiotic classes that are of high relevance for human medicine.

AB  - In recent years, reports of plastic debris in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of fish have been well documented in the scientific literature. This, in turn, increased concerns regarding human health exposure to microplastics through the consumption of contaminated fish. Most of the available research regarding microplastic toxicity has focused on marine organisms through direct feeding or waterborne exposures at the individual level. However, little is known about the trophic transfer of microplastics through the aquatic food chain. Freshwater zooplankton Daphnia magna (hereafter Daphnia), and the fathead minnow Pimephales promelas (FHM), are well-known model species used in standard toxicological studies and ecological risk assessments that provide a simple model for trophic transfer. The aim of this study was to assess the tissue translocation, trophic transfer, and depuration of two concentrations (20 and 2000-part ml(-1)) of 6 mu m polystyrene (PS) microplastics particles between Daphnia and FHM. Bioconcentration factors (BCF) and bioaccumulation factors (BAF) were determined. Fluorescent microscopy was used to determine the number of particles in the water media and within the organs of both species. Throughout the five days of exposure, PS particles were only found within the GI tract of both species. The BCF for Daphnia was 0.034 +/- 0.005 for the low concentration and 0.026 +/- 0.006 for the high concentration. The BAF for FHM was 0.094 +/- 0.037 for the low concentration and 0.205 +/- 0.051 for the high concentration. Between 72 and 96 h after exposure all microplastic particles were depurated from both species. The presence of food had a significant effect on the depuration of microplastic particles from Daphnia but not for FHM. Based on the low BCF and BAF values for both species, rapid depuration rates, and null translocation of microplastic particles to organs and tissues from the GI tract, there is a low probability that microplastics will bioconcentrate and bioaccumulate under environmental conditions.

AB  - Sclerochronology provides an important and widely used tool to examine annual environmental patterns in marine systems, but few similar tools have been developed to establish ecological indicators in freshwaters on a seasonal scale. Previous work using marine mussels as ecological indicators have practiced shell ashing, acetate peels, and thin sectioning, all of which destroy the specimens. We studied the external annual rings of three freshwater mussel species with clear annual bands from the River Medway, UK, in order to non-invasively investigate the relationship between banding patterns, growth parameters, location, and seasonal water temperatures. We tested the accuracy and precision of this method through repetition of measurements and the reproduction of results through separate agers. Overall, mussels living downstream had higher length-at-age curves, asymptotic lengths (L-infinity), and growth constants (k) than those living upstream. In Unio pictorum and Unio tumidus, there was a negative relationship between asymptotic lengths and growth constants, indicating that larger asymptotic lengths took more time to reach. Unio tumidus had the highest asymptotic lengths and the lowest growth constants across sites while Unio pictorum had the lowest asymptotic lengths and the highest growth constants across sites. Anodonta anatina showed simultaneously increasing asymptotic lengths with increasing growth constants and had the highest overall lengths of all three species. Summer water temperatures had the largest positive effect on annual growth, followed by spring and winter water temperatures, while autumnal temperatures had a negative impact on growth. The findings of this study suggest that through their annual banding, freshwater mussels can be used as tools to document historical water temperatures, especially in the warmer months of spring and summer, and can therefore serve as powerful indicators of spatial and temporal patterns in water temperature. Such tools can help infer palaeoclimatic conditions from fossil and subfossil shells, establish baselines for understanding future climatic change, and support conservation efforts aimed at protecting temperature-sensitive taxa.

AB  - The distribution and reproductive traits of copepods of the genus Clausocalanus were investigated during the Atlantic Meridional Transect cruise AMT-15, in September-October 2004 to estimate their ecological niches and secondary production in the epipelagic layer along a latitudinal cline (48 degrees N-40 degrees S). The distribution patterns of selected environmental parameters, i.e., temperature, salinity and chlorophyll a concentration, enabled eco-provinces to be identified as described by Longhurst (2006). Clausocalanus represented on average 34% of total copepod abundance, with a large predominance of adult females and copepodites over males. Among the eleven Clausocalanus species found during the survey, eight species showed a wide distributional range, i.e.,C paululus, C. pergens, C furcatus, C. arcuicomis, C jobei, C. parapergens, C. lividus, and C mastigophorus, while C. ingens, C. brevipes, and C laticeps were recorded only in the South Atlantic. The smallest C. furcatus, C. paululus, and C pergens together accounted for 85% of total Clausocalanus adult abundance. The ecological niches were clearly separated among congeners of similar size and largely overlapped in congeners whose size differed. The small-and medium-sized species, which are egg-sac-spawners, had smaller clutch size and lower egg-production rate than the larger broadcaster congeners. Nevertheless, embryo viability was lower in broadcasters, which may explain their low abundance in terms of lower recruitment. A sex ratio largely skewed toward females in all Clausocalanus species and the observation of viable eggs in successive clutches from isolated females seem to indicate that re-mating is not necessary in this genus. Broadcast-spawners showed the highest weight-specific fecundity rates in the genus but similar secondary production to sac-spawners despite the fact that they never occurred at high abundance. In light of their abundant occurrence in oceanic waters and well-defined ecological niches, Clausocalanus species may be considered as good indicators of environmental conditions and monitored in relation to changes in ecosystem structure due to climate change.

AB  - Changes in environmental and wildlife health from contaminants in tailings water on the Canadian oil sands have been well-studied; however, effects of air contaminants on wildlife health have not. A field study was conducted to assess biological costs of natural exposure to oil sands-related air emissions on birds. Nest boxes for tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) were erected at two sites; within 5 km of active oil sands mining and extraction, and >= 60 km south, at one reference site. Passive air monitors were deployed at the nest boxes to measure nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, volatile organic compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Nestlings were examined at day 9 post hatching to assess T cell function and morphometry. At day 14 post hatching, a subset of nestlings was euthanized to measure detoxification enzymes, endocrine changes, and histological alterations of immune organs. Except for ozone, all air contaminants were higher at the two oil sands sites than the reference site (up to 5-fold). Adult birds had similar reproductive performance among sites (p> 0.05). Nestlings from industrial sites showed higher hepatic ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (EROD) induction (p < 0.0001) with lower relative hepatic mass (p = 0.0001), a smaller T cell response to the phytohemagglutinin skin test (p = 0.007), and smaller bursae of Fabricius (p < 0.02); a low sample size for one site indicating lower body condition scores (p = 0.01) at day 14 warrants cautious interpretation. There were no differences among nestlings for feather corticosterone (p > 0.6), and no histological alterations in the spleen or bursa of Fabricius (p > 0.05). This is the first report examining toxicological responses in wild birds exposed to air contaminants from industrial activity in the oil sands. It is also the first time that small, individual air contaminant monitors have been used to determine local contaminant levels in ambient air around nest boxes of wild birds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Various stakeholders of California almonds have been investing efforts into mitigating pesticide impacts on human and ecosystem health. This study is the first comprehensive evaluation that examines the spatial and temporal patterns of pesticide use and associated environmental risks. The pesticide use data from 1996 to 2010 were obtained from the Pesticide Use Reporting database. The Pesticide Use Risk Evaluation indicator was employed to evaluate the pesticide environmental risks based on the pesticide properties and local environmental conditions. Analyses showed that the use intensities (UI) of insecticides (oils accounted for 86% of the total insecticide UI) and herbicides both increased from north to south; fungicides showed the opposite spatial pattern; and fumigants were used most intensively in the middle region. The UI of fungicides and herbicides significantly decreased and increased, respectively, throughout the study area. The insecticide UI significantly decreased in the north but increased in many areas in the south. In particular, the organophosphate UI significantly decreased across the study area, while the pyrethroid UI significantly increased in the south. The fumigant UI did not show a trend. The regional risk intensities of surface water (RIW), soil (RIS), and air (RIA) all increased from north to south, while the groundwater regional risk intensity (RIG) decreased from north to south. The main trends of RIW, RIG, and RIS were decreasing, while the RIA did not show a trend in any region. It's noticeable that although the herbicide UI significantly increased, the UI of high-leaching herbicides significantly decreased, which led to the significant decrease of RIG. In summary, the temporal trends of the pesticide use and risks indicate that the California almond growers are making considerable progress towards sustainable pest management via integrated pest management, but still require more efforts to curb the fast increase of herbicide use.

AB  - Microbial food webs dominate heterotrophic food webs in large rivers with bacterial metabolism being a key component of carbon processing. Thus, analysis of bacterial population dynamics is critical to understanding patterns and mechanisms of material cycling and energy fluxes in large rivers. Within the frame of the Joint Danube Survey (JDS) 2007, the longitudinal development of the natural bacterial community in the Danube in terms of bacterial numbers, morphotype composition, and heterotrophic production of the suspended and particle-attached fractions was followed at a fine spatial resolution of approximately 30 km for the first time in such a large river along a 2,600-km stretch. Twenty-one major tributaries and branches were also included. This allowed us to investigate whether bacterial standing stock and production undergo continuous, linear changes or whether discontinuities and local processes like the merging of tributaries or the potential impact of sewage input drive the bacterial population in the Danube. The presented investigation revealed surprising continuous patterns of changes of bacterial parameters along the Danube River. Despite the presence of impoundments or hydropower plants, large municipalities, and the discharge of large tributaries, most bacterial parameters (standing stock, morphotype succession, and attached bacterial production) developed gradually, indicating that mainly broad-scale drivers and not local conditions shape and control the bacterial community in the midstream of this large river. As most important broad-scale drivers, nutrients (inorganic and organic) and changes in particle concentrations were identified. These data are also in remarkable accordance with the patterns of changes of the genetic bacterial community composition, observed during the first JDS (2001) 6 years before. In contrast, bacterial activity did not follow a continuous trend and was mainly controlled by the input of sewage from large cities in the middle section, leading to a bloom of phytoplankton. The observed patterns and the comparison between the Danube, its tributaries and other large rivers worldwide indicate that the bacterial community in rivers has a powerful indicator function for estimating the ecological status of large river ecosystems once enough information has been collected at various temporal and spatial scales.

AB  - The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a widespread mathematical technique for multi-criteria decision-making analyses, deals with the structured hierarchical database models, gathered from interdisciplinary criteria for future perspective analyses in the specific sector. Viticulture microzoning and terrain selection for potential vineyards are becoming important knowledge for vine farming systems. In this study the AHP method is used to gather, structure and resolve the data of variety sorts of vine, evaluate the physical natural resources (climate, soil and relief), socioeconomic and infrastructures conditions to dissolve different environmental problems of vineyards management. GIS (Geographical Information Systems) tools allow making multi-criteria analysis and combined various data of vineyards for digital complex environmental assessment. The site selecting for a new vineyard for wine-grape or wine production is a fundamental and crucial decision as several factors have influenced on it.

AB  - Roadkill is a significant indicator in realizing the impacts of roads on adjacent ecosystems. This study undertakes a comprehensive survey of roadkills in Kinmen (Taiwan) and analyzes their causes. Two models, Traffic Flow Model and Geometric Model, combined with animal road-crossing behaviors, are used to derive survival probability. Survey results and model predictions yield similar results for moderate traffic flow and agree in bird and small mammal roadkill frequency prediction. It is found that traffic volume, adjacent landscape and road condition are the major contributing factors related to roadkills. Higher traffic volume near habitats always augments the probability of roadkill; however, roadside trees, adjacent landscapes, and road longitudinal slope also affect the probability of successful crossing by small animals, especially birds. This study also proposes measures, to be applied to future road planning and design, aimed to lower roadkill probability.

AB  - Bank filtration is a popular pre-treatment method to produce drinking water as it benefits from the natural capacity of the sediments to attenuate contaminants. Under flood conditions, bank filtration systems are known to be vulnerable to contamination, partly because flow patterns may evolve at short timescales and result in a rapid evolution of the origin and travel times of surface water in the aquifer. However, high frequency monitoring for water quality is not common practice yet, and water quality management decisions for the operation of bank filtration systems are typically based on weekly to monthly assays. The aim of this study is to illustrate how monitoring strategies of environmental tracers at flood-affected sites can be optimized and to demonstrate how tracer-based evidence can help to define adequate pumping strategies. Data acquisition spanned two intense flood events at a two-lake bank filtration site. Based on bacteriological indicators, the bank filtration system was shown to be resilient to the yearly recurring flood events but more vulnerable to contamination during the intense flood events. The origin of the bank filtrate gradually evolved from a mixture between the two lakes towards a contribution of floodwater and one lake only. Automatized measurements of temperature and electrical conductivity at observation wells allowed to detect changes in the groundwater flow patterns at a daily time-scale, while the regulatory monthly monitoring for indicator bacteria did not fully capture the potential short timescale variability of the water quality. The recovery to pre-flood conditions was shown to be accelerated for the wells operating at high rates (i.e., >= 1000 m(3)/day), partly because of floodwater storage in the vicinity of the less active wells. These results establish new perspectives to anticipate water quality changes through selected pumping schemes, which depend on and must be adapted to site-specific water quality issues.

AB  - The relevance of the research. In the Tomsk region, the weathering crusts are very widespread, their gold content has been established, but a detailed study of the mineral composition has not previously been carried out. The relevance of the research is caused by the need to identify the conditions for formation of weathering crusts and to establish the patterns of accumulation of a wide range of minerals in them.
   The main aim of the research is to study the morphological and chemical features, paragenetic associations and distribution of minerals of the phosphate group, division into primary, transformed, and newly formed, the use of phosphates as minerals-indicators of the conditions for the formation of weathering crusts and their relationship with the distribution of gold.
   The object: residual and redeposited weathering crusts of the Tomsk region and the minerals of the phosphate group contained in them.
   Methods. The crystal morphological features of minerals of the phosphate group, their paragenetic associations were studied microscopically using an OLYMPUS SZX10 stereomicroscope, the chemical composition of minerals was determined using a HORIBA Scientific XGT-7200 X-ray fluorescence microscope and a TESCAN VEGA 3 SBU X-50 X-50 EDS Max OXFORD scanning electron microscope.
   Results. In the weathering crusts of the Tomsk region, phosphates of the apatite group, rare earth elements, and aluminophosphates of the crandallite group have been found. Phosphate minerals are divided into groups: primary terrigenous phosphates, stable in weathering crusts and released during the destruction of bedrock (monazite, xenotime, apatite), hypergene-transformed, altered during weathering (monazite), and secondary (monazite, cularite, flitorensite, crandallite, goyacite, gorseixite, plumbogumite). Established in different zones of the weathering crust, phosphate associations for the most part represent links in the successive transformation of minerals from calcium and rare-earth phosphates to aluminum, indicating an increase in the acidity of the mineral formation environment. In the upper part of the hydrolysis zone of the residual weathering crust, the greatest accumulation of gold is noted.

AB  - Understanding ambient background concentrations in soil, at a local scale, is an essential part of environmental risk assessment. Where high resolution geochemical soil surveys have not been undertaken, soil data from alternative sources, such as environmental site assessment reports, can be used to support an understanding of ambient background conditions. Concentrations of metals/metalloids (As, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) were extracted from open-source environmental site assessment reports, for soils derived from the Newer Volcanics basalt, of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. A manual screening method was applied to remove samples that were indicated to be contaminated by point sources and hence not representative of ambient background conditions. The manual screening approach was validated by comparison to data from a targeted background soil survey. Statistical methods for exclusion of contaminated samples from background soil datasets were compared to the manual screening method. The statistical methods tested included the Median plus Two Median Absolute Deviations, the upper whisker of a normal and log transformed Tukey boxplot, the point of inflection on a cumulative frequency plot and the 95th percentile. We have demonstrated that where anomalous sample results cannot be screened using site information, the Median plus Two Median Absolute Deviations is a conservative method for derivation of ambient background upper concentration limits (i.e. expected maximums). The tipper whisker of a boxplot and the point of inflection on a cumulative frequency plot, were also considered adequate methods for deriving ambient background upper concentration limits, where the percentage of contaminated samples is <25%. Median ambient background concentrations of metals/metalloids in the Newer Volcanic soils of Melbourne were comparable to ambient background concentrations in Europe and the United States, except for Ni, which was naturally enriched in the basalt-derived soils of Melbourne.

AB  - The paper presents the results of long-term observations (1991-2015) of zooplankton community in Lake Lebyazh'e (Kazan, Russia). Lake Lebyazh'e is a system of four water bodies: Bol'shoe, Maloe, Svetloe, and Sukhoe Lebyazh'e lakes, all interconnected with channels. Under the influence of anthropogenic and natural factors, a decrease of the water level and shrinkage of Lake Lebyazh'e took place. In order to save the valuable recreational facility, a range of hydrotechnical measures have been carried out.
   To date, the lake area has decreased by about 13 times; the water level is maintained artificially by supplying groundwater, which caused an increase in water mineralization, prevalence of sulfate ions. This, in turn, has led to changes in the structure of zooplankton community. The values of species composition have reduced significantly (by more than 20%). According to the recently obtained data, zooplankton of Lake Lebyazh'e comprises 44 species: 26 rotifer species (59%), 14 cladoceran species (32%), 4 copepod species (9%). New species, which were previously uncommon in the lake, have been found. It has been revealed that the range of dominant species of zooplankton changed, and their abundance decreased. The quantitative values of zooplankton decreased. It has been demonstrated that the abundance and bio-mass of zooplankton prior to the exposure corresponded to mesotrophic-eutrophic water bodies, but today's quantitative characteristics of zooplankton are more of oligotrophic water bodies. Based on Shannon's index, the species diversity of zooplankton has not decreased. However, most species are represented by either single or low number of individuals. This suggests that all organisms forming the community of Lake Lebyazh'e have evenly become less abundant. According to the saprobity index, the lake is beta-mesosaprobic, moderately polluted, and corresponds to class III of water quality.
   It has been concluded that the characteristics of zooplankton can be used as indicators to describe changes in the ecosystem initiated by variations in hydrological conditions, salinity, and main ions.

AB  - As conservation of sensitive habitats is a high priority issue in European environmental policy, there is considerable interest in mapping and monitoring specific habitats of high conservation value. In this study, we discuss the potential of the Swiss mire monitoring program to monitor small area habitats in sufficient detail. The monitoring scheme combines nationwide probability sampling and predictive habitat mapping based on a field data sample. Thus, it is designed to identify spatio-temporal changes at the stand level and to derive hard statistics for the sub-national level. For feasibility reasons, the thematic focus is on semi-quantitative mean indicator values derived from vegetation records. These measures provide robust estimates of essential floristic site conditions. Regression models based on CIR aerial photographs are applied to continuously map respective measures across the sample mires. The present study explores the required investment of data for model-based mapping. Exemplary mapping results are presented and validated within a reference mire. Repeated tests show that about one hundred field records are needed to guarantee optimal prediction accuracy and reliable error estimates for all target variables. The corresponding 95% error quantiles in a test data set are below 0.7. To evaluate the benefit of high resolution orthophotos (30 cm resolution), the model prediction is compared with results obtained from coarsened images. Although the original CIR images produce the best model performance, the models based on resolutions comparable to modern satellite images still show considerable potential to assess larger areas where the use of digital aerial photographs is limited. The resulting spatially-explicit in-depth information can resolve the common thematic limitations of stand-alone remote sensing applications in conservation monitoring. As the method is applicable consistently across a range of habitat types, we argue that it has the potential to become a standard method for operational monitoring of priority habitats in European nature conservation.

AB  - A kinetic model of trace element bioaccumulation in zebra mussels, employing experimentally determined trace element influx and efflux rates following food and water exposures, was field-tested in the Hudson and Niagara Rivers and Lakes Erie and Ontario. Ultraclean measurements of water column trace element concentrations in these waters and on suspended particles were used to predict metal concentrations in zebra mussels that were measured independently by the NOAA Mussel Watch program. Field concentrations of Ag, Cd, Or, and Hg ranged from subpicomolar (Ag) to low nanomolar (Cr) and displayed partition coefficients between particulate and aqueous phases of 1-20 x 10(5) L kg(-1). Despite variation in bioaccumulation factors (BAF) between locations by up to 6x (far Ag), our model predicted mean body burdens of Ag, Or, Hg, and Se that differed from measured tissue concentrations at the same sites by only 30% an average. Cd predictions matched measured values at the two lake sites but exceeded measurements at the three river sites by 2.6-fold. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under all environmental conditions likely to prevail in natural waters, Ag, Cd, and Hg are predominantly accumulated from ingested particles, that Cr is accumulated mostly from the dissolved phase, and that the relative uptake pathway for Se varies with environmental conditions. The highest BAF was far Cd (15-64 x 10(4)) and the lowest BAFs were for Or and Se (1.2-2.5 x 10(4) and 0.5-2.8 x 10(4), respectively), with Ag and Hg being intermediate (2.0-12 x 10(4) and 1.4-25 x 10(4), respectively). The good agreement of the model with field measurements suggests, for these elements, that (a) accumulation of these elements in zebra mussels is in fact proportional to influx from food and water (that is, the organism is not actively regulating internal concentrations), and (b) we can account for the processes governing metal bioaccumulation in these animals. We conclude that for these elements the zebra mussel will be effective as a bioindicator of ambient metals in freshwater systems.

AB  - Metacommunity ecology emphasizes that community structure and diversity are not only determined by local environmental conditions through environmental filtering, but also by dispersal-related processes, such as mass effects, dispersal limitation and patch dynamics. However, the roles of dispersal processes are typically ignored in bioassessment approaches. Here, we simultaneously explored the potential influences of four groups of factors: local stressors, climatic factors, within-basin spatial factors and basin identity in explaining variation in diversity indices of macroinvertebrate assemblages from seven subtropical tributary rivers. A total of 12 biodiversity indices based on species identities, functional traits and taxonomic relatedness were calculated and used in the subsequent statistical analysis. Our results showed that, although differing in their relative importance, the four explanatory factor groups all played important roles in explaining variation in biodiversity indices. Of the pure fractions, index variation was best explained by local environmental stressors, whereas the other three explanatory factor groups appeared less influential. Furthermore, diversity indices from species, functional and taxonomic dimensions responded distinctly to the focal ecological factors, and differed in their abilities to portray the effects of human disturbances on macroinvertebrate communities. Taxonomic distinctness indices performed best, with the highest amount of variation associated to local stressors and hardly any variation explained by other factors, implying that these indices are robust in portraying human disturbances in streams. However, species diversity and functional diversity indices were also affected by spatial processes and climatic factors, suggesting that these indices should be used with caution in bioassessment. We hence conclude that environmental assessment of riverine ecosystems should not rely entirely on the perspective of species sorting. In contrast, both roles of spatial processes and environmental variables related to human disturbances and climatic variation should be incorporated in management and conservation of riverine ecosystems.

AB  - Forage fishes are ecologically and economically important in marine ecosystems worldwide and thus are a focal topic for ecosystem-based fisheries management. In the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), the community dynamics of forage populations have been studied at regional spatial scales, but not across regions. To evaluate indicators of the forage community at the ecosystem-wide scale, we examine temporal variability of forage assemblages in Northern (Oregon/Washington), Central (California; Point Reyes to Monterey Bay) and Southern (southern California) regions of the CCLME from 1998 through 2016 which include years with unprecedented climate variability. Forage communities fluctuated greatly between years within each region owing to regionally low abundances of common taxa in at least some years (e.g., rockfishes Sebastes spp. in each region). Comparison of species assemblages among regions indicate that that temporal shifts in assemblage structure were largely synchronous throughout the CCLME. However, dynamics of most individual taxa were out of phase between regions, indicating that different taxa drove the variability in each region. Within regions, taxa with similar adult ecological niches tended to co-vary, suggesting synchronous responses to environmental forcing. Major changes in forage assemblage structure are descriptively linked to large oceanographic perturbations such as the transition from El Nino to La Nina conditions in 1998, anomalous upwelling in 2005, and the onset of a large marine heatwave in fall-winter 2013-2014. Changes in forage assemblage structure are reflected in prey switching in the diet of California sea lions, Zalophus californianus, in the Southern region. The multivariate forage indices that we develop can serve as effective indicators of regional forage community composition shifts in the CCLME and provide managers with context on spatio-temporal changes in the structure of forage fish communities important to top predators in this system.

AB  - The environmental purpose is to characterize watersheds in a region regarding vulnerability and resiliency relative to present and potential degradation of water quality due to human impact based on available spatial information and multidisciplinary expertise. Available information is of six general types as (1) physical and topographic conformation, (2) soil factors, (3) climatic factors, (4) hydrologic characteristics, (5) land-cover/land-use, and (6) prior records of sampling at selected locations for water quality and biological indicators. The strategy is first to develop cluster-based classes of watersheds that are expected to have similar responses to anthropogenic stressors, without using indicators of landscape condition that are directly influenced by local human activity. Watersheds in these classes can then be analyzed for degree of human influence as indicated by land-cover/land-use demographics. More sparse data on water quality and biological indicators at stream sampling locations provide a basis for determining the degradation response to human-induced stressors in each class along with potential for remediation. Focus in this paper is on the first task of cluster-based classification.
   Statistical adaptation comes in combining empirical objectivity of clustering with interdisciplinary environmental expertise, such that the trajectory of investigation arises from team expertise while the formulation is shaped statistically. Expertise enters initially in recognizing subsets of available descriptors that characterize different aspects of the watershed context needing to be explored separately rather than being completely confounded. Reduction of redundancy among available descriptors and removal of outliers are preliminary concerns. Clustering then proceeds through a series of phases using the sets of variables individually and in selected combinations. Contingency of composite clustering relative to separately clustered sets is examined via special cross tabulations in order to elucidate interactions between sets of variables. The spatial nature of the investigation contributes the major contextual capability for exercising team expertise through visualization using geographic information systems (GIS) that enhances and integrates insights from clustering, particularly with regard to spatial distribution of cluster membership.

AB  - An estimated 100 million people inhabit coastal areas at risk from flooding and erosion due to climate change. Seagrass meadows, like other coastal ecosystems, attenuate waves. Due to inconsistencies in how wave at-tenuation is measured results cannot be directly compared. We synthesised data from laboratory and field experiments of seagrass-wave attenuation by converting measurements to drag coefficients (C-D). Drag coefficients varied from 0.02-5.12 with (C) over bar (D) = 0.74 for studies conducted in turbulent flow in non-storm conditions. A statistical model suggested that seagrass species affects C-D although the exact mechanism remains unclear. A wave model using the estimated (C) over bar (D) as an input parameter demonstrated that wave attenuation increased with meadow length, shoot density, shoot width and canopy height. Findings can be used to estimate wave at-tenuation by seagrass, in any given set of conditions.

AB  - Do consumers become stingy tippers in inclement weather? Prior literature suggests that such weather induces negative moods, which in turn leads to stingy tipping. In this paper, on the basis of New York City taxi tipping data merged with corresponding real-time weather data, we provide different perspectives on weather-induced mood effects that take into account ambient environments provided by indoor services under inclement weather. In addition, we show that reciprocity effects triggered by taxi drivers' extra efforts in rainy or snowy weather conditions contribute to eliciting generous taxi tipping. In our investigation, precipitation and whether extreme temperature conditions are present or not are analysed after controlling for speed, fare amount for a trip, borough, taxi vendor company, and driver fixed effects. The implications are discussed in relation to weather driven reciprocity effects and relativism of weather-driven mood effects on generosity.

AB  - The predominant approach for studying macro-financial linkages is employing standard econometric techniques to link bank-specific risk parameters to macroeconomic and financial indicators. A single model is estimated using historical data and is subsequently used to forecast their evolution under various scenarios for the explanatory variables. However, the implicit assumption of invariable relationship structure across different economic conditions might not necessarily hold therefore introducing important model risk. Focusing on Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, this study examines the dynamic nature of the relationship between credit risk and macroeconomic and market-based indicators under stress. The empirical results indicate that the relationship structure is changing during crises and a significant number of models is affected by this change. Model combination techniques are utilized to mitigate the impact of this structural change. The results show that model combination outperforms individual models under changing economic conditions.

AB  - Urban park managers in densely-populated metropolises such as Hong Kong have to cope with dynamic user expectations, the impacts of recreation, and the shortage of resources over time, and the goal to improve park management strategies is ongoing. Indicators are potentially effective yardsticks for measuring park conditions and explaining the implications of various conditions on sustainable park management. This study solicits an indicator set through a two-tiered process of indicator selection, screening and rating, and a tripartite engagement by 20 park managers, 9 local scholars, and 743 park users in Hong Kong. The findings from the user-perceived level of importance of each indicator suggest that users pay close attention to landscaping, and that users consider the environmental quality of parks to be important management aspects. User-associated components of urban park management are identified, which reveal gradual changes in park features over the years.

AB  - Goats are homeothermic animals considered rustic from the bioclimatic point of view, but a reduction in their productive efficiency occurs under unfavorable thermal conditions. The present study evaluated pupil dilation as an indicator of thermal stress in Boer crossbred goats maintained under controlled environmental conditions. Six male crossbred goats of the Boer breed were distributed in a completely randomized design and submitted to temperatures of 26, 29 and 33 degrees C and 68% relative humidity. Pupillary dilation (PD), pupillary temperature (PT), respiratory frequency (FR), heart rate (HR), surface and rectal temperatures (ST and RT), body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion (FC) were monitored. An increase in the PD of the animals was observed with elevated air temperature. Specifically, pupillary area increased by 26.96 mm(2) at 33 degrees C compared to 26 degrees C. PD is shown as an efficient response for measuring the level of thermal stress in goats.

AB  - This paper aimed at proposing an inland waterway traffic noise prediction model for environmental assessment in China. The study was the first to predict inland waterway traffic noise levels considering water surface condition and absorption influence in China. The analysis results indicated that the inland waterway traffic noise exposure levels can be influenced by water surface. The model was developed based on the Germany Schall 03 model by adding the water surface condition and absorption correction terms to the governing equations. Results showed that the predicted noise levels by the developed model correlated well with the measurements. In addition, the developed model had higher precision compared with the existing models such as the Schall 03 model, the modified US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) model and the modified Germany Richtlinien fur den Larmschutz an Strassen (RLS 90) model. The proposed model can be utilized to assess inland waterway traffic noise exposure in China.

AB  - The New South Wales Medical Board has developed the Impaired Registrants Program to deal with impaired registrants (doctors and medical students) in a constructive and non-disciplinary manner; the program is now well established.
   The Program enables the Board to protect the public, while maintaining doctors in practice whenever possible.
   Disorders that commonly lead to referral of impaired doctors include alcohol and drug misuse, major depression, bipolar disorder, cognitive impairment and, less commonly, psychotic and personality disorders and anorexia nervosa.
   Pathways in the program are individualised according to the impact of the specific disorder, the registrant's career stage, stage of involvement in the program, insight and motivation.
   Critical points in the program include entry, easing of conditions, breach of conditions, return to work after suspension, and exit from the program.
   Decision-making at these points takes into account the nature of the impairment, compliance, professional and personal support available and the registrant's insight and motivation.

AB  - The biodegradation of alicyclic compounds was studied under methanogenic and sulfate-reducing conditions in samples from a gas condensate-contaminated aquifer amended with whole gasoline. Aquifer microorganisms exhibited previously unrecognized anaerobic alicyclic hydrocarbon metabolism of a broad range of substrates at relatively rapid rates. Simple unsubstituted, methyl-substituted, and ethyl-substituted cyclopentenes, cyclopentanes and cyclohexanes were consumed without a substantial lag in the presence of sulfate, but rather less effectively under methanogenic conditions. Dimethyl-substituted cyclopentanes and cyclohexanes were biodegraded only in the presence of sulfate and a limited isomer-specific biodegradative pattern was seen. These results extend the range of hydrocarbons known to be susceptible to anaerobic decay and help indicate the patterns of alicyclic hydrocarbon biodegradation that can be expected (C) 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - Objective: Evaluation of standing stalls under the aspect of animal welfare by recording the prevalence of stereotypic behaviour patterns which are known to be indicators of the general behavioural control system becoming overloaded. Material and methods: Behavioural observations were made on 37 horses stabled in standing stalls and on nine horses housed under natural conditions. Results: Many of the horses stabled in standing stalls showed stereotypes (51%). Very different stereotypes were observed. Besides the known stereotypes of crib-biting (n = 7), crib-whetting (n = 1), licking (n = 3) and weaving (n = 10), some special stereotypes could be observed: "lip-sucking" (n = 1), "seesawing" (n = 2), "standing in the corner" (n = 1), hyper-nervousness (n 3), apathy (n = 1) and extreme aggression (n = 4). Half of the 19 horses with stereotypic behaviour showed more than one stereotype. Conclusion and clinical relevance:The results show that the standing stalls for horses, under present conditions, do not sufficiently take into account animal needs.

AB  - Two new sampling and analysis techniques for assessing the condition of EPDM (ethylene-propylene diene monomer) composite insulators are presented. Polymer oxidation is assessed by removing small amounts of surface polymer by swabbing with xylene and analyzing this material by FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) emission spectroscopy. A measure of the amount of surface chalking is obtained by scraping a small amount of degraded surface material with a blade and analyzing by FTIR absorption spectroscopy. Numerical indices quantifying the amount of oxidation and surface chalking are obtained by calculating the ratios of absorption or emission peak heights in the infrared spectra. These indices are named the oxidation index and the chalking index. Three types of field-aged 275 kV EPDM composite insulators are investigated and the results from the new techniques compared with analyzes by XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) with good agreement. It is found that for two types of insulator that the oxidation index is increased in regions near the HV conductor.

AB  - Context: The global demand for food is expected to continue increasing for decades, which may drive both agricultural expansion and intensification. The associated environmental impacts are potentially considerable but will depend on how the agricultural sector develops. Currently, there are contrasting regional developments in agriculture; expansion and/or intensification in some regions and abandonment in others, as well as changes in the type of farming. However, the environmental consequences of changes in farm type are not well understood.
   Objective: We have evaluated the impacts of farm type on food production and three key environmental variables-landscape openness, grassland biodiversity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-in three marginal agricultural regions in Sweden.
   Methods: We do this by first dividing the population of farms in each region into types, based on their land-use and livestock holdings using an innovative clustering method. Thereafter we analysed changes in production activities for farm types over time and evaluated the environmental and food-production impacts, where landscape openness is quantified using a novel indicator.
   Results and conclusion: Our results show that there is not one single farm type that would simultaneously maximize food production, grassland biodiversity, and landscape openness, whilst minimizing GHG emissions. However, there exists considerable potential to manage the trade-offs between food production and these environmental variables. For example, by reducing land use for dairying and instead increasing both cropping for food production and extensive livestock grazing to maintain landscape openness and biodiversity-rich semi natural pastures, it would keep food production at similar levels.
   Significance: Our farm typology allows us to assess the multifunctionality of farming, by relating contrasting production activities to multiple ecosystem services, grassland biodiversity and GHG emissions for informing policy towards more sustainable agriculture. We have demonstrated this with examples under Swedish conditions, but it should to a large extent also be applicable for other countries.

AB  - Silver fir-beech forests form ecologically important ecosystems in European mountains, where they have been intensively managed due to timber harvesting. Forest management effects can be evaluated using herb layer diversity as an indicator of environmental changes. Therefore, revealing the patterns of herb layer diversity is necessary for developing strategies for sustainable management. Knowledge on management history of fir-beech forests in the western Pyrenees is still limited. In this study we aim to disentangle the environmental drivers of species richness and species composition of these forests emphasizing the role of forest management. We sampled the herb layer vascular plants in 68 plots distributed among 14 silver fir-beech stands of the association Scillo lilio-hyacinthi-Fagetum sylvaticae and related diversity patterns with management histories, light conditions and topographic and climatic variables. Four management categories were established: recently managed, long managed, recently abandoned and long abandoned. Species richness was analysed by GLMM and species composition by partial CCA and PCNM. Multivariate dispersion analysis was used to assess differences in beta diversity among management categories. Management, continentality and slope had in general a weak effect on species richness, continentality with a positive effect whilst slope and management, in category of recently abandoned stands, with a negative effect. In addition, the percentage of large gaps had a moderate effect on open area species richness. Species composition was related to slope, ombrothermic index, forest management and spatial effects in terms of neutral processes. Long managed forests showed differences in beta diversity with recently abandoned and long abandoned forests. Our study suggests that environmental variables in combination with spatial effects are the main drivers of species diversity at small sampling scale, high-lighting that management plays an important role in these western Pyrenean silver fir-beech forests.

AB  - Trophic state is an important property of the aquatic ecosystems as it reflects the anthropogenic influence on water quality and the ecological functioning of rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Trophic state indexes provide an insight on how nutrient and light availability controls phytoplankton development. We analyzed data on total phosphorus (TP, N = 931), chlorophyll a (Chl a, N = 848) and Secchi disk depth (SDD, N = 204) monitored in 18 tropical/subtropical reservoirs from 1996 to 2009 by the Environmental Protection Agency of Sao Paulo State (Brazil) in a bimonthly basis. Through linear regression with paired data on "TP x Chl a" and "Chl a x SDD", we proposed a new trophic state index for tropical/subtropical reservoirs (TSItsr). Based on the annual geometric mean concentrations of TP and Chl a, we also assessed the risk of occurrence of individual episodes (e.g. Chl a >= 30 mu g/L or TP = 50 mu g/L) within six categories: ultraoligotrophic (U), oligotrophic (O), mesotrophic (M), eutrophic (E), supereutrophic (S) and hypereutrophic (H). The upper boundaries (as annual geometric means) are (mu g/L): 15.9 (U), 23.8 (O), 36.7 (M), 63.7 (E) and 77.6 (S) for TP and 2.0 (U), 3.9 (O), 10.0 (M), 20.2 (E) and 27.1 (S) for Chl a. The lower boundaries for the hypereutrophic state were (mu g/L) 77.7 (TP) and 27.2 (Chl a). Comparisons with criteria available in the literature suggested that trophic state limits established for temperate systems are not suitable for tropical/subtropical reservoirs and may overestimate their enrichment condition. Restrictions of the TSItsr are discussed in light of the limiting- nutrient concept, the spatial and temporal water quality variability and the use of Chl a as an indicator of phytoplankton density and biomass. The TSItsr may aid in reservoirs management as a starting point for analyzing data on water quality in the tropics/subtropics since this issue is of paramount importance worldwide.

AB  - The Magdalenian culture-stratigraphic unit in Western Europe, despite being a construct of nineteenth-century prehistoric archeologists, does have reality as a continuous network of human inter-relationships, whose ecologically transcendent range expanded through the course of the Late Last Glacial, in many ways reminiscent of Braudel's histoire de la longue dur,e-in this case lasting some 9,000 calendar years. At the scale of the moyenne dur,e, the Magdalenian underwent several reorganizations [represented by its Initial, Lower, Middle, Upper, Final, and Epi-Magdalenian (i.e., Azilian, Federmesser) stages]-with distinctly regional manifestations and inter-regional connections-that in part can be understood in light of environmental/resource changes and variations at the scales of millennia and natural regions. At the scale of the courte dur,e, we are dealing with the adaptations of local and regional hunter-gatherer bands and the peculiarities and vicissitudes of their circumstances measured by forager group territories and centuries. Numerous, diverse concrete archaeological manifestations of territories and inter-group contacts support the growing consensus about the social reality of the Magdalenian phenomenon and the changes and variations that characterized it within a range that ultimately stretched from Portugal to Poland during the last millennia of the Pleistocene. Here, the focus is on Cantabrian Spain as one of the core or source areas of the Magdalenian cultural tradition that arose out of the Solutrean experience some 20,000 calendar years ago (about a millennium later than in France) and that was intimately linked to the process of human recolonization of upland and northerly regions of western and ultimately central Europe during the course of Greenland Stadial 2 and early Greenland Interstadial 1. Finally, archaeological and paleobiological indicators clearly point to major breaks in human adaptations and ways of understanding the human place in the universe a few centuries after the onset of Holocene conditions in Vasco-Cantabria, i.e., the development of Mesolithic cultures about 11,000 calendar years ago.

AB  - The monitoring of trends in the status of species or habitats is routine in developed countries, where it is funded by the state or large nongovernmental organizations and often involves large numbers of skilled amateur volunteers. Far less monitoring of natural resources takes place in developing countries, where state agencies have small budgets, there are fewer skilled professionals or amateurs, and socioeconomic conditions prevent development of a culture of volunteerism. The resulting lack of knowledge about trends in species and habitats presents a serious challenge for detecting, understanding, and reversing declines in natural resource values. International environmental agreements require signatories undertake systematic monitoring of their natural resources, but no system exists to guide the development and expansion of monitoring schemes. To help develop such a protocol, we suggest a typology of monitoring categories, defined by their degree of local participation, ranging from no local involvement with monitoring undertaken by professional researchers to an entirely local effort with monitoring undertaken by local people. We assessed the strengths and weaknesses of each monitoring category and the potential of each to be sustainable in developed or developing countries. Locally based monitoring is particularly relevant in developing countries, where it can lead to rapid decisions to solve the key threats affecting natural resources, can empower local communities to better manage their resources, and can refine sustainable-use strategies to improve local livelihoods. Nevertheless, we recognize that the accuracy and precision of the monitoring undertaken by local communities in different situations needs further study and field protocols need to be further developed to get the best from the unrealized potential of this approach. A challenge to conservation biologists is to identify and establish the monitoring system most relevant to a particular situation and to develop methods to integrate outputs from across the spectrum of monitoring schemes to produce wider indices of natural resources that capture the strengths of each.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) are being promoted as adaptive measures against predicted increasing hydrometeorological hazards (HMHs), such as heatwaves and floods which have already caused significant loss of life and economic damage across the globe. However, the underpinning factors such as policy framework, end-users' interests and participation for NBS design and operationalisation are yet to be established. We discuss the operationalisation and implementation processes of NBS by means of a novel concept of Open-Air Laboratories (OAL) for its wider acceptance. The design and implementation of environmentally, economically, technically and socio-culturally sustainable NBS require inter- and transdisciplinary approaches which could be achieved by fostering co-creation processes by engaging stakeholders across various sectors and levels, inspiring more effective use of skills, diverse knowledge, manpower and resources, and connecting and harmonising the adaptation aims. The OAL serves as a benchmark for NBS upscaling, replication and exploitation in policy-making process through monitoring by field measurement, evaluation by key performance indicators and building solid evidence on their short- and long-term multiple benefits in different climatic, environmental and socioeconomic conditions, thereby alleviating the challenges of political resistance, financial barriers and lack of knowledge. We conclude that holistic management of HMHs by effective use of NBS can be achieved with standard compliant data for replicating and monitoring NBS in OALs, knowledge about policy silos and interaction between research communities and end-users. Further research is needed for multi-risk analysis of HMHs and inclusion of NBS into policy frameworks, adaptable at local, regional and national scales leading to modification in the prevalent guidelines related to HMHs. The findings of this work can be used for developing synergies between current policy frameworks, scientific research and practical implementation of NBS in Europe and beyond for its wider acceptance.

AB  - Evidence indicating that ecological communities show delayed responses to environmental change has raised the need to better understand the effects of landscape history on biodiversity. We investigated how freshwater biodiversity is related to both recent and past land use change in tropical river catchments. More specifically, we analysed the relationship between biodiversity and change in forest cover that occurred across five decades, including landscape trajectories of forest gain and loss. The abundance of stream insects showed a more delayed response to landscape change than rarefied richness, whereas the Tsallis diversity index was not related to past forest cover. However, both alpha diversity and local abundance were related to mean forest cover across the five decades when conditioned by the trajectory of change. We found a negative relationship between the historical mean of forest cover and community descriptors in streams embedded in landscapes on a trajectory of forest loss, but a positive relationship in landscapes on a trajectory of forest gain. We provide the first evidence of delayed responses of tropical freshwater insect communities to landscape history and suggest that the magnitude of change in forest cover, mediated by its trajectory, is a major driver of delayed responses. We show that a trajectory of forest loss might result in both immediate loss of species and a set of species doomed for future extinction. Synthesis and applications. Delayed responses of multispecies communities to past landscape changes depend on their extent, frequency and intensity. Our findings indicate that, beyond the relative amount of forest cover within river catchments, the magnitude of change in forest cover mediated by its historical trajectory can be a major driver of delayed responses in stream communities. We suggest that, if biodiversity conservation is the main aim, stream restoration should be prioritized in catchments with higher forest cover, as even under a forest gain trajectory, stream communities continue responding to past landscape changes depending on how widespread and intensive changes were.

AB  - Metacommunity ecology has broadened considerably with the recognition that measuring beta diversity beyond the purely taxonomic viewpoint may improve our understanding of the dispersal- and niche-based mechanisms across biological communities. In that perspective, we applied a novel multidimensional approach including taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic data to enhance our basic understanding of macrophyte metacommunity dynamics. For each beta diversity metric, we calculated the mean overall value and tested whether the mean value was different from that expected by chance using null models. We also employed evolutionary and spatially constrained models to first identify the degree to which the studied functional traits showed a phylogenetic signal, and then to estimate the relative importance of spatial and environmental effects on metacommunity structure. We first found that most individual ponds were inhabited by species that were merely random draws from the taxonomic and phylogenetic species pool available in the study region. Contrary to our expectations, not all measured traits were conserved along the phylogeny. We also showed that trait and phylogenetic dimensions strongly increased the amount of variation in beta diversity that can be explained by degree of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation. This suggests that accounting for functional traits and phylogeny in metacommunity ecology helps to explain idiosyncratic patterns of variation in macrophyte species distribution. Importantly. phylogenetic and functional analyses identified the influence of underlying mechanisms that would otherwise be missed in an analysis of taxonomic turnover. Together, these results let us conclude that macrophyte species have labile functional traits adapted to dispersal-based processes and some evolutionary trade-offs that drive community assembly via species sorting. Overall, our exploration of different facets of beta diversity showed how functional and phylogenetic information may be used with species-level data to test community assembly hypotheses that are more ecologically meaningful than assessments of environmental pat- terns based on the purely taxonomic viewpoint.

AB  - Deep-sea ecosystems are in general adapted to a limited variability of physical conditions, resulting in high vulnerability and slow recovery rates from anthropogenic perturbations such as bottom trawling. Commercial trawling is the most recurrent and pervasive of human impacts on the deep-sea floor, but studies on its consequences on the biogeochemistry of deep-sea sediments are still scarce. Pigments, fatty acids, amino acids and carbohydrates were analysed in sediments from the flanks of the La Fonera (Palamos) submarine canyon (NW Mediterranean Sea), where a commercial bottom trawling fishery has been active for more than 70 yr. More specifically, we investigated how trawling-induced sediment reworking affects the quality of sedimentary organic matter which reaches the seafloor and accumulates in the sediment column, which is fundamental for the development of benthic communities. Sediment samples were collected during two oceanographic cruises in spring and autumn 2011. The sampled sites included trawl fishing grounds as well as pristine (control) areas. We report that bottom trawling in the flanks of the La Fonera Canyon has caused an alteration of the quality of the organic matter accumulated in the upper 5 cm of the seafloor. The use of a wide pool of biochemical tracers characterized by different reactivity to degradation allowed for us to discriminate the long-term effects of trawl-induced sediment reworking from the natural variability caused by the seasonal cycle of production and sinking of biogenic particles. Differences between untrawled and trawled areas were evidenced by labile amino acids, while differences between spring and autumn samples were detected only by the more labile indicators chlorophyll a and monounsaturated fatty acids. These results suggest that changes in the biochemical composition of the sedimentary organic matter caused by bottom trawling can be more relevant than those associated with natural seasonality and pose serious concerns about the ecological sustainability of deep-sea trawling activities.

AB  - Establishment of water quality criteria to guide catchment sediment management is required by the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive. The topic, however, is hotly contested among scientists and policy makers. Existing legislation with regard to fine sediment was set by the EU Freshwater Fish Directive. Its guideline, i.e. mean annual suspended sediment concentration, is 25 mg l(-1). Such a static target fails to capture the episodic nature of sediment transport. Furthermore, application of such global standards is inappropriate for a pollutant that is strongly controlled by spatial variation in key catchment drivers. Paleolimnology offers an approach for assessing background sediment pressures on watercourses, enabling determination of values for times pre-dating agricultural intensification. We propose that Modern Background Sediment Delivery to Rivers (MBSDR) across England and Wales can be determined using paleolimnology to quantify maximum feasible sediment reduction. No management programme should aim to reduce sediment loss to values below those resulting from background, natural physiographic and/or hydrological controls. Lacking generic tools to quantify process linkages between sediment pressures and biological impact, we propose that MBSDR could be taken to represent ecological demand for sediment inputs into watercourses required to support healthy aquatic habitats. In situations where generic tools exist for coupling sediment pressures and ecological impacts, assessment of MBSDR could be used to correct the gap between current or future projected sediment loss and biological condition. Existing paleolimnological data on sediment yields across England and Wales are presented to illustrate the approach and provide preliminary national estimates of MBSDR. We briefly consider the basis for reconstructing sediment yields using a paleolimnological approach and analyse temporal trends in published sediment yield, inferred for a range of landscape types. We also attempt to correlate sediment accumulation rates (SARs) with sediment yields to extend the MBSDR data base. Preliminary maps were generated to identify regions where further sediment yield data are needed to produce a more robust estimate of the spatial distribution of MBSDR across England and Wales.

AB  - The development and the evaluation of a biological indicator system for pesticide pollution in streams are presented. For small headwater streams with an agricultural catchment area, the expert system LIMPACT estimates the pesticide contamination according to the four classes: Not Detected (ND), Low (L), Moderate (M) and High (H) contamination without any specification of the chemical agents. The input parameters are the abundance data of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa within four time frames in a year (March/April, May/June, July/August, September/October) and nine basic water-quality and morphological parameters. The heuristic knowledge base was developed with the shell-kit D3 and contains 921 diagnostic rules with scores either to establish or to de-establish a diagnosis. The 418 rules had less than three symptoms, and only 47 rules had more than four symptoms in their rule condition. We differentiate between positive indicator (PI) taxa, which indicate contamination by high abundance values and positive abundance dynamics, and negative indicator (NI) taxa, a high abundance of which rules out contamination and indicates an uncontaminated site. We analysed 39 taxa and found 13 positive and 24 negative indicators. The database comprises 157 investigations per stream and year with rainfall event-controlled pesticide sampling and repeated benthic sampling as described in Part 1 [Ecol. Indicators, this issue]. For the evaluation of LIMPACT, we used the same cases. The correct class for the 157 investigations per stream and year is established by LIMPACT in 66.7-85.5% of the cases, with better results for uncontaminated sites. The overall alpha error probability (false positive) is 9.6% while the beta error probability (false negative) varied between 0 and 8% depending on the contamination class. If each stream is considered only once in the system (n = 104), the correct diagnosis is established by LIMPACT in 51.9-88.6% of the cases. In most of the remaining cases no diagnosis is established instead of a wrong one. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The risk tropospheric ozone poses to forests in the United States is dependent on the variation in ozone exposure across the distribution of the forests in question and the various environmental and climate factors predominant in the region. All these factors have a spatial nature, and consequently an approach to characterization oi ozone risk is presented that places ozone exposure-response functions for species as seedlings and model-simulated tree and stand responses in a spatial context using a geographical information systems (GIS). The GIS is used to aggregate factors considered important in a risk characterization, including: (1) estimated ozone exposures over forested regions, (2) measures of ozone effects on species' and stand growth, and (3) spatially distributed environmental, genetic, and exposure influences on species' response to ozone. The GIS-based risk characterization provides an estimation oi the extent and magnitude of the potential ozone impact on forests. A preliminary risk characterization demonstrating this approach considered only the eastern United States and only the limited empirical data quantifying the effect oi ozone exposures on forest tree species as seedlings. The area-weighted response of the annual seedling biomass loss formed the basis for a sensitivity ranking: sensitive-aspen and black cherry (14%-33% biomass loss over 50% of their distribution); moderately sensitive-tulip popular, loblolly pine, eastern white pine, and sugar maple (5%-13% biomass loss); insensitive-Virginia pine and red maple (0%-1% loss). In the future, the GIS-based risk characterization will include process-based model simulations of the three- to 5-year growth response of individual species as large trees with relevant environmental interactions and model simulated response of mixed stands. The interactive nature of GIS provides a tool to explore consequences of the range of climate conditions across a species' distribution, forest management practices, changing ozone precursors, regulatory control strategies, and other factors influencing the spatial distribution of ozone over time as more information becomes available.

AB  - At three uranium (U) legacy sites in Kyrgyzstan, namely, Kadji Sai, Mailuu-Suu and Sumsar, an initial human bio-monitoring programme was introduced as a complementary activity to environmental impact studies in these areas. The aim was to assess trace element (TE) contents in blood and genetic susceptibility for Pb as one of the contaminants.
   The programme included the determination of 9 TE in blood samples from 123 residents living permanently in this environment. The analyses included U and the potentially toxic TE, lead (Pb), cadmium, mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As), together with essential elements iron (Fe), copper, selenium (Se) and manganese (Mn). TE were analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and genetic background effect by three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD; rs1805313, rs818708, rs1800435) genotyped by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
   The obtained results were generally similar to literature reference values obtained from the U non-exposed environments. However, some significant findings indicated elevated levels of certain contaminants typical of the studied environment (U, Pb). Several essential (Se, Mn) and toxic TE (Pb, Hg, As, U) in blood showed statistically significant differences among the studied areas. All areas showed diminished Fe blood levels. Altogether, this indicated specific and different environmental conditions at three industrial legacy sites for U milling and processing along with the accompanying chemical (pollutant) elements. Blood U concentrations were slightly higher at Mailuu-Suu, known for elevated technogenic and naturally occurring U. At Sumsar, the distribution of elevated blood Pb concentrations indicated an airborne source of pollution that was different from the anticipated aqueous exposure pathway. Pb blood variability was found associated with ALAD polymorphisms (SNPs rs1805313, rs1800435).
   Results are confirming that human data will be a useful and scientifically important additional tool for environmental impact assessment studies at industrial legacy sites in Kyrgyzstan. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Arsenic accumulation in the environment poses ecological and human health risks. A greater knowledge about soil total As content variability and its main drivers is strategic for maintaining soil security, helping public policies and environmental surveys. Considering the poor history of As studies in Brazil at the country's geographical scale, this work aimed to generate predictive models of topsoil As content using machine learning (ML) algorithms based on several environmental covariables representing soil forming factors, ranking their importance as explanatory covariables and for feeding group analysis. An unprecedented databank based on laboratory analyses (including rare earth elements), proximal and remote sensing, geographical information system operations, and pedological information were surveyed. The median soil As content ranged from 0.14 to 41.1 mg kg(-1) in reference soils, and 0.28 to 58.3 mg kg(-1) in agricultural soils. Recursive Feature Elimination Random Forest outperformed other ML algorithms, ranking as most important environmental covariables: temperature, soil organic carbon (SOC), clay, sand, and TiO2. Four natural groups were statistically suggested (As content +/- standard error in mg kg(-1)): G1) with coarser texture, lower SOC, higher temperatures, and the lowest TiO2 contents, has the lowest As content (2.24 +/- 0.50), accomplishing different environmental conditions; G2) organic soils located in floodplains, medium TiO2 and temperature, whose As content (3.78 +/- 2.05) is slightly higher than G1, but lower than G3 and G4; G3) medium contents of As (7.14 +/- 1.30), texture, SOC, TiO2, and temperature, representing the largest number of points widespread throughout Brazil; G4) the largest contents of As (11.97 +/- 1.62), SOC, and TiO2, and the lowest sand content, with points located mainly across Southeastern Brazil with milder temperature. In the absence of soil As content, a common scenario in Brazil and in many Latin American countries, such natural groups could work as environmental indicators. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In south and southeast Brazil land use caused profound changes in natural vegetation and consequently the value of the pollen composition in surface samples as modern analogues. In order to test the capability of modern pollen to represent the natural vegetation, three different time slices of pollen assemblages from 27 sites spread over southern and south-eastern Brazil and the Misiones Province in Argentina were collated. Pollen samples from the pre-colonization period, selected from the moment just before abrupt changes evidenced on pollen diagrams caused by the colonization process throughout the last 500 years, were assumed to represent the natural vegetation conditions once the climate remained stable within this period. Thus we used pre-colonization assemblages to compare with modern samples to explore to what extent surface pollen may be biased in representing the natural vegetation types. Furthermore, to compare man made vegetation change to climate driven vegetation change we also compared to these 20 out of 27 samples dated to 3,000 years bp. Guided by ordination and cluster analysis, but using abundance thresholds of indicator taxa we classified the pollen spectra of pre-colonization time into seven groups consistent with the main vegetation types in the area. Ordination analyses capture the differentiation between grassland and forested vegetation and between tropical and subtropical vegetation types. Comparing the pre-colonization with other time slices we observed that based on Poaceae abundance, 70 and 85 % respectively of sites from 3,000 bp and modern assemblages maintained their classification. Based on finer classification criteria these values decreased to 40 and 52 % respectively. Square chord dissimilarity indicates that colonization impact altered the pollen composition as strongly as 3,000 years of climate induced vegetation change. The surface samples still represent important environmental gradients; however, their use as modern analogue requires careful treatment and eventual exclusion of highly impacted sites.

AB  - We investigated communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the roots and the rhizosphere soil of Brachypodium retusum in six different natural soils under field conditions. We explored phylogenetic patterns of AMF composition using indicator species analyses to find AMF associated with a given habitat (root versus rhizosphere) or soil type. We tested whether the AMF characteristics of different habitats or contrasting soils were more closely related than expected by chance. Then we used principal-component analysis and multivariate analysis of variance to test for the relative contribution of each factor in explaining the variation in fungal community composition. Finally, we used redundancy analysis to identify the soil properties that significantly explained the differences in AMF communities across soil types. The results pointed out a tendency of AMF communities in roots to be closely related and different from those in the rhizosphere soil. The indicator species analyses revealed AMF associated with rhizosphere soil and the root habitat. Soil type also determined the distribution of AMF communities in soils, and this effect could not be attributed to a single soil characteristic, as at least three soil properties related to microbial activity, i.e., pH and levels of two micronutrients (Mn and Zn), played significant roles in triggering AMF populations.
   IMPORTANCE
   Communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are main components of soil biota that can determine the productivity of ecosystems. These fungal assemblages vary across host plants and ecosystems, but the main ecological processes that shape the structures of these communities are still largely unknown. A field study in six different soil types from semiarid areas revealed that AMF communities are significantly influenced by habitat (soil versus roots) and soil type. In addition, three soil properties related to microbiological activity (i.e., pH and manganese and zinc levels) were the main factors triggering the distribution of AMF. These results contribute to a better understanding of the ecological factors that can shape AMF communities, an important soil microbial group that affects multiple ecosystem functions.

AB  - Since the 1990s, science based ecological risk assessments constitute an essential tool for supporting decision making in the regulatory context. Using the European REACH Regulation as example, this article presents the challenges and opportunities for new scientific developments within the area of chemical control and environmental protection. These challenges can be sorted out in 3 main related topics (sets). In the short term, the challenges are directly associated with the regulatory requirements, required for facilitating a scientifically sound implementation of the different obligations for industry and authorities. It is important to mention that although the actual tools are different due to the regulatory requirements, the basic needs are still the same as those addressed in the early 1990s: understanding the ecological relevance of the predicted effects, including the uncertainty, and facilitating the link with the socio-economic assessment. The second set of challenges covers the opportunities for getting an added value from the regulatory efforts. The information compiled through REACH registration and notification processes is analyzed as source for new integrative developments for assessing the combined chemical risk at the regional level. Finally, the article discusses the challenge of inverting the process and developing risk assessment methods focusing on the receptor, the individual or ecosystem, instead of on the stressor or source. These approaches were limited in the past due to the lack of information, but the identification and dissemination of standard information, including uses, manufacturing sites, physical-chemical, environmental, ecotoxicological, and toxicological properties as well as operational conditions and risk management measures for thousands of chemicals, combined by the knowledge gathered through large scale monitoring programs and spatial information systems is generating new opportunities. The challenge is liking predictions and measured data in an integral -omic type approach, considering collectively data from different sources and offering a complete assessment of the chemical risk of individuals and ecosystems, with new conceptual approaches that could be defined as risk-omics based paradigms and models.

AB  - Landscape indicators, when combined with information about environmental conditions (such as habitat potential, biodiversity, carbon and nutrient cycling, and erosion) and socioeconomic forces, can provide insights about changing ecosystem services. They also provide information about opportunities for improving natural resources management. Landscape indicators rely on data regarding land cover, land management and land functionality. Challenges in using landscape indicators to assess change and effects include (1) measures of land management and attributes that are reliable, robust and consistent for all areas on the Earth do not exist, and thus land cover is more frequently utilized; (2) multiple types of land cover and management are often found within a single landscape and are constantly changing, which complicates measurement and interpretation; and (3) while causal analysis is essential for understanding and interpreting changes in indicator values, the interactions among multiple causes and effects over time make accurate attribution among many drivers of change particularly difficult. Because of the complexity, sheer number of variables, and limitations of empirical data on land changes, models are often used to illustrate and estimate values for landscape indicators, and those models have several problems. Recommendations to improve our ability to assess the effects of changes in land management include refinement of questions to be more consistent with available information and the development of data sets based on systematic measurement over time of spatially explicit land qualities such as carbon and nutrient stocks, water and soil quality, net primary productivity, habitat and biodiversity. Well-defined and consistent land-classification systems that are capable of tracking changes in these and other qualities that matter to society need to be developed and deployed. Because landscapes are so dynamic, it is crucial to develop ways for the scientific community to work together to collect data and develop tools that will enable better analysis of causes and effects and to develop robust management recommendations that will increases land's capacity to meet societal needs in a changing world.

AB  - In the Loess Plateau, soil desiccation has become a serious problem for forest and grass vegetation. Soil desiccation leads to the formation of a dried soil layer (DSL). This paper presents the results of research carried out in the central part of the Loess Plateau. The objective of the research was to produce a statistically supported set of indicators for evaluating soil desiccation of forestlands, to present a heuristic idea for soil desiccation and to supply scientific support for replacing farmland with forest or grass in the Loess Plateau and other regions of China. Here, we suggest that more attention should be paid to soil desiccation and its effects on the ecosystem of the region in the future. The results showed that natural Quercus liaotungensis forestlands (NQF) retained more water content than regrown Robinnia pseudoscacia forestlands (RRF). Significant DSLs were formed in the RRF but not in the NQF. A possible reason for no formation of DSL in NQF could be due to the presence of an arbor-shrub-herb stand structure and large humus and litter accumulation, which increased the natural forest's (NF) adaptability to the environmental conditions. Soil water content in the north-facing slope was significantly larger than in the south-facing slope. DSLs formed in the 0-500 cm layer of the south-facing slope. When slope gradient was greater than 25 degrees, soil water content deceased sharply and showed significant difference compared with 9 degrees, 15 degrees and 20 degrees (P < 0.05). So, we conclude that plant species, aspect and slope angle could be the predicators for the formation of DSLs. The analysis on soil physical properties of 0-60 cm layer indicated that plant species, aspect and slope angle also have significant effects on bulk density, porosity, plant-available capacity, and hydraulic conductivity, especially in the 0-20 and 20-40 cm layers. In the NQF and RRF with north-facing slope, soil physical properties were improved. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The biological indicators of ten Bulgarian and introduced Burley tobacco varieties were analyzed. The analysis showed that the expression of the biological indicators is closely related to the genotype and is insignificantly influenced by the environmental conditions. The most favorable results for all morphological features and the length of the vegetation period was for the Burley 1344 variety, which can be used in the breeding programs as a donor to improve the biological parameters of Burleys tobacco. In the other studied varieties of Burley tobacco, there was uniformity in morphological parameters. Pliska 2002 variety was not suitable for the Burley tobacco standard, because it presents with a small leaf width in the middle harvesting belt and too long vegetation period for the Burleys tobacco varieties. Bulgarian varieties were more favorable biological indicators that those of the introduced varieties. From the introduced varieties with optimal biological parameters was characterized Burley 21 variety.

AB  - The loss of aquatic biodiversity is increasing at a rapid rate globally. There is a worldwide effort to protect, preserve and restore aquatic ecosystems. For efficient biodiversity monitoring and reliable management tools, comprehensive biodiversity data are required. The abundance and species diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates are commonly used as indicators of the aquatic ecosystem condition. Currently, macroinvertebrate species biodiversity assessment is based on morpho-taxonomy, which could be enhanced by recent advances in DNA-based tools for species identification. In particular, DNA metabarcoding has the potential to identify simultaneously many different taxa in a pool of species and to improve aquatic biomonitoring significantly, especially for indicator species. This review is focused on the current state of DNA-based aquatic biomonitoring using benthic macroinvertebrates in the Mediterranean region.

AB  - Based on the brief review and detailed analysis of the results obtained in the course of investigation of chemical and other characteristics of tundra soils in Russia, we developed a procedure for calculation of essential agrochemical properties of natural and disturbed soil cover in tundra to make quantitative evaluations of the ecological danger of its degradation. The initial data for calculation were the values of humus content in the soil layer 0-20 cm. They were either obtained experimentally or calculated based on correlations with soil annealing losses, hygroscopic humidity of the upper soil layer and its organic constituent, and the qualitative characterization of wetting and thermal conditions during the vegetation period. In order to illustrate the sequence and relevance of calculative determinations, we give a sample calculation and application of its results.

AB  - A structurally dynamic model was developed based on the software Pamolare II for the plant-dominated Baiyangdian Lake in North China. The model was applied to forecast the ecological health condition under different scenarios of removing submerged plants. The indicators for ecosystem health included phytoplankton biomass, ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass, eco-exergy and structural eco-exergy. The results showed that the lake's health degraded following the decrease of removal of submerged plants. Meanwhile, the ecological health improved when the removal of submerged plants increased to 1.5 times the normal level. Finally, based on the model results, the biomass of submerged plants is recommended to be reduced to 140-180 g/m(2), which may provide reasonable reference for regulating and controlling submerged plants in Baiyangdian Lake.

AB  - Isothermal and Differential Scanning Calorimetry is applied to analyze the evolution of soil using its microorganisms and organic matter as bioindicators of soil quality. This study was carried out with two similar soils under different agricultural activities: culture and pasture. Sampling and measurements were performed through 1 year in order to check the sensitivity of common calorimetric indicators of microbial activity and organic matter to the different climatic seasons in the sampling place: spring, summer, fall and winter. Results show that these indicators are sensitive to changes related to climatic conditions but the variability depended also on the nature of the soil: pasture or agricultural land. The results achieved through the present study show that the procedure here proposed could be used on any soil everywhere, providing the determination of the own parameters of soil and zones.

AB  - Despite increasing threats to Tonga's coral reefs from stressors that are both local (e.g. overfishing and pollution) and global (e.g. climate change), there is yet to be a systematic assessment of the status of the country's coral reef ecosystem and reef fish fishery stocks. Here, we provide a national ecological assessment of Tonga's coral reefs and reef fish fishery using ecological survey data from 375 sites throughout Tonga's three main island groups (Ha'apai, Tongatapu and Vava'u), represented by seven key metrics of reef health and fish resource status. Boosted regression tree analysis was used to assess and describe the relative importance of 11 socio-environmental variables associated with these key metrics of reef condition. Mean live coral cover across Tonga was 18%, and showed a strong increase from north to south correlated with declining sea surface temperature, as well as with increasing distance from each provincial capital. Tongatapu, the southernmost island group, had 2.5 times greater coral cover than the northernmost group, Vava'u (24.9% and 10.4% respectively). Reef fish species richness and density were comparable throughout Tongatapu and the middle island group, Ha'apai (similar to 35 species/transect and similar to 2500 fish/km(2)), but were significantly lower in Vava'u (similar to 24 species/transect and similar to 1700 fish/km(2)). Spatial patterns in the reef fish assemblage were primarily influenced by habitat-associated variables (slope, structural complexity, and hard coral cover). The biomass of target reef fish was greatest in Ha'apai (similar to 820 kg/ha) and lowest in Vava'u (similar to 340 kg/ha), and was negatively associated with higher human influence and fishing activity. Overall mean reef fish biomass values suggest that Tonga's reef fish fishery can be classified as moderately to heavily exploited, with 64% of sites having less than 500 kg/ha. This study provides critical baseline ecological information for Tonga's coral reefs that will: (1) facilitate ongoing management and research; and (2) enable accurate reporting on conservation targets locally and internationally.

AB  - In situ carbon flux studies are typically rare over the Himalaya but are important to understand carbon (C) balance. We investigated night-time canopy respiration (R-nc) and soil respiration (R-s) of a deciduous coniferous forest in response to environmental factors. A comprehensive investigation has been carried out on C balance indicators by employing systematic and concurrent measurements over an annual growth cycle of pine (Nov 2010-Dec 2011). The study site consists of uniformly distributed young deciduous Pinus roxburghii plantation having understory as Lantana camara (an invasive shrub). Results underlined that both R-nc and R-s fluxes were highest in the post-monsoon season. Evaporative fraction (EF) and temperature explained maximum variability of fluxes during warm-moist monsoon. Our key finding depicts an inverse significant correlation between day-time canopy photosynthesis (A(c)) and R-nc across the seasons (r=0.83-0.99). This can be explained by the mechanistic physiological phase of optimal anabolism (A(c)) with favorable environmental conditions and minimum level of catabolism (R-nc). The respiration-photosynthesis ratio (R-nc/A(c)) typically ranged from 0.25 +/- 0.11 (peak growing season) to 0.71 +/- 0.16 (winter season) with mean of 0.26 +/- 0.10. The ratio R-s/A(c) was highest during the winter season (2.69 +/- 0.43), while minimum during peak growing season (0.64 +/- 0.29). The R-nc/A(c) ratio and night-time temperature (AT) also revealed that the ratio could increase when AT crossed 24 degrees C. These responses indicate that under climate warming, it may have a significant influence on net plant C uptake. Presence of understory shrub minimizes the R-nc/A(c) ratio, and indicative of a more positive C-balance. Nevertheless, the observations could certainly lend useful insight into C-balance and ecological function in the region. Further, it may be useful in parameterizing and validating C-cycle models.

AB  - The southern Levant is a Mediterranean climate zone of complex variability in which uncertainty remains in regional palaeoclimate reconstruction. In spite of the proven value of diatoms in circum-Mediterranean palaeoenvironmental research, their potential remains largely unexplored in the southern Levant region. In this study, we generate a new, high-resolution multi-proxy record for the last ca. 9000 cal. yr BP, supported by diatom data and key biological, mineralogical and geochemical indicators preserved in a 17.8-m-long sediment sequence recovered from Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee), Israel. During the Holocene, well-correlated shifts in the diatom, minero-geochemical and palynological data indicate marked lake-level variation over time as well as changes in the trophic state of Lake Kinneret. Our results are particularly important in improving the reconstruction of Holocene lake-level variation, and thus past moisture availability. Diatom-inferred lake-level oscillations correlate well with the output from climatic models from the Levantine region and clarify previous uncertainty concerning regional variation in moisture availability. The Early Holocene (from ca. 9000 to 7400 cal. yr BP) was characterized by lake-level shifts due to fluctuating dry-wet climate conditions. During the mid-Holocene (from 7400 to 2200 cal. yr BP), a stable, deep lake-level phase persisted due to high humidity. The lake level of modern Lake Kinneret not only fluctuates seasonally with available moisture, but has also been influenced for ca. 2000 years by the impacts of water abstraction for human consumption and agriculture. Over the last 9000 cal. yr BP, the trophic state of Lake Kinneret has changed from an oligotrophic to a meso- to eutrophic environment, mainly triggered by increased human impact from around 2200 cal. yr BP onwards. The lake's ecosystem status was not strongly affected by the documented major changes in human occupation patterns during the mid-Holocene, when a relatively stable environment persisted.

AB  - Charcoal is a heterogeneous material exhibiting a diverse range of properties. This variability represents a serious challenge in studies that use the properties of natural charcoal for reconstructing wildfires history in terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that particle size is a sufficiently robust indicator for separating forest wildfire combustion products into fractions with distinct properties. For this purpose, we examined two different forest environments affected by contrasting wildfires in terms of severity: an eucalypt forest in Australia, which experienced an extremely severe wildfire, and a Mediterranean pine forest in Italy, which burned to moderate severity. We fractionated the ash/charcoal layers collected on the ground into four size fractions (> 2, 2-1, 1-0.5, < 0.5 mm) and analysed them for mineral ash content, elemental composition, chemical structure (by IR spectroscopy), fuel source and charcoal reflectance (by reflected-light microscopy), and chemical/thermal recalcitrance (by chemical and thermal oxidation).
   At both sites, the finest fraction (< 0.5 mm) had, by far, the greatest mass. The C concentration and C/N ratio decreased with decreasing size fraction, while pH and the mineral ash content followed the opposite trend. The coarser fractions showed higher contribution of amorphous carbon and stronger recalcitrance. We also observed that certain fuel types were preferentially represented by particular size fractions. We conclude that the differences between ash/charcoal size fractions were most likely primarily imposed by fuel source and secondarily by burning conditions. Size fractionation can therefore serve as a valuable tool to characterise the forest wildfire combustion products, as each fraction displays a narrower range of properties than the whole sample. We propose the mineral ash content of the fractions as criterion for selecting the appropriate number of fractions to analyse. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Individual-based models (IBMs) predict how dynamics at higher levels of biological organization emerge from individual-level processes. This makes them a particularly useful tool for ecotoxicology, where the effects of toxicants are measured at the individual level but protection goals are often aimed at the population level or higher. However, one drawback of IBMs is that they require significant effort and data to design for each species. A solution would be to develop IBMs for chemical risk assessment that are based on generic individual-level models and theory. Here we show how one generic theory, Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, can be used to extrapolate the effect of toxicants measured at the individual level to effects on population dynamics. DEB is based on first principles in bioenergetics and uses a common model structure to model all species. Parameterization for a certain species is done at the individual level and allows to predict population-level effects of toxicants for a wide range of environmental conditions and toxicant concentrations. We present the general approach, which in principle can be used for all animal species, and give an example using Daphnia magna exposed to 3,4-dichloroaniline. We conclude that our generic approach holds great potential for standardized ecological risk assessment based on ecological models. Currently, available data from standard tests can directly be used for parameterization under certain circumstances, but with limited extra effort standard tests at the individual would deliver data that could considerably improve the applicability and precision of extrapolation to the population level. Specifically, the measurement of a toxicant's effect on growth in addition to reproduction, and presenting data over time as opposed to reporting a single EC50 or dose response curve at one time point.

AB  - Climate change exerts direct effects on ecosystems but has additional indirect effects due to changes in agricultural practice. These include the increased use of pesticides, changes in the areas that are cultivated, and changes in the crops cultivated. It is well known that pesticides, and in particular insecticides, affect aquatic ecosystems adversely. To implement effective mitigation measures it is necessary to identify areas that are affected currently and those that will be affected in the future. As a consequence, we predicted potential exposure to insecticide (insecticide runoff potential, RP) under current conditions (1990) and under a model scenario of future climate and land use (2090) using a spatially explicit model on a continental scale, with a focus on Europe. Space-for-time substitution was used to predict future levels of insecticide application, intensity of agricultural land use, and cultivated crops. To assess the indirect effects of climate change, evaluation of the risk of insecticide exposure was based on a trait-based, climate-insensitive indicator system (SPEAR, SPEcies At Risk). To this end, RP and landscape characteristics that are relevant for the recovery of affected populations were combined to estimate the ecological risk (ER) of insecticides for freshwater communities. We predicted a strong increase in the application of, and aquatic exposure to, insecticides under the future scenario, especially in Central and Northern Europe. This, in turn, will result in a severe increase in ER in these regions. Hence, the proportion of stream sites adjacent to arable land that do not meet the requirements for good ecological status as defined by the EU Water Framework Directive will increase (from 33% to 39% for the EU-25 countries), in particular in the Scandinavian and Baltic countries (from 6% to 19%). Such spatially explicit mapping of risk enables the planning of adaptation and mitigation strategies including vegetated buffer strips and nonagricultural recolonization zones along streams.

AB  - Aghbolagh copper deposit is located in the southwest of West Azarbaijan Province, 10 km north of Oshnavieh city. Most of the existing rock outcrops in the area include Cambrian deposits (carbonated and clastic deposits). These deposits are metamorphosed by intrusive-granite masses (skarn-genesis). The infiltration of the mineralization solution at distances beyond contact and inside the sandstone sequences has resulted in the formation of copper ore veins. For microscopic and geochemical studies, 21 thin sections, and 22 doubly-polished cross-sections, 22 XRD specimens, 22 ICP-MS specimens, and three samples for analysis of 10 oxides were analyzed by Zarazma Corporation. In the study of the fluids involved, measurements were made using a Linkham THMSG600 heater and freezer plate, mounted on a polarized microscope with a separate stage and Olympus model. Studies on quartz minerals (3 samples) and garnet minerals (2 samples) were performed on five polished double sections by micro-thermometry measurements on 30 inclusion in quartz mineral and 15 inclusion in garnet mineral at Rizkavan Land Company. The results show that the La/Y ratio, which is a proper indicator for the pH conditions of the formation environment of ore deposit, in Aghbolagh deposit is a range from 0.09 to 2.26. The granite mass has the highest amount, and the skarn zone represents two types of conditions. Type 1: Section where the La/Y> 1 ratio observed in samples close to the skarn mass and ore. Type 2: Part where the ratio La/Y <1 is close to marble lithology. In the case of a vein deposit, the samples have mineralization under alkaline conditions, and other samples show acidic conditions. The examination of fluid inclusions determined two main groups of fluids in this mineralization system. Group 1: Supersaturated fluids of salt, which is the origin of halite multiphase inclusions in the garnet ore during the progressive skarn alteration process. Group 2: Salt-saturated fluids, which are the source of fluid-rich two-phase intermediates in the garnet and quartz minerals, and have been effective in regressive alteration in the skarn system.

AB  - There is a problem for providing financial security, investment attractiveness and competitiveness of energy sector enterprises in complex and dynamic conditions of Ukrainian electricity market, gain of crisis situations, magnification of competition and complexity of internal business processes. Modern tendencies of gain the crisis situations in electric energy market are determined the importance and necessity for using the instruments of financial anti-crisis management in enterprises. One of them is estimation financial condition of enterprises. Its application will allow to develop the system of anti-crisis measures for enterprises financial management and to provide their financial security, investment attractiveness and competitiveness in modern economic conditions. The purpose of this publication is to develop the methodical approach to estimate the financial situation level and the depth crisis of energy sector enterprises in Ukraine. To achieve the purpose the following tasks were posed and solved: find the indicators of enterprise financial situation; determine normative values for financial situation indicators of energy sector enterprises in Ukraine; estimate financial situation complex integral indicator of energy sector enterprises in Ukraine; find out level and crisis type of energy sector enterprises in Ukraine. In this publication the methodical approach to determine the financial situation level and the crisis depth of energy sector enterprises in Ukraine has been proposed. Its distinctive feature from existing ones is: setting normative values for 22 financial situation indicators and crisis levels for energy sector enterprises in Ukraine. It is established that activity problems of energy sector enterprises in Ukraine are: fixed assets depreciation, low liquidity, shortage of net working capital, unprofitability. It was revealed that during 2012-2017 only 12.20% of energy sector enterprises in Ukraine were in favourable financial situation; 19.51% were in destabilization; 19.51% were in pre-crisis; 14.63% were in crisis and 34.15%were in catastrophic. The enterprises become very sensitive to negative factors effects of internal and external environment in crisis situations. It influences the choice of ineffective anti-crisis measures and deepening crisis situation. Therefore, there is advisability to estimate financial condition and to search improvement areas of financial component of enterprises anti-crisis management. This will increase effectiveness of anti-crisis measures management of energy sector enterprises in Ukraine.

AB  - QuestionsWhat is the effect of grazing on seedling recruitment and seedling establishment? To what extent is grazing dependent on local habitat conditions?
   Locationesky Kras (Czech Karst), central Bohemia, Czech Republic.
   MethodsIn 2005, grazing was reintroduced on formerly grazed dry grassland. Twelve blocks of grazed and control plots were established. Seedlings of dicotyledonous plants were observed three times a year for 4yrs, for a total of ten censuses. We tested the effects of grazing on seedling recruitment (entry of new individuals to the seedling stage) as well as seedling establishment (survival of seedlings for 1yr after initial emergence). In addition, we explored the effect of soil depth - the most important environmental variable at our study site - on seedling response to grazing. The effects of grazing, soil depth and season on seedling number in plots were tested with generalized mixed effect models with a Poisson distribution. The effect of grazing on species composition was tested with canonical correspondence analysis.
   ResultsGrazing had a significant positive effect on seedling recruitment. Grazing affected the number of seedlings and species composition and facilitated the presence of dry grassland species. Seedlings of xerophilous species were primarily found in grazed plots, while control plots contained species preferring higher, closed sward. Grazing explained only 1.2% of the total variation in composition of recruited seedlings. We presume that the main factor determining species composition could be dispersal limitation. Grazing increased the number of recruited seedlings by 10.55%. The final number of established seedlings was unaffected by grazing. Furthermore, the interaction of grazing with soil depth had a significant positive effect on seedling recruitment, thus showing that the effect of grazing strongly depends on habitat conditions at the specific microsite within our location.
   ConclusionsOur results indicate that predicting higher generative reproduction on pastures based on a larger number of seedlings may be misleading if the species are limited by establishment - but not recruitment - as at our study site. Furthermore, our findings show that varying habitat conditions on small spatial scales can modify the impact of management on seedling recruitment and establishment.

AB  - Participation in private tutoring has been a global educational phenomenon and is especially prevalent in China. The present study conducted a student-report questionnaire and collected school reports of mathematical achievement to track a year of the longitudinal variation of private tutoring and obtained an analysis of the impact of metacognition on private tutoring participation and its moderating effects between environment-related and initial indicators and mathematical private tutoring participation. The empirical results of this study showed that metacognitive level for learning process monitoring, family economic condition, and mathematics achievement could impact the decision to participate in private tutoring. The results also showed that family economic condition could moderate the effect of metacognitive level for learning process monitoring on the decision to participate in private tutoring. Practical implications for educational competent department and the schoolteachers were discussed.

AB  - The oral cavity being one of the important opening encounter huge number of microorganisms via air, water and food. Some of them establish, grow and multiply, form communities inside the cavity. The selection and growth of these microorganisms depend upon the physiochemical environment in the cavity. Various molecules of the host and resident microorganisms are responsible for the environmental conditions. Literatures indicate that change in this molecular content in the cavity may likely change the microbial communities in it. Therefore, in case of various diseased conditions/changed food habit may invite changes in microorganisms inside the oral cavity. Thus association of certain microorganisms or increased number of certain microorganisms in the oral cavity may be a good indicator for disease diagnosis.

AB  - We conducted a detailed study of the morphology of diamond crystals partially dissolved in a water-bearing kimberlite melt at pressure of 6.3 GPa, temperature of 1400 degrees C, and two oxygen fugacities (fO(2)) corresponding to the Re-ReO2 buffer and near the magnetite-hematite (MH) buffer. The triangular etch pits on the {111} faces, which formed during experimental diamond dissolution, were found to completely correspond to negative trigons on natural diamond crystals in the shape and sidewalls inclination angle. Furthermore, two experimental fO(2) values were associated with two relief types of the rounded tetrahexahedroid surfaces typical of natural rounded diamonds. Therefore, the surface microrelief on rounded natural diamond crystals was concluded to be an indicator of the redox conditions of natural diamond resorption.

AB  - [1] Hydroxylamine (NH(2)OH) is an intermediate of the marine nitrogen cycle and in marine environments dissolved NH(2)OH is short-lived. In order to investigate the distribution of NH(2)OH under varying oxygen conditions, its seasonal variability was investigated on a monthly basis from July 2005 to May 2006 at the time series station Boknis Eck located in the Eckernforde Bay (southwestern Baltic Sea). NH(2)OH concentrations were generally low and close to the detection limit. However, a pronounced increase was observed after the seasonal thermohaline stratification period with low oxygen/anoxic conditions in the deep layers was terminated in November 2005. The increase of NH(2)OH was associated with the re-oxygenation of the water column. We conclude that NH(2)OH was produced in-situ during nitrification. We suggest that the detection of significant amounts of NH(2)OH can be used as an indicator for a "fresh" nitrifying system.

AB  - To understand the performance implications of corporate strategies as conditioned by business group affiliations, we analyze the relation between corporate diversification and performance for 889 Indian firms. We find that diversified firms perform significantly worse than focused firms and that there exists a significant negative relation between the degree of diversification and firm performance. A comparative analysis of firms affiliated with Indian business groups and those affiliated with MNCs indicates that the sources of negative impact of diversification on performance are conditioned by the nature of a firm's affiliation. For multinational affiliates, diversification is associated with poor asset quality and asset management, which is an indicator of possible agency conflict. For domestic business group affiliates, diversification is associated with cost inefficiencies and poor performance. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
LA  - English
AB  - The operation of an on-load tap-changer (OLTC) on a high-voltage power transformer produces a vibration signal that consists of a series of well-defined transients. Due to the harmonic and non-stationary nature of transient. vibration signals, the traditional frequency and time-frequency techniques are not effective for characterising this type of vibration signal. The time domain features such as delays in time between transients, and the number and strengths of transients are more important for the assessment of the OLTC condition; This paper details the development of an OLTC vibration signal characterisation technique using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The CWT, due to its capability of multi-scale localisation in the time domain, is an effective tool in extracting the essential features from the original signals. These features are utilised to provide reliable indications of the health of the equipment. Signals from real plant are used to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed technique.

AB  - In the context of increasing climate change, fishery-based livelihoods as major means of income and well-beings for millions of population in coastal communities around the world are most affected. Yet, available information how fishery-based livelihood system at local level are vulnerable to climate change, especially in developing countries is very limited. Using an indicator-based vulnerability assessment framework, this study examined the household-level vulnerability of fishery-based livelihoods in two coastal communities in Central Vietnam. The results showed that the nature and degree of livelihood vulnerability to climate change among fishing households depend on their own characteristics and conditions as well as accessibility to livelihood diversification opportunities. Developing appropriate adaptation policies and coastal management measures to reduce livelihood vulnerability should enhance positive indicators of household's adaptive capacity and create a better environment for alternative livelihood opportunities.

AB  - In this age of rapid biodiversity loss, we must continue to refine our approaches to describing variation in life on Earth. Combining knowledge and research tools from multiple disciplines is one way to better describe complex natural systems. Understanding plant community diversity requires documenting both pattern and process. We must first know which species exist, and where (i.e., taxonomic and biogeographic patterns), before we can determine why they exist there (i.e., ecological and evolutionary processes). Floristic botanists often use collections-based approaches to elucidate biodiversity patterns, while plant ecologists use hypothesis-driven statistical approaches to describe underlying processes. Because of these different disciplinary histories and research goals, floristic botanists and plant ecologists often remain siloed in their work. Here, using a case study from an urban greenway in Colorado, USA, we illustrate that the collections-based, opportunistic sampling of floristic botanists is highly complementary to the transect- or plot-based sampling of plant ecologists. We found that floristic sampling captured a community species pool four times larger than that captured using ecological transects, with rarefaction and non-parametric species estimation indicating that it would be prohibitive to capture the "true" community species pool if constrained to sampling within transects. We further illustrate that the discrepancy in species pool size between approaches led to a different interpretation of the greenway's ecological condition in some cases (e.g., transects missed uncommon cultivated species escaping from nearby gardens) but not others (e.g., plant species distributions among functional groups were similar between species pools). Finally, we show that while using transects to estimate plant relative abundances necessarily trades off with a fuller assessment of the species pool, it is an indispensable indicator of ecosystem health, as evidenced by three non-native grasses contributing to 50% of plant cover along the highly modified urban greenway. We suggest that actively fostering collaborations between floristic botanists and ecologists can create new insights into the maintenance of species diversity at the community scale.

AB  - Lake Bangong Co is a special lake in western Tibet, with characteristics of increased salinity from the eastern area to the western area. Due to its remote location and poor environmental conditions, there are few background data on the water environment of this lake. In this study, the water chemical composition of Lake Bangong Co was studied, and the concentration levels, distribution characteristics, and pollution sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalic acid esters (PAEs), and metals (As, Pb, Cr, Mn, Cu, Cd, Ni, and Zn) were investigated. The hydrochemical characteristics of the lake showed significant spatial differences. Conductivity, salinity, degree of mineralization, total hardness, Cl-, and SO42- generally increased from the eastern part to the western part. Most water quality parameters met the class III standards of the Chinese surface water standards; however, the Cl- and SO42- concentrations in the western part exceeded the surface water standard limits. sigma PAH and sigma PAE concentrations in lake water have no significant relationship with hydrochemical parameters. Among the 16 target PAHs, 4 PAH monomers with a (5 + 6)-ring were not detected in the lake water. The main sources of PAHs included emissions from biomass combustion, petroleum volatilization, and automobile exhaust. Six PAE monomers were detected at all sampling sites with relatively low concentrations, and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) were the main pollutants. The main source of PAEs was domestic waste, which might be related to increasing human activities in this area recently. In general, the concentrations of metals in the water of Lake Bangong Co were lower than those in the regions affected by anthropogenic activities except As. The results of PCA showed that As, Cu, and Cr mainly originated from natural sources; Pb, Mn, and Cr came from both natural and anthropogenic sources; and Cd was highly likely from anthropogenic sources.

AB  - Arsenic (As) in the environment is of concern due to its strong toxicity and high risks to the ecosystems and humans. In this study, soil samples across China collected in 2011 and 2016 were used to determine the concentrations of arsenic in arable soils. The median concentration of arsenic in surface soils was 9.7 mg/kg. The inventory of arsenic in the Chinese agricultural surface soils was estimated to be 3.7 x 10(6) tons. In general, arsenic contamination was found higher in South and Northeast China than in other regions, with means of 18.7 and 15.8 mg/kg, respectively. Vertically, arsenic concentrations were higher in top layer (0-15 cm) soils (median of 9.8 mg/kg) and decreased with soil depth (medians of 8.9 mg/kg at 15-30 cm and 8.0 mg/kg at 30-45 cm). By comparing with published data, an increasing accumulation trend over the past decades was found and this enhancement was positively related with the long-term application of fertilizers in agricultural practice, especially phosphate fertilizers. Soil pH was found to affect the movement of arsenic in soil, and high-pH conditions enhanced the pool of arsenic. The ecological risk assessment revealed that arsenic in Chinese agricultural soil posed a low risk to the ecosystem. Regarding human health, the mean hazard indices (HIs) of arsenic were below 1, suggesting an absence of non-carcinogenic risks. In addition, the cancer risks of arsenic in all soil samples were within the acceptable range (below 1 x 10(-4)), indicating low to very low risks to the exposed population. Findings from this study are valuable to provide effective management options for risk avoidance and to control the persistent accumulation of arsenic in the agriculture sector across the world.

AB  - Our study is focused on native spontaneous species of saline ecosystems Plantago maritima. Plants were cultivated at several salt concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mM NaCl) in a glass greenhouse under semi-controlled conditions. Growth parameters, water parameters and ionic status were determined and they were used as criteria to assess the response of P. maritima under a salinity gradient. Catalase, guaiacaol and ascobate peroxidase activities, total protein and proline were also determined. Our results show that P. maritima is a facultative halophyte capable of expressing its maximum growth potential at relatively low concentrations of salt (less than 3 gl(-1) NaCl). At high doses of salt (concentrations > 200 mM), the decrease in the growth of P. maritima is associated to a decrease in the uptake of K. There is a disruption of the water intake of their organs and therefore results an invasion of the cytoplasm by Na+ toxic ion. However, stressed plants use K+ more sparingly. They invest especially in the production of biomass expressed by the dry weight of the shoots, and they use Na+ and proline for osmotic adjustment. The halophyte studied is able to accumulate high levels of proline in response to increasing salt concentration. The accumulation of the amino compound, mainly in roots, is interpreted as an indicator of salt tolerance. Additionally, a significant correlation between the tolerance of the plants to salinity and the activity of several antioxidant enzymes has been observed. Hence, we suggest the possibility of using these activities as a biochemical indicator for salt tolerance in P. maritima. Our study points out two types of biomarkers of salt exposure: enzymatic biomarkers in the leaves and proline content in the roots. Both did show very good correlation with salt exposure, and thus may be considered good biomarkers of exposure with a very good dose-response relationship. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biotic and Abiotic Pathways of Phosphorus Cycling in Minerals and Sediments: Insights from Oxygen Isotope Ratios in Phosphate
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - WATER
KW  - LAKE
AB  - A key question to address in the development of oxygen isotope ratios in phosphate (delta O-18(p)) as a tracer of biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus in ancient and modern environments is the nature of isotopic signatures associated with uptake and cycling of mineral-bound phosphate by microorganisms. Here, we present experimental results aimed at understanding the biotic and abiotic pathways of P cycling during biological uptake of phosphate sorbed to ferrihydrite and the selective uptake of sedimentary phosphate phases by Escherichia coli and Marinobacter aquaeolei. Results indicate that a significant fraction of ferrihydrite-bound phosphate is biologically available. The fraction of phosphate taken up by E. coli attained an equilibrium isotopic composition in a short time (<50 h) due to efficient O-isotope exchange (between O in PO4 and O in water; that is, actual breaking and reforming of P-O bonds) (biotic pathway). The difference in isotopic composition between newly equilibrated aqueous and residual sorbed phosphate groups promoted the ion exchange (analogous to isotopic mixing) of intact phosphate ions (abiotic pathway) so that this difference gradually became negligible. In sediment containing different P phases, E. coli extracted loosely sorbed phosphate first, whereas M. aquaeolei preferred Fe-oxide-bound phosphate. The presence,of bacteria always imprinted a biotic isotopic signature on the P phase that was taken up and cycled. For example, the delta O-18(p) value of loosely sorbed phosphate shifted gradually toward equilibrium isotopic composition. The delta O-18(p) value of Fe-oxide-bound phosphate, however, showed only slight changes initially but, when new Fe-oxides were formed, coprecipitated/occluded phosphate retained delta O-18 values of the aqueous phosphate at the time of formation of new Fe oxides. Concentrations and isotopic compositions of authigenic and detrital phosphates did not chan e, suggesting that these phosphate phases were not utilized by bacteria. These findings support burgeoning applications of delta O-18(p) as a tracer of phosphorus cycling in sediments, soils, and aquatic environments and as an indicator of paleo- environmental conditions.

AB  - This paper presents new results from high temporal resolution observations over two years (2007 and 2008) from instrumented moorings deployed in the central North Sea, at the Oyster Grounds and on the northern slope of Dogger Bank (North Dogger). The water column was stratified in the summer at both sites, leading to limited exchange of the water in the bottom mixed layer. Data from these moorings revealed the variable nature of summer oxygen depletion at the Oyster Grounds. The combination of in situ and ship-based measurements allowed the physical and biological conditions leading to decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations in bottom water to be examined. In 2007 and 2008, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the bottom water at both sites was observed to decrease throughout the summer period after the onset of stratification. Depleted dissolved oxygen concentration (6.5 mg l(-1), 71% saturation) was measured at the North Dogger, a site which is not significantly influenced by anthropogenic nutrient inputs. Lower oxygen saturation (5.2 mg l(-1), 60% saturation) was measured for short durations at the Oyster Grounds. The seasonal increase in bottom water temperature accounted for 55% of the decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration at the Oyster Grounds compared to 10% at North Dogger.
   Dissolved oxygen concentration in bottom water at the Oyster Grounds was shown to be strongly influenced by short term events including storms and pulses of particulate organic matter input. In contrast, dissolved oxygen concentration in bottom water at the North Dogger reflected longer seasonal processes such as a gradual temperature increase over the summer and a more steady supply of particulate organic matter to the bottom mixed layer. The differences between the study sites shows the need for an improved understanding of the mechanisms driving these processes if the use of oxygen in marine management and ensuring ecosystem health is to be meaningful and successful in the future. These high frequency observations provide greater understanding of the nature of the depletion in bottom oxygen concentration in the North Sea.

AB  - Brazil's Tucurui Dam provides valuable lessons for improving decision-making on major public works in Amazonia and elsewhere. Together with social impacts, which were reviewed in a companion paper, the project's environmental costs are substantial. Monetary costs include costs of construction and maintenance and opportunity costs of natural resources (such as timber) and of the money invested by the Brazilian government. Environmental costs include forest loss, leading to both loss of natural ecosystems and to greenhouse gas emissions. Aquatic ecosystems are heavily affected by the blockage of fish migration and by creation of anoxic environments. Decay of vegetation left in the reservoir creates anoxic water that can corrode turbines, as well as producing methane and providing conditions for methylation of mercury. Defoliants were considered for removing forest in the submergence area but plans were aborted amid a public controversy. Another controversy surrounded impacts of defoliants used to prevent regrowth along the transmission line. Mitigation measures included archaeological and faunal salvage and creation of a "gene bank" on an island in the reservoir. Decision-making in the case of Tucurui was virtually uninfluenced by environmental studies, which were done concurrently with construction. The dam predates Brazil's 1986 requirement of an Environmental Impact Assessment. Despite limitations, research results provide valuable information for future darns. Extensive public-relations use of the research effort and of mitigation measures such as faunal salvage were evident. Decision-making was closely linked to the influence of construction firms, the military, and foreign financial interests in both the construction project and the use of the resulting electrical Fewer (most of which is used for aluminum smelting). Social and environmental costs received virtually no consideration when decisions were made, an outcome facilitated by a curtain of secrecy surrounding many aspects of the project. Despite improvements in Brazil's system of environmental impact assessment since the Tucurui reservoir was filled in 1984, many essential features of the decision-making system remain unchanged.

AB  - Since the early 1970s, epizootics of disease in fish, particularly epizootics of tumors, have been used as indicators of the "health" of the ecosystems in the Great Lakes. The justification for such an approach was based on contemporary evidence that demonstrates a chemical etiology for most known animal tumors. Consequently, clustering of neoplastic lesions in populations of fish in a particular locale might provide a means of identifying "hot spot" sources of waterborne carcinogens, Such an approach has advantages over reliance on chemical screening, since it does not require a priori knowledge of the chemistry of the biologically active factor(s).
   Pacific salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) have been introduced in to the Great Lakes since the early 1960s. These salmon have been studied with regard to their value as "sentinel" organisms. This paper reviews the data available in which these species have been used in the exploration of the presence of environmen tal factors that adversely affect endocrine (specifically thyroid)function, reproductive success or developmental processes.
   All Great Lakes salmon suffer an epizootic of thyroid hyperplasia that appears To have an environmental etiology other than that of iodide deficiency. Indirect evidence is indicative of the presence of goitrogens in the Great Lakes. In order to determine whether such goitrogens are accumulated in the adult salmon, Great Lakes salmon diets were fed to fish (coho salmon and rainbow trout) and rodents (rats and mice). The recipient fish did not develop thyroid lesions, suggesting that the putative factor(s) effecting thyroid enlargement in the wild salmon is not bioaccumulated in their body tissues. However the salmon-fed rodents did exhibit thyroid lesions, which may be associated with the halo genated aromatic hydrocarbon mb that was present in the Great Lakes salmon.
   Some of the Pacific salmon stocks in the Great Lake exhibit a variety of reproductive problems. The paper reviews what is known of these conditions, and discusses the evidence for and against an environmental etiology.

AB  - After thirty years of the framework legislation for parks, their effect on the territories and social communities that created new national park institutes in 1991 was investigated. Some significant indicators were used, such as demography, the structure of records and income conditions, and it emerged that the National Parks did not lead to a clear separation from the dynamics that were already in effect after World War II, and which are typical of the disadvantaged areas in which they are established, in all of that time. There are undoubtedly many causes for this, and they also differ from park to park. In a country like Italy, these certainly depend on the geographic location, since significant socio-economic differences are found along its latitudinal line.

AB  - Aquatic organisms have physico-chemical as well as flow habitat requirements. There are three main kinds of data which are useful in quantifying these requirements: chemical data which describe in-stream chemical conditions; ecotoxicity data which describe the tolerances of organisms and their in-stream responses to changing chemical concentrations; and biomonitoring data which describe the distribution and composition of communities. However, it is only by linking these data that organism requirements can be adequately elucidated and translated into resource quality objectives. This paper describes the methods for linking these data and their application in the integration of water quality into environmental flow assessments and the assessment of the water quality Reserve. A case study is presented to demonstrate the methodology. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Within the middle Ogooue valley (Gabon), the Lope depression appears as a very particular area with savannas landscape surrounded by rain forest. Such a pattern results from the low annual rainfall and also extensive surface erosion. Several sedimentologic analyses, radiocarbon dates on archaeological levels, delta(13)C isotopic data of residual organic matter led us to suggest too bad conditions for a forest extension and think that savannas ecosystem has probably always existed in this region during the late Pleistocene and Holocene times and has been seriously influenced by human destabilizations since 9000 years BP and probably for long times before.

AB  - In order to facilitate a common understanding, on-going debate and increasing application of ecological risk assessment (ERA) in South Africa, the ERA process of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been summarised and evaluated for South African conditions, Many of the individual steps in the process have been interpreted and reworded in order to improve communication of the concepts. The basic process is unchanged though a few minor changes are recommended as improvements. A comparison is also made with integrated environmental management (IEM). It is noted that ERA addresses many of the key principles underpinning IEM, including consultation with interested and affected parties which provides an opportunity for public and specialist input into the decision-making process. However, there are some differences though more in degree than in principle. Of importance is that the ERA framework provides explicitly for quantification of all aspects of an assessment in an IEM procedure.

AB  - Yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata fed a non-fish meal diet and control fish fed a standard fish meal diet were reared in neighboring net-cages under the same natural environmental conditions. The growth and food consumption of the fish fed the non-fish meal diet (NFM fish) were similar to the fish fed the control diet (control fish). Mortality due to a natural infection with Pasteurella piscicida occurred among NFM fish, but not among control fish during 55 days of feeding experiment. Plasma total cholesterol, free cholesterol and phospholipid of NFM fish were significantly lower than those of control fish. This result indicates that the decrease in the levels of plasma lipid components may be a good indicator of reduced disease resistance in yellowtail.

AB  - A shot description of the imposer condition in Hydrobia ulvae is presented. In this species four different imposer stages with two types of development were identified. In laboratory experiments the mud snail accumulates TBT in a time and concentration-dependent manner. Increasing biological indices e.g. VDSI (vas deferens sequence index), female penis length (FPL) and the imposer incidence are significantly correlated with increasing TBT body burden. The percentage of sterile females depends on the TBT contamination of sediments. An interspecific comparison of the mud snail H. ulvae and the periwinkle Littorina littorea elucidates that the mud snail is the more sensitive species at lower environmental TBT concentrations.

AB  - The Menilite facies, representing the most prolific hydrocarbon source rocks in the Carpathian fold and thrust belt, has been studied in two outcrop sections of the Vrancea and Tarca?u Nappes (Eastern Romania) with the aim of determining the depositional environment during the Early Oligocene in the Vrancea and Tarca?u sub-basins of the Central Paratethys. The biomarker composition indicates spatial variability in organic matter sources with mainly algal (particularly diatoms and dinoflagellates) and bacterial contributions in both sub-basins. This is reflected by the occurrence of such biomarkers as triaromatic dinosteroids, C25 highly branched isoprenoid thiophenes, marine n-alkanes, hopanoids and monomethyl alkanes. Solely in the Vrancea domain, the input of terrigenous organic matter of higher plant origin can be anticipated from the presence of abietane-class biomarkers (conifer-derived) and oleanane (angiosperm-derived). Distinct nutrient availability related to different positions of individual sub-basins (i.e. shallower, temporarily eutrophic Vrancea sub-basin vs. open-marine mesotrophic Tarca?u domain) is reflected by different paleoproductivity indicators, such as the total organic carbon content, hydrogen index and 17?-hopanes to steranes ratio.
   Water column stratification with bottom water anoxia enhanced by bacterial sulfate reduction stretching into the chemocline, at least intermittently, is expressed by a characteristic tiny pyrite framboid distribution and the lack of bioturbation. However, molecular indicators (Pr/Ph ratio, C35 homohopane index) imply fluctuations of redox conditions with the dominance of dysoxic conditions, which may suggest the occasional oxidation of bottom waters linked to local upwelling. Early diagenetic organic matter transformations such as photodegradation taking place in the oxidised upper part of the water column could also have affected the biomarker distributions. The presence of aryl isoprenoids and Me,i-Bu-maleimides indicates periods of euxinic conditions within the photic zone only in the Vrancea sub-basin during the deposition of the Lower Menilite Member. This is probably related to freshwater incursions from the adjacent, at least partly emerged forebulge, as suggested by a high MTTC ratio and the occurrence of higher plant-derived organic matter.

AB  - Shorefaces can display strong facies variability and integration of sedimentology and ichnology provides a high resolution model to identify variations among strongly storm-dominated (high energy), moderately storm affected (intermediate energy), and weakly storm-affected (low energy) shoreface deposits. In addition, ichnology has proved to be of help to delineate parasequences as trace-fossil associations are excellent indicators of environmental conditions which typically change along the depositional profile. Shallow-marine deposits and associated ichnofaunas from the Mulichinco Formation (Valanginian, Lower Cretaceous) in Puerta Curaco, Neuquen Basin, western Argentina, were analyzed to evaluate stress factors on shoreface benthos and parasequence architecture.
   During storm-dominated conditions, the Skolithos Ichnofacies prevails within the offshore transition and lower shoreface represented by assemblages dominated by Thalassinoides isp. and Ophiomorpha irregulaire. Under weakly storm-affected conditions, the Cruziana Ichnofacies is recognized, characterized by assemblages dominated by Thalassinoides isp. and Gyrochorte comosa in the offshore transition, and by Gyrochorte comosa within the lower shoreface. Storm-influenced conditions yield wider ichnologic variability, showing elements of both ichnofacies.
   Storm influence on sedimentation is affected by both allogenic (e.g. tectonic subsidence, sea-level, and sediment influx) and autogenic (e.g. hydrodynamic) controls at both parasequence and infra-parasequence scales. Four distinct types of parasequences were recognized, strongly storm-dominated, moderately storm-affected, moderately storm-affected-strongly fair-weather reworked, and weakly storm-affected, categorized based on parasequence architectural variability derived from varying degrees of storm and fair-weather wave influence. The new type of shoreface described here, the moderately storm-affected-strongly fair-weather reworked shoreface, features storm deposits reworked thoroughly by fair-weather waves. During fair-weather wave reworking, elements of the Cruziana Ichnofacies are overprinted upon relict elements of the Skolithos Ichnofacies from previous storm induced deposition. This type of shoreface, commonly overlooked in past literature, expands our understanding of the sedimentary dynamics and stratigraphic architecture in a shoreface susceptible to various parasequence and intra-parasequence scale degrees of storm and fair-weather wave influence.

AB  - Spinosad is a bacterially derived insect control agent consisting of two active compounds, spinosyns A and D. The objective of this paper is to describe the environmental fate of spinosad in aquatic systems. To this end, several studies performed to meet regulatory requirements are used to study the fate and degradation in individual environmental media. Specifically, investigations of abiotic (hydrolysis and photolysis) and biotic (aerobic and anaerobic aquatic) processes are described. Understanding developed from the laboratory-based studies has been tested and augmented by an outdoor microcosm study. Understanding of aquatic fate is a building block for a complete environmental safety assessment of spinosad products (Cleveland, C. B.; Mayes, M. A.; Cryer, S. A. Pest Manag. Sci. 2001, 58, 70-84). From individual investigations, the following understanding of dissipation emerges: (1) Aqueous photolysis of spinosad is rapid (observed half-lives of <1 up to 2 days in summer sunlight) and will be the primary route of degradation in aquatic systems exposed to sunlight. (2) Biotic transformations contribute to spinosad's dissipation, but less so than photolysis; they will be of primary importance only in the absence of light. (3) Spinosad partitions rapidly (within a few days) from water to organic matter and soil/sediment in aquatic systems but not so rapidly as to replace sunlight as the primary route of dissipation. (4) Abiotic hydrolysis is relatively unimportant compared to other dissipation routes, except under highly basic (artificial) conditions and even then observed half-lives are similar to8 months. Degradation pathways are understood are follows: (1) Degradation primarily proceeds by loss of the forosamine sugar and reduction of the 13,14-bond on the macrolide ring under aqueous photolytic conditions. (2) Degradation to several other compounds occurs through biotic degradation. Degradation under anaerobic conditions primarily involves changes and substitutions in the rhamnose ring, eventually followed by complete loss of the rhamnose ring. Degradation under aerobic conditions was more extensive (to smaller compounds) with the loss of both the forosamine and rhamnose sugars to diketone spinosyn aglycon degradates. (3) Hydrolytic degradation involves loss of the forosamine sugar and water and reduction on the macrolide ring to a double bond at the 16,1 7-position.

AB  - Climate change (CC) can alter the configuration of marine ecosystems; however, ecosystem response and resilience to change are usually case-specific. The effect of CC on the demersal resources of the Aegean Sea (east Mediterranean Sea) was investigated during the past six decades applying a combination of multivariate analysis, non-additive modeling and the Integrated Resilience Assessment (IRA) framework. We focused on the study of: (i) the biological "system" complex, using proxies of biomass (landings per unit of capacity) for 12 demersal taxa, and (ii) the environmental "stressor" complex, described by 12 abiotic variables. Pronounced changes have occurred in both the environmental and biological system over the studied period. The majority of the environmental stressors exhibited strikingly increasing trends (temperature, salinity, primary production indices) with values started exceeding the global historical means during late 1980s-early 1990s. It is suggested that the biological system exhibited a discontinuous response to CC, with two apparently climate-induced regime shifts occurring in the past 25 years. There is evidence for two-fold bifurcations and four tipping points in the system, forming a folded stability landscape with three basins of attraction. The shape of the stability landscape for the Aegean Sea's biological system suggests that while the initial state (1966-1991) was rather resilient to CC, absorbing two environmental step-changes, this was not the case for the two subsequent ones (intermediate: 1992-2002; recent: 2003-2016). Given the current trajectory of environmental change, it is highly unlikely that the biological system will ever return to its pre-1990s state, as it is entering areas of unprecedented climatic conditions and there is some evidence that the system may be even shifting toward a new state. Our approach and findings may be relevant to other marine areas of the Mediterranean and beyond, undergoing climate-driven regime shifts, and can assist to their adaptive management.

AB  - Climate change is projected to affect the hydrological cycles in China, while the effects are expected to vary spatiotemporally. Understanding the variations in water security conditions and their sensitivity to climatic variables is crucial for assessing regional ecosystem responses to climate change. In the present study, we estimated the water yield capacity, an important indicator of water security in North China (NC), at a spatial resolution of 1 km during the last two decades based on the Budyko framework and quantified the sensitivity of water yield change to climate change among different vegetation types. The results showed that the performances of the Budyko framework were reliable both at the pixel scale and across large watersheds. The annual water yield in North China was estimated to be 7.61 +/- 2.67 * 1010 m(3)/yr, with an average mean water yield (MWY) of 49.51 +/- 17.49 mm/yr. The spatial pattern of mean water yield change (MWYC) exhibited high heterogeneity; 46% of the study region was dominated by an increasing trend, while 9.84% was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Compared with temperature, the water yield capacity was more sensitive to precipitation variation. A consistent trend of variation was found in cropland between water yield and precipitation, while negative sensitivity coefficients were found in natural vegetation types. The variation in sensitivity coefficients (Swyp) in natural vegetation showed that in regions with a decrease in precipitation, the variation in water yield capacity also decreased, while in regions with an increase in precipitation from 0 to 8 mm/yr, the water yield capacity first decreased and then increased with precipitation. Our findings suggest that grass and shrubs would be more beneficial to regional water security in North China's revegetation, while afforestation would provide protection for the regional environment from extreme rainfall events.

AB  - Polychaetes are one of the most diverse groups of marine organisms, characterized by high species richness, diversity of feeding guilds, life styles, and mobility types. Marine annelids are useful indicators of ecosystem responses to changes in environmental conditions. The aim of our study was to assess the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors on functional diversity of polychaete communities in the Gulf of Guinea, a large marine ecosystem (LME) located in West Africa. This area can be considered as a model marine ecosystem affected by various human influences, such as pollution associated with the oil industry. Material was collected in 2012 across the coast of Ghana. Samples were gathered along four transects, each with six sampling stations (25-1000 m depth range). Analyses of functional richness and evenness, based on generalized linear mixed effect models and hierarchical partitioning, allowed for complex assessments of the interactions between polychaete communities and environmental factors (e.g., sediments, total organic matter, salinity, fluorescence, oxygen, concentration of toxic metals, total hydrocarbons). Overall species richness of polychaetes was outstandingly high, with 253 species recorded. Functional richness decreased along a depth gradient, while functional evenness increased with depth, and was positively correlated with Ba content, which reached the highest values in the upper bathyal. Gravel content was an important factor in shaping functional composition of shallow water communities. High values of functional richness observed in the shallows may be an expression of high stability of this ecosystem, at the same time indicating its high resilience. Elevated concentrations of lead also influ-enced community structure at a local scale. Our study demonstrated how a complex set of factors operating along a depth gradient can influence the functional composition of communities. These results are crucial for future management of industrial and environmental protection activities in this region. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure plays an increasingly significant role in sustainable urban development planning as it provides important regulating and cultural ecosystem services. Monitoring of such dynamic and complex systems requires technological solutions which provide easy data collection, processing, and utilization at affordable costs. To meet these challenges a pilot study was conducted using a network of wireless, low cost, and multiparameter monitoring devices, which operate using Internet of Things (IoT) technology, to provide real-time monitoring of regulatory ecosystem services in the form of meaningful indicators for both human health and environmental policies. The pilot study was set in a green area situated in the center of Moscow, which is exposed to the heat island effect as well as high levels of anthropogenic pressure. Sixteen IoT devices were installed on individual trees to monitor their ecophysiological parameters from 1 July to 31 November 2019 with a time resolution of 1.5 h. These parameters were used as input variables to quantify indicators of ecosystem services related to climate, air quality, and water regulation. Our results showed that the average tree in the study area during the investigated period reduced extreme heat by 2 degrees C via shading, cooled the surrounding area by transferring 2167 +/- 181 KWh of incoming solar energy into latent heat, transpired 137 +/- 49 mm of water, sequestered 8.61 +/- 1.25 kg of atmospheric carbon, and removed 5.3 +/- 0.8 kg of particulate matter (PM10). The values of the monitored processes varied spatially and temporally when considering different tree species (up to five to ten times), local environmental conditions, and seasonal weather. Thus, it is important to use real-time monitoring data to deepen understandings of the processes of urban forests. There is a new opportunity of applying IoT technology not only to measure trees functionality through fluxes of water and carbon, but also to establish a smart urban green infrastructure operational system for management.

AB  - Understanding the ecological function of large frugivores in tropical forests is important considering their central position in seed-dispersal networks. This study illustrates the seed-dispersal effectiveness of a western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) population in Cameroon by looking at the interaction of seed quantity, species regeneration traits and the environmental characteristics of the deposition sites (sleeping sites vs. feeding trails) in order to discuss the role of gorillas within the ecosystem. The analysis of 1030 faecal samples collected over a 3-y period (September 2009-August 2012) showed that gorillas dispersed a diverse array of species (58 spp. identified), with an average of 289 intact seeds (>5 mm) d(-1) per individual. Seed damage during mouth and gut processing occurred for 12 spp., generally accounting for <5% of specific seed load. Germination trials suggested that germination success of passed seeds remained unchanged (N = 6 spp.) or improved (N = 5 spp.) after gut passage compared with hand-cleaned seeds, with one exception. Indicator species identification (IndVal method) and General Discriminant Analysis suggested that sleeping sites (N = 36), as a main type of seed deposition site, correspond to regenerating microhabitats and correspondingly degree of canopy openness is one variable discriminating significantly this type of deposition site with random locations in the forest (N = 36) used as a proxy for non-directed seed deposition on feeding trails. With a mean canopy openness of 19-27%, sleeping sites offer optimal light conditions for the seedling recruitment of non-pioneer light-demanding species, the seeds of which encompass 47.4% of the total seed load dispersed over the 3-y period. From this study, it is hypothesized that the gorilla performed directed-dispersal of some light-demanding plant species at sleeping sites, and hence, by being actively implicated in gap-phase dynamics, fulfils a valuable ecological function within its ecosystem.

AB  - BackgroundAccurate prediction of crop flowering time is required for reaching maximal farm efficiency. Several models developed to accomplish this goal are based on deep knowledge of plant phenology, requiring large investment for every individual crop or new variety. Mathematical modeling can be used to make better use of more shallow data and to extract information from it with higher efficiency. Cultivars of chickpea, Cicer arietanum, are currently being improved by introgressing wild C. reticulatum biodiversity with very different flowering time requirements. More understanding is required for how flowering time will depend on environmental conditions in these cultivars developed by introgression of wild alleles.ResultsWe built a novel model for flowering time of wild chickpeas collected at 21 different sites in Turkey and grown in 4 distinct environmental conditions over several different years and seasons. We propose a general approach, in which the analytic forms of dependence of flowering time on climatic parameters, their regression coefficients, and a set of predictors are inferred automatically by stochastic minimization of the deviation of the model output from data. By using a combination of Grammatical Evolution and Differential Evolution Entirely Parallel method, we have identified a model that reflects the influence of effects of day length, temperature, humidity and precipitation and has a coefficient of determination of R-2=0.97.ConclusionsWe used our model to test two important hypotheses. We propose that chickpea phenology may be strongly predicted by accession geographic origin, as well as local environmental conditions at the site of growth. Indeed, the site of origin-by-growth environment interaction accounts for about 14.7% of variation in time period from sowing to flowering. Secondly, as the adaptation to specific environments is blueprinted in genomes, the effects of genes on flowering time may be conditioned on environmental factors. Genotype-by-environment interaction accounts for about 17.2% of overall variation in flowering time. We also identified several genomic markers associated with different reactions to climatic factor changes. Our methodology is general and can be further applied to extend existing crop models, especially when phenological information is limited.

AB  - The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest-warming places on Earth. Elevated sea water temperatures cause glacier and sea ice melting. When icebergs melt into the ocean, it "freshens" the saltwater around them, reducing its salinity. The oceans absorb excess anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) causing decline in ocean pH, a process known as ocean acidification. Many marine organisms are specifically affected by ocean warming, freshening and acidification. Due to the sensitivity of Antarctica to global warming, using biomarkers is the best way for scientists to predict more accurately future climate change and provide useful information or ecological risk assessments. The 70-kilodalton (kDa) heat shock protein (HSP70) chaperones have been used as biomarkers of stress in temperate and tropical environments. The induction of the HSP70 genes (Hsp70) that alter intracellular proteins in living organisms is a signal triggered by environmental temperature changes. Induction of Hsp70 has been observed both in eukaryotes and in prokaryotes as response to environmental stressors including increased and decreased temperature, salinity, pH and the combined effects of changes in temperature, acidification and salinity stress. Generally, HSP70s play critical roles in numerous complex processes of metabolism; their synthesis can usually be increased or decreased during stressful conditions. However, there is a question as to whether HSP70s may serve as excellent biomarkers in the Antarctic considering the long residence time of Antarctic organisms in a cold polar environment which appears to have greatly modified the response of heat responding transcriptional systems. This review provides insight into the vital roles of HSP70 that make them ideal candidates as biomarkers for identifying resistance and resilience in response to abiotic stressors associated with climate change, which are the effects of ocean warming, freshening and acidification in Antarctic organisms.

AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) plays an important role in the hydrological functioning of wetlands. Remote sensing shows potential for the quantification and monitoring of the SMC of palustrine wetlands; however, this technique remains to be assessed across a wetland-terrestrial gradient in South Africa. The ability of the Sentinel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical sensors, which are freely available from the European Space Agency, were evaluated to predict SMC for a palustrine wetland and surrounding terrestrial areas in the grassland biome of South Africa. The percentage of volumetric water content (%VWC) was measured across the wetland and terrestrial areas of the Colbyn Wetland Nature Reserve, located in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality of the Gauteng Province, using a handheld SMT-100 soil moisture meter at a depth of 5 cm during the peak and end of the hydroperiod in 2018. The %VWC was regressed against the Sentinel imagery, using random forest, simple linear and support vector machine regression models. Random forest yielded the highest prediction accuracies in comparison to the other models. The results indicate that the Sentinel images have the potential to be used to predict SMC with a high coefficient of determination (Sentinel-1 SAR = R-2>0.9; Sentinel-2 optical = R-2>0.9) and a relatively low root mean square error (Sentinel-1 RMSE = <17%; Sentinel-2 optical = RMSE <21%). Predicted maps show higher ranges of SMC for wetlands (> 50%VWC; p<0.05) compared to terrestrial areas, and therefore SMC monitoring may benefit the inventorying of wetlands, as well as monitoring of their extent and ecological condition.
   Significance:
   The freely available and space-borne Sentinel sensors show potential for the quantification of surface soil moisture across a wetland-terrestrial gradient.
   Significant differences between the surface soil moisture of palustrine wetlands and terrestrial areas, imply that inventorying and monitoring of the extent and hydroperiod of palustrine wetlands can potentially be done.

AB  - Intermittently Closed and Open Lakes and Lagoons (ICOLLS) are important coastal systems that are periodically separated from the ocean by a sand barrier or a berm. In urban ICOLLs, continuous inputs of organic material and nutrients into coastal lagoons are contributing to eutrophic conditions that, together with natural environmental factors have implications for the resident sediment bacterial communities. We used molecular tools to investigate the ecological communities of four ICOLLs; Narrabeen, Dee Why, Curl Curl and Manly in Sydney, Australia, which have been subjected to increasing pressure from anthropogenic activities over the last century. We used targeted gene sequencing of the prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA gene to describe the bacterial diversity and community structure and discuss differences with respect to environmental factors at the ICOLL scale (e.g. size, shape, normalised N loading) and site scale (e.g. water and sediment quality) within each lagoon. Due to differences in hydrological patterns, we expected that sediment bacterial communities would be more heterogenous in displacement-dominated lagoons (Curl Curl and Manly) than the mixing-dominated lagoons (Narrabeen and Dee Why). Interestingly, we did not find strong relationships between the main bacterial groups and distance from the lagoon entrance (used as a proxy for salinity and silt) in the displacement-dominated lagoons. Moreover, we found that alpha diversity was highest in Narrabeen and Manly lagoons despite differences in lagoon size and shape. Furthermore, while bacterial community structure was similar in Curl Curl and Dee Why, communities in Manly and Narrabeen differed along temperature/TOC and salinity/silt gradients respectively. In Manly lagoon, we found relatively more anaerobic bacteria such as Epsilonbactereota which is involved in the oxidation and reduction of sulfur compounds. Moreover, we identified several bacterial taxa (including sulfur metabolising Chlorobiaceae) related to increasing TOC that could be investigated further as potential indicators of excess enrichment.

AB  - Soil aggregates are organomineral associations with a fundamental importance for soil structure and function. Litter from vegetation alters aggregate formation and stability, and polyphenols such as tannins found in leaves, roots and wood play an important role in soil biogeochemical and biological processes. However, the effect of tannins on soil physical properties remains largely unexplored. We hypothesized that tannins influence aggregate stability through their ability to (i) complex proteins in the soil and (ii) perturb the gelling property of root mucilage. Therefore, Mediterranean soil aggregates were incubated with condensed tannins, either as a pure substrate or in combination with a standard protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) and with a model root mucilage polysaccharide (polygalacturonic acid, PGA) able to form gel-like structures with divalent cations (notably Ca2+) widely present in Mediterranean calcareous soils. The changes in aggregate stability were monitored under controlled conditions, immediately after the addition of tannins, after 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months of incubation. Tannins added alone did not yield a significant effect on aggregate stability. However, modulatory effects were found when combinations of treatments occurred. Tannins positively modulated the stabilizing effect of the BSA, giving credit to our hypothesis on the stabilizing role of the tannin-protein complex forming macromolecules, thus enforcing soil particle cohesion within aggregates. However, tannins negatively altered the stabilizing effect of PGA, suggesting that the expected perturbation of the PGA gelation occurred, with detrimental consequences for aggregate stability. Over time, tannins maintained the effect of BSA, suggesting a protective effect of tannins, possibly linked to their ability to slow down the degradation of nitrogen compounds through protein binding. Overall, we showed that tannins reacted with other organic compounds resulting in specific effects on physical soil properties, thus demonstrating that tannins in soils play a role beyond their effects on biogeochemical aspects.

AB  - The mining industry is a common source of environmental metal emissions, which cause long-lasting effects in aquatic ecosystems. Metal risk assessment is challenging due to variations in metal distribution, speciation, and bioavailability. Therefore, seasonal effects must be better understood, especially in boreal regions in which seasonal changes are large. We sampled 4 Finnish lakes and sediments affected by mining for metals and geochemical characteristics in autumn and late winter, to evaluate seasonal changes in metal behavior, the importance of seasonality in risk assessment, and the sensitivity and suitability of different risk assessment methods. We compared metal concentrations in sediment, overlying water, and porewater against environmental quality guidelines (EQGs). We also evaluated the toxicity of metal mixtures using simultaneously extracted metals and an acid volatile sulfides (SEM-AVS) approach together with water quality criteria (US Environmental Protection Agency equilibrium partitioning benchmarks). Finally, site-specific risks for 3 metals (Cu, Ni, Zn) were assessed using 2 biotic ligand models (BLMs). The metal concentrations in the impacted lakes were elevated. During winter stratification, the hypolimnetic O-2 saturation levels were low (<6%) and the pH was acidic (3.5-6.5); however, abundant O-2 (>89%) and neutral pH (6.1-7.5) were found after the autumnal water overturn. Guidelines were the most conservative benchmark for showing an increased risk of toxicity in the all of the lakes. The situation remained stable between seasons. On the other hand, SEM-AVS, equilibrium partition sediment benchmarks (ESBs), and BLMs provided a clearer distinction between lakes and revealed a seasonal variation in risk among some of the lakes, which evidenced a higher risk during late winter. If a sediment risk assessment is based on the situation in the autumn, the overall risk may be underestimated. It is advisable to carry out sampling and risk assessment during periods in which metals are assumed to be the most environmentally harmful. (C) 2015 SETAC

AB  - Air handling units are usually used to maintain the thermal and humidity parameters in indoor swimming pools that are used for lap swimming and recreation. Their use throughout the year consumes much more energy than, for example, air conditioning in residential or office buildings. Their considerable energy consumption is due to the need for their continuous operation to remove moisture gains from the evaporation of water and to heat the air and cover the heat losses of the pool. It is possible to design ventilation devices in such a way that the operating costs will be reduced, and the environmental impact will be significantly reduced. In this article, six different ventilation units in which different heat sources are used to heat the ventilation air have been evaluated; the selection of which was based on the most commonly used solutions. The results of the analysis are aimed to show which of the available heat sources is the most advantageous in terms of global and operating costs, and in terms of low CO2 emissions. Indicators of both the final and primary energy consumption, as well as the operating and global costs, were determined. The recommended solution that was chosen was the one that had both the lowest cost index (18-20% lower than most ecological sources) and the low primary energy index (8-13% higher than most ecological sources). The results showed that a heat pump in the ventilation unit proved to be the most beneficial solution. Unfortunately, this solution is rarely used due to its high investment costs (20% higher). However, the results have shown that the investment cost of using an advanced air handling unit will be recouped in only two to three years. Also, the global cost for units with a heat pump proved to be the lowest, despite high investment cost.

AB  - The recent discovery of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (also known as Magallana gigas) spatfields in a Mediterranean lagoon intensely exploited for shellfish farming (Thau lagoon) revealed significant contrasts in spatial patterns of recruitment. We evaluated the processes that drive spatial patterns in oyster recruitment by comparing observed recruitment, simulated hydrodynamic connectivity and ecological variables. We hypothesized that spatial variability of recruitment depends on (1) hydrodynamic connectivity and (2) the ecology of the larval supply, settlement, metamorphosis, survival and biotic environmental parameters. We assessed recruitment at 6-8 experimental sites by larval sampling and spat collection inside and outside oyster farming areas and on an east-west gradient, from 2012-2014. Hydrodynamic connectivity was simulated using a numerical 3D transport model assessed with a Eulerian indicator. The supply of large umbo larvae did not differ significantly inside and outside oyster farming areas, whereas the supply of pediveligers to sites outside shellfish farms was structured by hydrodynamic connectivity. Inside shellfish farming zones, unfavorable conditions due to trophic competition with filter-feeders jeopardized their settlement. In this case, our results suggest loss of settlement competence by oyster larvae. This confirms our hypothesis of top-down trophic control by the oysters inside farming zones of Thau lagoon in summer that fails to meet the ecological requirements of these areas as oyster nurseries. Knowledge of oyster dispersal, connectivity and recruitment in coastal lagoons will help local development of sustainable natural spat collection. On a global scale, our method could be transposed to other basins or used for other species such as mussels, clams or scallops, to better understand the spatial patterns of bivalve recruitment. Management of the oyster industry based on natural spat collection will help develop a sustainable activity, based on locally adapted oyster strains but also by reducing the risks of transferring pathogens between basins and the global carbon footprint of this industry.

AB  - Climate warming and consequent greening of subarctic landscapes increase the availability of organic carbon to the detrital food webs in aquatic ecosystems. This may cause important shifts in ecosystem functioning through the functional feeding patterns of benthic organisms that rely differently on climatically altered carbon resources. Twenty-five subarctic lakes in Finnish Lapland across a tree line ecotone were analysed for limnological and optical variables, carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope (SI) composition of surface sediment organic matter (OM) and fossil Chironomidae (Diptera) remains to examine environmental controls behind chironomid functional feeding group (FFG) structure and their isotopic associations for assessing ecosystem functioning and carbon utilisation. We hypothesise that the chironomid SI signatures reflect increased allochthony with increasing allochthonous input, but the resource use may be altered by the functional characteristics of the assemblage. Multivariate analyses indicated that carbon geochemistry in the sediments (delta C-13, delta N-15, C/N), nutrients, indices of productivity (chlorophyll-a) and lake water optical properties, related to increasing presence of OM, played a key role in defining the chironomid FFG composition and isotopic signatures. Response modelling was used to examine how individual FFGs respond to environmental gradients. They showed divergent responses for OM quantity, dissolved organic carbon and nutrients between feeding strategies, suggesting that detritivores and filter feeders prefer contrasting carbon and nutrient conditions, and may thus hold paleoecological indicator potential to identify changes between different carbon fluxes. Benthic production was the primary carbon source for the chironomid assemblages according to a three-source SI mixing model, whereas pelagic and terrestrial components contributed less. Between-lake variability in source utilisation was high and controlled primarily by allochthonous OM inputs. Combination of biogeochemical modelling and functional classification is useful to widen our understanding of subarctic lake ecosystem functions and responses to climate-driven changes in limnology and catchment characteristics for long-term environmental change assessments and functional paleoecology.

AB  - Mapping habitats of species communities helps to inform on the ecological processes which drive their distribution. This information is critical to identify suitable areas for spatial management, aimed at preserving biodiversity, ecosystem functions or essential habitats. While demersal fish have been extensively studied at the community scale, small pelagic fish have mainly been characterised at the population scale. This paper presents a community-based approach on the biodiversity of small pelagic fish, with the aim to: (i) define small pelagic fish communities, (ii) characterise their spatial and interannual dynamics, and (iii) assess their habitats. We present a Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA)-based method that characterises the spatio-temporal variability in a series of multivariate maps. The main components of variability in these maps are identified to define "characteristic areas" displaying contrasting conditions in both MFA ordination and geographical spaces. Characteristic habitats of fish communities were defined by the correlation between the main components of variability from MFAs applied to maps containing fish information on one hand, and on hydrographic variables on the other hand. The analysis of the long term PELGAS survey series of fish biomass and hydrological indices maps resulted in the characterisation of mesoscale latitudinal gradients and coarse to mesoscale onshore-off-shore gradients in both fish and hydrology datasets. A community with anchovy (E. encrasicolus) and chub mackerel (S. colias) as indicator species was consistently distributed in southeast Biscay. This area was associated with higher bottom temperatures, which likely affected the fish community through physiological processes. A second community with small clupeiforms as indicator species was found in coastal spawning habitats. These habitats were typically characterised by low salinity, a probable proxy for high productivity and good feeding grounds for those species. Mapping the habitats of small pelagic fish communities may inform marine spatial management, aimed at preserving biodiversity, ecosystem structure and function. In addition, it may help in achieving maximum sustainable yields of these commercially important species, and contribute to achieving and maintaining good environmental status of shelf seas ecosystems.

AB  - Assessments of land-system change have dominantly focused on conversions among broad land-use categories, whereas intensity changes within these categories have received less attention. Considering that both modes of land change typically result in diverse patterns and trajectories of land-system change, there is a need to develop approaches to reduce this complexity. Using Europe as a case study, we applied a clustering approach based on self-organising maps and 12 land-use indicators to map (1) land-system archetypes for the year 2006, defined as characteristic patterns of land-use extent and intensity, and (2) archetypical change trajectories, defined as characteristic changes in these indicators between 1990 and 2006. Our analysis identified 15 land-system archetypes, with low-intensity archetypes dominating (ca. 55 % coverage) followed by high-intensity archetypes (ca. 26 %). In terms of change, we identified 17 archetypical change trajectories, clustered in four broad categories. Stable land systems were most widespread (ca. 40 % of the EU27), followed by land systems characterised by land-use conversions (ca. 26 %), de-intensification trends (ca. 18 %), and intensification trends (ca. 15 %). Intensively used and intensifying land systems were particularly widespread in Western Europe, whereas low-intensity and de-intensifying land systems dominated in Europe's east. Comparing our archetypes with environmental and socio-economic factors revealed that good accessibility and favourable topographic, climatic, and soil conditions characterised intensively managed areas. Intensification was also most common in these areas, suggesting an ongoing polarisation of intensification in favourable areas and de-intensification and abandonment trends in more marginal areas. By providing spatially and thematically improved maps of land-use patterns and changes therein, our archetypes could serve as useful inputs for more detailed assessments of ecosystem service demand and supply, as well as explorations of land-system change trade-offs, especially with regard to land-use intensity. Further, they could serve useful for identifying regions within which similar policy tools could be valuable to develop regionalised, context-specific land-management policies to steer European land systems onto desired pathways.

AB  - In agriculture, the use of plastic mulch (plasticulture) is globally increasing. Besides beneficial effects on crop yield and quality, possible adverse environmental effects associated with plastic mulch are currently under debate. Aside from the obvious disadvantages of substantial amounts of (micro)plastic waste, adverse effects on soil quality and biodiversity might be assumed. We compared the effect of plastic mulch and organic mulch (straw) systems in strawberry cultivation on soil invertebrates and biological activity in an observational field study in the Upper Rhine valley, Germany. Soil invertebrates were collected using pitfall traps and Berlese-Tullgren-funnels, earthworms by hand sorting. Soil biological activity was determined using bait-lamina sticks and the MicroResp (TM) system. Soil samples from test fields were analysed for physicochemical and microbial parameters. Despite minor effects on soil physicochemical parameters, our results showed that the mulch system had a significant effect on the community structure of soil invertebrates. In strawberry fields with plastic mulch we found a decreased taxonomic richness and taxonomic richness decreased with increasing soil temperature. About 50% of the analysed taxa had significantly lower abundances in plastic mulched fields compared to fields with organic mulch. No investigated taxon had a higher abundance in plastic mulched fields. Soil moisture was the most important environmental variable in explaining invertebrate abundances. The soil microbial activity was significantly lower in plastic mulched fields than in fields with organic mulch. Our results indicate that even little shifts in abiotic (e.g. temperature, water content) and biotic (e.g. food availability) conditions associated with the plastic mulch system can have strong effects on soil invertebrates and soil microbial activity. Hence, plastic mulch might pose a threat to soil biodiversity and related ecosystem functions in agroecosystems. We call for further studies analysing the influence of plasticulture, to better evaluate the long-term consequences on agrobiodiversity and soil quality as well as sustainability.

AB  - Riparian vegetation cover influences benthic assemblages structure and functioning in headwater streams, as it regulates light availability and autochthonous primary production in these ecosystems. Secondary production, diversity, and exergy-based indicators were applied in capturing how riparian cover influences the structure and functioning of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in tropical headwater streams. Four hypotheses were tested: (1) open canopy will determine the occurrence of higher diversity in benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages; (2) streams with open canopy will exhibit more complex benthic macroinvertebrate communities (in terms of information embedded in the organisms' biomass); (3) in streams with open canopy benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages will be more efficient in using the available resources to build structure, which will be reflected by higher eco-exergy values; (4) benthic assemblages in streams with open canopy will exhibit more secondary productivity. We selected eight non-impacted headwater streams, four shaded and four with open canopy, all located in the Neotropical savannah (Cerrado) of southeastern Brazil. Open canopy streams consistently exhibited significantly higher eco-exergy and instant secondary production values, exemplifying that these streams may support more complex and productive benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Nevertheless, diversity indices and specific eco-exergy were not significantly different in shaded and open canopy streams. Since all the studied streams were selected for being considered as non-impacted, this suggests that the potential represented by more available food resources was not used to build a more complex dissipative structure. These results illustrate the role and importance of the canopy cover characteristics on the structure and functioning of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in tropical headwater streams, while autochthonous production appears to play a crucial role as food source for benthic macroinvertebrates. This study also highlights the possible application of thermodynamic based indicators as tools to guide environmental managers in developing and implementing policies in the neotropical savannah.

AB  - The studied soil profile under the Main Market Square (MMS) in Krakow was characterised by the influence of medieval metallurgical activity. In the presented soil section lithological discontinuity (LD) was found, which manifests itself in the form of cultural layers (CLs). Moreover, in this paper LD detection methods based on soil texture are presented. For the first time, three different ways to identify the presence of LD in the urban soils are suggested. The presence of LD had an influence on the content and distribution of heavy metals within the soil profile. The content of heavy metals in the CLs under the MMS in Krakow was significantly higher than the content in natural horizons. In addition, there were distinct differences in the content of heavy metals within CLs. Profile variability and differences in the content of heavy metals and phosphorus within the CLs under the MMS were activity indicators of Krakow inhabitants in the past. This paper presents alternative methods for the assessment of the degree of heavy metal contamination in urban soils using selected pollution indices. On the basis of the studied total concentration of heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cu, Mn, Cr, Cd, Ni, Sn, Ag) and total phosphorus content, the Geoaccumulation Index (I-geo), Enrichment Factor (EF), Sum of Pollution Index (PIsum), Single Pollution Index (PI), Nemerow Pollution Index (PINemerow) and Potential Ecological Risk (RI) were calculated using different local and reference geochemical backgrounds. The use of various geochemical backgrounds is helpful to evaluate the assessment of soil pollution. The individual CLs differed from each other according to the degree of pollution. The different values of pollution indices within the studied soil profile showed that LDS should not be evaluated in terms of contamination as one, homogeneous soil profile but each separate CL should be treated individually.

AB  - The evaluation of ecosystem quality is inherently subjective, requiring decisions about which variables to notice or measure, and how these variables are integrated into a coherent evaluation. Despite the central role of human judgment, few evaluation methods address the subjectivity that is inherent in their design. There are, however, advantages to directly using opinion to create an expert system where the metric is constructed around opinion data. These advantages include stakeholder inclusion and the encouragement of a dialogue of data-driven criticism rather than subjective counter-opinion.
   We create an expert system to express the quality of a grassland ecosystem in Australia. We use an ensemble of bagged regression trees trained on calibrated expert preference data, to model the perceived quality of this grassland using a set of eight site variables as inputs. The model provides useful predictions of grassland quality, producing predictions similar to real expert evaluations of independent synthetic test sites not used to train the model. We apply the model to real grassland sites ranging from pristine to highly degraded, and confirm that our model orders the sites according to their degree of modification. We demonstrate that the use of too few experts produces relatively poor results, and show that for our problem the use of data from over twenty experts is appropriate. The scaling approach we used to calibrate between-expert data is shown to be an appropriate mechanism for aggregating the opinions of multiple experts.
   The resultant model will be useful in many contexts, and can be used by managers as a tool to evaluate real sites. It can also be integrated into ecological models of change as a means of evaluating predicted changes, for example, as a measure of utility when combined with cost estimates. The basic approach demonstrated here is applicable to any ecosystem, and we discuss the opportunities and limitations of its wider use.

AB  - This study is carried out to report the concentrations of trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, V and Zn) in several species sample of lichens which were collected from Maliau Basin, Sabah and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) Bangi campus in Selangor. Comparison with the natural concentration of trace elements from different species of lichens collected in Maliau Basin with the samples collected in UKM Campus provides unambiguous evidence of pollutions from both study locations. Eight species of lichens were sampled from Maliau Basin, Sabah, and two more species from UKM campus, Bangi. The eight species collected from Maliau Basin were Coccocarpia dissecta, Cladonia cf. floerkeana, Cladonia adspersa, Pseudocyphellaria cf gilva, Parmotrema acrotrychum, Parnzotrema cristiferum, Parmotrema cf pseudonilgherrense, and Sticita weigelii, while the species collected from UKM campus were Parmotrema praesorediosum and Dirinaria picta. Generally, the results of this study showed that concentrations of trace elements in the lichens from UKM campus were relatively higher than those from Maliau Basin. Besides that, the distribution of each trace metal is uneven in each lichen species from Maliau Basin. The ranges of concentrations (mu g/g) of each trace element in the lichens from UKM campus were V (0.38-0.67), Cr (1.02-3.78), Mn (3.48-7.94), Cu (9.97-44.39), Zn (68.38-98.36), As (0.76-1.73), Cd (0.05-0.09) and Pb (12.36-31.99), whereas that of each trace element in the lichens from Maliau Basin were V (0.01-0.14), Cr (0.46-0.93), Mn (3.28-234.35), Cu (3.05-13.74), Zn (1.61-16.01), As (<2.00), Cd (0.0004-0.09) and Pb (1.49-7.73). The fast pace of modernization together with air pollution may probably be the reason for the difference in level of metals accumulated compared from both study locations. The present study will be a reference record for conducting future biomonitoring studies in this fast-growing country.

AB  - This paper proposes a household model that relates various development interventions, such as infrastructure, to rural development. The model is then estimated using data from a household survey in which rural development outcomes are measured in terms of a perception scale. Household perceptions are important early lead indicators of rural development outcomes that manifest later.
   Rural poverty is linked to the exposure of the households to economic vulnerability, through their chronic dependence on agriculture for income generation. A starting point in mitigating this vulnerability would be a comprehensive improvement ill accessibility. This Would substantially reduce transportation cost and thereby lessen the isolation of rural communities from basic welfare services. Ail advocacy campaign and/or incentive system would be needed to encourage private firms to establish operations in rural areas. More private establishments in rural areas Would not only shield households against exposure to vulnerability, but would also serve as it catalyst for microenterprise development. Sustainable rural development would follow, provided that there was all ample corporate social responsibility programme among these firms to avert it widening of inequality. A natural resource management strategy Would also be needed for ecological integrity.
   Community participation is crucial in identifying development projects; it call help to minimise the wastage of resources on inappropriate projects, and enable resources to be allocated instead it to other productive uses. The provision of rural roads should be bundled properly with Support services and capacity-building activities. This can enhance the demand for other infrastructure and services. resulting, in a dynamic evolution of essential elements in the pursuit of rural development. Bundles of intervention improve the production efficiency of rural households at the different stages of production, both on and off the farm.
   Rural development interventions should pay special attention to the more vulnerable segments of the community, especially, the farmers. Interventions should aim gradually to detach them from complete dependence on agriculture, without putting their food Security at fisk.
   Public investments in infrastructure and in users' fees call complement each other, in the continuous provision of new infrastructure and the maintenance of existing infrastructure. to create a sustainable track towards rural development. The socialised users' fee system is a potential tool for preventing widening income disparity in rural areas. The careful selection of a suitable and acceptable basis for the socialised users' fee rate is important, however. Ail incorrect choice of rate could be perceived as a disincentive to access or might stimulate distrust among a segment of the rural society, regarding the government's sincerity in promoting rural development. This might eventually create more social issues, rather than bridging inequality. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous studies have proposed terrestrial amphipods as potential bioindicators of forest condition. In order to investigate the response of the exotic terrestrial amphipod Talitroides topitotum (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Talitridae) to anthropogenic disturbances and its potential as a bioindicator, we compared its abundance among three forest reserves in southeastern Brazil, under different types and intensities of disturbance. We observed significantly higher abundances in disturbed sites compared to undisturbed sites in two of the reserves sampled, corroborating previous studies. In the third reserve, in which both forest disturbance and the abundance of amphipods were much lower than in the other two reserves, there was no significant difference between the sampling sites. We also speculate about the potential use of terrestrial amphipods as global indicators of forest disturbance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper reviews the modern process studies for four types of proxies (tree-ring, biologic indicators, physical proxies and geochemical indexes) in arid north-western China for the purpose of better understanding their environmental indication for reconstructing paleoenvironment and paleoclimate. These proxies are affected by many variables in some cases, such as temperature, precipitation, pH, topography etc., and their indicative meanings may become complex sometimes. For this reason, multiple proxies might be used to complement each other if conditions permit. Moreover, potential differences of each proxy should be taken into consideration when they were used. This paper indicates the application of each modern process proxy and their advantages and disadvantages, so as to give some references to fossil data interpretation and environment reconstruction in arid north-western China.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the lactation activity and reproductive function of Holstein cows in the conditions of modern dairy complex on loose technology content. As a result of researches high milk productivity of animals of the investigated population (8818-10164 kg) is revealed. However, the discrepancy between the diets of the biological status of the animals intense dairy type were kept down milking with age lactations. Milk yield of cows in the second lactation compared to the first was higher by 1346 kg (p<0.001), and the third, on the contrary, lower than the second by 330 kg (p>0.05). The dairy herd was characterized by high protein content and optimal fat content. With the age of lactation, these main indicators of milk composition also tended to decrease. As a result of higher milk yield of cows on the second lactation, milk fat, protein production was higher compared to the first lactation by 90.1 kg (P<0.001), and the difference relative to the third lactation was only 26.5 kg (P>0.05). In Holstein cows, th peak of milking was in the second month after calving. The fall of milk yield by months of lactation from the maximum (on the 2nd month.) to the minimum (before launch) was 54 %.The low coefficient of full value of lactation of cows (75,3 %) indirectly yield, testified also to discrepancyof 16% conditions of their contents. Lactation of Holstein cows was characterized by high variability: 26% by milkby fat, 8% by protein, which indicated the possibility of selection. The negative relationship between milk yield and fat content in milk suggests the need for measures to improve the feeding of cows, and directed selection of bulls to increase the fat content in the offspring. Milk of Holstein cows produced in the conditions of industrial technology had good parameters of thermal stability and suitability for production of cheese. Animals Holstein breed precocious. Service -period at cows in longer established norms (144,1), but the third lactation it was close to the optimum value and was 102.5 days. The coefficient of reproductive function of cows during three lactation was low, but with the age of lactation was approaching normal.

AB  - In the present study, Permian shale beds of Ib-River Mand-Raigarh Basin have been evaluated for insights of depositional conditions, organic, clay and mineral composition allied to shale matrix. The shale core samples were obtained during exploratory drilling and analysed for the properties like proximate, petrography, Rock-Eval, Total organic content (TOC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The values of vitrinite content and TOC varies from 2.00 to 16.20 (vol%) and 1.88-6.99 wt % with an average value of 10.34 (vol%) and 3.75 (wt. 0 /0) respectively, suggesting fair to excellent source rock potential of shale for gas. Whereas, results of the Rock-Eval pyrolysis indicated fair to very good source rock potential (S1: 0.04-0.22 and S2: 0.57-39.45). The indicator of thermal maturity parameters like T-max (423-470 degrees C) and VRo (0.64-0.96%), counsels moderately matured shales. The plot of hydrogen index (HI) vs oxygen index (OI), T-max vs HI and TOC vs HI illustrated the presence of type II and III kerogen in studied shales. The uniformity in carbon conversion elucidates negligible effects of intrusive and basin tectonics on shale reservoir which is validated from the passive stable tectonic setting of Ib-River Mand-Raigarh basin which favours deposition of organic matter. The high percentage of quartz (26.30-57.60 vol%) signifying the resistive nature of SiO2 towards erosion and weathering. However, the negligible or typical absence of K-feldspar and a large percentage of kaolinite (16.80-53.30 vol%) attributed to the strong weathering process. Consequently, the instantaneous reduction condition supported the preservation and transformation of organic matter.
   The paper focuses on the significance of various essential parameters like depositional conditions, organic richness, the degree of maturation, clay types and mineral constituents on the gas genesis and storage. The parameters interpreted through facies and evolution history of the basin to evaluate the prospects of shale gas resource development in Ib-River Mand-Raigarh Basin, India.

AB  - The normal alkanes (n-alkanes) and their hydrogen isotopic (delta D) values in sediments and aquatic and terrestrial plants from Fuxian Lake area of China were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS), respectively. According to the delta D values of the odd carbon-numbered n-alkanes, the sediment samples were divided into types I and II. The type I samples had a heavier hydrogen isotopic composition (-161 to -155 parts per thousand on average) compared to that of the type II samples (-208 to -173 parts per thousand on average). This isotopic difference is likely a result of their different biological sources. Similarity in the average n-alkane dD values in the sediments and plants indicated that C-17 and C-21 to C-25 were mainly derived from aquatic submerged plants in the lake, C-27 and C-29 mainly from woody plants from the surrounding area, and C-31 and C-33 principally from a mixture of terrestrial herbaceous and woody plants. The results further demonstrate that n-alkane hydrogen isotopic composition can be used as an useful source indicator. The study also suggests that the ecological environment of the lake area is an important factor controlling the hydrogen isotopic composition of lake sedimentary n-alkanes. This study also found that the plots of the sedimentary n-alkane delta D values and the average n-alkane chain length (ACL values), and the sedimentary n-alkane delta D values and relative contribution of n-alkanes from woody and terrestrial herbaceous plants (Q(w) values) can distinguish sediment samples from the two different ecological environments of Fuxian Lake and Gahai Lake. Our results also show that the effect of the ecological environment on hydrogen isotopic composition of sedimentary n-alkanes should be considered when reconstructing paleoclimatic and hydrologic conditions using sedimentary n-alkane delta D values.

AB  - Indicator species can provide invaluable insights into environmental conditions but robust empirical testing of their effectiveness is essential. Ancient woodland indicators (AWIs) are plant species considered indicative of sites that have been continuously wooded for a long period by virtue of poor dispersal ability and intolerance of non-woodland habitats. Many countries now utilise AWI species lists to classify ancient woodlands. Here we use a metastudy approach to test resilience of AWIs to interruptions and persistence following deforestation and thus the robustness of using AWI lists using a novel approach. We compare current AWI assemblage with woodland history based on pollen evidence at nine sites across the UK with a robustly-dated and spatially-precise palynological profile. Sites were split into: (1) proven continuous woodland; (2) previously interrupted woodland; and (3) previously but not currently wooded. Vegetation history was > 1000 years at most sites. Assessment of ancientness using AWIs agreed with palynologically-proven ancient woodland at two sites, including a species-poor woodland of previously-uncertain age. However, four interrupted woodland sites and three clear-felled sites supported extensive AWI floristic communities. This suggests AWIs are resilient to interruptions, possibly by remaining in the seed bank longer than expected, and persistent following deforestation. Persistence might be due to other species (e.g. heathland plants) acting as pseudo-canopy or because some AWIs are more tolerant of non-woodland locations than previously thought. We conclude that use of floristic AWIs alone in defining ancient woodland should be reviewed, especially where status links to planning policy and conservation prioritisation. We suggest species on AWI lists be reviewed under expert and local guidance and a system of weighting species based on their strict or strong affinity solely with ancient woodland be developed. The use of multi-taxa indicators is recommended to allow stakeholders globally to make informed decisions about ancient woodland status.

AB  - This study considers elements of geoinformation support of the natural resource management system. The formulated problem embraces construction of a complex analytical system for planning the economic development of a territory in line with sustainable development principles, environmental law and comfortable livingconditions. The paper describes components of the spatial data infrastructure and proposes key principles of the spatial data infrastructure formation. Such principles enable creation of an integrated geoinformation model that serves to solve various tasks of territorial management: mapping and cartographic support, urban planning, supervisory control, and natural resource management.
   The geoinformation basis of a territory, adapted for digital mapping of the technogenic natural and territorial complexes, is described and structured. Socio-economic effect of the spatial data infrastructure implementation is substantiated. The developed information model of the natural resource management system is seen as an element of long-term planning of territory development and creation of agglomerations. Indicators of the rational urban territory use are evaluated using practical examples. The paper demonstrates importance of such parameters as the compactness of scattering of a settlement, availability of the street and road network, the developed social infrastructure, the integral indicator of social comfort of the population.
   The dependence of the cadastral value of real estate on the factor of time that the territory of the technogenic natural and territorial complex has been in use, is proposed as a main indicator of the natural resource management efficiency. At that, prospective development of the territory should be aimed at increasing the cadastral value of existing real estate or creating new real estate that are of interest to potential investors. A compuer-based decision support system is proposed as a model of geoinformation support to the rational natural resource management.
   The predictive models of the developed lands and their conditions should be created at the stage of territorial planning and landscape zoning. This can ensure land protection and rational use of natural resources. The predictive models help to estimate the ecological capacity of the natural systems and forecastthe ecological situation in the territory.

AB  - In this study, biological responses and contaminant levels in biological tissues were investigated in grass goby fish specimens (Zosterisessor ophiocephalus) collected from five stations in a moderately polluted ecosystem, namely the Bizerte lagoon on the north coast of Tunisia. The following biomarkers were measured: muscular acetylcholinesterase (AChE), hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), lipoperoxidation (TBARS), condition factor (CF), and hepatosomatic index (HSI). These measurements were taken in parallel with the content of Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and trace metals (As, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, V, Zn, Ag, Cd, Co and Ni) in muscle tissue. Total PAH concentrations ranged from 20.09 +/- 0.68 to 105.77 +/- 42.58 ng g(-1) dw, PCB from 33.19 +/- 6.25 to 126.28 +/- 7.37 ng g(-1) dw, OCP from 11.26 +/- 1.62 to 19.17 +/- 2.06 ng g(-1) dw, and metals from 107.83 +/- 1.83 to 187.21 +/- 2.00 mg/kg dw. The highest levels of pollutants and biomarkers were observed at station S1, located in the Bizerte channel. Elevated EROD, GST and CAT activities, as well as TBARS levels in liver were positively correlated with tissue contaminant levels at station S1 Significant negative correlations were also found between hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs) body burden with AChE activity in muscle at station S2. The integration of biological responses and contaminant tissue content indicated that certain areas of the Bizerte lagoon, notably station Si, are significantly impacted by various human activities, which likely represent a threat for aquatic wildlife. On the basis of these results, and due to its ecological characteristics, the grass goby appears a suitable indicator species for pollution biomonitoring in coastal marine areas along the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Characterizing biologically relevant stream disturbance regimes is challenging, but necessary to answer questions about disturbance effects on ecological processes. No universally accepted approach exists for characterizing stream disturbance regimes. Our goal was to evaluate approaches that can be applied to test effects of disturbance on benthic organisms. We defined disturbance as events or environmental conditions caused by changes in stream discharge that affect the stability or habitability of the stream bed. We used several metrics to describe disturbance regimes of mountain streams that were not permanently gauged in 1 catchment, and considered the trade-off between effort required to obtain the data and the quality of information gained. We used an innovative photographic method to assess substrate particle movement empirically as a benchmark for comparison to other indicators of channel stability and to metrics describing hydrologic variability relevant to streambed stability. We used a model selection procedure to choose the best combination of individual variables to explain variation in substrate particle movement and included those variables in a multivariate axis of disturbance that can be applied to evaluate effects of disturbance on benthic organisms. Individual variables with the highest explanatory power were maximum daily increase in discharge and the Pfankuch index of channel stability. Substrate particle size and stream size (drainage basin area) were related to the multivariate index of disturbance, but channel gradient was not. Protocols used to measure substrate stability and to obtain the multivariate index of disturbance were labor intensive, but our analyses indicate it may be reasonable to use more easily measured variables (e.g., Pfankuch index) to estimate disturbance to benthic organisms at local scales, although explanatory power may be reduced. Our analyses provide a menu of options to estimate variation in local disturbance regimes of ungauged mountain streams that may not be adequately explained by extrapolation from hydrographs of gauged streams.

AB  - Variation in age and size at life-history transitions is a reflection of the diversifying influence of biotic or abiotic environmental change. Examples abound, but it is not well understood how such environmental changes influence the age structure of a population. I experimentally investigated the effects of water temperature and food type on age and body size at metamorphosis in larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus. In individuals grown at a cold temperature (15 degrees C) or given Chironomidae as prey, the time to metamorphosis was significantly prolonged, and body size at metamorphosis was significantly enlarged, compared with individuals grown at a warmer temperature (20 degrees C) or fed larvae. I also examined whether larval density (a possible indicator of cannibalism in natural habitats) generated variation in the age structure of natural populations in Hokkaido, Japan, where the climate is subarctic. Natural ponds in Hokkaido may contain larvae that have overwintered for 1 or 2 years, as well as larvae of the current year, and I found that the number of age classes was related to larval density. Although cool water temperatures prolong the larval period and induce later metamorphosis, in natural ponds diet-based enhancement of development translated into a shorter larval duration and earlier metamorphosis. Geographic variation in the frequency of cannibalism resulted in population differences in metamorphic timing in H. retardatus larvae. It is important to understand how environmental effects are ultimately transduced through individual organisms into population-level phenomena, with the population response arising as the summation of individual responses. Without a thorough comprehension of the mechanisms through which population and individual responses to environmental conditions are mediated, we cannot interpret the relationship between population-level and individual-level phenomena.

AB  - Mitigation of urban effects on streams requires an understanding of the paths by which urban effects are transmitted from catchments to streams and how those effects are attenuated with distance. We assessed whether modeling attenuation from impervious surfaces and septic tanks along drainage lines improved prediction of 3 instream ecological indicators. Eleven regression models were calculated for each indicator (Escherichia coli, NO3/NO2, and Stream Invertebrate Grade Number Average Level [SIGNAL; a macroinvertebrate assemblage composition index]). Predictor variables included imperviousness or septic-tank density with no attenuation (i.e., total imperviousness and tank density), with overland attenuation (exponential decay with distance along topographic flow paths to stormwater drain or to stream), and with overland and instream attenuation (exponential decay with distance travelled within the stream). Escherichia coli was best predicted by the weighted density of septic tanks, with their influence attenuated to near 0 within tens of meters of the stream and within thousands of meters along streams. These results suggest strong overland attenuation of bacterial contamination and indicate that stormwater drains are not important pathways for septic leakage in this area. NO3/NO2, which is mobile through soils, was best predicted by nonattenuated septic-tank density within catchments. SIGNAL was best predicted by either impervious area or septic tanks within tens of meters of stormwater drains, a result suggesting that SIGNAL is most strongly affected by stormwater runoff routed through stormwater pipes to streams. Management of dry-weather fecal and N contamination in the study streams should focus on septic tank management (stricter maintenance regimes or replacement with other sewage management systems). Near-stream septic tanks are probably most important for fecal contamination, whereas catchment-wide management probably will be required for reduction of dry-weather N concentrations. Management of broader instream ecological condition, as indicated by macroinvertebrate assemblage composition, probably will require catchment-wide retention of stormwater runoff (using tanks or infiltration systems) to mimic natural flow-paths between catchments and streams.

AB  - This study provides information on LC(50) toxicity tests and bioaccumulation of heavy metals in the nearshore Antarctic gammarid, Paramorea walkeri. The 4 day LC(50) values were 970 mu g/l for copper and 670 mu g/l for cadmium. Net uptake rates and bioconcentration factors of these elements were determined under laboratory conditions. After 12 days of exposure to 30 mu g/l, the net uptake rates were 5.2 and 0.78 mu g/g per day and the bioconcentration factors mere 2080 and 311 for copper and cadmium, respectively. The body concentrations of copper were significantly correlated with the concentrations of this element in the water. Accumulation of copper and cadmium continued for the entire exposure suggesting that heavy metals concentrations were not regulated to constant concentrations in the body. Using literature data about two compartments (water-animal) first-order kinetic models, a very good agreement was found between body concentrations observed after exposure and model predicted. Exposure of P. walkeri to mixtures of copper and cadmium showed that accumulation of these elements can be assessed by addition of results obtained from single exposure, with only a small degree of uncertainty. The study provides information on the sensitivity of one Antarctic species towards contaminants, and the results were compared with data of similar species from lower latitudes. An important finding is that sensitivity to toxic chemicals and toxicokinetic parameters in the species investigated are comparable with those of non-polar species. The characteristics of bioaccumulation demonstrate that P. walkeri is a circumpolar species with the potential to be a standard biological indicator for use in monitoring programmes of Antarctic nearshore ecosystems. The use of model prediction provide further support to utilise these organisms for biomonitoring. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The frequent lack of correspondence between measured population stage structures and those predicted from demographic models has usually been seen as an embarrassment, resulting from poor data, or a testimony to the failings of overly simplistic models. However, such mismatches can also arise due to natural or anthropogenic changes in the: environment, thus providing the data needed to test hypotheses about the ecological effects of local or global environmental change. Here, we present a method that allows this type of comparison to rigorously test for the population-level effects of past and ongoing environmental change in situations where no long-term monitoring data exist. Our approach hinges on the fact that changing environmental conditions will cause population size structure to lag behind that predicted by current demographic rates. We first develop the methods needed to calculate the likelihood of an observed population structure, given different stochastic models of demography responding to environmental changes. We next use simulated data to explore the method's power in the face of estimation errors in current vital rates, environmental noise, and other complications. We conclude that this method holds promise when applied to slowly growing, long-lived species and when model structures are used that allow for realistic time lags in population structure. Researchers using this approach should also be careful to assess the importance of other phenomena (rare catastrophes, recent founding of populations, genetic changes, and density dependence) that may compromise the method's accuracy. Although large data sets are required for the method to be accurate and powerful, the data required will be readily obtainable for abundant and easily sampled species. While most ecological efforts to detect global environmental changes have focused on long-term monitoring, or indicators such as tree rings that are unique to organisms not present in all biomes, this method allows tests for past and ongoing changes in situations where neither past monitoring data nor unique indicator species are available.

AB  - One of the most consistent impacts observed in the analysis of commercial catch globally is the phenomenon known as 'fishing down marine food webs', wherein fisheries increasingly target small fish in low-trophic levels as a result of the depletion of large, high-trophic level fish. Detecting and mitigating fishing down effects are critical to avoid undermining the long-term sustainability of marine ecosystems; yet the widespread geographical expansion of fisheries in response to declining coastal catches has concealed these effects. Iran is the most important fishing country in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea region, with ever-growing artisanal fisheries that provide food and employment. In this paper, using catch time series spanning over 66 years (1950-2016) and biological data for 67 marine species/groups, we estimate mean trophic level (MTL), fishing-in-balance (FiB) and region-based MTL (RMTL) indicators to examine the effects of fishing down marine food webs while considering the geographical expansion of Iran's fisheries in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea. We demonstrated that when not accounting for the geographical expansion of fisheries, MTL did not change much, and primarily reflected the presence of large fish (trophic level > 3.5). However, the climbing trend of FiB suggested that the increasing pattern of Iran's catch is potentially driven by the spatial expansion of the fishing fleet, which is concealing the fishing down effects. By considering the nonstationary nature of fishing fleet and fish stocks over time and area, results from RMTL bolster those obtained by FiB: the actual (observed) catch exceeded the potential catch calculated from the observed trophic structure, indicating that fleets have likely moved from nearshore to deeper, offshore waters to gain access to new resources. Once this is accounted for, our study reveals a downward trajectory of the coastal RMTL, providing insights into the condition of the coastal ecosystem in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea.

AB  - The benefits of urban greenspace to residents are increasingly recognised as important to planning for sustainable and healthy cities. However, the way that people interact with and benefit from urban greenspace is context dependent and conditioned by a range of social and material factors. This paper applies and expands the ecosystems services based approach to understanding urban environmental quality and the way in which greenspace is appropriated by residents in the context of incomplete urbanisation in three peri-urban target areas in Brazil. We develop and employ the notion of indirect (scientifically detected) and directly experienced ecosystems services, and undertake a science based ecosystem services assessment and a qualitative analysis of interviews, walking narratives and images captured with a smartphone application to understand what functions urban greenspace serves in the daily life of the studied neighbourhoods. Findings demonstrate how elements of urban greenspace and what can be termed ecosystem services serve both material and signifying functions and produce subjective and collective benefits and dis-benefits that hinge on aspects of livability such as quality of urban service delivery, housing status and perceptions of crime and neighbourhood character. We identify factors that enable, hinder and motivate both active material and interpretative interactions with urban greenspace. The findings suggest that the relationship between ecosystem service provision and wellbeing is better understood as reciprocal rather than one way. Although at the neighbourhood scale, fear of crime and poor access to urban services can hinder positive engagements with urban greenspace and experienced benefits form ES, urban squares and fringe vegetation is also being appropriated to address experienced disadvantages. Presently however these local interactions and ecosystem service benefits are overlooked in formal planning and conservation efforts and are increasingly compromised by growing population density and environmental degradation. We make recommendations for a nuanced assessment of the material and interpretative human-nature interactions and associated ecosystem services in an urban context, and discuss the potential for planning initiatives that could be employed to articulate and nurture these important interactions in our target areas.

AB  - Planktonic diatom data sets were compared within different rarity categories to verify their responses using the weighted average (WA) approach. Our hypothesis is to proportionally reach an increased performance for the WA model by reducing the taxa weight according to their categories considering that the use of various cut-off criteria may affect the predictive abilities of different models. The underlying assumption is that WA models are unable to characterize optima and tolerances for low-occurrence taxa; in addition, their overriding may improve the overall model performance. Therefore, we developed forty diatom-training sets for six reservoirs located at two different basins in the Southwest Sao Paulo, Brazil. 339 diatom taxa were identified and built different models based on their relative abundance values, occurrence frequency, and the data set with no species deletion. The optimum and tolerance per taxon through the WA formula (Zelinka-Marvan weighted averages) was estimated according to their abundance values, in addition to using the pH in the data sets to infer the environmental conditions based on the sample taxonomic composition. First, the procedure using the complete dataset was repeated and subsequently with the down weighting taxa according to their rarity categories. The following procedures were advanced: comparison of predicted and measured pH values via regression analysis, and estimation of the species deletion effects on the predictive ability of the different models in terms of the coefficient of determination values (r(2)) of the response curves. In contrast to what is expected, since r(2) values down weighting rare taxa had negative effect on the transference functions, data sets manipulation had significant influence on WA models performance. However, deleting non-abundant taxa had a positive effect on p values, thus providing robust reconstructive relationship. This work contributes to an improved understanding on diatom ecology, especially in tropical reservoirs, supporting the development of a diatom biological monitoring protocol for the study area.

AB  - Current climate change is significantly modifying Arctic ecosystems and their components, but the reference and direction of these changes are still undefined. The aim of this study was to provide well-grounded data on the present composition and structure of zooplankton from boreal to Arctic latitudes. This comparative study was performed with a unified methodology in six fiords located along the west coasts of Norway and Svalbard. Comparisons between the fjords' environmental characteristics (temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and particles) and the zooplankton community, described with several metrics (abundance and biovolume) and traits (taxonomy and size), were performed to recognise the potential of various ecological indicators for future monitoring. While hydrography and the taxonomic composition of zooplankton were specific to each fjord and changed along the latitudinal environmental gradient, the clustering of particle characteristics (size, concentration, and transparency) and zooplankton size structures alludes to their susceptibility to additional, local processes. The differences in the biotic and abiotic characteristics distinguished the semi-closed fiords from the fiords prone to Atlantic water advection. The fjords with a limited water mass exchange incorporated local or Arctic-type waters and were host to specific zooplankton communities and particles, with the marked presence of species adapted to high particle concentrations (Microsetella norvegica) or species of Arctic affiliation (Calanus glacialis). In the open fiords, zooplankton communities were characterised by the predomination of Oithona similis and Calanus finrnarchicus, confirming influence of Atlantic water. The zooplankton community size structure, expressed as abundance, was mainly shaped by changes in the contributions of small copepods, whereas the size structure expressed as biovolume reflected the differences in the co-occurring sibling species of Calanus spp. and/or differences in their dominating life stages. The results of this integrative across-system study constitute a necessary baseline for the future monitoring of changes in the zooplankton communities, which are likely to occur in response to climate change at high latitudes.

AB  - The solution-mediated formation of calcium sulfate minerals, i.e. gypsum, anhydrite and bassanite, is a common process in both natural and engineered settings. It plays a key role in the global sulfur cycle and serves as an indicator of past environmental conditions on Earth and Mars. Products relying on the crystallization of these minerals have been employed since antiquity, and today they are an essential part of a wide array of industrial applications. Accordingly, the fundamental aspects of calcium sulfate mineralization have been the focus of intensive research during the past century. However, a recent flurry of studies addressing alternative, i.e. nonclassical, nucleation and growth mechanisms has spurred a revisit of the precipitation pathway of the most common phase, gypsum. The newly obtained data sketch a far more complex picture of the mineralization process than previously assumed. This has important consequences for the interpretation of calcium sulfate deposits, both from a geochemical and industrial point of view. In order to shed light on this issue, we discuss in this review both recent and long-standing observations of abiotic formation routes of calcium sulfate minerals as a function of the physicochemical solution properties. By integrating both the classical and non-classical perspectives on crystallization we put forward a unified model for calcium sulfate crystallization. Using this model, we (re)-evaluate the phase stability and transformations taking place in the CaSO4-H2O system. Next, we look into the formation of calcium sulfate minerals occurring in close association with the biosphere. Employing the abiotic case scenario as a benchmarking tool, the possible influence and/or control exerted by biological activity (and its byproducts) on the precipitation pathway is critically reviewed. Finally, we point out the central issues that need to be resolved if we wish to fully understand, and control, the formation of calcium sulfate solids in natural and engineered environments.

AB  - Sediments from the Pialassa Piomboni coastal lagoon (NE Italy) were studied to assess the degree of contamination and ecological risk related to trace metals by combining a geochemical characterization of bulk sediments with the assessment of the bioavailable forms of trace metals. With this purpose, sediment contamination (Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) was assessed by Enrichment Factors (EFs), and potential bioavailability by the Simultaneously Extracted Metals and Acid Volatile Sulfides (SEM-AVS) approach (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn), and by Sequential Extraction Procedure (Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn). On average, Cr and Ni exhibited no contamination (EF <= 1.5), and a predominance in the residual fraction of the sediment, indicating natural origin for these metals. Cu, Pb and Zn displayed a local contamination, which resulted in a higher proportion of Cu bound to the reducible and oxidizable fractions (similar to 30% and similar to 40% as median, respectively), and Pb mostly associated with the reducible phase (similar to 60% as median). Hence, Cu and Pb could bemobilized when environmental conditions become reducing or oxidizing. Zn resulted mainly partitioned into the reducible and residual fractions (similar to 50% as median, in both fractions). The Risk Assessment Code (RAC) indicated that approximately 30% of samples had > 10% of total Zn weakly bound to the sediment, suggesting a medium risk of exposure for aquatic organisms. RAC results were consistent with the Sigma SEM-AVS findings, pointing to possible adverse effects for aquatic biota in similar to 30% of samples, with Zn mostly accounting for the total metal bioavailability. Hg showed a moderate to very severe enrichment, indicating that a substantial amount of this metal derives from anthropogenic sources and may pose adverse effects on the aquatic biota of the Pialassa Piomboni lagoon.

AB  - 1. Most ecological studies require knowledge of animal abundance, but it can be challenging and destructive of habitat to obtain accurate density estimates for cryptic species, such as crustaceans that tunnel deeply into the seafloor, beaches, or mudflats. Such fossorial species are, however, widely used in environmental impact assessments, requiring sampling techniques that are reliable, efficient, and environmentally benign for these species and environments.
   2. Counting and measuring the entrances of burrows made by cryptic species is commonly employed to index population and body sizes of individuals. The fundamental premise is that burrow metrics consistently predict density and size. Here we review the evidence for this premise. We also review criteria for selecting among sampling methods: burrow counts, visual censuses, and physical collections.
   3. A simple 1:1 correspondence between the number of holes and population size cannot be assumed. Occupancy rates, indexed by the slope of regression models, vary widely between species and among sites for the same species. Thus, 'average' or 'typical' occupancy rates should not be extrapolated from site- or species specific field validations and then be used as conversion factors in other situations.
   4. Predictions of organism density made from burrow counts often have large uncertainty, being double to half of the predicted mean value. Whether such prediction uncertainty is 'acceptable' depends on investigators' judgements regarding the desired detectable effect sizes.
   5. Regression models predicting body size from burrow entrance dimensions are more precise, but parameter estimates of most models are specific to species and subject to site-to-site variation within species.
   6. These results emphasise the need to undertake thorough field validations of indirect census techniques that include tests of how sensitive predictive models are to changes in habitat conditions or human impacts. In addition, new technologies (e.g. drones, thermal-, acoustic- or chemical sensors) should be used to enhance visual census techniques of burrows and surface-active animals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Woody debris provides substrate for a large part of forest biodiversity. Many saproxylic species are threatened by deadwood removal from commercial forests. However, deadwood availability alone may be insufficient to sustain those specialist species, given that naturally they inhabit diverse and dynamic forest ecosystems. We analysed the occurrence of saproxylic beetles under the conditions of semi-natural forestry in Estonia where managed stands are relatively rich in deadwood. We had two aims: (i) to estimate the role of deadwood amount taking into account other habitat factors for the beetles, and (ii) to contribute to the assessment of ecological sustainability of the silvicultural approaches used. The 128 studied stands represented four management stages: clear-cuts, retention cuts with solitary trees, mature commercial forests, and (as reference) old growth across a gradient of forest site-types. Using flight-intercept traps and rearing from wood samples, we captured 105 pre-defined habitat specialist species, of which 41% were of regional conservation concern. Site-scale occurrence of 34 species modelled for habitat factors depended mostly on management stage and forest type. Harvested sites (particularly retention cuts) were primarily preferred, and dry pine sites had a distinct fauna. Thirteen percent of target species favoured old growth, but in general, the beetle assemblages in old growth resembled those in mature commercial forest. Statistical significance of any stand characteristics (site type; stand structure) was established in only 62% of species, which indicates that there can be additional important factors, such as habitat connectivity, patch size or landscape history. These results highlight the importance of diverse forest management and protection approaches for deadwood-dwellers, which should aim for habitat heterogeneity along with substrate diversity. For beetle diversity, retention cutting performs much better than clear-cutting, but even deadwood-rich mature stands cannot fully substitute old growth. We conclude that deadwood abundance serves only as a starting consideration for reconciling timber production and the conservation of deadwood dependent biodiversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The monitoring of organisms' health conditions by the assessment of their immunocompetence may serve as an important criterion for the achievement of the Good Environmental Status (GES) as defined in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (EU). In this context, the complex role of natural environmental stressors, e.g. salinity, and interfering or superimposing effects of anthropogenic chemicals, should be carefully considered, especially in scenarios of low to moderate contamination. Organisms from the Baltic Sea have adapted to the ambient salinity regime, however energetically costly osmoregulating processes may have an impact on the capability to respond to additional stress such as contamination. The assessment of multiple stressors, encompassing natural and anthropogenic factors, influencing an organisms' health was the main aim of the present study. Immune responses of Mytilus edulis, collected and kept at natural salinities of 12 parts per thousand (LS) and 20 parts per thousand. (MS), respectively, were compared after short-term exposure (1,7 and 13 days) to low copper concentrations (5,9 and 16 mu g/L Cu). A significant interaction of salinity and copper exposure was observed in copper accumulation. LS mussels accumulated markedly more copper than MS mussels. No combined effects were detected in cellular responses. Bacterial clearance was mostly achieved by phagocytosis, as revealed by a strong positive correlation between bacterial counts and phagocytic activity, which was particularly pronounced in LS mussels. MS mussels, on the other hand, seemingly accomplished bacterial clearance by employing additional humoral factors (16 mu g/L Cu). The greatest separating factor in the PCA biplot between LS and MS mussels was the proportion of granulocytes and hyalinocytes while functional parameters (phagocytic activity and bacterial clearance) were hardly affected by salinity, but rather by copper exposure. In conclusion, immune responses of the blue mussel may be suitable and sensitive biomarkers for the assessment of ecosystem health in brackish waters (10-20 parts per thousand.

AB  - 1. Increasingly, river managers are turning from hard engineering solutions to ecologically based restoration activities in order to improve degraded waterways. River restoration projects aim to maintain or increase ecosystem goods and services while protecting downstream and coastal ecosystems. There is growing interest in applying river restoration techniques to solve environmental problems, yet little agreement exists on what constitutes a successful river restoration effort.
   2. We propose five criteria for measuring success, with emphasis on an ecological perspective. First, the design of an ecological river restoration project should be based on a specified guiding image of a more dynamic, healthy river that could exist at the site. Secondly, the river's ecological condition must be measurably improved. Thirdly, the river system must be more self-sustaining and resilient to external perturbations so that only minimal follow-up maintenance is needed. Fourthly, during the construction phase, no lasting harm should be inflicted on the ecosystem. Fifthly, both pre- and post-assessment must be completed and data made publicly available.
   3. Determining if these five criteria have been met for a particular project requires development of an assessment protocol. We suggest standards of evaluation for each of the five criteria and provide examples of suitable indicators.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Billions of dollars are currently spent restoring streams and rivers, yet to date there are no agreed upon standards for what constitutes ecologically beneficial stream and river restoration. We propose five criteria that must be met for a river restoration project to be considered ecologically successful. It is critical that the broad restoration community, including funding agencies, practitioners and citizen restoration groups, adopt criteria for defining and assessing ecological success in restoration. Standards are needed because progress in the science and practice of river restoration has been hampered by the lack of agreed upon criteria for judging ecological success. Without well-accepted criteria that are ultimately supported by funding and implementing agencies, there is little incentive for practitioners to assess and report restoration outcomes. Improving methods and weighing the ecological benefits of various restoration approaches require organized national-level reporting systems.

AB  - Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex is a measure of sensory-motor synchronization. A deficit in PPI has been observed in psychiatric patients, especially those with schizophrenia and vulnerable subjects, since the neural bases of this disorder are also involved in the regulation of PPI. Recently, we have reported that baseline PPI levels in mice can predict their sensitivity to the conditioned reinforcing effects of cocaine in the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Mice with a low PPI presented a lower sensitivity to the conditioned rewarding effects of cocaine; however, once they acquired conditioned preference with a higher dose of the drug, a more persistent associative effect of cocaine with respect to environmental cues was evident in these animals when compared with High-PPI mice. Therefore, we proposed that the PPI paradigm can determine subjects with a higher vulnerability to the effects of cocaine. Developing locomotor sensitization after pre-exposure to cocaine is considered an indicator of transitioning from recreational use to a compulsive consumption of the drug. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether subjects with a low PPI display a higher locomotor sensitization induced by cocaine. First, male and female OF1 mice were classified as High- or Low-PPI according to their baseline PPI levels. Subsequently, the motor effects induced by an acute dose of cocaine (Experiments 1 and 2) and the development of locomotor sensitization induced by pre-exposure to this drug (Experiments 3 and 4) were recorded using two apparatuses (Ethovision and actimeter). Low-PPI mice presented low sensitivity to the motor effects of an acute dose of cocaine, but a high increase of activity after repeated administration of the drug, thus suggesting a great developed behavioral sensitization. Differences after pretreatment with cocaine vs. saline were more pronounced among Low-PPI subjects than among High-PPI animals. These results endorse our hypothesis that the PPI paradigm can detect subjects who are more likely to display behaviors induced by cocaine and which can increase the risk of developing a cocaine use disorder. Herein, we further discuss whether a PPI deficit can be considered an endophenotype for cocaine use disorder.

AB  - Electronic systems may be subjected to prolonged and intermittent periods of storage prior to deployment or usage. Prior studies have shown that the lead-free solder interconnects show measurable degradation in the mechanical properties even after the brief exposures to high temperature. In this paper, a method has been developed for determining the equivalent storage time to produce identical damage at a different temperature. Electronics subjected to accelerated tests often have a well-defined thermal profile for a specified period of time. Quantification of the thermal profile in field-deployed electronics may be often difficult because of the variance in the environment conditions and usage profile. There is a need for tools and techniques to quantify the damage in deployed systems in the absence of macroindicators of damage without the knowledge of prior stress history. The approach for mapping damage in the lead-free second-level interconnects between different thermal conditions is new. High-reliability applications, such as avionics and missile systems, may be often exposed to long periods of storage prior to deployment. The effect of storage at different temperature conditions can be mapped using the presented approach. A framework has been developed to investigate the system state and estimate the remaining useful life of the solder ball subjected to a variety of isothermal aging conditions, including 60 degrees C, 75 degrees C, and 125 degrees C for periods of time between 1 and 4 weeks. Data on damage precursors, including the rate of change in the normalized phase growth and the normalized IMC thickness, has been collected and analyzed to derive physics-based damage mapping relationships for aging. Mathematical relationships have been derived for the damage mapping to various thermal storage environments to facilitate determining an appropriate time-temperature combination to reach a particular level of damage state. Activation energy for the leading indicators of failure is also computed. Specific damage proxies examined include the phase-growth indicator and the intermetallic thickness. The viability of the approach has been demonstrated for the lead-free test assemblies subjected to multiple thermal aging at 60 degrees C, 75 degrees C, and 125 degrees C. Damage mapping relationships are derived from the data based on the two separate leading indicators.

AB  - Environmental filters and functional adjustments of species to local conditions are major determinants of plant communities in stressing habitats. We set out to understand the role of different substrates in functional trait variation in wood plants by investigating key functional traits at the community and intraspecific levels in different types of Brazilian savanna: two sites of alluvial savannas (lowland savannas that occur in old alluvial deposits in riverbeds with sandy soils and low water-holding capacity), and two sites of typical savannas (upland savannas that occur in interfluvial zones, far from the influence of rivers, in which clay soils with higher fertility and water-holding capacity predominate). We conducted this study in four sites with savanna vegetation in the northeast region of the Cerrado Biome, nearby the transition with the Amazon. In each site we sampled six functional traits for each tree species: leaf area, leaf thickness, specific leaf area (SLA), stem-specific density, relative bark thickness and maximum plant height. We sampled 101 wood species, ranging from 26 to 62 species within each site. In both community and intraspecific levels, alluvial savanna plants showed higher SLA and specific-stem density, and lower leaf area, leaf thickness, bark thickness, and plant height compared with the typical savanna. We also found that, at a given leaf thickness, species from typical savanna exhibited -20% higher SLA. In addition, at a given plant height, typical species showed -56% higher bark thickness and -20% lower specific-stem density. Our findings suggest that savanna tree species growing on alluvial savannas tend to adopt strategies related to water acquisition while species growing on typical savannas invest in both water conservation strategies and protection against high-intensity fires. We conclude that water deficit and fire, both related to substrate properties, play a key role in determining the woody plant communities functioning in savannas.

AB  - Monitoring of soil moisture dynamics provides valuable information about grassland degradation, since soil moisture directly affects vegetation cover. While the Mongolian soil moisture monitoring network is limited to the urban and protected natural areas, remote sensing data can be used to determine the soil moisture status elsewhere. In this paper, we determine whether in situ and remotely sensed data in the unaccounted areas of Southwestern Mongolia are consistent with each other, by comparing Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) first passive L-band satellite data with in situ measurements. To evaluate the soil moisture products, we calculated the temporal, seasonal, and monthly average soil moisture content. We corrected the bias of SMOS soil moisture (SM) data using the in situ measured soil moisture with both the simple ratio and gamma methods. We verified the bias-corrected SMOS data with Nash-Sutcliffe method. The comparison results suggest that bias correction (of the simple ratio and gamma methods) enhances the reliability of the SMOS data, resulting in a higher correlation coefficient. We then examined the correlation between SMOS and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) index in the various ecosystems. Analysis of the SMOS and in situ measured soil moisture data revealed that spatial soil moisture distribution matches the rainfall events in Southwestern Mongolia for the period 2010 to 2015. The results illustrate that the bias-corrected, monthly-averaged SMOS data has a high correlation with the monthly-averaged NDVI (R-2 > 0.81). Both NDVI and rainfall can be used as indicators for grassland monitoring in Mongolia. During 2015, we detected decreasing soil moisture in approximately 30% of the forest-steppe and steppe areas. We assume that the current ecosystem of land is changing rapidly from forest to steppe and also from steppe to desert. The rainfall rate is the most critical factor influencing the soil moisture storage capacity in this region. The collected SMOS data reflects in situ conditions, making it an option for grassland studies.

AB  - Aim Intensification of land use strongly impacts plant communities by causing shifts in taxonomic and functional composition. Mechanisms of land use-induced biodiversity losses have been described for temperate grasslands, but a quantitative assessment of species-specific occurrence optima and maximum tolerance (niche breadth) to land-use intensity (LUI) in Central European grasslands is still lacking. Location Temperate, managed permanent grasslands in three regions of Germany. Methods We combined extensive field work with a null model-randomization approach, defined a "habitat niche" for each plant species based on occurrence and abundance across 150 grassland sites differing in LUI (i.e., amount of fertilizer, mowing/grazing intensity and a compound index of these), and assessed their realized niche breadth (tolerance). Underlying mechanisms driving species' responses to LUI were assessed by relating plant functional traits, Ellenberg indicator values (EIV), Grime's ecological strategies (CSR) and Briemle utilization numbers. Results Out of 151 plant species, 34% responded negatively, whereas 10% responded positively to high LUI. This pattern was mainly driven by species' response to fertilization and mowing frequency; grazing intensity response was less pronounced. Positively reacting species, displaying broader niches, were associated with competition-related functional traits, high EIV for nutrient supply and moisture and high mowing tolerance under spatiotemporally variable conditions. Negatively responding species, displaying relatively narrow niches confined to spatiotemporally homogeneous low LUI sites, were associated with a nutrient-retentive strategy, under nutrient-poor, base-rich soil conditions. Conclusion Our analyses of individual species' reactions clearly demonstrate that species responding negatively to high LUI display little tolerance towards intensive fertilization and mowing, leading to plant diversity loss; whereas grazing partly thwarts these effects by creating new habitat niches and promoting ruderal species. Our approach can be applied to other habitat types and biogeographical regions in order to quantify local specific response or tolerance, adding to existing knowledge about local vegetation dynamics.

AB  - Satellite-retrieved solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has shown great potential to monitor the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial ecosystems. However, several issues, including low spatial and temporal resolution of the gridded datasets and high uncertainty of the individual retrievals, limit the applications of SIF. In addition, inconsistency in measurement footprints also hinders the direct comparison between gross primary production (GPP) from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers and satellite-retrieved SIF. In this study, by training a neural network (NN) with surface reflectance from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), we generated two global spatially contiguous SIF (CSIF) datasets at moderate spatiotemporal (0.05 degrees 4-day) resolutions during the MODIS era, one for clear-sky conditions (2000-2017) and the other one in all-sky conditions (2000-2016). The clear-sky instantaneous CSIF (CSIFclear-inst) shows high accuracy against the clear-sky OCO-2 SIF and little bias across biome types. The allsky daily average CSIF (CSIFall-daily) dataset exhibits strong spatial, seasonal and interannual dynamics that are consistent with daily SIF from OCO-2 and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). An increasing trend (0.39 %) of annual average CSIFall-daily is also found, confirming the greening of Earth in most regions. Since the difference between satellite-observed SIF and CSIF is mostly caused by the environmental down-regulation on SIFyieid, the ratio between OCE-2 SIF and CSIFclear-inst can be an effective indicator of drought stress that is more sensitive than the normalized difference vegetation index and enhanced vegetation index. By comparing CSLFall-daily with GPP estimates from 40 EC flux towers across the globe, we find a large cross-site variation (c.v. = 0.36) of the GPP-SIF relationship with the highest regression slopes for evergreen needle-leaf forest. However, the cross-biome variation is relatively limited (c.v. = 0.15). These two contiguous SIF datasets and the derived GPP-SIF relationship enable a better understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of the GPP across biomes and climate.

AB  - Environmental factors management is important in the control of flower induction in orchids. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of two controlled environments and greenhouse conditions, as well as the influence of the flowering background in Laelia anceps Lindl. subesp. anceps, on four years old plants during their growth, induction, and indicators of flower development. The evaluated environments were: 1) greenhouse environment (AInv), with an average day/night 29/13 degrees C temperature, natural photoperiod of 12 h with a photosynthetic photon flux (FFF) of 90 mu mol.m(-2) s(-1), 2) controlled environment 1 (AC1) with metal-halide lamps + high-pressure sodium lamps + fluorescent tubes lights with a FFF of 80 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and 3) controlled environment 2 (AC2) with light emitting diodes with a FFF of 64 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Both controlled environments had a 9/15 h photoperiod and 25/13 degrees C day/night temperature. Flowering background: plants with previous flowering (CFA) and without previous flowering (SFA). The experimental design was completely random with treatments: AInv + CFA, AInv + SFA, AC1 + CFA, AC1 + SFA, AC2 + CFA and AC2 + SFA, with 20 repetitions. Each plant was an experimental unit. Statistical analyses were ANOVA and Tukey test (p <= 0.05) for means comparison, logistic regression, and Pearson correlation. The evaluated environments did not have any influence on the vegetative growth of flowering induced plants, but the non-induced plants, mainly those in AC2 + CFA, decreased their growth. The CFA plants promoted a higher probability of flowering induction. The AInv generated the highest percentage of flower induction. Both controlled environments reduced the anthesis 45 and 30 d. For blooming, flower size and labellum were correlated among themselves in the three environments, meanwhile, in greenhouse conditions, they relate to the number of flowers. The length of the flower stalk was correlated with the days to anthesis in controlled environments.

AB  - The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) is regarded as one of the most significant evolutionary events in the history of Phanerozoic life. The present study integrates palynological, petrographic, molecular and stable isotopic (delta C-13 of biomarkers) analyses of cores from four boreholes that intersected the Goldwyer Formation, Canning Basin, Western Australia, to determine depositional environments and microbial diversity within a Middle Ordovician epicontinental, tropical sea. Data from this study indicate lateral and temporal variations in lipid biomarker assemblages extracted from Goldwyer Formation rock samples. These variations likely reflect changing redox conditions between the upper (Unit 4) and lower (Units 1 + 2) Goldwyer, which is largely consistent with existing depositional models for the Goldwyer Formation. Cryptospores were identified in Unit 4 in the Theia-1 well and are most likely derived from bryophyte-like plants, making this is the oldest record of land plants in Australian Middle Ordovician strata. Biomarkers in several samples from Unit 4 that also support derivation from terrestrial organic matter include benzonaphthofurans and delta C-13-depleted mid-chain n-alkanes. Typical Ordovician marine organisms including acritarchs, chitinozoans, conodonts and graptolites were present in the lower and upper Goldwyer Formation, whereas the enigmatic organism Gloeocapsomorpha prisca (G. prisca) was only detected in Unit 4. The correlation of a strong G. prisca biosignature with high 3-methylhopane indices and C-13 depleted G. prisca derived chemical fossils (biomarkers) is interpreted to suggest an ecological relationship between methanotrophs and G. prisca. This research contributes to a greater understanding of Ordovician marine environments from a molecular perspective since few biomarker studies have been undertaken on age-equivalent sections. Furthermore, the identification of the oldest cryptospores in Australia and their corresponding terrestrial biomarkers provides further insight into the geographical distribution and evolution of early land plants.

AB  - Although development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has substantially improved our understanding of the microbial ecology of animal feces, previous studies have mostly focused on freshly excreted feces. There is still limited understanding of the aging process dynamics of fecal microbiomes in intact cowpats exposed to natural environments. Fresh cowpats were sampled at multiple time points for 57 days under field conditions; half the samples were exposed to sunlight (unshaded) while the other half was protected from sunlight (shaded). The 16SRNA hypervariable region 4 was amplified from each sample and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq Platform. While Clostridia, Bacteroidia, and Sphingobacteria were dominant classes of bacteria in fresh cowpats, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacilli were the dominant classes by the end of the study, indicating a general shift from anaerobic to aerobic bacterial populations. This change was most likely influenced by the shift from cattle gut (anaerobic) to pasture ground (aerobic). Reduced moisture in cowpats may also contribute to the community shift since air can penetrate the dryer cowpat more easily. Twelve genera consisting pathogenic bacteria were detected, with Mycobacterium, Bacillus, and Clostridium being the most abundant; their combined abundance accounts for 90% of the total pathogenic genera. Taxonomic richness and diversity increased throughout the study for most samples, which could be due to bacteria regrowth and colonization of bacteria from the environment. In contrast to the high taxonomic diversity, the changes of PICRUSt inferred function profile were minimal for all cowpats throughout the study, which suggest that core functions predicted by PICRUSt may be too conserved to distinguish differences between aerobe and anaerobe. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that cowpat exposure to air and sunlight can cause drastic microbiome changes soon after deposition in natural environments. Our findings offer important insights for future research characterizing the microbiome of feces collected in natural environments and the impact of cattle fecal contamination on water resources.

AB  - Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) is one of the most important, small-sized, pelagic fishes in the North Pacific. Using correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), we examined the relationships between climatic/oceanographic indices (Asian monsoon index (MOI), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), North Pacific Index (NPI), Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index, air temperature, wind velocity, sea surface temperature (SST), and surface current velocity (SCV) in the Kuroshio axis), and abundance/biological indices of Pacific saury (adult catch, catch per unit effort, i.e., CPUE, condition factor, and body length and larval density) in order to detect the response of Pacific saury abundance to the recent climatic/oceanic regime shifts (1976/1977, 1987/1988, and 1997/1998). Our oceanographic analyses show that notable regime shifts occurred in 1987/1988 and possibly 1997/1998 in the Kuroshio region, while the same kind of regime shift was not readily apparent there in 1976/1977. Results of our oceanographic/biological analyses show that the decadal-scale variation pattern in Pacific saury abundance responded well to the regime shifts of 1987/1988 and 1997/1998. These results indicate that only the regime shifts which occurred in the Kuroshio region can affect Pacific saury abundance. Our results also showed that the abundance and biological indices of saury significantly correlated with both the SSTs in the northwestern Kuroshio waters and the SCV in the Kuroshio axis in winter. These correlations suggest that winter oceanographic conditions in the Kuroshio region strongly affect the early survival process and determine the recruitment success of Pacific saury. The abundance of other major small pelagic species also changed greatly around 1989, suggesting that the regime shift in the late 1980s occurred in the pelagic ecosystem basin. We concluded that Pacific saury could be used as a bio-indicator of regime shifts in the northwestern subtropical Pacific. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research conducted in various contexts suggests that urban greenspace, primarily trees, helps to reduce crime rates and other negative aspects of place. This study contributes to that literature by examining residents' reporting of activities they do to create, maintain, and protect the urban forest in Atlanta, Georgia (USA), and the association of this involvement with blight measures. Using binary logistic regression, we found that urban forest engagement did not mediate egregious blight conditions but did reduce the presence of litter. Rather, residence in predominantly African American communities was the most consistent predictor of more substantial indicators of blight. Except for litter, these are overwhelming conditions, often involving absentee property owners. Redress requires municipal-level, bureaucratic interventions, which can be complex. Urban forest engagement appears relatively ineffectual in combating the worst kinds of blight but may aid in reducing more pedestrian forms.

AB  - The August 2006 collapse of a sinkhole beneath a residential structure in Nixa, Missouri, offered a new opportunity to investigate such features. Investigation of the roughly 60 ft (18 m) diameter by 75 ft (23 m) deep sink suggested factors that may be precursors of such catastrophic events and provided an opportunity to document a common approach to remediating collapse subsidence events. A review is presented here of the site conditions, the initial emergency response, site investigation and remedial planning, and the final actions taken. In addition, several potential indicators or contributing factors are identified that may allow others in karst terranes to identify future potential hazard areas. These factors include subsurface drainage features, tree roots and macropores, and unique storm-water drainage conditions. Lessons learned during the response to the sinkhole collapse are presented that should prove helpful to others if they need to prepare for, or respond to, similar incidents.

AB  - Many studies have reported that behavior and bioluminescence of fireflies could be affected by changes in environment conditions. However, little is known about how the deterioration of the aquatic environment affects aquatic fireflies, particularly with respect to molecular responses following exposure to water pollutants, such as benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), which is a key indicator in environmental risk assessment because of the hazards it poses. Here, whole transcriptome sequencing and gene expression analysis were performed on freshwater fire-flies (Luciola leii) exposed to BaP (concentration of 0.01mg/L). Four transcriptomic librarieswere constructed for the control and treatment groups, including two biological replicates. From the mixed pools (each pool contains 60 individuals from three time points), a total of 54,282 unigenes were assembled. Furthermore, 329,337 of Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1324 of Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were predicted using bioinformatics, which is useful for the future development of molecular markers. Subsequently, 2414 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in response to BaP stress in comparison to the control, including 1350 up-regulated and 1064 down-regulated DEGs. Functional enrichment showed that these DEGs are primarily related to innate immunity; xenobiotic biodegradation and response, biomacromolecule metabolism, biosynthesis, and absorption. Eight key BaP-responsive DEGs were screened to survey the dynamic changes of expression in response to BaP stress at different time points, and to validate the RNA sequencing data using quantitative real-time PCR. The results indicate that the expression of genes encoding UGT, CYP3A, CYP9, CYP6AS5 and ADHP were induced, while those encoding UGT2B10L, PTGDS, and ALDH were reduced, to participate in response to the BaP exposure and potentially help counteract the adverse effects of BaP. This investigation provides insight into the toxicological response of fireflies to the occurrence of water deterioration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a key legislative action developed by the European Union in order to protect aquatic ecosystems. One of the concerning pollutants, listed in this directive as a priority hazardous substance, is tributyltin (TBT), a biocide largely used in antifouling paints and identified as a causative agent of imposex/intersex in gastropods. In order to integrate TBT pollution monitoring within this legislative framework, a practical exercise is here proposed to assess the evolution of surface water ecological status in Ria de Aveiro (NW Portugal). Three bioindicators - the caenogastropods Nucella lapillus, Nassarius reticulatus and Littorina littorea - were used under the general WFD benthic invertebrate quality element, and the vas deferens sequence index (VDSI) and the intersex index (ISI) were selected as biomarkers for the purpose of assessing the condition of this quality element regarding the impact of TBT pollution. Levels of VDSI in N. lapillus and N. reticulatus, and ISI in L. littorea, were surveyed in 2013 and compared with previous data available for the same species and study area in 1998 and 2005, providing a time lapse for a period of 15 years. VDSI and ISI values were converted into Ecological Quality Ratios (EQR) and EQR boundaries were set for each species in order to define the five ecological status classes (High, Good, Moderate, Poor and Bad). We propose N. lapillus as key bioindicator, however the combined use of further species is very useful to cover a wider study area. Based on the proposed method, it is concluded that the ecological status of the surface waters surveyed in Ria de Aveiro, concerning the impact of TBT pollution on the above benthic invertebrate taxa, improved considerably since 1998 and achieved a Good Ecological Status in 2013, thus meeting the WFD environmental objectives for this priority hazardous substance even before 2015.

AB  - Diatoms collected from 113 surface peat samples from the Boreal Shield and Hudson Plains show taxonomic distributions that are associated with macro-vegetation type, pH, and position relative to the water table, the main environmental variables measured in this study. The overall goal of our research was to determine the ecological distribution and response of diatoms to microhabitat conditions, and to assess the potential for diatoms to be applied as indicators of long-term environmental change in northern peatlands. Our results indicate that diatom assemblage composition was determined by both the broader peatland type (i.e., bog, rich and poor fens) and microhabitats within peatland formations (e.g., hummock, hollow). The diatom assemblages were primarily influenced by pH with the sites divided at a critical pH of 5.5, and secondarily by the depth to the water table. Acidic bog hollow and hummock microhabitats were species-poor and dominated almost exclusively by Eunotia paludosa A.Grunow and (or) Eunotia mucophila (H.Lange-Bertalot, M.Norpel-Schempp & E.Alles) H.Lange-Bertalot. These acidophilic and aerophilic diatom species were associated with the narrow pH optima of the dominant Sphagnum L. species (e. g., Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.) Klinggr., Sphagnum angustifolium (C.E.O.Jensen ex Russow) C.E.O.Jensen) found in these bog habitats. Rich and poor fen samples, which were less acidic, supported a more diverse diatom assemblage (>30 species) with greater variability in both diatom and bryophyte pH tolerances. The diatom assemblages recorded in the bogs and fens of our study are similar to those found in peatlands around the world, demonstrating that diatom species are very specialized to exist in these often harsh semi-aquatic environments. Diatoms from peatlands have great potential as biomonitors of environmental change in these important ecosystems.

AB  - 1. In the face of a rapidly changing environment, long-term studies provide important insights into patterns of vegetation and processes of change, but long-term studies are rare for many ecosystems.
   2. We studied recent vegetation changes at a fine scale in a Sphagnum-dominated bog in south Sweden by resurveying part of the bog 54 years after the original phytosociological survey. We used an indirect approach to identify changes in vegetation composition in relation to environment because of a lack of permanent sampling units. By applying a weighted averaging technique, we calculated relative changes in species optimum values for different environmental gradients as represented by indicator values for light, temperature, pH, moisture and nutrients.
   3. Species composition of the mire vegetation has changed significantly over the past five decades, as indicated by significant changes in species frequencies and species optima for the gradients examined. Species with lower indicator values for moisture and light and higher indicator values for nutrients have become more frequent on the mire. In particular, species of trees and dwarf shrubs increased in frequency, whereas typical mire species decreased (e. g. Trichophorum cespitosum (L.) Hartm.) or disappeared from the study site (e. g. Scheuchzeria palustris L.).
   4. Synthesis. Composition of the mire vegetation is found to be dynamic at different temporal and spatial scales. Increased air temperature and nutrient availability in south Sweden over the past few decades may have augmented productivity (e. g. tree growth), resulting in drier and shadier conditions for several species. This study successfully demonstrated the applicability of an indirect approach for detecting long-term vegetation change at a fine scale. This approach is an effective way of using historic and modern phytosociological data sets to detect vegetation and environmental change through time.

AB  - The constant demand for seafood products and the undeniable effects of fishing on marine ecosystems make it urgent to implement an ecosystem approach, even in data-poor scenarios such as small-scale fisheries. Understanding the impacts of fishing is essential for promoting management strategies that prevent irreversible damage to marine ecosystems. Thus, ecosystem quantitative science-based models have been frequently used to evaluate the effects of fishing, although fishers' local ecological knowledge (LEK) can aid the implementation of qualitative models, particularly in data-poor conditions. Here, we present a framework for simulating and assessing the effects of fishing following two strategies: (1) for both types of models, we simulated species removal scenarios, and (2) for quantitative science-based models, we fitted time series to dynamically assessed impacts. The impacts were analyzed through ecological indicators commonly used for quantitative models, and because these indicators cannot be easily estimated for qualitative models, we propose the use of topological indicators in both types of models. The approach was applied to three case studies of small-scale finfish fisheries in northwestern Mexico. We found that the ecosystem response to species removal was different in each case study and that the target species can play an important role in ecosystems, but their removal does not generate abrupt changes in the ecosystem structure. The quantitative science-based models were able to reproduce the historical catch trends, which allowed us to reveal that changes in ecosystems are indeed influenced by fishing effort but also by underlying primary productivity. Furthermore, topological and ecological indicators showed similar trends in the quantitative models, which suggests that the former could be useful when data-poor conditions allow only qualitative models. This result confirms the relevance of the participation of fishers in generating qualitative models and their decisive role in the discussion of co-management strategies and risk scenarios in a better-informed manner.

AB  - Hyrrokkin sarcophaga is a parasitic foraminifera that is commonly found in cold-water coral reefs where it infests the file clam Acesta excavata and the scleractinian coral Desmophyllum pertusum (formerly known as Lophelia pertusa). Here, we present measurements of the trace element and isotopic composition of these parasitic foraminifera, analyzed by inductively coupled optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and mass spectrometry (gas-source MS and inductively-coupledplasma MS).
   Our results reveal that the geochemical signature of H. sarcophaga depends on the host organism it infests. Sr / Ca ratios are 1.1 mmol mol 1 higher in H. sarcophaga that infest D. pertusum, which could be an indication that dissolved host carbonate material is utilized in shell calcification, given that the aragonite of D. pertusum has a naturally higher Sr concentration compared to the calcite of A. excavata. Similarly, we measure 3.1 parts per thousand lower delta C-13 and 0.25 parts per thousand lower delta O-18 values in H. sarcophaga that lived on D. pertusum, which might be caused by the direct uptake of the host's carbonate material with a more negative isotopic composition or different pH regimes in these foraminifera (pH can exert a control on the extent of CO2 hydration/hydroxylation) due to the uptake of body fluids of the host. We also observe higher Mn / Ca ratios in foraminifera that lived on A. excavata but did not penetrate the host shell compared to specimen that penetrated the shell, which could be interpreted as a change in food source, changes in the calcification rate, Rayleigh fractionation or changing oxygen conditions.
   While our measurements provide an interesting insight into the calcification process of this unusual foraminifera, these data also indicate that the geochemistry of this parasitic foraminifera is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of paleoenvironmental conditions using Sr / Ca, Mn / Ca, delta O-18 or delta C-13 unless the host organism is known and its geochemical composition can be accounted for.

AB  - Worldwide landslides correspond to one of the most dangerous geological events due to their destructive power and unpredictable nature. In the Chilean Patagonia, the SERNAGEOMIN (Chilean Geological Survey Service) has detected 2533 landslide events in the Northern Patagonia (42. 7(circle)S, 72. 4(circle)W) alone, a small area compared to the whole Chilean Patagonia. However, only 11 evens have known date. Consequently, it is not possible to associate temporal triggers and mechanisms that control such events, resulting in a lack of understanding of the factors that enable landslides. This work aims to detect landslides and identify the main environmental variables (climatic and geomorphological) that explain their occurrence using machine learning methods. We will address the following research questions: 1) How can a temporal landslide dataset be built using Landsat images and Google Earth Engine in Northern Patagonia? 2) Once the landslides and their timing have been detected, what are the main variables that condition the landslide processes? In our work, we developed a temporal dataset of landslides for the northern Patagonia of Chile. We used three machine learning approaches, where it was possible to identify the main environmental variables that allow us to predict their generation. Statistical models show that during the last 19 years, there has been complex interaction between different environmental variables that have influenced the activity of landslides. Climatic indices, indicators of extreme events, have a high incidence in the events' predictive capacity. However, the most important are those linked to Patagonia's tectonic context. In particular, the time elapsed after the eruptive event of the Chaiten volcano. Finally, the Liquine-Ofqui Fault System's presence extending throughout the entire north of Patagonia has generated discontinuities at a general level, causing significant geomorphological instability. The study area has a relief in evolution and reactive to climatic conditions. Therefore, we highlight the need to understand better the interaction between geological and climatic processes and the future impact of these natural hazards. We emphasize the importance of analyzing landslide controls, considering both geomorphological variables and sporadic geological events.

AB  - Industrialization and urbanization have increased the risk of heavy metal(loid)s coming from a wide range of pathways and processes. Regional environmental risk assessment mainly focuses on the regional functional layout, industrial orientation, and enterprise location. These aspects may generate immense environmental risks and hazards. However, many gaps in regional environmental risk assessment remain, particularly concerning the spatial heterogeneity of environmental processes and mechanisms affected by the industrial layout. Most of the risk estimation often neglected the risk factor interaction. Here, we developed a framework to estimate the environmental risk of heavy metal(loid)s focusing on the spatial heterogeneity of the industrial layout. This framework was operationalized by performing an integrated risk detection of heavy metal(loid)s, spatial heterogeneity identification of the industrial layout, the power of risk factors and factor interaction examination, risk factor condition quantification and key risk source apportionment. Shaoguan city, one of six trial zones for China's pollution prevention and control of heavy metal(loid)s, was taken as a case study. Among all of the natural and socioeconomic factors, the running time of the industry was the most important risk factor of the Cd, As and Pb in soil and rice in all subregions. These subregions were divided based on the spatial heterogeneity of the industrial layout. The threshold of the running time of the industry for soil Cd was 11.97 years. The power of other dominant risk factors was different in different subregions, and the joint risk of the dominant risk factors was larger than the single risk of the running time of the industry. Our results suggest that the environmental risk of heavy metal(loid)s in Shaoguan could be mitigated by adjusting the industrial structure and controlling the running time of enterprises. Our study also indicates that estimating the regional environmental risk of heavy metal(loid)s focusing on the spatial heterogeneity of the industrial layout can help define specific strategies to achieve environmentally friendly industrial development.

AB  - Municipal wastewater treatment plants in coastal areas are facing numerous challenges, including the need to provide a cost-effective approach for removing nutrients and trace organic contaminants from wastewater, as well as adapting to the effects of climate change. The horizontal levee is a multi-benefit response to these issues that consists of a sloped subsurface treatment wetland built between a coastal levee and tidal marshes. The wetland attenuates storm surges and can provide space for wetland transgression to higher elevations as sea levels rise, while simultaneously removing contaminants from treated wastewater effluent. To assess the ability of the horizontal levee to improve water quality and to identify optimal operating conditions, a 0.7-ha experimental system was studied over a two-year period. The removal of nitrate and trace organic contaminants was particularly sensitive to hydrology; rapid and near complete removal (>97%) of these contaminants was observed in water flowing through the subsurface, whereas surface flows did not exhibit measurable contaminant removal. Removal of Fthorn coliphage also appeared to be sensitive to hydrology, with up to 99% removal of these indicator viruses in subsurface flow. For phosphate, removal was not as sensitive to hydrology, but significant removal (>83%) was still observed when overland flow was eliminated. Although removal of contaminants did not appear to be sensitive to other design considerations, parameters such as soil texture and planting regimes affected the maximum subsurface flows, which in turn controlled contaminant mass loadings. Rapid subsurface removal of contaminants suggests that water quality benefits of these systems are limited by physical constraints (i.e., the ability of the system to maintain subsurface flow) and not chemical or biological conditions in the subsurface.

AB  - Compared to agricultural land and spruce plantations, central European beech-oak forests are often relatively close to natural conditions. However, forest management may alter these conditions. In Steigerwald, southern Germany, a large beech-dominated forest area, three management intensities were applied during the past 30-70 years. Here, we examined the influence of management intensity on saproxylic beetles in > 100-year old mature stands at 69 sampling plots in 2004. We sampled beetles using flight-window traps and time standard direct searches. The community structure based on presence/absence data changed remarkably along the gradient from unmanaged to low-intensity to high-intensity management, but these differences were not evident using abundance data from flight interception traps. Saproxylic species richness decreased in intensively managed forests. Elateridae and threatened species richness peaked in unmanaged forests and in forests under low-intensity management. Saproxylic species richness was dependent on certain micro-habitat factors. These factors were (1) the amount of dead wood for Elateridae, overall and threatened saproxylic beetle richness; (2) the amount of flowering plants for Cerambycidae; (3) the richness of wood-inhabiting fungi for Staphylinidae, Melandryidae and overall saproxylic beetle richness; and (4) the frequency of Fomes fomentarius for threatened species. Species richness was better explained by plot factors, such as dead wood or fungi, than by management intensity. These results suggest that the natural variation of dead wood niches (decay stages, snag sizes, tree cavities and wood-inhabiting fungi species) must be maintained to efficiently conserve the whole saproxylic beetle fauna of beech forests. Also, intensive management may alter the specialised saproxylic beetle community even if the initial tree-species composition is maintained, which was the case in our study. For monitoring the ecological sustainability of forest management we must focus on threatened species. If structures alone are sampled then the amount of dead wood is the best indicator for a rich saproxylic beetle fauna.

AB  - The microbicidal effect of UV light depends on the dose in both, disinfection processes and natural inactivation by the sunlight in surface water. Deviations of the time dose reciprocity are well known from chemical water disinfection whereas no data are available about this effect in UV inactivation in water. In a previous study we found that the UV inactivation behaviour of yeast strains does not follow the time dose reciprocity, insofar that longer exposure led to higher reduction of cultivable cells. In contrast, an earlier study about E call B/r claimed a higher inactivation with single exposure compared with fractionated UV irradiation. To investigate this question we selected water-relevant microorganisms and studied their UV inactivation behaviour (253.7 nm) by means of a specially designed UV irradiation apparatus (a) under standard irradiation conditions (2W/m(2)) and (b) with three levels of UV dose rate (2, 0.2 and 0.02W/m(2)). The test organisms were (i) three E coli strains (ATCC 25922, ATCC 11229 and an isolate from sewage) representing the routinely used faecal indicator, (ii) three bacterial viruses (MS2, phi X174 and B40-8) proposed as indicators for viral contamination in water and (iii) spores of Bacillus subtilis because of their use as a biodosimeter in prototype testing of commercial UV plants for drinking water disinfection. We found, under standard inactivation conditions, that the E coli strains and phage phi X174 are most UV susceptible, followed by B40-8 and finally MS2 and bacterial spores. The dose protraction experiments revealed for the E coli strains a higher inactivation with high dose rates compared to low dose rates at the same UV doses (difference of about 1 log(10) at 80-100J/m(2)). The other test organisms did not deviate from the time dose reciprocity in the proven range of dose. (C) 1998 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Assessing the viability of a public infrastructure includes economic, technical and environmental aspects; however, on many occasions, the social aspects are not always adequately considered. This article proposes a procedure to estimate the social sustainability of infrastructure projects under conditions of uncertainty, based on a multicriteria deterministic method. The variability of the method inputs is contributed by the decision makers. Uncertain inputs are treated through uniform and beta PERT distributions. The Monte Carlo method is used to propagate uncertainty in the method. A case study of a road infrastructure improvement in El Salvador is used to illustrate this, treatment. The main results determine the variability of the short and long-term social improvement indices by infrastructure and the probability of the position in the prioritization of the alternatives. The proposed mechanism improves the reliability of the decision making early in infrastructure projects, taking their social contribution into account. The results can complement environmental and economic sustainability assessments.

AB  - Anomalously warm air temperatures in various parts of the world have been widely noted in recent decades. In marine systems, biological indicators such as the range of plankton and fish have been used to indicate impacts of ocean warming, although for many regions recent ocean warming does not exceed short-term warming events over the last two centuries. Here we use International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) sea-surface temperature data to update analysis in the North Atlantic to show that present warm conditions are currently no more persistent than those encountered in the last 150 years. We show that the position of various isotherms, which play a central role in influencing the distribution of marine taxa ranging from plankton to fish and turtles, are more regularly found further north in recent years than at any time since the 1850s.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges of raspberry production in Hungary nowadays is the reduction of unfavourable effect of climate changes. The maturation phase of main varieties within the Carpathian Basin falls in a period of extremely high temperature - reaching, or even exceeding, 35-40 degrees C - and atmospheric drought. This detains the desirable fruit growth. In order to restore or even save the domestic raspberry production and market, introduction of greenhouse or polytunnel solutions is needed. Experimental plantations of three different raspberry varieties were set in two repetitions: covered and uncovered versions. Each cover has characteristic light reflection /absorption/ transmission which should generate devious environmental conditions and also different plant growth. Besides the monitoring of elementary biological indicators a wide range of sensors (temperature, humidity, solar irradiation, spectroradiometer) were used to quantify the difference between cover materials to find the optimal tunnel material for maximal plant productivity.

AB  - This paper investigates the coherence of the relationship between indicandum (the subject to be indicated) and indicator (how the subject is effectively indicated) in the framework of the Ecological Footprint (EF). In this case, the indicandum is potential overuse of regenerative capacity measured by the indicator EF. According to the latest definition, EF measures the area of biologically productive land and water required to produce all the resources consumed and to absorb the waste (ill particular the carbon dioxide) generated, considering prevailing technology and resource management practices. The term "prevailing technology" replaces "sustainable way" in the definition. This creates confusion and prevents the indicator from fully representing the indicandum. A correction factor in the classical EF formulation is proposed to restore coherence of the indicandum-indicator relationship. The correction factor is particularly relevant for cropland and fishing grounds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evidence-based practice is not possible without an evidence base. Guldemond et al. confuse our attempt at assessing the status of the evidence base of restoration programs in South Africa with attempting to assess whether restoration is evidence-based. While we fully agree with them that there is a need to assess whether practitioners use evidence in their decision-making, we assert that use of evidence is the last step in the evidence-based approach. It is preceded by the generation (and documentation) of evidence through baseline condition assessment, proper goal setting, sound monitoring of the impacts of the chosen intervention as well as effective dissemination of resulting evidence. To answer the question whether restoration is evidence-based would require the assessment of all stages from generation to use. We chose to start at the beginning, a logical place to start.

AB  - Despite the seriousness of the environmental and socio-economic impacts of desertification, few efforts have been made to devise diagnostic and monitoring techniques for appraising the status and trend of desertification. Indicators are integrated and synthetic information that can provide data on threshold levels, status and evolution of relevant physical, chemical, biological and anthropogenic processes. Existing studies have taken a global perspective, and most have dealt with rangeland conditions. Moreover, the zones usually studied have included countries whose socio-economic and cultural backgrounds differ from those prevailing in Europe. This paper presents a methodology and discussion of indicator requirements, selection and definition, procedures for measuring or making estimates, sensitivity, range of values and interactions. Emphasizing the need to use indicators to develop a system of desertification evaluation, this paper outlines the advantages and difficulties of using such an evaluation system.

AB  - Synthesis of four decades of Gulf of Alaska ichthyoplankton data indicates that species diversity and total abundance peaks during spring, a common pattern in temperate and sub-arctic ocean regions due to synchrony with the spring peak in plankton production. Nevertheless, fish larvae occur in the plankton at all times of year and peak abundance periods vary significantly by species and habitat. Larval size at hatching and at transformation to the juvenile stage is also highly variable and associated with a variety of larval durations and temporal supply of larval cohorts to pelagic habitats. This phenological diversity represents variability in exposure and adaptation to seasonal cycles in the ocean. Water temperature, winds and currents, and availability of suitable zooplankton prey vary significantly on a seasonal scale affecting degrees of synchrony among larval species with optimal environmental conditions for growth, transport and survival. This synchrony is also affected by interannual shifts in the oceanographic environment, and different early life phenologies among species generate different sensitivities to such interannual variability. Early life history strategies and synchronies are evaluated here and environmental sensitivities are proposed for the numerically dominant species of fish larvae occurring in Gulf of Alaska plankton, including commercially and ecologically important species. For winter to early spring spawners, cold temperatures are an advantage in terms of slowing development so that larvae do not use up all their lipid reserves prior to optimal availability of suitable larval zooplankton prey. Interannual variability in winter temperature may therefore be a good indicator of survival outcomes, especially as influenced by the timing of the switch to exogenous feeding. Variability in temperature-influenced larval growth during late spring and summer months may be less consequential in maintaining synchrony with larval food availability for spring summer spawners. Rapid growth in association with warm summer conditions facilitates access to a wide size range of prey organisms and minimizes critical periods of vulnerability to trophic mismatch. The Gulf of Alaska is a highly advective environment; storms and alongshore winds promote onshore advection of surface waters. This onshore Ekman transport is strongest during winter and spring when deep water spawned larvae are most abundant over the slope and require access to the shelf. Enhanced shoreward transport of larvae in the canyons intersecting the slope is also an important mechanism. Interannual variability in such transport mechanisms may be critical in determining early ontogeny survival for these species. During all seasons, but especially spring and summer, there are species of larvae for which retention nearshore is vital for survival and mesoscale oceanographic features as well as larval behavioral abilities may be crucial.
   Annual patterns in phytoplankton and zooplankton production and abundance indicate high-amplitude variation in the composition of prey fields available to larvae, including variability in abundance and the size spectrum of organisms that larvae might encounter and consume. Food limitation seems less likely for larval species that are most abundant in spring summer than for species with peak abundance in winter-spring. It is probable that the more selective a species is in terms of zooplankton prey, the more susceptible that species is to atrophic mismatch. Species-specific intrinsic rates and morphological development during early ontogeny also influence the interaction of larvae with their environment, and larval growth trajectories can be quite different even among species with identical early life phenology. This insight clearly indicates that although phenology is critical, timing is not everything and all fish larvae are not equal. For the 23 species and two genera of fish in this study, a synoptic overview is provided of their early ontogeny environmental synchronies and proposed sensitivities. This ecological synthesis of phenologies helps us characterize vulnerability and resilience factors for intervals of the planktonic phase in the pelagic environment. It also identifies environmental signals that could be tested as species-specific ecosystem indicators of population trends for fish stocks in the Gulf of Alaska. Further, understanding seasonal dynamics in the ichthyoplankton is considered important for gauging food availability and energy flow more broadly in this and other pelagic ecosystems, as well as to understanding environmental forcing on the fish populations themselves.

AB  - A recent global meta-analysis reported a decrease in terrestrial but increase in freshwater insect abundance and biomass (van Klink et al., Science 368, p. 417). The authors suggested that water quality has been improving, thereby challenging recent reports documenting drastic global declines in freshwater biodiversity. We raise two major concerns with the meta-analysis and suggest that these account for the discrepancy with the declines reported elsewhere. First, total abundance and biomass alone are poor indicators of the status of freshwater insect assemblages, and the observed differences may well have been driven by the replacement of sensitive species with tolerant ones. Second, many of the datasets poorly represent global trends and reflect responses to local conditions or nonrandom site selection. We conclude that the results of the meta-analysis should not be considered indicative of an overall improvement in the condition of freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Ongoing climate change has led to an increase in extreme temperatures, which influence both the environment and human beings. However, not everyone is affected by heat stress to the same degree. This article analyzes who is affected by subjective heat stress. Individual and social indicators of vulnerability and exposure-mediated by conditions of housing and living environments-are considered simultaneously, from the sociological perspective of social inequality influences. Using local data from an empirical survey in Nuremberg, Germany, the article shows that age, individual health, and social contexts all explain variations in how people experience heat stress. It is further hypothesized and confirmed that heat exposure due to disadvantaged housing conditions or distance from green space increases the levels of subjective heat stress. When looking at differences in levels of subjective heat stress, the consideration of heat exposure due to social vulnerability and socioeconomic reasons offers some explanations.

AB  - Routine monitoring data from 1993 to 1999 were analysed to elucidate relationships between microbiological water quality and environmental conditions at sixteen EC identified bathing waters in South-West Wales. The objective was (a) to gain an understanding of the factors affecting non-compliance with the guideline standard of the EC Bathing Waters Directive, (b) to aid the development of action plans for improved bathing-water quality, and (c) to enable effective targeting of future investigations. The analyses demonstrated relationships between water quality and rainfall, sunshine, tidal range, tidal state, time of sampling, time of year, wind speed, wind direction, state of sea, transparency, river flows, river quality, salinity and temperature. The temporal and spatial variability In water quality shown by this study also highlights the need to ensure that monitoring programmes represent conditions at the times and locations of greatest bathing-water use.

AB  - Plant protection products to be placed on the market in the European Union need to meet rigorous safety criteria including the testing of lumbricid earthworms, the functionally most important soil organism group in Central European agricultural ecosystems. To address uncertainties and investigate the potential long-term in-crop effects of the fungicide Cantus (R) containing 50% boscalid as an active substance, a series of standardized earthworm field studies with an overall duration of 5 years per study program was carried out in four German agricultural fields under realistic crop rotation conditions. A two-step approach was chosen to analyze the potential overall long-term effects on earthworms in agricultural fields: (i) an assessment of the earthworm abundance development in the course of the four study programs in relation to the determined actual content of boscalid in soil and (ii) an effect size meta-analysis of earthworm abundance 1 year after treatment for each consecutive year and study program. Measured boscalid concentrations in the soil after multiple applications were well above the maximum boscalid residues observed in agricultural soils across Central Europe. There were isolated statistically significant reductions of earthworm abundance for some species and groups at some time points during the studies, but no consistent relationship to the Cantus (R) treatments was observed. These results were supported by the meta-analysis, indicating no adverse effects on earthworm populations. Therefore, fluctuations of abundance reflect the natural variation of the populations rather than a concentration-related response. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we conclude that there is no application rate-related effect of the 5-year use of Cantus (R) on the development of the earthworm communities. The four study programs, paired with a comprehensive evaluation, directly address the concerns about the potential long-term effects of boscalid on earthworms in the field and suggest that multiyear applications do not adversely affect earthworm populations.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are experiencing degradation from compound impacts of climate change and multiple anthropogenic disturbances. These pressures often act synergistically and complicate designing effective conservation measures; consequently, large-scale coastal restoration actions become a wicked problem. The purpose of this study was to use two different food web models in a coordinated manner to inform resource managers in their assessment of the ecological effects of a large-scale marsh restoration project. A team was formed that included the model developers and outside scientists, who were asked to use available model results of the calibrated simulations of an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model and a Comprehensive Aquatic Systems Model (CASM), both designed to describe the structure and energetics of the Barataria Bay, Louisiana, United States food web. Both models offer somewhat different depictions of the predator-prey and competitive interactions of species within the food web, and how environmental conditions affect the species biomass pools and energetics. Collectively, the team evaluated the strengths of each model and derived a common set of indicator variables from model outputs that provided information on the structure and energy flow of the simulated food web. Considering the different modeling structures and calibration approaches, indicators were interpreted within and between models. Use of both models enabled a robust determination that: (1) Detritus plays a vital role in the energetics of the system; (2) The food web responds to spring high flow seasons by increasing productivity through specific, dominant pathways; (3) The trophic pyramid is truncated; (4) Compared to other estuaries, this system has redundant pathways for energy transfer. These findings indicate that the food web appears to be resilient to disturbance because of a detritus energy reserve, most consumer biomass consists of low trophic level, high turnover species, and redundant energy pathways exist. This information provides context to decision-makers for assessing possible basin-scale impacts on fish and shellfish resources of a proposed large-scale restoration project. The use of multiple models in a coordinated but not overly constrained way, as demonstrated here, provides a significant step toward co-production of knowledge for use in resource management decisions.

AB  - It is generally hypothesized that forest dieback is a characteristic of alder swamp forests (alder carrs, Alnion glutinosae alliance). Different internal and external factors may trigger this process, including human disturbance, changes in river discharge, unusually severe and prolonged flooding, terminal age of an even-aged alder forest (ca. 100-150 years) and others. Although forest dieback in this type of forest may cause major changes in environmental conditions, the influence of this change on the floristic composition has not been well recognized. The study aimed to detect any possible changes in floristic variation in alder swamp forest following forest dieback. Vegetation plots in alder swamp forests affected by forest dieback were resurveyed 20 years after a previous study. PERMANOVA was used to test the significance of the compositional change and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) with passively fitted means of the Ellenberg's Indicator Values were used to interpret its ecological meaning. In addition, different structural and diversity indices were compared, including species richness, percentage cover of vegetation layers, Shannon and Simpson diversity and evenness. Finally, we analyzed changes in the frequency of vascular plant species using Chi square tests. We recorded clear and significant compositional changes following alder swamp forest dieback. This change was most related to the gradient of moisture, followed by the gradients of light and temperature. The analysis of the individual species showed that the species of hummocks declined, while the species of hollows increased. Moreover, the current communities are dominated by some hydrophytes that were not recorded 20 years ago. Forest dieback resulted in profound changes in the hydrological regime. The observed changes are consistent with a model of cyclic succession as proposed for alder swamps. In addition, we conclude that the natural forest dynamics have to be taken into consideration while interpreting the results of re-survey studies.

AB  - There are several ecological scales developed both for phytoindication of ecological factors and plant ecomorphs. Among them, the scales of Ellenberg and Tsyganov are the most commonly used. L. G. Ramensky and P. S. Pogrebnyak had developed a phytoindication method; they also were founders of first ecological scale of plant species in relation to various environmental factors. One of first ecomorph systems was developed by Alexander Lyutsianovich Belgard. In 1947, Belgard presented a tabular ecomorph system in his doctoral dissertation, and later in monograph "Forest vegetation of the South-East of Ukraine". In the system he used abbreviated Latin names applying terminology proposed in the late 19th century by Dekandol, Warmin and other authors. He considered ecomorphs as adaptations of plants to environmental conditions in forests of the steppe zone of Ukraine where forest cenoses are exposed to processes of steppization, prairification, swamping, salinization, and thus clarification of relationships between forest, meadow, steppe, marsh and weed plant species was essential. Therefore, development and introduction of cenomorph terms as "adaptation of plant species to phytocenosis as a whole" were an absolutely new contribution to the concept of ecomorph system. In environmental factor scales of Ellenberg and other authors, environment characteristics based on phytoindication were underlined; in the Belgard Plant Ecomorph System, ecomorphs reflect ability of plant species to grow within certain ranges of a given factor. These approaches are quite comparable, and ecomorphs of the Belgard system correspond to certain grades of the Ellenberg and Tsyganov scales. The Belgard ecomorph system has been applied in a number of fundamental and applied works on plant ecology and phytocenology. It is convenient for characterizing ecological features of plant species growing in the steppe zone with a wide range of environment factors such as lighting, humidity, and soil richness. Other authors have expanded and supplemented the Belgard Plant Ecomorph System based on its strategy. A number of ecomorphs was introduced; they reflect intermediate or extreme gradations of factors. A new cenomorph - silvomargoant - has been proposed by the authors of this paper.

AB  - One of the goals of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is to restore more natural salinity regimes to the coastal bays of South Florida (USA) with the aim of improving their degraded estuarine function (e.g., as productive feeding and nursery areas). Here, we examined the occurrence (presence absence) and concentration (presence-only fish density) of goldspotted killifish (Floridichthys carpio) observed in an ongoing fish survey as potential indicators of restoration performance in Biscayne Bay, Florida To determine F. carpio salinity affinity, we applied regression analyses to field data and performed behavioral choice trials in the laboratory, whereby individuals were exposed to a salinity gradient (10-50). Analysis of field data indicated a parabolic relationship between killifish occurrence and salinity, where occurrence is maximized at salinity similar to 22. Killifish concentration was unrelated to salinity. Experimental salinity choice results tended to agree with field observations of occurrence and demonstrated a preference for intermediate salinity levels (10-30). Finally, we performed a simulation exercise to compare seasonal changes in habitat suitability within our study domain over the course of one year. Seasonal comparisons were performed as a proxy for assessing different freshwater management alternatives. We applied the relationship between killifish occurrence and salinity that resulted from analyses of field data to the output of a published hydrodynamic salinity transport model. This exercise provided areal estimates of suitable habitat gained or lost, as well as maps indicating the geographic distribution of habitat quality by season. We conclude that: (1) continued field monitoring of goldspotted killifish occurrence is warranted for its utility as a biological indicator of nearshore salinity conditions in an ecosystem-based management framework and (2) the regression relationships revealed by the present study may be useful in habitat suitability modeling exercises, especially those that compare impacts of different freshwater flow scenarios via simulation.

AB  - In plant communities, the species distribution patterns and their relationships with environmental factors are of central importance in ecology. In San Luis Potosi of Mexico, woodlands of Pinus cembroides and P johannis are sympatric, but P cembroides tends to be located in South and Southwest slopes, in more disturbed sites; unlike, P johannis, is mostly distributed in mesic areas, in North and Northeast slopes. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of some physical factors on the floristic similarity of pinyon pine P cembroides and P johannis. The study area was located in the Sierra San Miguelito, San Luis Potosi, Mexico. We selected 40 sampling units spread over an area of 50km(2). In each unit, we laid out two 20m long lines perpendicular to each other, in which we recorded cover data of the plant species intercepted. We developed two data matrices, the first one including cover values of 91 species, and the second one, considering seven topographical, climatic, and solar radiation variables. We applied cluster analysis and ordination to explore the influence of environmental variables on the floristic differentiation of pinyon pine woodlands. Clustering showed six groups, the first three characterized by P cembroides. The ordination showed that variance represented by the first three axes was 65.9%. Axis 1 was positively correlated with altitude and negatively with mean annual temperature; axes two and three, showed low correlation with the variables tested. P. cembroides woodlands and accompanying flora tend to be located in lower altitude, higher mean annual temperature, and mainly in South-Southwestern slopes. In contrast, stands of P. johannis, mixed stands of P. johannis-P cembroides, and Quercus potosina, were usually founded in greater altitudes, mean annual temperature slightly lower, and North-Northeastern exposure. The sites of these monospecific and mixed woodlands with associated species, indicators of environmental variables, generates the pre-diagnosis of the situation of the communities and their condition, so that future actions can be planned in agreement with the natural balance of the ecosystem.

AB  - Several geopolitical factors, aggravated by worries of global warming, have been fueling the search for and production of renewable energy worldwide for the past few years. Such demand for renewable energy is likely to benefit the sugarcane ethanol industry in Brazil, not only because sugarcane ethanol has a positive energetic balance and relatively low production costs, but also because Brazilian ethanol has been successfully produced and used as biofuel in the country since the 1970s. However, environmental and social impacts associated with ethanol production in Brazil can become important obstacles to sustainable biofuel production worldwide. Atmospheric pollution from burning of sugarcane for harvesting, degradation of soils and aquatic systems, and the exploitation of cane cutters are among the issues that deserve immediate attention from the Brazilian government and international societies. The expansion of sugarcane crops to the areas presently cultivated for soybeans also represent an environmental threat, because it may increase deforestation pressure from soybean crops in the Amazon region. In this paper, we discuss environmental and social issues linked to the expansion of sugarcane in Brazil for ethanol production, and we provide recommendations to help policy makers and the Brazilian government establish new initiatives to produce a code for ethanol production that is environmentally sustainable and economically fair. Recommendations include proper planning and environmental risk assessments for the expansion of sugarcane to new regions such as Central Brazil, improvement of land use practices to reduce soil erosion and nitrogen pollution, proper protection of streams and riparian ecosystems, banning of sugarcane burning practices, and fair working conditions for sugarcane cutters. We also support the creation of a more constructive approach for international stakeholders and trade organizations to promote sustainable development for biofuel production in developing countries such as Brazil. Finally, we support the inclusion of environmental values in the price of biofuels in order to discourage excessive replacement of natural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and pasture by bioenergy crops.

AB  - Antarctic lakes with simple plankton ecosystems are believed to be sensitive biological indicators of climate change. Models of the physical environment, in particular the ice layer, support understanding of how the ecosystems respond to meteorological variables. This paper describes how data from a previously reported automatic measuring probe and meteorological data from Davis station were used to develop a detailed thermodynamic model of the ice layer on Crooked Lake, one of the largest and deepest freshwater lakes in Antarctica. The general model structure is similar to a previously reported model of sea ice but with modifications specific to the Antarctic freshwater lake case informed by the data. The model inputs are atmospheric variables as well as water temperature, ice albedo and the radiation extinction coefficient for the ice. Heat and radiation fluxes at the ice-air and ice-water boundaries are calculated using equations chosen for their suitability for the Antarctic. In the case of shortwave radiation, equations were fitted to data from the automatic probe. Using the heat fluxes to establish boundary conditions, and incorporating the known thermodynamic properties of ice, the temperature profile within the ice and the resulting growth and melt of the ice can be calculated. The model uses a largely mechanistic approach, with most equations taken from established thermodynamic theories or empirical studies and only one adjustable parameter related to the sensible heat flux from the water, which is not easily calculated from the available data. It was found to accurately reproduce ice temperature and ice thickness data for the year 2003, with r(2) = 0.89, n = 2005. Finally, the model was simplified to run with air temperature as the only input variable and was shown to perform well-this suggests that freshwater lake ice is affected more by air temperature than any other variable, and is therefore a useful indicator of climate change in its own right.

AB  - The successful execution of both large and complex construction projects and environmental and natural hazard assessments requires a precise definition of subsurface conditions. Over the past two decades, a series of sophisticated 3-D modelling technologies-collectively identified as geoscientific information systems, or GSIS - have been developed to address this subsurface characterisation need. Existing commercial systems reflect their historical origins. The modelling and visualisation process remains technically challenging. Rapid development of computer hardware and software, modern data base design concepts and expanded information transmission capabilities across the Internet are encouraging the greater use of GSIS technologies as they become cheaper and easier to use and integrate within corporate decision-support systems. The integration of GSIS with broader information management systems is not common, but limited initial experiences suggest that large benefits are likely to result.

AB  - Dimensions and plan morphology of current ripples are generally considered to vary with flow velocity and grain size. Recently, however, it has been shown that for sand of D-50=0.095 and 0.238 mm the equilibrium dimensions are identical at all velocities within the stability field of ripples and that the plan form of equilibrium ripples is linguoid. On this basis, an empirical unsteady flow model has been developed and tested with flume experiments in order to predict ripple development in natural depositional environments. The model includes the development of washed-out ripples and upper stage plane bed. The unsteady flow model explains the development and preservation of small scale bedforms in various tidal environments more accurately than previous models. Such bedforms can serve, therefore, as indicators of prevailing hydrodynamic conditions.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities have led to a global decline in biodiversity, and monitoring studies indicate that both insect communities and wetland ecosystems are particularly affected. However, there is a need for long-term data (over centennial or millennial timescales) to better understand natural community dynamics and the processes that govern the observed trends. Chironomids (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) are often the most abundant insects in lake ecosystems, sensitive to environmental change, and, because their larval exoskeleton head capsules preserve well in lake sediments, they provide a unique record of insect community dynamics through time. Here, we provide the results of a metadata analysis of chironomid diversity across a range of spatial and temporal scales. First, we analyse spatial trends in chironomid diversity using Northern Hemispheric data sets overall consisting of 837 lakes. Our results indicate that in most of our data sets, summer temperature (T-jul) is strongly associated with spatial trends in modern-day chironomid diversity. We observe a strong increase in chironomid alpha diversity with increasing T-jul in regions with present-day T-jul between 2.5 and 14 degrees C. In some areas with T-jul > 14 degrees C, chironomid diversity stabilizes or declines. Second, we demonstrate that the direction and amplitude of change in alpha diversity in a compilation of subfossil chironomid records spanning the last glacial-interglacial transition (similar to 15,000-11,000 years ago) are similar to those observed in our modern data. A compilation of Holocene records shows that during phases when the amplitude of temperature change was small, site-specific factors had a greater influence on the chironomid fauna obscuring the chironomid diversity-temperature relationship. Our results imply expected overall chironomid diversity increases in colder regions such as the Arctic under sustained global warming, but with complex and not necessarily predictable responses for individual sites.

AB  - Grassland vegetation growth directly reflects plant growth conditions, and growth processes are an important component of ecological status assessments of grasslands and can provide timely guidance for agricultural production. In this study, the Xilingol Grassland in Inner Mongolia was used as the study area, and a monitoring indicator system for the remote sensing of grassland vegetation growth was established based on 16 days of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and ground sampling data, which were used to assess the suitability of the indicator system. A monitoring indicator system for the remote sensing of grassland vegetation that included the modified growth index (MGI)-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), MGI-enhanced vegetation index (EVI), growth index (GI)-NDVI, and GI-EVI was established by using the year 2000 as the base year, two vegetation indices and difference and normalized difference methods. A model for estimating the ground growth (g) was then constructed by using expert opinion scoring and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine the weights of vegetation coverage (c), height (h), and yield (y) in the ground plots, with the model calculated as follows: g=0.2543c+0.1848h+0.5609y. Additionally, the ground growth value was calculated according to the ground growth model, and the values obtained from the remote-sensing indicators in the corresponding region were subjected to a correlation analysis based on this partition. The remote-sensing growth indices suitable for temperate steppe, meadow steppe, and desert steppe regions were GI-EVI, MGI-NDVI, and GI-NDVI, respectively. Finally, vegetation growth in the Xilingol Grassland was evaluated using the optimal remote-sensing GI for each area, and the results indicated that the areas with the greatest growth improvement occurred in the temperate steppe region followed by the meadow steppe region, whereas vegetation growth improvement was insignificant in the desert steppe region. The results of this study have important significance for the economic development and ecological environmental improvement of pastoral and semi-pastoral regions and can be used to determine the optimal use and scientific management of grasslands.

AB  - Protected natural areas are often subjected to severe human impacts including recreational-related impacts Walking hiking horse riding bicycling and backpacking are the most popular outdoor recreational activities in many protected areas Trampling of vegetation and soil erosion are two main indicators of trail impact Understanding and modelling factors related to trail and forest road degradation are crucial to park managers who are responsible for the preservation of natural conditions and the maintenance of recreational opportunities It is usually impossible to make direct measurements of all the factors that determine the trail impact Hence the use of GIS modelling to assess environmental sensitivity is encouraged In this study two variables have been used (1 vulnerability of plant communities to trampling 2 vulnerability of soil to erosion processes) to assess the spatial distribution of areas with diversified degrees of environmental sensitivity to trail impact These variables can be relatively easily collected and spatially modelled using GIS The model presented in the study is simple and, an be easily calculated with limited data
   Although 50% of the area of the Gorce National Park has potentially medium or low environmental sensitivity to trail impact over 36% of its recreational trails and forest roads are constructed in sensitive area These roads are highly susceptible to gully erosion One result of the model used in this study is the qualitative assessment of environmental sensitivity Although it does not provide quantitative results (e g a maximum allowed number of tourists per day) It allows to study the spatial distribution of environmental vulnerability and to compare selected areas For example results provided by the proposed methodology can be used to determine which areas are resilient and therefore are predisposed to recreational use and which are vulnerable and should be protected from severe human Impact (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB  - As part of an ongoing ecological assessment of the Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary (GRNMS), a 58-km(2) marine protected area 32 km off the coast of Georgia, USA, surveys of benthic macroinfaunal communities, contaminant levels in sediments and biota, and general habitat conditions were conducted during 2000-2002 at 20 stations within the sanctuary and along three cross-shelf transects in nearby shelf waters. Macroinfaunal community structure and composition exhibited distinct cross-shelf patterns associated with sediment granulometry, depth and possibly other factors related to shoreline proximity (e.g., erosional effects, recruitment of estuarine species). Finer-scale spatial patterns of benthic fauna among stations within the sanctuary appear to be related to proximity to live-bottom habitat and other features of seafloor structure (e.g., rippled vs. flat sand). Population densities of dominant fauna within the sanctuary also varied considerably among years, resulting in shifts in the ranking of dominants at most stations. Chemical contaminants generally were at low background concentrations below probable bioeffect levels and thus are not a likely cause of the observed spatial patterns of benthic fauna. However, trace concentrations of pesticides, PCBs, and PAHs were detectable in sediments and biota throughout the Study area, demonstrating that chemicals originating from human activities are capable of reaching the offshore sanctuary environment, possibly from atmospheric deposition or cross-shelf transport of materials outwelled through coastal sounds. Highly diverse infaunal assemblages also were observed within the sanctuary and nearby sites of similar depth, suggesting that the sanctuary is an important reservoir of marine biodiversity. Results of this study should be useful in addressing long-term science and management needs of the GRNMS and in furthering our understanding of broader ecological patterns and dynamics of the surrounding South Atlantic Bight (SAB) ecosystem.

AB  - The ecotonal zones support populations that are acclimated to changing, fluctuating, and unstable conditions, and as a result, these populations are better equipped to adjust to expected change. In this context, a hypothesis was tested that there must be vegetation dominated by unique indicator plant species under the influence of ecological gradients in the ecotonal zone of Manoor Valley (northwestern Himalaya), Pakistan. Keeping the aforementioned hypothesis in mind, detailed field studies were conducted during different seasons in 2015-18. Line transect sampling and phytosociological characteristics (density, frequency, cover, and their relative values and Importance Value) were implemented as ecological methods. This investigation documented 97 plant species recorded from seven sampling sites. The community distribution modelling revealed that the ecological variables separate the seven sampling sites into two major plant communities (Indigofera-Parrotiopsis-Bistorta and Ziziphus-Leptopus-Quercus) recognized by TWINSPAN. The IBP communities showed a positive and significant correlation with altitude (1789.6-1896.3 m), sandy soil texture with a slightly acidic pH (6.4-6.5), and higher phosphorous (9-13 mg kg(-1)). In contrast with this, the ZLQ community was recognized on the southern slope under the strong influence of high electrical conductivity (2.82-5.4 dsm(-1)), organic matter (1.08-1.25%), calcium carbonate (5.8-7.6 mg kg(-1)), potassium (202-220 mg kg(-1)), and temperature (28.8-31.8 degrees C). Hence, both communities were found on opposite axes with clear differences based on the ecological gradients. NMDS clustered different species with similar habitats and different stands with common species, showing that plant species and stands were in a linear combination with ecological gradients. The IPB community has the maximum number of plant species (87 species), Shannon value (H' = 4), Simpson value (0.98), and Pielou's evenness value (0.96). Thus, the multivariate approaches revealed unique vegetation with sharp boundaries between communities which might be due to abrupt environmental changes.

AB  - The eastern coastal areas of China span multiple climatic zones, and the impacts of climate warming on their ecological environment show regional differences. In this research, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used as the indicator to characterize the ecological environment, and selected Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Liaoning as its typical research areas. The authors selected the NDVI, average temperature, and precipitation data of the yearly growth season, respectively, from 1982 to 2016. This study adopted the copula functions model based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo to carry out the research of bivariate joint distribution so as to calculate the joint probability, the joint exceedance probability, the joint return period and the co-occurrence return period. The results showed that 1) the temperature and precipitation in the three regions were respectively related to the NDVI sequence showing the characteristic that was correlated at the upper tail and asymptotically independent at the lower tail, which demonstrated that the temperature and precipitation had little effect on NDVI when they reached their minimum values, and the temperature and precipitation had obvious effect on NDVI when they reached their maximum values. 2) The shorter the return period was, the wider the ranges of the climate factor and the NDVI were, showing that when the climate factor was constant, the probability of the NDVI having a shorter return period was higher. The greater the climate factor was, the longer the return period was, indicating that the probability of plant growth inhibition was higher when the climate factor exceeded a certain threshold. 3) The suitable temperature and precipitation for vegetation growth in the three regions gradually decreased from south to north. These results provide some theoretical guidance and scientific foundation for the protection of regional ecological environment and enhance the understanding of the impact of climate change on the ecosystem.

AB  - The goal of our review was to evaluate scientific outcomes connected to hydromorphology and Water Framework Directive by synthesizing the main themes based on keywords, research domains, and the spatial coverage of high visibility publications. These data were integrated into a social network analysis to understand the structure of science related to our topic. Thus, we investigated 183 articles and conference proceedings from the Web of Science Core Collection. Among the 505 authors keywords, the central ones in our network were Water Framework Directive, hydromorphology, macroinvertebrates, ecological status, water quality, reference conditions, and river. The characteristics of the network of keywords indicated that information developed around a few key-concepts linked to numerous peripheral keywords, which highlighted some main themes of research. Hydromorphology appeared mostly in articles with macroinvertebrates and river restoration, suggesting the acceptance of environmental based paradigm in water bodies' management. Consequently, we expected to count the majority of publications in Environmental Sciences & Ecology research domain. Issues related to the society (e.g. public participation, stakeholders) didn't appear in our analysis. Publications covered especially European Union member states, the network being dominated by Germany, Italy, and UK in terms of both study area and authorship. Besides traditional scientific relations between Western and Northern European states, we also noticed numerous comparisons between Danube countries. To comment the position of these publications in the scientific world, we used the Article Influence Score, which was below the average for the main research domain of Environmental Sciences & Ecology, probably as a consequence of the regional cover and concern of the Water Framework Directive. Further, we recommend more connections between environmental and social sciences, as well as between countries and we encourage funding for open access publications in order to increase the visibility and influence of the topic of hydromorphology and Water Framework Directive both bibliometrically and for decision and policy makers.

AB  - Land use decision making in the Upper Suriname River area knows a history of disempowerment and marginalization of the Saamaka communities inhabiting the area. Non-recognition of land rights is at the origin of this problem. This is aggravated by the increasing over-exploitation of timber resources by powerful stakeholders and the unfair distribution of timber benefits. This has left Saamakans marginalized, causing distrust and opposition among themselves and towards outsiders. Furthermore, as a result of deforestation, Saamakans face detrimental changes in the ecosystem services (ES) that support their traditional livelihoods, with important effects for their wellbeing. This environment of distrust, opposition and marginalization makes it difficult to assess these concerns. Hence, an ES assessment approach that would generate salient ES knowledge while generating trust, communication among stakeholders and local capacity building was needed. In this paper we evaluate whether Participatory 3D modelling (P3DM) is an effective approach for ecosystem services assessments in such disenabling environments. We evaluate this by using empirical data from an ES assessment in the Saamaka region using a P3DM approach. Results show the efficient identification and evaluation of 36 ES representing provisioning, cultural and regulating service categories with crops, fish, wild meat, timber and forest medicines identified as most important. We found a decrease in the demand and supply of crops, fish and wild meat associated with ecosystem degradation, out-migration and changes in lifestyles. Further, our findings show an increasing demand and decreasing supply for timber related to over-exploitation. We provide evidence of the utility of P3DM to foster multi-functional landscape development among wary communities. Further, we discuss the usefulness of the approach and the necessary conditions needed for P3DM process to tackle the needs of the local communities as well as the need for a broader P3DM implementation strategy beyond the engagement, screening, and diagnostic phases of ES assessments when the aim is to enhance ES outcomes for marginalized communities.

AB  - This paper gives step-by-step instructions for assessing aquatic selenium hazards associated with mining. The procedure was developed to provide the U.S. Forest Service with a proactive capability for determining the risk of selenium pollution when it reviews mine permit applications in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The procedural framework is constructed in a decision-tree format in order to guide users through the various steps, provide a logical sequence for completing individual tasks, and identify key decision points. There are five major components designed to gather information on operational parameters of the proposed mine as well as key aspects of the physical, chemical, and biological environment surrounding it - geological assessment, mine operation assessment, hydrological assessment, biological assessment, and hazard assessment. Validation tests conducted at three mines where selenium pollution has occurred confirmed that the procedure will accurately predict ecological risks. In each case, it correctly identified and quantified selenium hazard, and indicated the steps needed to reduce this hazard to an acceptable level. By utilizing the procedure, NEPA workers can be confident in their ability to understand the risk of aquatic selenium pollution and take appropriate action. Although the procedure was developed for the Forest Service it should also be useful to other federal land management agencies that conduct NEPA assessments, as well as regulatory agencies responsible for issuing coal mining permits under the authority of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) and associated Section 401 water quality certification under the Clean Water Act. Mining companies will also benefit from the application of this procedure because priority selenium sources can be identified in relation to specific mine operating parameters. The procedure will reveal the point(s) at which there is a need to modify operating conditions to meet environmental quality goals. By recognizing concerns early in the NEPA process, it may be possible for a mining company to match operational parameters with environmental requirements, thereby increasing the likelihood that the permit application will be approved.

AB  - Many wetlands around the world that occur at the base of watersheds are under threat from land-use change, hydrological alteration, nutrient pollution, and invasive species. A relevant measure of whether the ecological character of these ecosystems has changed is the species diversity of wetland-dependent waterbirds, especially those of conservation value. Here, we evaluate the potential mechanisms controlling variability over time and space in avian species diversity of the wetlands in the Palo Verde National Park, a Ramsar Site of international importance in Costa Rica. To do so, we assessed the relative importance of several key wetland condition metrics (i.e., surface water depth, wetland extent, and vegetation greenness), and temporal fluctuations in these metrics, in predicting the abundance of five waterbirds of high conservation value as well as overall waterbird diversity over a 9-yr period. Generalized additive models revealed that mean NDVI, an indicator of vegetation greenness, combined with a metric used to evaluate temporal fluctuations in the wetland extent best predicted four of the five waterbird species of high conservation value as well as overall waterbird species richness and diversity. Black-bellied Whistling-ducks, which account for over one-half of all waterbird individuals, and all waterbird species together were better predicted by including surface water depth along with wetland extent and its fluctuations. Our calibrated species distribution model confidently quantified monthly averages of the predicted total waterbird abundances in seven of the 10 sub-wetlands making up the Ramsar Site and confirmed that the biophysical diversity of this entire wetland system is important to supporting waterbird populations both as a seasonal refuge and more permanently. This work further suggests that optimizing the timing and location of ongoing efforts to reduce invasive vegetation cover may be key to avian conservation by increasing waterbird habitat.

AB  - Myriophyllum spicatum is a sediment-rooted, aquatic macrophyte growing submerged, with a wide geographical distribution and high ecological relevance in freshwater ecosystems. It is used in testing and risk assessment for pesticides in water and sediment. Population models enable effects measured under laboratory conditions to be extrapolated to effects expected in the field with time-variable environmental factors including exposure. These models are a promising tool in higher-tier risk assessments. However, there is a lack of data on the seasonal dynamics of M. spicatum, which is needed to test model predictions of typical population dynamics in the field. To generate such data, a two-year study was set up in outdoor experimental systems from May 2017 to May 2019. The growth of M. spicatum was monitored in 0.2025 m(2) plant baskets installed in an experimental ditch. Parameters monitored included biomass (fresh weight [FW] and dry weight [DW]), shoot length, seasonal short-term growth rates of shoots, relevant environmental parameters, and weather data. The results showed a clear seasonal pattern of biomass and shoot length and their variability. M. spicatum reached a maximum total shoot length (TSL) of 279 m m(-2) and a maximum standing crop above-ground DW of 262 g m(-2). Periodical growth rates reached up to 0.072, 0.095, and 0.085 day(-1) for total length, FW, and DW, respectively. Multivariate regression revealed that pH (as a surrogate for the availability of carbon species) and water temperature could explain a significant proportion of the variability in M. spicatum growth rates (p < 0.05). This study has provided an ecologically relevant data set on seasonal population dynamics representative of shallow freshwater ecosystems, which can be used to test and refine population models for use in chemical risk assessment and ecosystem management.

AB  - The study of the relationships between vascular aquatic macrophyte occurrence, species richness and the local environment are central for suitable ecosystem quality assessments, freshwater bodies management and assistance for macrophyte restoration. Here we quantify the importance of the local factors, both water column and sediment, to provide tools for lentic water systems management and conservation in a Mediterranean region. We surveyed 90 water bodies along a 2500 m altitudinal gradient in Catalonia (NE Spain). Despite its relatively small scale, the area of study exhibits large-scale environmental gradients mainly related to a diverse geology and climate. In consequence, the response of aquatic macrophytes to a broad range of environmental conditions can be studied without interference of biogeographical dines. We identified all vascular aquatic macrophytes and analyzed 35 environmental variables at each site. Local environmental factors accounted for only 19% of variance in aquatic macrophyte distribution. Even though water column variables explained more variance than sediment variables in a variance partitioning analysis (pCCA), a mixed model integrating variables of both compartments performed better. The most important variables driving aquatic macrophyte distribution were water conductivity, water DOC, water K, water pH, water Na, sediment organic matter, sediment Na and water nitrate. CCA between species and water and sediment variables clearly segregated coastal lagoons, temporary pools and alpine lakes over two main gradients: ionic content and water body productivity. Species richness was low (4.2 species per water body on average) and GAM showed weak correlations with sediment and most water column variables. The best factor explaining species richness was the geomorphological typology, but only temporary pools were significantly different from the other types and had the highest species richness. Thus, temporary pools were unique and displayed a high biodiversity, strengthening the need for their preservation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Woolsey Mound, a carbonate/hydrate complex of cold seeps, vents, and seafloor pockmarks in Mississippi Canyon Block 118, is the site of the Gulf of Mexico Hydrates Research Consortium's (GOMHRC) multi-sensor, multi-disciplinary, permanent seafloor observatory. In preparation for installing the observatory, the site has been studied through geophysical, biological, geological, and geochemical surveys. By integrating high-resolution, swath bathymetry, acoustic imagery, seafloor video, and shallow geological samples in a morpho-bio-geological model, we have identified a complex mound structure consisting of three main crater complexes: southeast, northwest, and southwest. Each crater complex is associated with a distinct fault. The crater complexes exhibit differences in morphology, bathymetric relief, exposed hydrates, fluid venting, sediment accumulation rates, sediment diagenesis, and biological community patterns. Spatial distribution of these attributes suggests that the complexes represent three different fluid flux regimes: the southeast complex seems to be an extinct or quiescent vent; the northwest complex exhibits young, vigorous activity; and the southwest complex is a mature, fully open vent. Geochemical evidence from pore-water gradients corroborates this model suggesting that upward fluid flux waxes and wanes over time and that microbial activity is sensitive to such change. Sulfate and methane concentrations show that microbial activity is patchy in distribution and is typically higher within the northwest and southwest complexes, but is diminished significantly over the southeast complex. Biological community composition corroborates the presence of distinct conditions at the three crater complexes. The fact that three different fluid flux regimes coexist within a single mound complex confirms the dynamic nature of the plumbing system that discharges gases into bottom water. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of bio-geological processes appears to be a valid indicator of multiple fluid flux regimes that coexist at the mound. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Because novel ecological conditions can cause severe and long-lasting environmental damage with large economic costs, ecologists must identify possible environmental regime shifts and pro-actively guide ecosystem management. As an illustrative example, we applied six potential indicators of impending regime shifts to S. R. Carpenter and W. A. Brock's model of lake eutrophication and analyzed whether or not they afforded adequate advance warning to enable preventative interventions. Our initial analyses suggest that an indicator based on the high-frequency signal in the spectral density of the time-series provides the best advance warning of a regime shift, even when only incomplete information about underlying system drivers and processes is available. In light of this result, we explored two key factors associated with using indicators to prevent regime shifts. The first key factor is the amount of inertia in the system; i.e., how fast the system will react to a change in management, given that a manager can actually control relevant system drivers. If rapid, intensive management is possible, our analyses suggest that an indicator must provide at least 20 years advance warning to reduce the probability of a regime shift to <5%. As time to intervention is increased or intensity of intervention is decreased, the necessary amount of advance warning required to avoid a regime shift increases exponentially. The second key factor concerns the amount and type of variability intrinsic to the system, and the impact of this variability on the power of an indicator. Indicators are considered powerful if they detect an impending regime shift with adequate lead time for effective management intervention, but not so far in advance that interventions are too costly or unnecessary. Intrinsic "noise'' in the system obscures the "signal'' provided by all indicators, and therefore, the power of the indicators declines rapidly parameters. Our results highlight the key role of human decisions in managing ecosystems and the importance of pro-active application of the precautionary principle to avoid regime shifts.

AB  - The development of ecologically sound water allocation strategies that account for the needs of riverine ecosystems is a pressing issue, especially in semiarid river basins. In the Aral Sea Basin, a search for strategies to mitigate ecological and socioeconomic deterioration has been in process since the early 1990s. The Geographic Information System-based simulation tool TUGAI has been developed to support the policy determination process by providing a simple, problem-oriented method to assess ecological effects of alternative water management strategies for the Amudarya River. It combines a multiobjective water allocation model with simple, spatially explicit statistical and rule-based models of landscape dynamics. Changes in environmental conditions are evaluated by a fuzzy habitat suitability index for Populus euphratica, which is the dominant species of the characteristic riverine Tugai forests. Water management scenarios can be developed by altering spatiotemporal water distribution in the delta area or the amount of water inflow into the delta. Outcomes of scenario analysis are qualitative comparisons of the ecological effects of different options for a time period of up to 28 years. The given approach utilizes different types of knowledge, from quantitative hydrological data to qualitative local expert knowledge. The main purpose of the tool is to integrate the knowledge in a comprehensive way to make it available for discussions on alternative policies in moderated workshops with stakeholders. In this article, the modules of the tool, their integration, and three hypothetical scenarios are presented. Based on the experience gained when developing the TUGAI tool, we propose that the general framework can be transferred to other areas where tradeoffs in water allocation between the environment and other water users are of major concern. The potential for a simulation tool to structure and inform a complex resource management situation by involving local experts and stakeholders in the development of possible future scenarios will become increasingly valuable for transparent and participatory resource management.

AB  - Environmental impact assessment (EIA) work is becoming more and more extensive in the world. The environmental assessment process has to be differently defined in different countries. In fact, it appears that no two countries have defined it in exactly the same way. It is an aid to decision-making and the minimization or elimination of environmental impacts at an early planning stage. The EIA process is potentially a basis for negotiations between the developer, public interest groups and the planning regulator.
   The Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix (RIAM) method is based on a standard definition of the important assessment criteria as well as the means by which semiquantitative values for each of these criteria can be collected to provide an accurate and independent score for each condition. The impact of project activities is evaluated against the environmental components and for each component a score is determined, which provides a measure of the impact expected from the component. The RIAM method makes it possible to carry out a global analysis of the results based on the individual environmental score (ES) for each component, which is classified in ranges and so can be compared to each other.
   In this study, RIAM method was used for the Tuzla Geothermal and Can Thermal Power Plant in Canakkale. The most impacts are of class -B and there is a majority of positive impacts in Tuzla Geothermal Power Plant. No major negative impact has been identified by RIAM. Because of the geothermal fluid, physico-chemical effects are prominent in the study area. This power plant will cause positive impacts resulting from the sociological-cultural and economic-operational changes due to this power plant. Most impacts are of class -D in Can Thermal Power Plant. Because of the low quality coal, biological-ecological and physico-chemical effects are predominant in the study area. This power plant will cause positive impacts resulting from the sociological-cultural and economic-operational changes due to this power plant.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, sales volumes in the knowledge-intensive sectors of the developed world grew about 2 times faster than in the manufacturing industry. It is no coincidence that the share of knowledge-intensive sectors of the manufacturing industry and the service sector today accounts for an average of more than half the GDP of the leading industrial countries. A new, knowledge-based economy creates new resources that effectively replace natural resources and human intellect. A high-end economy is the creation of new, artificial energy and artificial intelligence and their use in all sectors of the economy. In addition, a knowledge-intensive economy is a large-scale use of scientific developments, a new content of labor and the attitude of all its participants to it. A high-tech economy is born and is able to develop in a social environment with a sufficient level of intellectual development of society. The creation of such an economy requires not only a high level of development and implementation of new resource-creating and resource-saving technologies, but also a mass knowledge of new technologies, skills to use in production and everyday life. A high-tech economy is formed in conditions of sufficient intellectual security. With all this, the urgency of finding answers to the questions is growing: what conditions are necessary for the creation and functioning of a knowledge-based economy. In this regard, firstly, the article compares the level of development of human resources in the Republic of Kazakhstan with other countries of the world, which allows us to conclude that in terms of quantitative indicators (coverage of primary, secondary, vocational and higher education, life expectancy), our country has average positions in the world ranking. Secondly, in order to identify the relationship between a number of indicators of the method of assessing intellectual security in Kazakhstan, a correlation analysis for 2004-2017 was conducted. This article expands the knowledge on methods of assessing intellectual security for the development of a knowledge-based economy in developing countries.

AB  - A major problem in food security, especially in developing countries, is the issue of the effective and sustainable utilization of agricultural water and land resources (AWLR). The system, however, is complicated by the interaction between humans and nature. There is a critical need to understand geographical differentiation and regional characteristics for the purpose of formulating management measures and altering development planning to fit the local conditions. This action requires establishing a set of indicators to conduct agricultural water and land resources utilization (AWLRU) zoning. This paper presents a general framework for the design and application of zoning indicators, integrating four dimensions of the AWLRU system: natural, technological, socio-economic and ecological. The supply-demand (SD) theory with the DPSIR (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) model was identified as an analytical framework by examining both the existing frameworks, and the desirable characteristics of indicators of AWLRU zoning. Five attributes or layers within the AWLRU system were defined, by which interdependent and interaction relations between nature and humans were revealed. Bayan Nur of Inner Mongolia was selected as the location for the case study. The results indicate obvious regional characteristics of AWLRU distributed along the Yellow River. The spatial pattern of AWLRU zoning was consistent with the condition of water resources and the characteristics of land use. Divisions were drawn clearly from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The results also indicate that water supply and the available land resources played a major role in the process of agricultural production that they determined the degree and direction of water and land resources utilization, and the types of agricultural production. The case study demonstrates the practicality and reasonability of the proposed framework and provides a reference for reasonable formulation and management of AWLR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Quantifying the historical range and variability of landscape composition and structure using Simulation modeling is becoming an important means of assessing current landscape condition and prioritizing landscapes for ecosystem restoration. However, most simulated time series are generated using static climate conditions which fail to account for the predicted major changes in future climate. This paper presents a simulation study that generates reference landscape compositions for all combinations of three climate scenarios (warm-wet, hot-dry, and current) and three fire regime scenarios (half historical, historical, and double historical fire frequencies) to determine if future climate change has an effect on landscape dynamics. We applied the spatially explicit, state-and-transition, landscape fire succession model LANDSUM to two large landscapes in west-central Montana, USA. LANDSUM was parameterized and initialized using spatial data generated from the LANDFIRE prototype project. Biophysical settings, critical spatial inputs to LANDSUM, were empirically modeled across the landscape using environmental gradients created from historical and modeled future climate daily weather data summaries. Successional pathways and disturbance probabilities were assigned to these biophysical settings based on existing field data and extensive literature reviews. To assess the impact of changes in climate and fire regime, we compared simulated area burned and landscape composition over time among the different simulation scenario combinations using response variables of Sorenson's index (a global measure of similarity) and area occupied by the dominant vegetation class (simple indicator of change in landscape composition). Results show that simulated time series using future predicted climate scenarios are significantly different from the simulated historical time series and any changes in the fire regime tend to create more dissimilar and more variable simulated time series. Our study results indicate that historical time series should be used in conjunction with simulated future time series as references for managing landscapes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We report the results of a detailed paleoecological study of the Bonneville basin covering the last similar to 280,000 yr. Our study used fossil ostracodes and a sedimentological record obtained from the August 2000 GLAD800 drilling operation at Great Salt Lake. We analyzed 125 samples, taken at similar to 1 in intervals from Site 4 (GSL00-4), for ostracodes and other paleoecologic and sedimentologic indicators of environmental change. Multivariate analyses applied to the ostracode data and qualitative analyses of fossil and sedimentological data indicate an alternation between three major environments at the core site over the cored interval: (1) shallow saline or hypersaline lakes; (2) salt or freshwater marshes;, and (3) occasional deep freshwater lakes. These environmental changes are consistent with shoreline studies of regional lake level fluctuations, but provide considerable new detail on both the timing and environmental conditions associated with the various lake phases. Our age model (using C-14, U- series, tephra and biostratigraphic chronologies) allowed us to associate the core's record of regional paleohydrology with the marine oxygen isotope stages of global climate change. The core contains continuous records for the last four glacial/interglacial sequences. Salt/freshwater marshes were common during the interglacials and deep freshwater conditions correspond with maximum global ice volume in OIS 2, and before a maximum in global ice during OIS 6. Immediately following deep lake phases, crashes in lake level from rapid desiccation resulted in the deposition of thick evaporite units. Our study suggests that the climate of the Great Salt Lake catchment appears to have been drier during OIS 6 than during OIS 2. We compare our record of environmental change during OIS 6 glaciation with other records from the western United States and find that the overall pattern of climate was similar throughout the West, but differences in the timing of climate change (i.e. when a region became drier or moister) are common.

AB  - In many industrialized countries the use of land is impeded by soil pollution from a variety of sources. Decisions on clean-up, management or set-aside of contaminated land are based on various considerations, including human health risks, but ecological arguments do not have a strong position in such assessments. This paper analyses why this should be so, and what ecotoxicology and theoretical ecology can improve on the situation. It seems that soil assessment suffers from a fundamental weakness, which relates to the absence of a commonly accepted framework that may act as a reference. Soil contamination can be assessed both from a functional perspective and a structural perspective. The relationship between structure and function in ecosystems is a fundamental question of ecology which receives a lot of attention in recent literature, however, a general concept that may guide ecotoxicological assessments has not yet arisen. On the experimental side, a good deal of progress has been made in the development and standardized use of terrestrial model ecosystems (TME). In such systems, usually consisting of intact soil columns incubated in the laboratory under conditions allowing plant growth and drainage of water, a compromise is sought between field relevance and experimental manageability. A great variety of measurements can be made on such systems, including microbiological processes and activities, but also activities of the decomposer soil fauna. I propose that these TMEs can be useful instruments in ecological soil quality assessments. In addition a ``bioinformatics approach'' to the analysis of data obtained in TME experiments is proposed. Soil function should be considered as a multidimensional concept and the various measurements can be considered as indicators, whose combined values define the "normal operating range'' of the system. Deviations from the normal operating range indicate that the system is in a condition of stress. It is hoped that more work along this line will improve the prospects for ecological arguments in soil quality assessment.

AB  - Mussel-flow relationships are not well defined and studies linking behavioural, physiological and life-history traits to hydrological conditions remain scant. This lack of information hinders not only understanding of how flow shapes population and community processes but the development of evidence-based flow recommendations to mitigate mussel declines. Mussel-flow relationships were evaluated for Potamilus amphichaenus (Texas heelsplitter), Pleurobema riddellii (Louisiana pigtoe) and Truncilla macrodon (Texas fawnsfoot) from the Sabine, Trinity, Neches and Cypress River basins of East Texas using Indicators of Hydraulic Alteration and random forest models. These species were chosen because all three are currently being evaluated for listing under the US Endangered Species Act. Analyses were performed on US Geological Survey stream gauge stations and mussel records within 20 km of each other. Only gauges with at least 15 years of continuous data and >= 70% overlap of flow records from 1968 to 2018 were included. For selected 28 gauges, Indicators of Hydraulic Alteration were used to calculate 47 hydrological parameters that describe the magnitude, frequency and duration of high and low flow events. Random forest classification models across species were significant and had low error rates (3.57-21.43%), moderate to high sensitivity (0.81-0.93) and moderate to high specificity (0.71-1.00). Life-history theory was useful for explaining how mussel species cope with hydrological variation. Potamilus amphichaenus and T. macrodon/Truncilla donaciformis, considered r-selected or opportunistic strategists, were more likely to occur in basins characterized by significant changes in flow and land use compared with P. riddellii, considered a K-selected or equilibrium strategist. The analytical framework presented in this study should be helpful to managers and conservationists interested in determining how the flow regime is shaping aquatic communities in their region and developing reference points that could serve for ecological research, conservation and management.

AB  - Climate change has caused various issues for our society and the environment. To decrease these impacts, abundant urban green infrastructure is considered a significant policy strategy. Green infrastructure provides a variety of social and ecological benefits, from improving mental health to managing flood conditions. Although previous studies have provided many planning approaches for green infrastructure, the kind of green infrastructure spatial configurations that can maximize co-benefits remains to be explored. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the synergies and trade-offs between co-benefits should be discussed. In this article, we applied the bivariate local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (BiLISA) to identify the spatial distribution of synergies and trade-offs between different co-benefits. We then built a Green Infrastructure Spatial Planning (GISP) model to set up three different scenarios, including plan orientation and centralized and decentralized green infrastructure planning. Ultimately, we evaluated accessibility to green infrastructure by GIS and surface runoff by Soil and Water Assessment Tools (SWAT) in these scenarios. The results showed that spatial heterogeneity exists in the synergy and trade-off relationships between diverse co-benefits, thus providing a new perspective for researchers to have more systematic studies associated with this issue. According to the Green Infrastructure Spatial Planning model that we built, the prioritization for green infrastructure is located in Annan District and North District in the Yanshuei River Basin. In addition, the effect of runoff reduction is better with decentralized green infrastructure planning; that is, smaller units of green infrastructure with a separate configuration are more effective in reducing runoff. Furthermore, the average accessibility to green infrastructure of decentralized green infrastructure planning is higher than that of the centralized scenario. In conclusion, decision-makers and planners should consider planning green infrastructure in a decentralized way to enhance the resilience and sustainability of one area.

AB  - The tropical estuaries are characterized with high biological production and also impacted by anthropogenic activities. Describing these estuaries in terms of ecological data and trophic dynamics to reveal the ecological impacts is gaining attention recently. In this study, the ecological structure is analyzed for a heavily impacted small macrotidal tropical estuary, Ulhas river estuary (URE), situated near Mumbai megacity in the western coast of India, to delineate the impact of anthropogenic stressors on the ecosystem functioning. The URE is being exploited for sand and fisheries resources, and also faces risks from anthropogenic activities. The ecological data of URE were compiled for 2017-18 together with the most relevant literature estimates to construct an ecosystem model. A trophic organization in 20 functional groups was identified for URE using Ecopath modeling approach. The functional groups identified in the food web ranged from detritus and primary producers (trophic level (TL) = 1) to large pelagics (TL = 4.14). Detritivory: herbivory ratio (1.35) indicated that the detritus chain is dominant over the primary producer's chain. The total system throughput (TST) was estimated as 16 736.2 t km(-2)year(-1). The indices such as net system production (NSP = 1 398.781 t km(-2) year(-1)), total primary production/total biomass (TPP/TB = 25.17), biomass/total system throughput (TB/TST = 0.01), recycling index (Finn's Cycling Index = 13.94%), system omnivory index (0.3), relative ascendency (25.6%), and system overhead (74.4%) classified URE as an immature system. The eco-exergy index (30748.54 gm detritus equivalent m(-2)) showed that the ecosystem is a moderately stable and relatively less organized network. The estuarine fish community index (EFCI) yielded a value of 38 indicating the poor health status of the fish community in URE. The study delivers a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem setting in URE and characterizes the prevailing condition. The ecological indicators analyzed here point towards a medium to a high level of impact in URE due to anthropogenic activities.

AB  - The N:P stoichiometry of a water body is one of the most commonly used indicators of its nutrient status and algal growth. However, in a dynamic aquatic ecosystem the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton is highly variable and depends on environmental conditions and key microbial interactions that influence their growth, such as grazing pressures and the microbial loop. Here we determine the influence of the nutrient-dependent microbial interactions between zooplankton, phytoplankton and bacteria on the ecological stoichiometry at different trophic levels and how they relate to water column properties. A 1D hydrodynamic-ecological model (DYRESM-CAEDYM) was applied to Lake Kinneret (Israel) for examining how the internal nutrient ratios of several phytoplankton functional groups correlate with nutrient ratios within the water column, and further explore how the microbial loop shapes the patterns of stoichiometry within the food web by testing two microbial loop configurations. The results showed that the average internal N:P ratios of the phytoplankton community followed their total carbon biomass patterns, and that seasonal patterns of simulated dissolved inorganic N to total P (DIN:TP) ratios in the water column were a useful indicator for reflecting the bulk phytoplankton N:P stoichiometry as compared with total N to total P (TN:TP) ratios and dissolved inorganic N to dissolved inorganic P (DIN:DIP) ratios. However, the internal N:P ratio patterns of individual phytoplankton groups did not necessarily correlate with DIN:TP ratio patterns in the water column. This was because different microbial processes regulate nutrient flows to individual phytoplankton groups. Our simulations with the microbial loop highlight the ability of bacteria to regulate phytoplankton stoichiometry. These results provide an improved mechanistic understanding of the food web in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Due to the hierarchical organization of stream networks, land use changes occurring at larger spatial scales (i.e. the catchment) can affect physical, chemical and biological characteristics at lower spatial scales, ultimately altering stream structure and function. Anthropogenic effects on streams have primarily been documented using structural metrics such as water chemistry, channel alteration and algal biomass. Functional parameters, including metrics of nutrient retention and metabolism, are now being widely used as indicators of stream condition.
   2. Within this hierarchical context, we used a multivariate approach to examine how structural and functional (i.e. nutrient retention and metabolism) attributes of streams are related to catchment variables, including land use. The study was done in 13 streams located within a single Mediterranean catchment, but draining sub-catchments with contrasting land use.
   3. At the catchment scale, results showed two contrasting land use gradients: (i) from forested- to urban-dominated catchments and (ii) from low to moderate agricultural-dominated catchments. Variation in structural and functional parameters was strongly related to these land use gradients. Specifically, NH4+ demand (measured as the uptake velocity, V-f) decreased along the gradient from forested- to urban-dominated catchments primarily in response to increases in stream nutrient concentrations [NH4+, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and carbon (DOC)]. Both primary production and respiration increased along the gradient of agricultural development in response to increases in algal biomass (chlorophyll a). Soluble reactive phosphorus demand was not related to any of the land use gradients.
   4. Our results illustrate the connections among factors operating at different spatial scales (i.e. from catchments to streams) and their distinct influence on stream ecosystem function. Managers should take into consideration these connections when designing stream management and restoration plans. Because ecologically successful stream management and restoration is expected to restore function as well as structure to streams, the use of appropriate measures of functional processes is required. Nutrient retention and metabolism parameters are good candidates to fill this gap.

AB  - Cultural and Creative Industries (ICC) form an ecosystem that benefits from both favorable socio-economic environments and the opportunities opened by the technological change. This article establishes the existence of correlations between the indicators that allow contextualizing creative activities in the framework of Spanish regions, in general, and of Catalonia in particular. GDP per capita and education level feedback each other positively; education is associated to lower risks of poverty and high rates of opportunities, infrastructures and digital uses; and the availability and intensive management of information and communication technologies (ICT) is inherent to greater cultural consumption and the enjoyment of favorable economic conditions. The methodology used in the present analysis shows for the first time the disaggregated weight of CCI in Catalonia, and its relationship with the rest of the Spanish regions.

AB  - Fish in both natural and farming conditions are exposed to stress of capture, handling, transport or treatment that provoke low zootechnical performance. Anesthetics like eugenol obtained from clove oil have been used strategically not only in freshwater but also in marine and estuarine fish in order to reduce the stress. Apart from the eugenol indication as anesthetic and its low toxicity for animals, its environment action is not clear. Bioassays or ecotoxicity tests with indicator organisms are used to evaluate the mode of action of the pollutants in the environment. The aim of this study was to test the acute toxicity of eugenol using the microcrustacean Daphnia magna and the bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri, and also its chronic toxicity for the algae Desmodesmus subspicatus. Eugenol in the concentrations of 50, 75 and 100mg L-1 were toxic to tested indicator organisms.

KW  - SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES
AB  - A new assessment system for macrophytes and phytobenthos in German lakes according to the Water Framework Directive of the European Community is described. Based on biological, chemical and hydromorphological data from about 100 lake sites covering the main ecoregions, hydromorphological lake types and degradation forms, biocoenotic types could be defined. For developing a classification system the quality element macrophytes and phytobenthos was divided into two components: macrophytes and benthic diatoms. For macrophytes 4 and for benthic diatoms 4 lake types were identified. The benthic vegetation at reference conditions is described and degradation is characterised as deviation in benthic vegetation species composition and abundance from the reference biocoenosis. For classification in five ecological status classes, several metrics were developed and used in combination with existing indices. For a few of the described lake types further investigations are necessary before a classification can be developed.

T2  - ARCHAEOFAUNA
LA  - English
AB  - Species of primate are physiologically and behaviorally adapted to particular environmental and ecological conditions. As a result, the presence or absence and the structure of primate communities are useful indicators of temporal and spatial variations in climate and environment. Previous zooarchaeological studies that have focused on Bornean primates have been restricted to the identification and analyses of the mandibles, maxillae, and teeth. However, adaptation to different modes of locomotion by the various species of monkeys and apes that inhabit Borneo has resulted in recognizable differences in the structure and morphology of a number of post-cranial skeletal elements. This paper focuses on just one of these elements, the humerus. It describes some of the anatomical criteria identified in modem humeri that consistently vary among the different primate genera, and demonstrates how this information can be applied to the study of primate remains recovered from archaeological contexts.

AB  - Spores of a Bacillus stearothermophilus strain thought to be a good biological monitor for low temperature steam and formaldehyde (LTSF) sterilization have been subjected to different recovery environments following exposure to relevant LTSF treatments and prior to enumerating the numbers of surviving spores. The recovery treatments essentially consisted of holding samples at a temperature of 90 degrees C for different time periods prior to plating out following exposure to 12 mu g ml(-1) formaldehyde at temperatures between 63 degrees and 83 degrees C. The data indicate that LTSF-exposed spores show a marked recovery when kept at 90 degrees C prior to plating out; the extent of the recovery increases with increasing inactivation temperature between 73 degrees and 83 degrees C. The data bring into question the sporicidal activity of LTSF.

AB  - Developmental Instability (DI) has been proposed as an inexpensive, quickly applied, and sensitive indicator of stress that can be utilized in early warning and in monitoring anthropogenic impacts on fish and other animals and plants. A problem arises, however, to the extent that natural stressors confound the effects of human-induced disturbances. Our objective in this work was, to investigate whether a natural stressor, in the form of El Nino conditions, contributed to DI in the Pacific hake. Right-left (fluctuating) asymmetry of otolith length, width, growth rate, and weight, as well as right-left otolith shape differences, were used as measures of DI. Results show that indeed El Nino disrupts development, indicating stress. This outcome suggests that DI, as an early warning and monitoring tool for stress, must be used with caution.

AB  - Aim Tropical America, including the Tropical Eastern Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, presents a high level of marine biodiversity, but its fish fauna has been poorly documented. In early studies marine species distributions were interpreted based on tectonic activity during the late Cenozoic, while more recent studies have highlighted a link with the present-day environment. Here, we described the assemblage richness and composition of fishes in Tropical America and related these properties to both the past evolution of marine environmental conditions and current environmental gradients.
   Location Tropical America.
   Taxon Demersal and benthic fishes.
   Methods We mapped the distribution of 2,216 demersal and benthic fish species of Tropical America using existing occurrence data. We computed three assemblage indicators: species richness, composition and nestedness, which we explained by environmental gradients. We linked compositional distance to environmental differences using distance-based redundancy analysis, species richness and nestedness using a generalized linear model. We ran simulations of a mechanistic model in which three processes determine the spatial dynamics of biodiversity: speciation, dispersal and extinction. This model yielded estimates for species assemblage properties following palaeogeographic changes in the region that shaped the current coastal habitat configuration.
   Results Fish species richness in Tropical America peaks around the Florida Peninsula, Bahamas and Greater Antilles. Fish composition varies along a depth gradient, between the Tropical Eastern Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, and forms distinct domains within the Caribbean region. The nestedness component of beta-diversity is lower in shallower assemblages, especially those along the outer section of the Greater Caribbean. Species richness and nestedness are partly explained by current environmental conditions, but model simulations illustrate how this may be further explained by the tectonic history of the region.
   Main conclusions Species richness peaks in the Greater Caribbean, coinciding with generally favourable current environmental conditions for demersal and benthic fishes. The high species richness and the low nestedness of fish assemblages in the Cuba region are compatible with the results of palaeo-environmental changes that have occurred in that area. Effects of the plate tectonic history might still be present in the organization of fish fauna in this region.

AB  - The waste heat recovery (HR) systems are employed to increase the overall thermal efficiency of electric generation units (EGUs). Although the emission factors (in terms of gram of pollutants per unit of thermal energy consumed or electric energy generated) generally decreases after installing HR systems, the emission rates in terms of grams of pollutants per unit of time remain unchanged. However, HR systems reduce stack exit temperature, resulting in lower effective emission heights, which lead to higher near-source ground level concentrations (GLCs) of air pollutants. In order to comprehensively evaluate the near-source air quality impact from deploying HR systems, we proposed a new modeling framework by integrating a computationally efficient Gaussian-based dispersion model (AERMOD) and a (relatively) more accurate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. As a demonstration of the proposed framework, we investigated the HR impact on NO,, concentrations near a simple cycle gas turbine located in Brentwood, NY. Specifically, we applied the AERMOD modeling system to screen the hourly GLCs over five years, and highest values (and the corresponding hours) were shown to cluster into two main meteorological conditions: the stable atmospheric boundary layer with relatively high wind speed (Stable, HW) and the unstable atmospheric boundary layer with relatively low wind speed (Unstable, LW). These two conditions were further simulated using a CFD model that have been extensively evaluated previously for detailed analysis. By setting different stack exit temperatures, the near-source air quality impact of different waste heat conversion rates was evaluated. We introduced a concept called the heat recovery amplified factor (HRAF), defined as the ratio between the maximum GLC with HR system and that without HR system, as an indicator of HR impact. HRAF was shown to be much more sensitive to temperature in the Unstable, LW condition than in the Stable, HW condition. Although the results were limited to a specific simple cycle gas turbine, the proposed modeling framework and HRAF can be used for evaluating the HR systems impact for other emission sources.

AB  - In order to examine the spatial distribution of organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) in recent sediments related to environmental conditions in the water column, thirty-two surface sediment samples from the NW African upwelling region (20-32 degrees N) were investigated.
   Relative abundances of the dinocyst species show distinct regional differences allowing the separation of four hydrographic regimes. (1) In the area off Cape Ghir, which is characterized by most seasonal upwelling and river discharge, Lingulodinium machaerophorum strongly dominates the associations which are additionally characterized by cysts of Gymnodinium nolleri, cysts of Polykrikos kofoidii and cysts of Polykrikos schwartzii. (2) Off Cape Yubi, a region with increasing perennial upwelling, L. machaerophorum, Brigantedinium spp., species of the genus Impagidinium and cysts of Protoperidinium stellatum occur in highest relative abundances. (3) In coastal samples between Cape Ghir and Cape Yubi, Gymnodinium catenatum, species of the genus Impagidinium, Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus, Operculodinium centrocarpum, cysts of P. stellatum and Selenopemphix nephroides determine the species composition. (4) Off Cape Blanc, where upwelling prevails perennially, and at offshore sites, heterotrophic dinocyst species show highest relative abundances. A Redundancy Analysis reveals fluvial mud, sea-surface temperature and the depth of the mixed layer in boreal spring (spring) as the most important parameters relating to the dinocyst species association. Dinocyst accumulation rates were calculated for a subset of samples using well-constrained sedimentation rates. Highest accumulation rates with up to almost 80,000 cysts cm(-2) ka(-1) were found off Cape Ghir and Cape Yubi reflecting their eutrophic upwelling filaments. A Redundancy Analysis gives evidence that primary productivity and the input of fluvial mud are mostly related to the dinocyst association.
   By means of accumulation rate data, quantitative cyst production of individual species can be considered independently from the rest of the association, allowing autecological interpretations. We show that a combined interpretation of relative abundances and accumulation rates of dinocysts can lead to a better understanding of the productivity conditions off NW Africa.

AB  - Haphazard use of pastures has become one of the factors of disturbance of their natural vegetation. Therefore, forest reclamation works were carried out and significant areas of strip plantations of shrubs were created in the Caspian Sea region in the mid-20th century. In the arid zone of Russia, one of the most important tasks in the field of scientific provision of protective afforestation is the improvement of methods and techniques of arrangement, increasing longevity and environmental, agricultural, and utilitarian efficiency of plantations. This study aims to determine the long-term impact of afforestation on the functioning of pasture ecosystems. The influence of tree and shrub layer on biodiversity and productivity of vegetation cover of pastures was also studied. The research objects are plantations growing on the reclaimed pastures. The research is based on the materials of biomonitoring and field experiments using standard methods of forest inventory and geobotanical survey. Rectangular-shaped test plots of 0.25-0.30 ha were laid out for the study of forest plots. Test plots were used for a detailed description of the location, soil composition, time, method, and technology of plantation development, as well as a comprehensive assessment of the growth and longevity of tree and shrub crops. Data from key plots were used to study the successional processes of vegetation cover. The research results have shown that deep plowing preparation of soil to obtain high results in rooting, preservation, and growth of shrub species has an advantage over other soil preparation technologies in the semi-desert zone. It was found that the shrub layer up to 45 years old retains its productive and generative abilities. Pasture protection belts from Haloxylon aphyllum and reclamation and fodder plantations from Krascheninnikovia ceratoides and Calligonum aphyllum have a high cenosis potential and stability. In this case study, in semi-arid regions, afforestation with shrubs is the best way to improve and restore pastures.

AB  - Background
   Since the late 1980s, long-term monitoring of various components of natural ecosystems under conditions of industrial pollution has been carried out in the Central Urals. In the mid-2000s, similar programmes were started in the Southern Urals. As a part of these monitoring programmes, the data on invertebrates in different types of biotopes, collected with different methods and in a different time intervals, continue to be gathered. Amongst the most well-studied groups of invertebrates are spiders and harvestmen whose communities are a convenient indicator of the environment. The data collected through these monitoring programmes can also be used to study natural local biodiversity.
   New information
   The dataset, presented here, includes information from a long-term monitoring programme for Araneae and Opiliones that inhabit grass stands of secondary dry meadows and litter of spruce-fir, aspen-birch and pine-birch forests in the Central and Southern Urals. The dataset (available from the GBIF network at https://www.gbif.org/dataset/e170dbd1-a67f-4514-841c-5296b290ca90) describes the assemblage structure of spiders and harvestmen (list of species and their abundance), age-sex composition and seasonal and inter-annual dynamics for two large areas in the southern taiga zone of the Ural Mountains. The dataset includes 1,351 samples, which correspond to 5,462 occurrences identified during 2004-2009, 2013 and 2018. In total, we collected 10,433 specimens, representing 178 species (36% of arachnofauna of the Urals), 115 genera (54%) and 23 families (100%). Most of the data (4,939 of 5,462 occurrences, 90%) were collected in the western macro-slope of the Ural Mountains (European part of Russia), the rest in the eastern macro-slope (Asian part). All represented data were sampled in industrially undisturbed areas and are used as a local reference for ecotoxicological monitoring. The dataset provides new useful information for recording the state of biodiversity for the Central and Southern Urals and contributes to the study of biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Copper is widely used in modern technology, but declining ore grades and depletion of natural deposits have raised concerns regarding sustainable demand-supply balance in the long term. The vulnerability to primary copper supply restrictions amplifies for countries dependant on imports, notably many EU Member States. Recycling of post-consumer scrap can provide a valuable source of essential material to the European industry. However, a considerable fraction of collected and processed copper old scrap is exported, while the remaining fraction is either not recovered or lost due to nonfunctional recycling undermining the implementation of a circular economy. In this work, material flow analysis, regression analysis, and life cycle assessment are combined to explore the possible evolution of four scenarios of copper demand in Europe to year 2050 and the potentials for greenhouse gas emissions reduction under material circularity conditions.
   The results show that for three of the four scenarios, secondary production would not comply with the carbon dioxide emissions reduction target of 50% below 2000 levels neither in case of combined aggressive recycling, moderate decarbonization of electricity, and energy efficiency improvements. In particular, for the scenario that describes a "business as usual" approach, the modelled future domestic demand can only be met by increasing primary inputs and, despite strong efforts to improve recycling at end-of-life, the fraction of old scrap in total metal demand seems likely to achieve 65% at best. Should that scenario ensue, the GHG emissions embodied in EU copper demand might result in an emissions gap of more than 15 TgCO(2) eq or about + 260% the carbon dioxide reduction target. In contrast, the lowest environmental impacts are associated with a scenario emphasizing green technology and more equitable lifestyles. In that scenario, the secondary copper flows will gradually approach the expected demand, laying the foundation for achieving a circular economy with considerable potential for preserving natural capital and mitigating climate change. This possible future, however, requires dramatic changes in the current pattern of material production and consumption, as we discuss.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) represent a tool for conservation that is intended to protect marine and estuarine habitats, biodiversity, and ecological processes. Many MPAs, some of which include estuarine zones, are affected by contamination sources; the discharge of chemicals into aquatic systems results in sediment contamination, risks to benthic systems, and consequent negative effects on ecological function. This study evaluated sediment quality in estuaries located within the Mosaic of Marine Protected Areas of Sao Paulo State, Brazil (MMPASP) in austral winter and summer: the Verde River (RV), the Una do Prelado River (BU), the Guarau River (GU), the Preto River (RP), and the Itanhaem River (ITA). Data on sediment chemistry (major and trace metals, as well as hydrocarbons) and whole-sediment toxicity in copepods and amphipods were associated with ecological indices of macrobenthic infaunal organisms in a weight-of-evidence approach meant to estimate the effects at the community level. Results revealed low-to-moderate levels of contamination, with higher concentrations detected at sites influenced by domestic effluent discharges (RP, ITA). Site-specific chemical contamination guidelines were in accordance with biological responses than threshold levels from international benchmarks, indicating a failure of these international criteria to predict effects. Sediments were toxic, and benthic descriptors corroborated these findings. The results reflected a pattern of environmental quality that ranged from relatively good conditions (RV, BU, GU) to poor environmental quality (RP, ITA). We concluded that benthic environments in the estuaries of the Central Shore Marine Protected Area (APAMLC) exhibit a good ecological status in general, but some sites are directly impacted by human activities and exhibit contamination levels associated with biological effects, thereby showing that some portions of these MPAs may be damaged by contamination. Environmental assessments based on the sediment quality triad (SQT) method provide suitable and reliable information on pollution within MPAs and can assist in establishing additional policies to control pollution sources and achieve conservation goals.

AB  - Nowadays, soil functionality and productivity are severely impaired due, in great part, to the fact that most of the land is being intensively used for food production and urbanization purposes, with a consequent rise in the generation of wastes and consumption/degradation of fertile soils. These issues can be jointly addressed by an integrated and sustainable management of the soil resource carried out in the framework of two recent paradigms: circular economy and phytomanagement. Within the fields of resource conservation and regenerative (urban) land management, at least the three following fundamental aspects can be contemplated: (i) the valorization and safe recovery of organic wastes (e.g., composts, green and animal manures, and biosolids) as soil amendments (from residue to resource); (ii) the re-development and revegetation of degraded soils characterized by low organic matter content, deficient physical structure and depressed biological status (from bare to vegetated soil); and, finally, (iii) the promotion of soil health in order to support soil ecological processes, functions and concomitant ecosystem services (integration of ecocentric and anthropocentric perspectives). Here, we discuss the benefits (knowns), potential risks (known unknowns) and future/affordable uncertainties (unknowns) resulting from the application of organic amendments (OAs) to soil. Traditionally, most studies have used physical-chemical parameters to assess soil health/quality, whereas less attention has been paid to soil biological criteria. Thus, we highlight the relevance of soil biological properties as key drivers of ecological restoration and suitable indicators of soil health. Notwithstanding, special attention should be paid to "amendments-plants-microorganisms" interactions in different soils and field conditions. Finally, the risk of introduction of emerging contaminants, including for instance microplastics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), through the application of OAs to soil, is currently a matter of much concern that must urgently be addressed if we are to continue with such practice.

AB  - The dynamic equilibrium of an ecosystem is driven by mutual feedback interactions between plants and soil microorganisms. Asparagus exerts a particularly strong influence on its soil environment through abundant production of persistent phenolic acids, which impact selectively soil microorganisms and may be involved in Fusarium crown and root rot (FCRR) of asparagus. In a survey of 50 asparagus plantations of the province of Quebec, we found that FCRR was associated with a profound cultivar-specific, reorganization of the soil microbial community, as revealed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. According to PLFA indicators, microbial biodiversity as well as bacterial and fungal abundance dropped sharply with the onset of FCRR in fields planted with the cultivar Guelph Millenium. This drop was followed by a similar drop in the arbuscular mycorrhizal population. Biodiversity and microbial population size then increased to finally reach a new equilibrium. Discriminant analysis of PLFA profiles obtained from soil samples also indicated a shift in soil microbial community structure associated with FCRR development in fields planted with the cultivar Jersey Giant. Different soil biological conditions, as indicated by microbial biomass C and N and soil enzyme activities, were associated with different cultivars. Preceding crop, manure application, geographical location and tillage depth also influenced the structure of soil microbial communities in asparagus plantations, as determined by PLFA profiling. If higher FCRR incidence is a consequence of the soil microbial community reorganization, means to reduce FCRR incidence in asparagus plantations may be found among practices such as soil organic fertilization, soil tillage and intercropping strategies that would dilute the negative influence of asparagus on the soil microbial community. Finally, FCRR outbreaks were generally promoted by a previous crop of maize. It seems that maize and asparagus host a F. proliferatum teleomorph (Gibberella fujikoroi) of the same mating type.

AB  - This research quantified patterns of riparian tree dominance in western Oregon, USA and then compared the observed patterns with the expected patterns defined from the literature. Research was conducted at 110 riparian sites located on private and public lands. The field sites were selected by probability surveys that were post-stratified by stream order and riparian forest type. An importance value index (IVI), which was the summation of tree relative density, relative frequency, and relative basal area, was used to define tree dominance. The IVI patterns of 19 riparian tree species with respect to ecoregion, geomorphic landform, stream order, and management practice were evaluated. In addition, the riparian trees were assigned to growth habit, life history strategy, and wetland indicator guilds depending on their taxonomy, response to flood disturbance, and wetland ecology, respectively. Douglas-fir, alder, western hemlock, and bigleaf maple were the trees with the highest IVI scores in western Oregon. The general IVI pattern of tree importance on the geomorphic landforms was hardwoods dominating the floodplain, hardwood and coniferous trees co-dominating the terrace, and conifers dominating the transition slope. However, there was considerable variability in the mix of the tree species because of differences in ecoregion, stream order, and management practice. The ecological importance of the dominant species was illustrated by their influence in determining the IVI patterns of the different guilds. For example, Douglas-fir, alder, and western hemlock were one, two, and three in their IVI rankings in western Oregon. The avoider, invader, and resister guilds were also ranked one, two, and three in importance because Douglas-fir, alder, and western hemlock were respectively classified in these groups. Such information is meaningful to developing conservation policy and plans to maintain or restore properly functioning riparian forests for aquatic and terrestrial biota, and to characterize reference condition and biological indicators for long-term ecological monitoring.

AB  - The collection of spatial information to quantify changes to the state and condition of the environment is a fundamental component of conservation or sustainable utilization of tropical and subtropical forests, Age is an important structural attribute of old-growth forests influencing biological diversity in Australia eucalypt forests. Aerial photograph interpretation has traditionally been used for mapping the age and structure of forest stands. However this method is subjective and is not able to accurately capture fine to landscape scale variation necessary for ecological studies. Identification and mapping of fine to landscape scale vegetative structural attributes will allow the compilation of information associated with Montreal Process indicators lb and ld, which seek to determine linkages between age structure and the diversity and abundance of forest fauna populations. This project integrated measurements of structural attributes derived from a canopy-height elevation model with results from a geometrical-optical/spectral mixture analysis model to map forest age structure at a landscape scale. The availability of multiple-scale data allows the transfer of high-resolution attributes to landscape scale monitoring. Multispectral image data were obtained from a DMSV (Digital Multi-Spectral Video) sensor over St Mary's State Forest in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Local scene variance levels for different forest tapes calculated from the DMSV data were used to optimize the tree density and canopy size output in a geometric-optical model applied to a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TU) data set. Airborne laser scanner data obtained over the project area were used to calibrate a digital filter to extract tree heights from a digital elevation model that was derived from scanned colour stereopairs. The modelled estimates of tree height, crown size, and tree density were used to produce a decision-tree classification of forest successional stage at a landscape scale. The results obtained (72% accuracy), were limited in validation, but demonstrate potential for using the multi-scale methodology to provide spatial information for forestry policy objectives (ie., monitoring forest age structure).

AB  - Linguistic variables are very useful to evaluate alternatives in decision making problems because they provide a vocabulary in natural language rather than numbers. Some aggregation operators for linguistic variables force the use of a symmetric and uniformly distributed set of terms. The need to relax these conditions has recently been posited. This paper presents the induced unbalanced linguistic ordered weighted average (IULOWA) operator. This operator can deal with a set of unbalanced linguistic terms that are represented using fuzzy sets. We propose a new order-inducing criterion based on the specificity and fuzziness of the linguistic terms. Different relevancies are given to the fuzzy values according to their uncertainty degree. To illustrate the behaviour of the precision-based IULOWA operator, we present an environmental assessment case study in which a multiperson multicriteria decision making model is applied.

AB  - In the and grazing lands of central Australia, a previous study found that the size and composition of seed banks were changed by heavy grazing. In this concurrent study we found that grazing decreased the number of 'safe sites' for seeds by reducing soil stability and damaging broad-scale resource traps. The loss of 'safe sites' was likely to have had a greater initial impact on seed bank size than the direct effect of grazing on seed-bearing plants. In this environment, changes to the soil preceded changes to the vegetation, so that soil-based rather than vegetation -based indicators may provide a better early warning of rangeland deterioration.

AB  - El Cometa lagoon lacks information on microalgae diversity, despite its relevance as the first productive component of aquatic ecosystems and its influence on water quality. Therefore, the objective of determine the morphospecies of phytoplankton microalgae in El Cometa lagoon, as well as, their indicator species and the possible presence of potentially toxic species were raised. Phytoplankton samples with 20 mu m phytoplankton network were collected in six sites during rainy season. Fifty taxa from six taxonomic groups are the first records for the lagoon and Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve. Thirty-three of them were added to the records for the coastal plain of the Usumacinta River. Five were marine, seven potentially toxic and five bioindicators of contamination and eutrophication conditions that represent a public health risk.

AB  - A total of 25 surface sediment samples collected along a North-South transect (from 9.69 degrees N to 80 degrees E and 55.01 degrees S to 40 degrees E) in south western Indian Ocean have been used to study recent planktic foraminifera revealing the ecological preferences of the planktic foraminifer species in the area, particularly the coiling direction patterns in the planktic species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (Ehrenberg). The coiling direction and their absolute abundance can be shown to be related to ambient temperature and salinity values. Dextrally coiled forms decrease towards higher latitude, while sinistrally coiled forms increase. Similar studies should be undertaken along various transects to further establish the extent of environmental control on coiling direction in planktic foraminifera.

AB  - Aim: Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) are frequently used in regions outside their Central European origin as proxies for environmental conditions, a practice further boosted by the increasing scientific focus on global change. The performance of EIV outside their geographic origin and over long gradients has, however, rarely been tested. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the indicative power of EIV changes over a large geographic gradient and to analyse the potential causes of such changes.
   Location: Sweden.
   Taxon: Vascular plants.
   Methods: We used data on forest understorey vegetation and soils from >15,000 plots from the Swedish National Forest Inventory to model how the relationship between community mean EIV and measured environmental variables changes along an extensive latitudinal gradient (>15 degrees). We used Generalized Additive Mixed Models to account for the inventory design, and for potential nonlinearities in the relationship between the mean EIV and the environmental variables. Additionally, Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) models were developed for the relationship between the incidence probability and the environmental variables to analyse if the widths of species niches change along the geographic gradient.
   Results: Our study shows that EIV for N (nutrients), R (pH) and T (temperature) are useful as far north as the Arctic Circle, while those for K (continentality) showed a much weaker relationship with measured continentality. However, the indicative power of the EIV for N and R gradually became weaker towards the north along with shifts towards larger environmental niche widths of the indicator species.
   Main conclusions: EIV are useful indicators of soil conditions in boreal forests located far north of Central Europe. However, the drop in indicative power in the northernmost regions due to increasing environmental niche widths needs to be taken into account when applying EIV along long geographic gradients to avoid spatial bias.

AB  - Biological indicators are highly relevant for assessing the condition of a soil as they are integrative; they reflect the overall impact of physical, chemical and biological changes. Indigenous soil organisms are preferable to other test organisms because the diversity and condition of indigenous soil organisms reflect both acute and chronic effects of soil disturbances. Nematodes are ubiquitous, speciose, easily extractable and present in extremely high numbers. Given the ever increasing amount of sequence data, DNA barcode-based community analysis will soon be possible and a next step would be to define objective criteria for the ecological grouping of soil nematodes. Here, we present a framework to ascertain which traits are correlated with a tolerance to stress. For this, a field study on the effects of pH and copper on nematode communities was re-analysed. Changes in abundances of individual genera were correlated with a number of potentially stress tolerance-related characteristics. The generalised least squares (GLS) method was used to account for the phylogenetic dependence of the data. Only the relationship between the ability to enter a survival stage and tolerance to copper at pH 6.1 was found to be significant, but the quantity of missing data probably had a negative impact on the analyses. This study did, however, clearly demonstrate the importance of accounting for the effects of phylogenetic dependence in the data. When the phylogeny was taken into account, we observed an average change in P value of 0.196 (and in some cases as much as 0.6) for the correlations of possible stress-related characteristics and Cu or pH tolerance. This research constitutes a proof-of-principle for a transparent method to relate stress tolerance to (ecological) characteristics. The usefulness of this powerful method should become even clearer when substantially higher numbers of individuals are analysed (as facilitated by using DNA barcodes) and when missing data are filled in.

AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE), the ratio of carbon gain to water loss, is an important physiological indicator in assessing the interactions between the carbon and water cycles. Quantifying the spatiotemporal patterns of WUE at both canopy and ecosystem levels across main dryland ecosystems along climate gradients is vital for water resource management in water-limited regions. However, the patterns of WUE among natural and managed ecosystems in drylands are not well understood. We partitioned the evapotranspiration (ET) components and calculated WUE at both canopy and ecosystem levels across dryland ecosystems in an arid region in Northwest China using observations from a regional flux observation network. Our results showed divergent variations of canopy and ecosystem WUE across the main ecosystems along climate gradients in arid regions. The ecosystem WUE and canopy WUE ranged from 0.7 to 1.8 gC Kg(-1) H2O and from 0.8 to 2.4 gC Kg(-1) H2O, respectively. Climatic gradients were the dominant factors controlling the spatial patterns of WUE across dryland ecosystems. Divergences were also observed between oasis and natural ecosystems because of different environmental conditions and management practices. Climatic regulation of the spatial WUE patterns was dominated by water variability rather than temperature. The higher canopy WUE for desert ecosystems indicated that these ecosystems were adapted to the water-limited environment. The discrepancies of both canopy and ecosystem WUE between croplands in arid and hyper-arid climate zones were caused by the differences in agricultural management techniques for these crops. Human activities (e.g., irrigation and agriculture management) altered the distribution of water resource and water use strategies, which further affected the magnitude and patterns of WUE in drylands. This study provides insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of ET components and both canopy and ecosystem WUE over dryland ecosystems and can inform regional water resources management in water-limited regions.

AB  - Potential CO2 leakage is a major concern for carbon capture and storage (CCS). The effects of high soil CO2 concentration on microbes is a major element of impact assessments of CO2 leakage on terrestrial ecosystems. We conducted a field experiment to investigate the responses of microbial functional groups of ammoniaoxidizers, methanogens, and methanotrophs in high soil CO2 conditions. A single-point injection gassing plot (2.5 m x 2.5 m in size), which had 52.2% CO2 in the center (radius = 0.5 m) and 5.5% in the edge (radius = 1.7 m) at 10 cm depth, was employed. N2O and CH4 emissions increased after I day of injection because injected CO2 was instantly utilized by nitrifiers and methanogens. This suggests that the activities of the selected microbes could be stimulated by high soil CO(2 )concentrations. Prolonged CO2 injection has toxic effects on aerobic nitrifiers, but may favor anaerobic methanogens. However, the early stimulatory effects of high soil CO2 on N2O and CH4 production did not last to the end of injection. These results imply that increased N2O and CH4 emissions could be the minor side effects of high soil CO2. Microbes responded faster than plants to high soil CO2, with responses observed as late as 7 days after injection. The inhibition of plant absorption of soil water and nutrients by high soil CO2 concentrations may also influence microbial responses. Moreover, high soil water content could retard underground CO2 diffusion, which would magnify CO2 impacts on plants and microbes. Our results suggest that microbial response could be used as an early indicator of the impact assessments of CO2 leakage on soil ecosystems. An understanding of the interaction among soils, plants, and microbes would be helpful in assessing the biological risks of potential CO(2 )leakage. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Badain Jaran desert is located in the western part of Inner Mongolia (China) in the Alashan Highland. The investigated soda-salt lakes combine high pH (more than 9) and mineralization (up to 400 g/dm(3)), where conditions for the development of an alkali-halophilic microbial community are created. The purpose of our work was to isolate and study pure alkali-halophilic microorganisms in the lakes of the Badain Jaran desert. From the accumulative cultures of the cortex salt and the microbial mats of the lakes of the Badain Jaran desert, pure cultures belonging to the family Bacillaceae (the phylum Firmicutes) were isolated and described. With the help of biochemical methods, the ecological and physiological properties of the isolated bacteria were determined. The isolated bacteria exhibit the properties of alkalophiles and obligate alkalophiles and develop at pH 7-10.5, the optima ranging from 9 to 10. With respect to the concentration of NaCl, the strains showed the properties of obligate halophiles and extreme halophiles. With respect to temperature, the isolated microorganisms are mesophiles growing at 10-50 degrees C, the optimal growth being at 30-40 degrees C. With respect to the substrates used, the isolated cultures are noted for extensive metabolic activity and, when in their natural habitats, are supposedly active participants of the destruction of organic matter. To study the hydrochemical indicators of water, the following methods were used: atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma, ion chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. As a result, it was found that a sodium cation and anions of carbonate, bicarbonate of chlorine and sulphate dominate in the soda-salt lakes of the Badain Jaran desert in a multicomponent composition. The results obtained broaden the notion of the diversity and ecological significance of bacteria in the extreme natural ecosystems of the Badain Jaran desert. The isolated strains are of interest for biotechnology as producers of enzymes resistant to high pH and mineralization.

AB  - Indiscriminate use of pesticides is rampant in most parts of Africa, but only scanty ecotoxicological data exist for the protection of soil organismsand these data were usually obtained under temperate conditions, including the use of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standard test protocols. In order to assess the effects of 3 commonly used pesticides (deltamethrin, dimethoate, chlorpyrifos) on soil fauna in Africa, noncontaminated natural soils were collected from Nigeria and Tunisia. In addition, 2 common test soils, OECD artificial soil and European (Landwirtschaftliche Untersichungs- und Forschungsanstalt [LUFA]) 2.3 soil, were used in OECD standard reproduction tests. Two microarthropod species, the springtail Folsomia candida and the predatory mite Hypoaspis aculeifer, were exposed in these 4 soils spiked individually with the 3 insecticides. Results show that the collembolan F. candida was more sensitive than the mite H. aculeifer for all 3 insecticides. The toxicity of each insecticide in the 4 soils differed, with few exceptions, by less than an order of magnitude. However, the pattern of toxicity was not consistent, that is, the lowest toxicity was often but not always found in OECD artificial soil. Soil- and pesticide-specific patterns of toxicity to F. candida and H. aculeifer might be related to the physicochemical properties of the soils and thus the availability of the 3 pesticides. Following the rules laid down in the European Union for the registration of pesticides and using standard European exposure scenarios, neither an acute nor a chronic risk of dimethoate and chlorpyrifos can be excluded (with few exceptions) in all 4 soils. Lower risks were identified for deltamethrin. For pesticide used in Africa, an environmental risk assessment based on data gained in tests with at least 1 additional natural field soil, preferably of African origin, should be performed using the same risk assessment principles as in the European Union.

AB  - The understanding of rock-soil geochemical fluxes provides an important tool for evaluating natural environmental risk. In this research we compare the geochemical composition of soils (n = 249) collected on Santiago Island (Cape Verde) with their parent rocks (n = 96). Basalt and basanites units and overlying soils are relatively rich in Co, Sc, Mg, Ca, Fe, V, Ti, Ni, Cr, and Cu, whilst phonolitic-trachytic units and overlying soils are relatively rich in Zn, P, Sr, Mn, Ba, La, As, Th and Pb. An enrichment of potentially toxic elements (PTE; As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, La, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sc, Th, V) was observed in soils relative to their parent rocks. This enrichment of PTE in Santiago soils results mainly from the removal of mobile elements that are common in primary minerals (e.g., Ca, Na, Mg, K) and coprecipitation and/or adsorption by Fe-oxy-hydroxides and clay minerals (mostly smectite and palygorskyte) under the influence of high pH values. Potentially toxic element contents were found to increase with weathering; oxidation is a major weathering mechanism under a semi-arid climate, and a high correlation between Fe and PTE was found, suggesting that the mobility of PTE is controlled by the iron phases. The level of enrichment of PTE in a specific site does not reflect the bulk concentration and so is not a good indicator of the actual geochemical environmental quality. The extent of contamination is not limited to the vicinity of the source, as contaminated material may be physically remobilized, particularly in high runoff conditions, causing dispersion of geo-pollutants over many kilometres from the source. The geochemical flux clarify the lithological origin of these elements, refuting the hypothesis of an anthropogenic contamination, as the PTE enrichment in Santiago soils is not a local phenomenon, but, on the contrary, occurs over the entire island.

AB  - State-and-transition models (STMs), conceptual models of vegetation change based on alternate state theory, are increasingly applied as tools for land management decision-making. As STMs are created throughout the United States, it is crucial to ensure that they are supported by ecological evidence. Plant species composition reflects ecosystem processes that are difficult to measure and may be a useful indicator of alternate states. This study aims to create data-driven STMs based on plant species composition for two ecological sites (Claypan and Mountain Loam) in northwestern Colorado sagebrush steppe. We sampled 76 plots with different management and disturbance histories. Drawing on the hierarchical approach currently taken to build STMs, we hypothesized that A) differences in species composition between the two ecological sites would be related to environmental factors and B) differences in species composition within each ecological site would be related to management and disturbance history. Relationships among species composition, site history, and environmental variables were evaluated using multivariate statistics. We found that between ecological sites, species composition was related to differences in soil texture, supporting Hypothesis A and the creation of separate STMs for each site. Within ecological sites, species composition was related to site history and also to environmental variation. This finding partially supports Hypothesis B and the identification of alternate states using species composition, but also suggests that these ecological sites are not uniform physical templates upon which plant community dynamics play out. This data-driven, plant species based approach created two objective, credible STMs with states and transitions that are consistent with the sagebrush steppe literature. Our findings support the hierarchical view of landscapes currently applied in building STMs. An approach that acknowledges environmental heterogeneity within ecological sites is necessary to help define finer-resolution ecological sites and elucidate cases in which specific abiotic conditions make transitions between states more likely.

AB  - Wetlands are exceptional ecosystems that contribute to biodiversity and play a key role in the hydrological and carbon cycles. Knowledge of their long-term ecology is essential for a proper understanding of these valuable ecosystems. We present the application of multi-proxy analyses to a 115 cm-thick core from La Molina mire (Alto de la Espina) located in NW Iberia, with a chronology spanning since similar to 500 BC. The mire is located in an area intensively mined for gold during the Roman period, and close to a water-canalization system used for mining operations at that time. Our aim was to get insights into the development of the wetland by combining palynological records of hydro-hygrophytes, non-pollen palynomorphs and geochemical analyses, supported by C-14 datings and multivariate statistics. The results indicate a complex pattern of ecological succession. During the local Iron Age the wetland was minerotrophic. Since similar to 20 AD it was subjected to dramatic hydrological changes due to a rise of the water-table, fluctuating between the presence of open water and phases of drawdown. Finally, by similar to 745 AD, the wetland experienced a rapid evolution towards ombrotrophic conditions. High grazing pressure was detected for the last decades. The significant change occurred during Early Roman Empire seems to have been the consequence of the direct use of the wetland as a water-reservoir of the canalisation system used for gold-mining. Thus, the current nature of the mire may be the result of human impact, although multiple human- and climate-induced causes were potentially linked to the detected shifts. However, the system seems to have been resilient, successfully buffering the changes without substantial alterations of its functioning. Our investigation shows that palaeoecological research is necessary to understand modifications in the structure of wetland ecosystems, their long-term ecology and the role of human-induced changes.

AB  - Farming-pastoral Ecotones in China (FPEC) is one of the most fragile ecological area in China. Landscape ecological risk assessment of FPEC based on terrain gradients has important strategic significance for ensuring national ecological security and the sustainable development of social economy. Based on the 30 x 30 m land use data and DEM data of FPEC in 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020, this paper constructs a landscape ecological risk assessment model, and uses the methods of spatial autocorrelation analysis and terrain distribution index to appraise the dynamic change law and influential factors of FPEC landscape ecological risk on various terrain gradients. The results showed that: (1) In recent 40 years, land use/land cover changes (LUCC) has significantly changed, and the farmland area has increased continuously, mainly transferred from grassland, forest and bare land, particularly the bare land converted into grassland in recent 10 years, which leads to substantial increase in grassland area. (2) The overall ecological risk of the study area showed an upward trend, and the area of highest risk regions has increased more than twice during the study period, mainly distributed in the regions of "interference of human activities in low terrain" and "change of natural high terrain environment," these regions showed a high spatial concentration. (3) Ecological risk along with terrain gradient distribution is mainly limited by climate and terrain factors, the interference of human activities and natural environment change are the main influential factors of ecological risk increase in low and high terrain, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions, and low terrain should rationally develop and utilize natural resources to reduce the interference of unreasonable production and human activities. In order to promote the sustainable and healthy development of FPEC, the policy of closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation should be adopted in the high terrain to reduce the impact of natural environment changes.

AB  - The taxonomy-based response pattern of macroinvertebrates to sediment stress is well established, with tolerant taxa increasing in impacted conditions, while sensitive taxa decrease along a deteriorating water quality gradient. However, the distribution patterns of traits in response to environmental stress gradient, including suspended sediments, remain unclear, particularly in Africa, where trait-based studies are under-explored. We examined the distribution patterns of macroinvertebrate traits along a suspended sediment stress gradient and identified tolerant and sensitive traits for suspended sediment stress. We sampled macroinvertebrates and environmental variables seasonally in winter, spring, summer and autumn of 2016 to 2018 in eight selected sites in the Tsitsa River and its tributaries. We selected 12 traits and ecological preferences, resolved them into 47 trait attributes, and analysed them using the RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Our results revealed that macroinvertebrate traits and ecological preferences were differentially influenced by fine suspended sediments in the Tsitsa River and its tributaries. Traits such as a preference for CPOM, collector-filtering, and a high sensitivity to oxygen depletion, were deemed sensitive to suspended sediments stress, exhibiting positive associations with the control sites, and negatively associated with any of the environmental parameters (sediment grain sizes, turbidity, TSS and EC). Tolerant indicator traits included a high tolerance of oxygen depletion, skating and a preference for FPOM. The fourth-corner analysis results indicated that suspended fine sediment grain sizes, (including coarse sand, fine silt and clay) were the most important variables influencing macroinvertebrate trait distribution patterns during the dry season, while gravel, mud and medium sand were more important during the wet season. Overall, our study provided critical insights towards trait-based responses of macroinvertebrates communities to suspended sediment stress, key information that could stimulate the development of macroinvertebrate trait-based biomonitoring tools for the assessment of suspended sediment stress in the Afrotropical region.

AB  - It is shown that since the beginning of field development, a single natural and historical process of oil and gas generation and accumulation has been accompanied by the transformation of the entire complex of geological, biochemical, geochemical, thermobaric and hydrogeological environmental conditions and modern landscape genesis. Studying this process within the territory of leading oil and gas production regions delivers interesting results in the three aspects of anthropogenic transformation of oil and gas geosystems: geotechnics (infrastructure), geotechnologies (extraction) and geotechnical metabolism (man-made metabolism and matter cycles). The research done on regional geoecology dictates a need to study all stages of oil production. We determined the parameters of regional geoecology and oil and gas ecology for dealing with the currently important problems of assessing the operation of enterprises of the oil and gas sector in the context of the ecological policy of the Russian Federation. The integrated geographical approach implemented as part of mega-ecology is suggested for forecasting the results of the global process of technogenesis in the landscape sphere and for determining the most crucial parameters of sustainable development of Russia's oil and gas regions. Ugra, the leader of Russia's oil production (235.3 million tons, 43.3%), faces issues with its resource base. Since 2009, there has been a production decline by 43 million tons in the region, with the watercut level in the main deposits reaching 90-95%. The hydrocarbon indicator was developed and used in ranking 30 oil and gas regions. The most important indicators of oil and gas ecology are given to illustrate the situation with the oil and gas sector of the economy: from prospecting, exploration and well stimulation to declining production and closing businesses down. It is established that production and processing of hydrocarbons are responsible for 55% of atmospheric emissions of pollutants, 33% of polluted effluents, 35% of solid waste and 80% of the total volume of greenhouse gases.

AB  - The assessment of eutrophic conditions is a formal requirement of several European Directives. Typically, these eutrophication assessments use a set of primary indicators which include dissolved inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen and secondary information such as phytoplankton community data. Each directive is characterized by a different geographical or political boundary which defines the area under assessment. Several disparate sources of data from the Thames estuary and Liverpool Bay in the United Kingdom collected from different monitoring programs were combined to generate a fully integrated dataset. Data sources included remote sensing, ecosystem models, moorings, freshwater inputs and traditional ship surveys. Different methods were explored for assigning ecologically relevant assessment areas including delineation of the assessment area based on salinity, extent of the river plume influence and ecohydrodynamic characteristics in addition to the traditional geographically defined typologies associated with the different directives. Individual eutrophication indicators were tested across these revised typologies for the period 2006-2015, and outcomes of the different metrics were compared across the river to marine continuum for the two UK areas. There have been statistically significant decreasing trends in the loads of ammonium, nitrite and dissolved inorganic phosphorous between 1994 and 2016 in both the Thames estuary and Liverpool Bay study areas but no statistically significant trends in loads of nitrate or dissolved inorganic nitrogen. There have been statistically significant increases in riverine nitrogen: phosphorous between 1994 and 2016. Nutrient concentrations exceeded assessment thresholds across nearly all areas other than the large offshore assessment areas, and outcomes of the chlorophyll metric were often below assessment thresholds in the estuarine-based areas and the offshore areas, but exceedances of thresholds occurred in the near coastal areas. However, trait-based indicators of phytoplankton community using functional groups show changes in plankton community structure over the assessment period, indicating that additional metrics that quantify community shifts could be a useful measurement to include in future eutrophication assessments.

AB  - Agricultural activities cause changes to land-use and vegetation characteristics at a smaller temporal scale and at a larger spatial scale than most corresponding natural processes. Simulation models have become important tools to predict future land-use change as a consequence of management policies and in advancing our understanding of the behaviour of complex managed ecosystems. To capture the temporal dynamics and the non-equilibrium properties of agroecosystems and to deal with multidisciplinary trade-offs between economic and conservation interests, it is often necessary for models to be both spatially and temporally explicit and incorporate some component of human decision-making. This paper presents a multiple-species assessment of land-use change scenarios related to ground water protection and pesticide use in a Danish agroecosystem. A spatially explicit simulation model is used that incorporates the temporal dynamics, driven by weather and farming decisions, of an agricultural landscape in great detail. Numeric and spatial outcome of multiple-species predictive scenarios based on real landscapes and realistic simulations of species behaviour and demographics were captured in simple spatial impact indices. Ecological type species were selected for a range of attributes relevant for specific cases to enable a comprehensive description of a broad species response based on a limited number of species. Five ecological type species, a carabid beetle (Bembidion lampros), a linyphiid spider (Oedothorax fuscus), a small farmland bird (skylark, Alauda arvensis), a small mammal (field vole, Microtus agrestis) and an ungulate (roe deer, Capreolus capreolus) were used. Simulation results were aggregated into two values indicating the overall numeric response and the overall spatial response of each type species. These two values indicate the change of conditions experienced by a species and thus make it possible to classify large numbers of species according to their general response. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The evaluation of restoration success needs the definition of goals and the set up of evaluation criteria. This will be done for wet grassland restoration on fen soils in NW Germany. These ecosystems lost their habitat function for co-adapted plant species due to melioration and intensive farming since the 1950s. The recovery of this function is a major concept deduced from environmental policies. In order to evaluate the success of restoration measures in wet grassland restoration target plant species are identified. Doing this, sets of required abiotic conditions are deduced and translated into calibrated mean indicator values for plant communities [Scripta Geobot. 18 (1992) 248]. These are arranged in a successional series which is expected to occur on fens when restoration measures are realised.
   Thresholds of mean indicator values are used in order to select "target systems". Four hundred and seventy three plant species that occur in the successional fen series are reduced to 136 target species using different selection criteria. For the evaluation of restoration success it is necessary to establish assemblages of target species with different indication power, invasion probability and frequency. As an indicator integrating these demands, the potential of species to occur during different temporal stages (within successional lines) on fen soils and different habitats is classified. A further ranking of these target species therefore is based on their different niche breadths and temporal persistence during secondary succession. Six vulnerability classes are established which represent species groups with gradually changing vulnerability for intensification or abandonment, respectively. Species with a narrow niche and short persistence during succession are strongly endangered by supposed changes in land management. It is clear from restoration experiments in NW Germany and The Netherlands however that these species are hardly capable of re-establishing during restoration. Higher frequencies in intensive grasslands enhance the re-invasion into recovered grassland swards. Considering this low re-colonisation rate it has to be a priority concept to protect those relic habitats still existing, especially remnants of small sedge-, wet grassland- and stream valley communities.

AB  - The Environmental Monitoring and Assessment program (EMAP) collects data that are used to statistically assess the environmental condition of large geographic regions. These data are then posted on the EMAP web site so that anyone can use them. Databases used for the statistical analyses, "analytical" databases, differ in design from the "general-use" databases used by a secondary audience. Their scope is usually restricted in time, in geographic extent: and in type and content of data. often being limited to a single scientific discipline. Their structure may be more horizontal than vertical, so that statistical programs can import the data easily. Their design is strongly influenced by the nature of the scientific analysis because the goal is to create a good computing environment for that analysis. We illustrate these aspects of design with an analytical database for estuaries in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region.

AB  - Because of the great variety of lacustrine-source depositional characteristics and biological consortia, identification of a universally applicable indicator of freshwater or brackish-water organic input for crude oils and rock extracts has proven elusive. Tetracyclic polyprenoid compounds (TPP) are present in relatively high concentrations in oils and associated source rocks deposited under freshwater or brackish-water conditions, but typically are present in relatively Low concentrations in samples from marine or coal-forming depositional environments. A TPP ratio, constructed from the gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry peak areas of a C-30 tetracyclic polyprenoid divided by the sum of the peak areas of the C-26 27-norcholestanes, revealed great specificity in identifying freshwater or brackish-water algal input, particularly in crude oils.

AB  - Introduction of purple loosestrife into North America and its spread into wetlands has led to the degradation of these important habitats for wildlife. Conventional control efforts are unsuccessful in providing long-term control. A classical biological control program offers the best chance for reducing the numbers of this invasive plant and improving regeneration of the native flora and fauna. European studies demonstrated that the root boring weevil Hylobius transversovittatus is highly host specific to the target weed. Attack of two test plant species (winged lythrum and swamp loose-strife) during host range screening was most likely due to artificial test conditions. An environmental assessment of the potential effects of the release of the purple loosestrife borer in North America indicated that benefits outweigh any potential negative impact. Therefore its field release was approved in 1992.

AB  - One consequence of nutrient-induced eutrophication in shallow estuarine waters is the occurrence of hypoxia and anoxia that has serious impacts on biota, habitats, and biogeochemical cycles of important elements. Because of the important role of dissolved oxygen (DO) on these ecosystem features, a variety of DO criteria have been established as indicators of system condition. However, DO dynamics are complex and vary on time scales ranging from diel to decadal and spatial scales from meters to multiple kilometers. Because of these complexities, determining DO criteria attainment or failure remains difficult. We propose a method for linking two common measurement technologies for shallow water DO criteria assessment using a Chesapeake Bay tributary as a test case. Dataflow (c) is a spatially intensive (30-60-m collection intervals) system used to map surface water conditions at the whole estuary scale, and ConMon is a high-frequency (15-min collection intervals) fixed station approach. The former technology is effective with spatial descriptions but poor regarding temporal resolution, while the latter provides excellent temporal but very limited spatial resolution. Our methodology for combining the strengths of these measurement technologies involved a sequence of steps. First, a statistical model of surface water DO dynamics, based on temporally intense ConMon data, was developed. The results of this model were used to calculate daily DO minimum concentrations. Second, this model was then inserted into Dataflow (c)-generated spatial maps of DO conditions and used to adjust measured DO concentrations to daily minimum concentrations. This information was used to assess DO criteria compliance at the full tributary scale. Model results indicated that it is vital to consider the short-term time scale DO criteria across both space and time concurrently. Large fluctuations in DO occurred within a 24-h time period, and DO dynamics varied across the length and width of the tributary. The overall result provided a more detailed and realistic characterization of the shallow water DO minimum conditions that have the potential to be extended to other tributaries and regions. Broader applications of this model include instantaneous DO criteria assessment, utilizing this model in combination with aerial remote sensing, and developing DO amplitude as an indicator of impaired water bodies.

AB  - Keeping animals in captivity should always favour conditions that aim to improve their welfare with respect to species-specific requirements. For laboratory animals, the majority of welfare issues have been explored in rodents thus far, whereas the effect of housing conditions on the well-being of avian lab species has received relatively little attention. Here, we investigate the importance of access to a water bath in captivity on the welfare of a drought-adapted passerine, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Zebra finches can survive long periods of drought in the wild, which also includes a lack of surface water for bathing, but if water is available, they regularly take the opportunity to bathe in water. Water baths represent an important comfort behaviour for zebra finches, especially because the birds do not take dust baths. Here, we wanted to examine the role of water baths in relation to corticosterone concentrations as an indicator of well-being in captive zebra finches. We sought to determine how important it is to provide water baths to zebra finches in captivity. Therefore, we repeatedly quantified the basal plasma stress hormone levels, i.e., corticosterone (CORT), and the body weight of individuals over a three-month period. During this time, control birds had permanent access to a water bath, while treatment birds experienced a 30-day period without the opportunity to bathe during the second month. We demonstrate that zebra finches lacking bathing opportunities show higher basal plasma CORT concentrations (GLM, p = 0.034) but do not differ in body weight in comparison to control birds (GLM, p = 0.31). Our results show that even for birds that can tolerate long periods of drought in their natural habitat, access to a water bath is essential for their well-being and their welfare, and thus, water baths should be provided under captive housing conditions. As chronically elevated stress hormone levels can have short-and long-term detrimental effects, our findings have important implications for welfare considerations in the management of one of the most used laboratory birds.

AB  - Coastal zones are exposed to various anthropogenic impacts, such as different types of wastewater pollution, e.g., treated wastewater discharges, leakage from sewage systems, and agricultural and urban runoff. These various inputs can introduce allochthonous organic matter and microbes, including pathogens, into the coastal marine environment. The presence of fecal bacterial indicators in the coastal environment is usually monitored using traditional culture-based methods that, however, fail to detect their uncultured representatives. We have conducted a year-around in situ survey of the pelagic microbiome of the dynamic coastal ecosystem, subjected to different anthropogenic pressures to depict the seasonal and spatial dynamics of traditional and alternative fecal bacterial indicators. To provide an insight into the environmental conditions under which bacterial indicators thrive, a suite of environmental factors and bacterial community dynamics were analyzed concurrently. Analyses of 16S rRNA amplicon sequences revealed that the coastal microbiome was primarily structured by seasonal changes regardless of the distance from the wastewater pollution sources. On the other hand, fecal bacterial indicators were not affected by seasons and accounted for up to 34% of the sequence proportion for a given sample. Even more so, traditional fecal indicator bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae) and alternative wastewater-associated bacteria (Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Arcobacteraceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Vibrionaceae) were part of the core coastal microbiome, i.e., present at all sampling stations. Microbial source tracking and Lagrangian particle tracking, which we employed to assess the potential pollution source, revealed the importance of riverine water as a vector for transmission of allochthonous microbes into the marine system. Further phylogenetic analysis showed that the Arcobacteraceae in our data set was affiliated with the pathogenic Arcobacter cryaerophilus, suggesting that a potential exposure risk for bacterial pathogens in anthropogenically impacted coastal zones remains. We emphasize that molecular analyses combined with statistical and oceanographic models may provide new insights for environmental health assessment and reveal the potential source and presence of microbial indicators, which are otherwise overlooked by a cultivation approach.

AB  - Increasing atmospheric CO2, cold water temperatures, respiration, and freshwater inputs all contribute to enhanced acidification in Arctic waters. However, ecosystem effects of ocean acidification (derived from anthropogenic and/or natural sources) in the Arctic Ocean are highly uncertain. Zooplankton samples and oceanographic data were collected in August 2012-2014 and again in August 2017 to investigate the pelagic sea snail, Limacina helicina, a biological indicator of the presence and potential impact of acidified waters in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Between 2012 and 2014 L. helicina abundance ranged from <1 to 1942 Ind. m(-2), with highest abundances occurring at stations on the Canadian Beaufort Shelf in 2012. The majority of individuals (66%) were located between 25 and 100 m depth, corresponding to upper halocline water of Pacific origin. In both 2014 and 2017, >85% of L. helicina assessed (n = 134) from the Amundsen Gulf region displayed shell dissolution and advanced levels of dissolution occurred at all stations. The severity of dissolution was not significantly different between 2014 and 2017 despite the presence of larger individuals that are less prone to dissolution, and higher food availability that can provide some physiological benefits in 2014. Corrosive water conditions were not widespread in the Amundsen Gulf at the time of sampling in 2017, and aragonite undersaturation (omega(ar) < 1) occurred primarily at depths >150 m. The majority of dissolution was observed on the first whorl of the shells strongly indicating that damage was initiated during the larval stage of growth in May or early June when sea ice is still present. Evidence of shell modification was present in 2014, likely supported by abundant food availability in 2014 relative to 2017. The proportion of damaged L. helicina collected from coastal embayments and offshore stations is higher than in other Arctic and temperate locations indicating that exposure to corrosive waters is spatially widespread in the Amundsen Gulf region, and periods of exposure are extreme enough to impact the majority of the population.

AB  - Water safety is a world-wide concern and several efforts have been made in order to ensure the conservation of aquatic ecosystems. Water quality monitoring must be performed with an integrated approach using biomonitor organisms allied to water parameters. Nonetheless, very few studies have focused on biomarker responses in neotropical fish, especially in the freshwater ecosystem of Brazilian Cerrado savanna. In present study, the active biomonitoring of the Joao Leite river (central Brazilian Cerrado river) was performed through the evaluation of biomarker responses in caged Astyanax lacustris in combination with land use classification and analysis of water parameters. Caged fish were exposed for seven days at four sites along the river and two control groups were kept in a tank under controlled conditions. Results showed that pasture was the predominant land use in the Joao Leite river basin (54.07%), followed by natural vegetation (34.92%) and other kind of land use (11.01%). Water analyses showed metal concentrations (Mn and Fe) above the maximum allowed by Brazilian regulation, with particularly higher concentrations at Site 2 (near to pasture area). Biomarker responses did not show significant differences for somatic and mutagenic biomarkers between sites. However, the comet assay showed high DNA damage at Sites 2 and 3, indicating genotoxic effects in caged fish at pasture areas. Histopathological analysis showed highest frequency of leukocyte infiltration in liver of fish from Site 2, confirming the ecotoxic effects on A. lacustris in streams impacted by grazing activities. DNA damage and leukocyte infiltration in fish hepatic tissues were sensitive biomarkers in the neotropical fish A. lacustris to assess the environment health of the Cerrado river. These results showed the importance of using a multibiomarker approach in environmental risk assessment, especially in areas more at risk from anthropogenic pollution. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are increasingly stressed by human-induced changes. Marine ecosystem drivers that contribute to stressing ecosystems - including warming, acidification, deoxygenation and perturbations to biological productivity - can co-occur in space and time, but detecting their trends is complicated by the presence of noise associated with natural variability in the climate system. Here we use large initial-condition ensemble simulations with an Earth system model under a historical/RCP8.5 (representative concentration pathway 8.5) scenario over 1950-2100 to consider emergence characteristics for the four individual and combined drivers. Using a 1-standard-deviation (67% confidence) threshold of signal to noise to define emergence with a 30-year trend window, we show that ocean acidification emerges much earlier than other drivers, namely during the 20th century over most of the global ocean. For biological productivity, the anthropogenic signal does not emerge from the noise over most of the global ocean before the end of the 21st century. The early emergence pattern for sea surface temperature in low latitudes is reversed from that of subsurface oxygen inventories, where emergence occurs earlier in the Southern Ocean. For the combined multiple-driver field, 41% of the global ocean exhibits emergence for the 2005-2014 period, and 63% for the 2075-2084 period. The combined multiple-driver field reveals emergence patterns by the end of this century that are relatively high over much of the Southern Ocean, North Pacific, and Atlantic, but relatively low over the tropics and the South Pacific. For the case of two drivers, the tropics including habitats of coral reefs emerges earliest, with this driven by the joint effects of acidification and warming. It is precisely in the regions with pronounced emergence characteristics where marine ecosystems may be expected to be pushed outside of their comfort zone determined by the degree of natural background variability to which they are adapted. The results underscore the importance of sustained multi-decadal observing systems for monitoring multiple ecosystems drivers.

AB  - A history of metal input and changes in the environmental conditions of the karst ecosystem of Krka River during the last several decades was investigated by statistical evaluation of the combination of several proxies including sediment content of minor (Pb, Zn, Cu, As, Cr, Ni, Co, V, Ga, Y, Rb, Sr) and major (Ca, K, Fe, Mn, Ti, Al) elements, concentrations of sedimentary organic carbon (C-org) and nitrogen (N), their stable isotope compositions (delta C-13(org) and delta N-15), as well as stable isotope composition of sedimentary carbonate (delta C-13(carb) and delta O-18(carb)). The results show that measured trace and major elements are predominately of terrigenous origin, reflecting the geological background of the area, whereas the sedimentary organic matter is predominantly authigenic. Although Zn amounts in sediments are results of anthropogenic pressures, its distribution in investigated sediment columns is influenced by natural processes, i.e. occasional re-sedimentation and self-purification of the water column caused by the particulate Zn deposition in lakes formed by the tufa barrages. Levels of Pb in sediment columns are low except in the K2 which is close to the crossroads, especially in the period of lead fuel use. Trace element concentrations in sediment columns are compared to consensus-based sediment quality guidelines (SQG) for freshwater ecosystems. Some of the As, Zn and particularly Ni sediment concentrations were found to be above threshold effect concentration (TEC) range. The stable isotopes of C-org and C-org/N ratios suggest that the sedimentary organic matter is predominately of algal and bacterial origin, while the carbonate is a mixture of terrigenic detritus and in-situ precipitates. The average grain size distribution and carbonate content of sediment indicate decreasing input of terrestrial non-carbonate fraction, as a consequence of afforestation and land use changes in studied area.

AB  - Large wood is a critical element in stream ecosystems, but only a subset of wood pieces actually provide hydraulic, geomorphic, and ecological functions. We test the current paradigm that larger pieces provide more function, and examine the role wildfires may play in affecting functionality of recruited wood. We conducted a cross-basin analysis in nine central Portugal watersheds, obtaining a variety of measurements on 1483 wood pieces (diameter >= 0.05 m; length >= 0.5 m) in 27 streams burned within six years prior. We examined nonlinear relationships and indirect effects on function using Generalized Additive Modeling and Structural Equation Modeling. Variables with direct effects on function were piece diameter, rootwads, anchoring, position (bridging, ramping, loose), longitudinal distance along the stream continuum, and the ratio of piece length to channel width. The effect of length ratio on function was nonlinear. Relatively long pieces were more likely to be functional until they were similar to 3 times the channel width, at which point longer pieces became less likely to be functional. Post-fire wood likely lacked complexity and longer pieces were more likely to be bridging; both conditions may have prohibited them from interacting with the wetted area. Wildfires had indirect effects on function. Burned pieces were more likely to be large in diameter (thus more likely functional) but not anchored (thus less likely functional); these antagonistic effects may be the reason burned status had no direct effect on function. Our results challenge the well-established idea that the function of wood in streams is simply a matter of wood size, along with indicators of longevity (e.g. stability and decay status). Relatively long pieces may in fact provide less function to the stream, at least until they break or are transported further downstream. Practitioners installing wood to streams should consider pieces with wide diameter and rootwads, approximately 3 times the channel width, and anchored but not bridging the channel.

AB  - It has been widely stated that pressures acting at large spatial scales influence local habitat conditions and might limit the effects of local restoration measures. However, only a few empirical studies have used statistical methods that have explicitly been developed to investigate such wedge-shaped relationships. The objectives of the present study were (i) to identify pressures acting as limiting factors and to investigate the mitigating effects of local restoration measures in three datasets from European rivers, (ii) to derive thresholds for the ecological status of invertebrates, and (iii) to compare results derived from two statistical approaches, one using aggregated response variables like biological metrics (quantile regression trees), another using taxon-specific responses to derive separate community thresholds for the negative response of sensitive and the positive response of tolerant taxa (Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis, TITAN). The results indicated that wedge-shaped relationships, typically resulting from limiting factors, are common in datasets from Central European rivers. There was empirical evidence for limiting effects of water pollution and catchment land use and an indication of a mitigating effect of hydromorphological restoration measures. The results emphasize the need to consider such large-scale pressures in river management and restoration because they potentially constrain the effects of local restoration measures. The thresholds derived for the aggregated response variables (metrics) and the community thresholds for sensitive taxa were in good agreement with values reported in the literature but differed markedly depending on the statistical method used. A possible reason is the different focuses of the methods on (i) the threshold for an aggregated response variable (metric), which includes the negative and positive response, and hence, reflects ecosystem functioning, and (ii) the community threshold of sensitive taxa based on taxon-specific negative responses, which is possibly best suited for species conservation issues. However, this interpretation requires further analysis since the results of the two methods showed no consistent differences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Assessment and monitoring of forest health represents a key point for environmental policy and for the management of environmental resources. With the renewed interest in assessment and monitoring of forest health generated by the suspected occurrence of a widespread forest decline in Europe and North America, many activities have been undertaken: however, some questions should be considered and clarified when attempting to estimate forest health. Particularly, the objective(s) of the assessment and monitoring program should be carefully identified. Identification of a program's task has a number of implications and consequences: it implies a definition of what concept of forest health (forest ecosystem health, forest health or forest trees health?) is assumed, what will be the target entity to be monitored, and therefore the identification of the relevant assessment questions and assessment endpoints. Consequences concern the definition of the spatial scale (from international to landscape and plot scale monitoring) and ecological coverage (from single species population to population of ecosystems) of the program, which can have a considerable influence on the choice of the proper sampling strategy and tactic, as well as on the most suitable methods, indicators and indices to be used. Although much of the work in the field of forest health and air pollution has concentrated on surveys on crown transparency and discoloration, there is an entire range of methods, indicators and indices developed to assess the health status of forests. The decision as to which ones should be used will depend on the aim of the program and on economic and practical considerations. A further consideration concerns the time span of the program, but any decision in this field is subject to many limitations due to difficulties in predicting future monitoring needs. All these points should be carefully considered and implemented according to a rigorous Quality Assurance procedure since any decision will influence future work for many years.

AB  - Ziadi, N., Belanger, G. and Claessens, A. 2012. Relationship between soil nitrate accumulation and in-season corn N nutrition indicators. Can. J. Plant Sci. 92: 331-339. Nitrogen management tools are required to optimize crop growth and yield while minimizing the likelihood of N losses to the environment. We previously determined that non-limiting N conditions for near maximum corn (Zea mays L.) grain yield are reached with the following threshold values for three in-season plant-based indicators of corn N nutrition determined at approximately the V12 stage of development: N nutrition index (NNI) = 0.88, leaf N (N-L) concentration = 32.7 mg N g(-1) leaf DM, and relative chlorophyll meter (RCM) values =0.95. Our objective was to study the relationship between these plant-based indicators and soil NO3-N content in an effort to develop tools to reduce the likelihood of soil NO3-N accumulation without affecting grain yield. This study at 5 site-years in Quebec consisted of six N fertilizer rates (20-250 kg N ha(-1)). The NNI, N-L concentrations, RCM values, and soil (0-0.15m) NO3-N content were measured weekly from July to early August, while soil NO3-N content to a 0.90-m depth was measured in late August and October. During the growing season from July to early August, the proportion of data points above the average soil NO3-N content was greater under non-limiting N conditions (NNI >= 0.88, N-L concentrations >= 32.7 mg N g(-1) leaf DM, or RCM values >= 0.95) than under limiting N conditions. Furthermore, the mean soil NO3-N content of the data points above the general average was much higher under non limiting than limiting N conditions in late August (167 vs. 78 kg NO3-N ha(-1) for NNI and RCM; 166 vs. 112 kg NO3-N ha(-1) N-L concentration) and October (68 vs. 49 kg NO3-N ha(-1)). High soil NO3-N accumulation during the season and at harvest occurs only when in-season plant-based N indicators are greater than their threshold values.

AB  - Legumes are characterized as keeping stable nutrient supply under nutrient-limited conditions. However, few studies examined the legumes' stoichiometric advantages over other plants across various taxa in natural ecosystems. We explored differences in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry of different tissue types (leaf, stern, and root) between N-2-fixing legume shrubs and non-N-2-fixing shrubs from 299 broadleaved deciduous shrubland sites in northern China. After excluding effects of taxonomy and environmental variables, these two functional groups differed considerably in nutrient regulation. N concentrations and N:P ratios were higher in legume shrubs than in non N-2-fixing shrubs. N concentrations were positively correlated between the plants and soil for non-N-2-fixing shrubs, but not for legume shrubs, indicating a stronger stoichiometric homeostasis in legume shrubs than in non-N-2-fixing shrubs. N concentrations were positively correlated among three tissue types for non-N-2-fixing shrubs, but not between leaves and non-leaf tissues for legume shrubs, demonstrating that N concentrations were more dependent among tissues for non-N-2-fixing shrubs than for legume shrubs. N and P concentrations were correlated within all tissues for both functional groups, but the regression slopes were flatter for legume shrubs than non-N-2-fixing shrubs, implying that legume shrubs were more P limited than non-N-2-fixing shrubs. These results address significant differences in stoichiometry between legume shrubs and non N-fixing shrubs, and indicate the influence of symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNP) on plant stoichiometry. Overall,N-2-fixing legume shrubs are higher and more stoichiometrically homeostatic in N concentrations. However, due to excess uptake of N, legumes may suffer from potential P limitation. With their N advantage, legume shrubs could be good nurse plants in restoration sites with degraded soil, but their P supply should be taken care of during management according to our results.

AB  - Spatial variation in mean annual precipitation is the principal driver of plant water and nitrogen status in drylands. The natural abundance of carbon stable isotopes (delta C-13) in photosynthetic tissues of C3 plants is an indicator of time-integrated behaviour of stomatal conductance; while that of nitrogen stable isotopes (delta N-15) is an indicator of the main source of plant N (soil N vs. atmospheric N-2). Previous studies in drylands have documented that plant delta C-13 and delta N-15 values increase with decreasing mean annual precipitation due to reductions in stomatal conductance, and soil enriched in N-15, respectively. However, evidence for this comes from studies focused on stable isotopes measurements integrated at the plant community level or on dominant plants at the site level, but little effort has been made to study C and N isotope variations within a species growing along rainfall gradients. We analysed plant delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N values of three woody species having different phenological leaf traits (deciduous, perennial and aphyllous) along a regional mean annual precipitation gradient from the central-western Argentinian drylands. Noticeably, plant delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in the three woody species did not increase towards sites with low precipitation or at the start of the growing season (drier period), as we expected. These results suggest that environmental factors other than mean annual precipitation may be affecting plant delta C-13 and delta N-15. The short-term environmental conditions may interact with species-specific plant traits related to water and nitrogen use strategies and override the predictive influence of the mean annual precipitation on plant delta C-13 and delta N-15 widely reported in drylands.

AB  - Collapse of social-ecological systems (SESs) is a common process in human history. Depletion of natural resources, scarcity of human capital, or both, is/are common pathways toward collapse. We use the system dynamics approach to better understand specific problems of small-scale, long-lived SESs. We present a qualitative (or conceptual) model using the conceptualization process of the system dynamics approach to study the dynamics of an oasis in Mexico that has witnessed a dramatic transition to decline in recent decades. We used indepth interviews, participant observation, expert opinions, and official statistical data sets to define the boundaries, and structure in a causal loop diagram of our studied system. We described historical trends and showed the reference mode for the main system variables (observed data), and analyzed the expected system behavior according to the system structure. We identified the main drivers that changed the system structure, as well as structural changes, and the effects of these changes on the dynamics, resilience, and vulnerability of this SES. We found that the tendency of this SES toward collapse was triggered by exogenous factors (growth of modern agriculture in nearby valleys, and socio-political relocation), and was maintained by an endogenous structure. These structural changes weakened the resilience of this SES. One of these changes resulted in a long-term maladaptation of the SES, which increased its vulnerability to frequent system disturbances (hurricanes and droughts). The conceptual model developed provides an in-depth qualitative description of the system, with an important amount of qualitative and quantitative information, to establish the structural hypothesis of the observed behavior. Using this qualitative model, the next research steps are to develop a quantitative model to test the qualitative theories, and to explore future scenarios of system resilience for decision-making processes to improve local conditions and restore the well-functioning of the system.

AB  - This paper assesses the sustainability of planned water uses in mesoscale river basins under multiple climate change scenarios, and contributes to determining the possible causes of unsustainability. We propose an assessment grounded in real-world water management issues, with water management scenarios built in collaboration with local water agencies. Furthermore, we present an analysis through indicators that relate to management goals and present the implications of climate uncertainty for our results, furthering the significance of our study for water management. A modeling framework integrating hydro-climatic and human dynamics and accounting for interactions between resource and demand was applied in two basins of different scales and with contrasting water uses: the Herault (2500 km(2), France) and the Ebro (85 000 km2, Spain) basins. Natural streamflow was evaluated using a conceptual hydrological model. A demand-driven reservoir management model was designed to account for streamflow regulations from the main dams. Human water demand was estimated from time series of demographic, socioeconomic and climatic data. Environmental flows were accounted for by defining streamflow thresholds under which withdrawals were strictly limited. Finally indicators comparing water availability to demand at strategic resource and demand nodes were computed. This framework was applied under different combinations of climatic and water use scenarios for the mid-21st to differentiate the impacts of climate- and human-induced changes on streamflow and water balance. Results showed that objective monthly environmental flows would be guaranteed in current climate conditions in both basins, yet in several areas this could imply limiting human water uses more than once every 5 years. The impact of the tested climate projections on both water availability and demand could question the water allocations and environmental requirements currently planned for the coming decades. Water shortages for human use could become more frequent and intense, and the pressure on water resources and aquatic ecosystems could intensify. The causes of unsustainability vary across sub-basins and scenarios, and in most areas results are highly dependent on the climate change scenario.

AB  - Conventional agricultural practices have often been associated with negative externalities, such as land degradation, pollution of soil and water resources, loss of biodiversity, and decreased provision of ecosystem services (ES). In response to these negative effects, the number of indicator-based attempts to assess ES provided by land use systems has increased. However, decisions regarding the importance of the different ES are usually made subjectively. Following an objective approach through the use of a partial order ranking method, this study aimed to assess several non-provisioning ES supplied by alley cropping system (ACS) in comparison with conventional agriculture (CA). The main objective of the study was to verify the applicability of partial order ranking to an ecologically-based assessment, focusing on soil, water, and biodiversity indicators. Results from 40 hypothetical scenarios representing various site conditions of agricultural fields in Germany were calculated using the Ecosystem Services Assessment Tool for Agroforestry (ESAT-A), a toolbox designed to assess selected ES of ACS following an empirical approach. The results were ranked using partial order and were visualized by a Hasse diagram. The findings depict partial order ranking as a promising technique to support decision making in order to find priority scenarios and indicators where the provision of ES can be enhanced by establishing ACS. The minimal scenarios under CA identified with simultaneously low values of all indicators were perceived as target scenarios for establishing ACS. The values of the indicators for the current land use system need to be taken into account in order to avoid scenarios where high tradeoff was suggested. Additionally, this approach can be extended and utilized at the field level to aid farmer decisions on which land use strategy is the most suitable alternative to increase the provision of ES.

AB  - Deforestation resulting from forest conversion to agricultural land use is an important issue worldwide. This phenomenon is known to influence the activity and size of soil microbial community due to changes in environmental conditions with subsequent losses of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil quality degradation. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and enzyme activities following land use conversion from native forests to continuous croplands. The amount of soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and the activity of five soil enzymes (i.e., urease, invertase, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase) were measured in croplands derived from forests and adjacent natural forests all on similar soil type at Gorgan site located in Northeast Iran. The content of SMBC decreased (47-83%) with deforestation at both soil sampling depths (0-20 and 20-40 cm). With the exception of phosphatases, the absolute activities of soil enzymes (activity on a soil mass basis) tended to decrease significantly (15-35%) with continuous cultivation. However, the specific enzyme activities expressed either per unit of SOC or SMBC tended to increase (about 1.5-5.5 times) with conversion of forestlands to croplands. The significant positive correlation between enzyme activity per SMBC and C turnover rate may imply that a faster C cycle and loss due to deforestation is related to a greater enzymatic activity by a smaller size of microbial biomass in cropland soils. In brief, the specific activities of soil enzymes could be used to reveal SOM losses and soil degradation in natural forest ecosystems, and to identify changes in soil quality and fertility following deforestation. Changes or improvements in soil management such as cessation of cultivation or implementing agricultural practices that stop or minimize soil disturbance are most likely needed to stop further soil degradation, restore soil quality and rebuild SOC stocks to offset CO2 emissions in these ecosystems.

AB  - The objective of this study was to carry out a critical comparison of data on the screening quality of surface sediments in Venice Lagoon (VL; main lagoon and its subbasins, Porto Marghera [PM], and Venice City Canals) and in other transitional and coastal ecosystems with various levels of human impact (urbanization and industrialization). To put VL in terms of reference and industrialized sites in the region, case studies were selected from the North Adriatic Region; to gain insight into how VL sediments compared to transitional areas throughout the world, case studies also were selected from a number of regions internationally. In order to compare regional levels of contamination, statistically processed sediment contaminant levels within a region (minimum, maximum, mean, and median), not individual sample values, are compared. The screening quality (relative to a variety of sediment quality guidelines) and the drivers of screening risk (based upon contaminant mixtures) of the VL sediments and other coastal and transitional sites are compared and discussed. The VL sediments have hazard quotients on the low end of the range typical of moderately urbanized and industrialized sites and higher than background conditions among the case studies reviewed. The Hg levels in the VL were generally higher than at other sites, and other contaminants were either equivalent or lower. Although sediments have somewhat higher levels of some contaminants and lower levels of other contaminants in PM and Venice City (VC) canals, levels for most contaminants are comparable to case studies with high levels of anthropogenic impact. For many contaminants of interest, PM (and for some, VC) sediments have some of the highest levels of any case study reviewed. How PM and VC rank when compared to other highly industrialized sites depends upon how data are synthesized and how ranges are taken into account. Actual risk must be evaluated using a weight-of-evidence approach, because natural background levels and site-specific bioavailability will differ both regionally and internationally.

AB  - A comparative study has been performed on populations of Unionidae from the Lake Suszek and Brda river situated in the centre of Tucholski Landscape Park, around which there are no factories and the Pilica river-affected by the influence of the nearby town agglomeration. Mussels collected from Suszek were also treated (72 h) with various concentrations of dichlorophenol (DCP; 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 ppm) and paraquat (PQ; 1, 5, 10 ppm) in laboratory conditions (aquarium). The activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system (NAD(P)H ferricyanide reductase, NAD(P)H cytochrome c reductase), cytochrome P450 content and b(5) in microsomal and cytosolic fractions of digestive gland were investigated. The differences in enzyme activities between groups of mussels, which were exposed to various concentrations of chemical pollutants, as well as the dependence on geographical distribution in Poland, were observed. In experiments with DCP the dose-dependent increase in GST activity was found, but no changes after PQ treatment were observed. Results, in experiments with DCP and PQ, have varied from no change to increase or decrease in the measured monooxygenase activities and cytochrome P450 content. Increases have been recorded in two cases (NADPH ferricyanide reductase and cytochrome P450) after exposure to DCP and in the case of NADH ferricyanide reductase following the exposure to PQ. NAD(P)H cytochrome c reductase activity and content of P450 decreased considerably in 5 and 10 ppm PQ-treated mussels. Thus, the treatment with DCP and PQ in water changed the properties of the mussels digestive gland cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system. These changes may be used as a bioindicator, at the molecular level, of exposure to those xenobiotics not only in controlled experiments (aquaria) but also in the natural environment.

AB  - Environmental protection strategies often rely on environmental impact assessments.  As part of the assessment process biologists are routinely asked to evaluate the effects of management actions on plants and animals. This evaluation often requires that biologists make judgments about the viability of affected populations. However, population viability analyses that are analytically comprehensive require extensive ecological data.  Such data are usually unavailable and impossible for wildlife managers to collect given limitations of time and money. In this paper we present a conceptual framework to help managers assess population viability given the reality of limited information and resources. Our framework includes a series of steps that facilitate assessment of management impacts on population viability while stressing the importance of reconciling disparities between the geographic scale of management actions and the scale of ecological responses. We argue that a gross mismatch of scale between local management actions (e.g, timber sales) and geographically extensive ecological responses (e.g., species viability) reduces the reliability of environmental analyses. Our framework stresses ''biological populations'' as the most appropriate level of ecological organization for conducting impact analyses. We argue that in most cases environmental analyses of local management actions should assess the ecological responses of populations rather than the responses of entire species, as is now commonly the case.  We also present ecological concepts that have been used effectively by biologists in making judgments about management effects and in developing conservation plans. Although not completely generalizable we believe these concepts, summarized from the conservation biology literature, can aid in evaluating population viability:  (1) connected habitats are better than disjointed habitats; (2) suitable habitats in close proximity to one another are better than widely separated habitats; (3) late stages of forest development are often better than younger stages; (4) larger habitat areas are better than smaller areas; (5) populations with higher reproductive rates are more secure than those with lower reproductive rates; and (6) environmental conditions that reduce carrying capacity or increase variance in the growth rates of populations decrease persistence probabilities.

AB  - The significance of stromatolites as depositional environmental indicators and the underlying causes of lamination in the lacustrine realm are poorly understood. Stromatolites in a ca 600 m thick Miocene succession in the Ebro Basin are good candidates to shed light on these issues because they are intimately related to other lacustrine carbonate and sulphate facies, grew under variable environmental conditions and show distinct lamination patterns. These stromatolites are associated with wave-related, clastic-carbonate laminated limestones. Both facies consist of calcite and variable amounts of dolomite. Thin planar stromatolites (up to 10 cm thick and less than 6 m long) occurred in very shallow water. These stromatolites represented first biological colonization after: (i) subaerial exposure in the palustrine environment (i.e. at the beginning of deepening cycles); or (ii) erosion due to surge action, then coating very irregular surfaces on laminated limestones (i.e. through shallowing or deepening cycles). Sometimes they are associated with evaporative pumping. Stratiform stromatolites (10 to 30 cm high and tens of metres long) and domed stromatolites (10 to 30 cm high and long) developed in deeper settings, between the surge periods that produced hummocky cross-stratification and horizontal lamination offshore. Changes in stromatolite lamina shape, and thus in the growth forms through time, can be attributed to changes in water depth, whereas variations in lamina continuity are linked to water energy and sediment supply. Growth of the stromatolites resulted from in situ calcite precipitation and capture of minor amounts of fine-grained carbonate particles. Based on texture, four types of simple laminae are distinguished. The simple micrite and microsparite laminae can be grouped into light and dark composite laminae, which represent, respectively, high and low Precipitation/Evaporation ratio periods. Different lamination patterns provide new ideas for the interpretation of microbial laminations as a function of variations in climate-dependent parameters (primarily the Precipitation/Evaporation ratio) over variable timescales.

AB  - In our time, a very urgent problem is the cessation of negative impacts on the environment and the return to the practical use of the territories of devastated lands. In this regard, it is important to find out the basic laws of primary soil formation in the area of these man-made neoplasms. The initial soil formation conditions were analyzed on 19 experimental sites which represent the main varieties of devastated land in the Kryvyi Rih Iron Mining and Metallurgical District (Central Ukraine): (i) waste rock dumps of old iron mines (old name "Forges"), (ii) tailing storage facility of underground iron mines, (iii) waste rock dumps of the Iron Ore Mining and Dressing Plant, (iv) waste rock dumps of the Granite Quarry Plant. It was established that on the devastated lands in Kryvyi Rih District, the initial soil formation occurs in very difficult conditions. Therefore, over 25-100 years only very primitive soils were formed. The following features are inherent to them: (1) primitive soil profile (thickness 10-100 mm), (2) low levels of soil organic substance content (9.5-11.5 %), (3) alkaline indicators of the soil solution (pH(H2O) - 8.08-8.92, pH(KCl) - 7.42-8.23), (4) low levels of cation exchange capacity (6.34-8.47 mMol /100 g). By results of correlation calculations, among the factors of soil formation time (duration of soil formation) and input of plant ash elements' fall are characterized by the maximum number of statistically significant correlation coefficients and their numerical values. In terms of chemical composition of the technosol, the values of organic matter content and exchangeable acidity (pH(KCl)) were the most predictable soil formation factors. Generally physical / chemical characteristics of geological rocks (as parent material) and time were the two most important factors in determining the initial pedogenesis on devastated lands in the Kryvyi Rih Iron Mining & Metallurgical District (Ukraine).

AB  - Two datasets, the geologic record and the genetic content of extant organisms, provide complementary insights into the history of how key molecular components have shaped or driven global environmental and macroevolutionary trends. Changes in global physico-chemical modes over time are thought to be a consistent feature of this relationship between Earth and life, as life is thought to have been optimizing protein functions for the entirety of its approximately 3.8 billion years of history on the Earth. Organismal survival depends on how well critical genetic and metabolic components can adapt to their environments, reflecting an ability to optimize efficiently to changing conditions. The geologic record provides an array of biologically independent indicators of macroscale atmospheric and oceanic composition, but provides little in the way of the exact behaviour of the molecular components that influenced the compositions of these reservoirs. By reconstructing sequences of proteins that might have been present in ancient organisms, we can downselect to a subset of possible sequences that may have been optimized to these ancient environmental conditions. How can one use modern life to reconstruct ancestral behaviours? Configurations of ancient sequences can be inferred from the diversity of extant sequences, and then resurrected in the laboratory to ascertain their biochemical attributes. One way to augment sequence-based, single-gene methods to obtain a richer and more reliable picture of the deep past, is to resurrect inferred ancestral protein sequences in living organisms, where their phenotypes can be exposed in a complex molecular-systems context, and then to link consequences of those phenotypes to biosignatures that were preserved in the independent historical repository of the geological record. As a first step beyond single-molecule reconstruction to the study of functional molecular systems, we present here the ancestral sequence reconstruction of the beta-carbonic anhydrase protein. We assess how carbonic anhydrase proteins meet our selection criteria for reconstructing ancient biosignatures in the laboratory, which we term palaeophenotype reconstruction.

AB  - The calcium carbonate hexahydrate mineral ikaite (CaCO3<(s)over dot> 6 H2O) has been documented in aquatic environments at near-freezing temperatures. An increase of the prevailing temperature in the depositional environment, results in the transformation of natural ikaite into less soluble calcium carbonate phases occasionally leaving calcite pseudomorphs in the sediments, which are considered as an indicator for primary cold water temperatures. Detailed understanding on the physicochemical parameters controlling ikaite (trans-) formation however, such as temperature and reactive solution chemical composition, are still under debate. In order to study the formation of ikaite, we conducted precipitation experiments under controlled physicochemical conditions (pH = 8.3 +/- 0.1; T = 6, 12, and 18 +/- 0.1 degrees C) at defined aqueous molar Mg/Ca ratios. The transformation of ikaite into anhydrous calcium carbonate polymorphs was investigated in solution and at air exposure. The obtained results reveal the formation of ikaite at temperatures up to 12 degrees C, whereas Mg-rich amorphous calcium carbonate precipitated at 18 degrees C. In contact with the reactive solution ikaite transformed into aragonite at aqueous molar Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios of >= 14. In contrast, ikaite separated from the Mg-rich solution and exposed to air transformed in all cases into calcite/vaterite. The herein obtained temperature limit of <= 12 for ikaite formation is significantly higher than formerly expected and most probably caused by (i) the high saturation degree of the solution with respect to ikaite and (ii) the slow dehydration of the aqueous Ca2+ ion at low temperatures. This result questions the suitability of calcite pseudomorphs (i.e. glendonites) as a proxy for near-freezing temperatures. Moreover, our findings show that the CaCO3 polymorph formed from ikaite is strongly controlled by the physicochemical conditions, such as aqueous molar Mg2(+/)Ca(2+) ratio of the reactive fluid and H2O availability throughout the transformation process.

AB  - Soil contamination due to petroleum-derived products is an important environmental problem. We assessed the impacts of diesel oil on plants (Trifolium repens and Lolium perenne) and soil microbial community characteristics within the context of the rhizoremediation of contaminated soils. For this purpose, a diesel fuel spill on a grassland soil was simulated under pot conditions at a dose of 12,000 mg diesel kg(-1) DW soil. Thirty days after diesel addition, T. repens (white clover) and L perenne (perennial ryegrass) were sown in the pots and grown under greenhouse conditions (temperature 25/18 degrees C day/night, relative humidity 60/80% day/night and a photosynthetic photon flux density of 400 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)) for 5 months. A parallel set of unplanted pots was also included. Concentrations of n-alkanes in soil were determined as an indicator of diesel degradation. Seedling germination, plant growth, maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (F-v/F-m), pigment composition and lipophylic antioxidant content were determined to assess the impacts of diesel on the studied plants. Soil microbial community characteristics, such as enzyme and community-level physiological profiles, were also determined and used to calculate the soil quality index (SQI). The presence of plants had a stimulatory effect on soil microbial activity. L perenne was far more tolerant to diesel contamination than T. repens. Diesel contamination affected soil microbial characteristics, although its impact was less pronounced in the rhizosphere of L perenne. Rhizoremediation with T. repens and L perenne resulted in a similar reduction of total n-alkanes concentration. However, values of the soil microbial parameters and the SQI showed that the more tolerant species (L perenne) was able to better maintain its rhizosphere characteristics when growing in diesel-contaminated soil, suggesting a better soil health. We concluded that plant tolerance is of crucial importance for the recovery of soil health during rhizoremediation of contaminated soils. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to concerns about the negative environmental impacts of ammonia (NH3), the EPA may soon regulate NH3 emissions from livestock operations, including waste piles. This would require knowledge of NH3 emission rates, but there are very few field-scale studies on emission measurement from broiler waste stockpiles. This is the first study in which short-term NH3 fluxes from broiler cake stockpiled in a shed were measured, taking into account both forced and natural convection. Acid scrubbers were used to measure NH3 concentrations, while the integrated horizontal flux (IHF) method and Fick's law of diffiision were used to determine NH3 emissions due to forced and natural convection, respectively. Average daily air temperature and wind speed 0.75 m above the stockpile were 24.9 degrees C and 0.65 m s(-1) in summer and 8.5 degrees C and 1.02 m s(-1) in winter. Natural convection accounted for <0.01% of total emission, but not isolating gas concentrations during forced convection conditions generally led to overestimation of emission. In summer (7 d), NH3-N emission factors were 17 g m(-2) d(-1) (stockpile surface area), 30 g m(-3) d(-1) (stockpile volume), 1.8 g kg(-1) N d(-1) (initial cake N content), and 11 g AU(-1) d(-1) (where AU = 500 kg live weight marketed). During the first 7 d of the winter study, the emission factors were 27 g m(-2) d(-1), 43 g m-3 d(-1), 2.1 g kg(-1) N d(-1), and 18 g AU(-1) d(-1), respectively. For the 15 d study, the emission factors changed very little. Higher emissions in winter were due to higher wind speeds, broiler cake total Kjeldahl N (TKN), and pH. While air temperature also affected emissions, stockpile temperatures (not measured) due to microbial activity were probably more important. Care should be taken in extrapolating this study's results to other stockpiles due to differences in stockpile dimensions, chemical properties, and environmental conditions.

AB  - The effects on soil condition of increasing periods under intensive cultivation for vegetable production on a Typic Haplohumult were compared with those of pastoral management using soil biological, physical and chemical indices of soil quality. The majority of the soils studied had reasonably high pH, exchangeable cation and extractable P levels reflecting the high fertilizer rates applied to dairy pasture and more particularly vegetable-producing soils. Soil organic C (C-org) content under long-term pasture (>60 years) was in the range of 55 g C kg(-1) to 65 g C kg(-1). With increasing periods under vegetable production soil organic matter declined until a new equilibrium level was attained at about 15-20 g C kg(-1) after 60-80 years. The loss of soil organic matter resulted in a linear decline in microbial biomass C (C-mic) and basal respiratory rate. The microbial quotient (C-mic/C-org) decreased from 2.3% to 1.1% as soil organic matter content declined from 65 g C kg(-1) to 15 g C kg(-1) but the microbial metabolic quotient (basal respiration/C-mic ratio) remained unaffected. With decreasing soil organic matter content, the decline in arginine ammonification rate, fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity, earthworm numbers, soil aggregate stability and total clod porosity was curvilinear and little affected until soil organic C content fell below about 45 g C kg(-1). Soils with an organic C content above 45 g C kg(-1) had been under pasture for at least 30 years. At the same C-org content, soil biological activity and soil physical conditions were markedly improved when soils were under grass rather than vegetables. It was concluded that for soils under continuous vegetable production, practices that add organic residues to the soil should be promoted and that extending routine soil testing procedures to include key physical and biological properties will be an important future step in promoting sustainable management practices in the area.

AB  - This article presents an approach to integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) into an activity-based costing (ABC) model to develop a steering system that takes into account both financial costs and associated environmental impacts. By combining the formalism of LCA and ABC matrix calculations, we show how impact assessment results can be affiliated with costs to jointly and simultaneously compute the costs and environmental impacts of products and activities. The conditions of integration are developed following the four-step structure of LCA. The proposal is applied to a simplified case study of the 'Classic Pen Company.' The developed ABC-LCA approach paves the way for further test applications, which are considered useful in the context of environmental indicators for strategic steering, communication with customers and forecasting or simulation.

AB  - As alternative to conventional electronic time-temperature sensors, a natural, nontoxic, biodegradable, and thermochromic protein-based sensor was investigated exploring myoglobin and myoglobin-nitrite proteins ability in changing color when exposed to temperature. Myoglobin extract and nitrite were added to the cassava starch thermoplastic sensor films and their thermochromic time-temperature ability were monitored through visual and instrumental color (L, a, b, Chroma, and hue angle) changes when exposed to 100 and 170 degrees C/60 min environments. Scanning electron microscopy analysis have indicated that myoglobin and/or myoglobin-nitrite extracts addition resulted in homogeneous materials. Samples were efficient in reporting temperature exposure during time, indicating their feasibility as additives for packaging or label time-temperature sensors.
   Practical applications The protein time-temperature sensor could increase the packed food security since manufacture, corroborating correct pasteurization or sterilization conditions; or at end consumer ' s houses, indicating that secure cooking temperatures were reached.

AB  - The distribution, species richness and ecology of Trichoptera, the diversity of benthic diatoms, and hydrochemical data in 7 springs in the vicinity of Lodz were investigated in 2011. In total, 17 Trichoptera taxa and more than 300 diatom taxa were collected from the studied springs. Trichoptera and especially diatom taxa are very sensitive indicators of ecological conditions; both showed a strong response to degradation in lowland springs. On the basis of faunal, diatom microfloral, and hydrochemical data, the typology of springs of the vicinity of Lodz is proposed. Two groups of factors (differentiating and non-differentiating) which contribute to distinguishing the studied springs are described. Additional experiments and observations were done on Trichoptera, including their life cycles, biology, and larval diet. In particular, the abundance of common diatom taxa in the guts of Silo sp. larvae was investigated.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates are considered important bioindicators of water quality, and their distribution is influenced by several factors, including food availability. This feeding is an essential factor for all living beings and determines aspects of temporal and spatial population dynamics and relations between individuals and their respective habitats. The present work aimed to analyze the diet of nymphs of the order Plecoptera associated with quartzite caves located in southern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The stomach contents of 79 specimens were analyzed, and many were empty (40.5 %). Among the nymphs with stomach contents, the most frequent content was fine particulate organic matter. The high amount of individuals with empty content may indicate a low tolerance of these organisms to subterranean environments.

AB  - The relationships between cyanobacterial abundance and the physical and chemical characteristics of waters were studied to identify the environmental variables responsible for the changes in species composition observed in a river characterized by variations in water quality. Principal component analysis showed that some communities had significantly different species composition and relationships with environmental variables than others. These analyses allowed us to identify indicator species with contrasting responses to nutrient conditions. One of the four cyanobacterial groups distinguished in the analysis was negatively correlated with variables related to aspects of water disturbance, including nutrients. The results indicate that the eutrophication gradient structured species composition and affected cyanobacterial community distribution. Since organisms have an integrating response to their environment, the use of cyanobacterial assemblages to indicate eutrophication gradients could help in the assessment of water quality in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) metrics are used to assess the conservation value of natural areas based on the composition of their plant communities. FQA is based on coefficients of conservatism (C-values). C-values are regional, expert-assigned values, which range from 0 to 10 to reflect a taxon's fidelity to high quality natural areas and its relative tolerance to modern human impacts. Approximately half of FQA publications assert without evidence that plant species with lower C-values are more generalist, whereas species with higher C-values are habitat specialists. The connection between specialization and C-values has never been investigated. Our primary objective was to test the claim that ecological specialization is associated with C-values. We first used the "theta (theta) method," based on species co-occurrences, to estimate niche width for 274 species in 598 wetlands, grasslands, and forests in Illinois, USA. As a secondary proxy for niche width, we counted the habitat preferences of all Illinois vascular taxa listed from the Illinois Plant Information Network (ILPIN). For theta in grasslands and wetlands, and for ILPIN habitat counts, the lowest and highest C-values were associated with greater ecological specialization, whereas species with low to intermediate C-values were the most generalist. In forests, we found weaker, negatively linear relationships between C-values and theta, indicating that species with a high conservation value (i. e. conservative) were the most specialized. However, when shrub and canopy layers were combined with the herbaceous layer data in forests, we did not find an association between C-values and specialization. We also reanalyzed the data to determine the effect of non-native species on the relationship between niche width and C-values because non-native species, by default, receive C-values of 0. Removing non-native species from the analyses did not influence our conclusions. Both methods to measure specialization suggested there is a weak relationship between C-values and ecological specialization. Our findings support the common claim that some conservative species are more specialized than species with intermediate or low C-values. However, we found the general C-value and specialization relationship is more complex than assumed by many FQA publications because if it exists, it is not necessarily linear, i.e., species with low C-values are often specialists. Specialization and niche width could be latent components of C-values, but FQA users should avoid defining species conservatism by niche and specialization.

AB  - The formation of sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) Pb/Zn deposits is linked to ocean euxinia, but recent evidence suggests that ferruginous conditions may have dominated the deep ocean during the Middle Proterozoic, a maximum period for SEDEX distribution. Biomarkers of sulfate-reducing and sulfide-oxidising bacteria are valuable indicators of euxinic conditions in such settings. Organic matter (OM) from SEDEX deposits is often affected by alteration and/or migration, but OM entrapped within the kerogen/mineral matrix (Bitumen II) may be less affected than the freely-extractable OM (Bitumen I). We analysed Bitumen II from the Paleoproterozoic Here's Your Chance (HYC) Pb/Zn/Ag deposit to find evidence of euxinic conditions in the depositional environment. n-Alkane distributions in Bitumen II are markedly distinct from previously-reported Bitumen I. Bitumen II contains long-chain n-alkanes (up to C-36 or C-38) and a strong even-over-odd distribution in a number of samples, which are 4 parts per thousand to 7 parts per thousand depleted in C-13 compared to n-alkanes in Bitumen I and verified as indigenous by comparison with delta C-13 of isolated kerogen. These features are interpreted as evidence of sulfate-reducing and sulfide-oxidising bacteria, confirming that HYC was deposited under euxinic conditions. Bitumen II has the potential to reveal information from OM that is degraded and/or overprinted in Bitumen I. Commonly-used methylphenanthrene maturity ratios give conflicting information as to the relative maturity of Bitumens I and II. Bitumen I contains a far higher proportion of methylated phenanthrenes than Bitumen II. As Bitumen II is sequestered within the kerogen/mineral matrix it may have restricted access to the 'methyl pool' of organic compounds that can donate methyl groups to aromatic hydrocarbons. Parameters that include both phenanthrene and methylphenanthrenes do not appear suitable to compare the maturity of Bitumens I and II; hence there is no clear evidence that Bitumen II is of lower thermal maturity than Bitumen I.

AB  - This study investigates whether raised beach sequences preserved on emergent coasts of the central Canadian Arctic Archipelago contain a proxy record of past sea-ice conditions and wave intensity. We hypothesize that periods of reduced sea ice (increased open water) expose shorelines to more prolonged and higher wave energy, leading to better-developed beach ridges. Surveys of raised beach sequences on Lowther Island revealed the following patterns: a) high, wide, single- to multi-crested barriers backed by deep swales or lagoons characterize both the active and lowest relict shorelines; b) small, narrow, discontinuous ridges of poorly sorted gravel extend from 1.0 to 7.5 m asl, except from 4.5 to 5.0 m ask c) ridge morphology is similar to the active and first relict ridges between 7.5 and 11 m asl; d) a near-featureless zone with minor terraces and ridges above 11 m extends to above 30 m asl. These distinct morphological and sedimentary units are interpreted as a function of wave climate and thus of summer sea-ice conditions. This model suggests periods of greater wave activity from the present day back about 500 (14)C years (530 cal BP;.Unit A), during a short interval from 1750 to 1600 (14)C years BP (1750-1450 cal BP; Unit B'), and earlier from 2900 to 2300 (14)C years BP (3030-2340 cal BP; Unit C). Units B and D are interpreted as the result of more severe ice conditions with lower wave energy from 2300 to 500 (14)C years BP (2340-530 cal BP) and earlier from more than 5750 to 2900 (14)C years BP (6540-3030 cal BP). Discrepancies with previously published interpretations of regional sea-ice history may reflect the local nature of the beach proxy record, which implies occurrences of extensive open-water fetch east and west of Lowther Island but cannot be extrapolated to a regional scale. The beach record shows distinct variation through time and provides an alternative window on past summer ice extent in central Barrow Strait.

AB  - The governance of the two-thirds of the world's ocean in areas beyond national jurisdiction (the high seas and deep seabed beyond national jurisdiction or ABNJ) is currently fragmented into diverse institutions addressing specific activities, issues or regions. This has hampered the international community's ability to redress critical issues including biodiversity loss, pollution, climate change, ecosystem degradation and declining fisheries in an integrated and ecosystem-based manner. Our analysis of polycentricity theory and associated enabling conditions shows that the current polycentric approach to marine biodiversity in ABNJ is not yet fully functional: it is missing the two key attributes of: (1) generally applicable rules and norms structuring actions and behaviors, and (2) processes to enhance cooperation, coordination, and conflict resolution. Based on the enabling conditions conducive for achieving "a functional polycentric governance system" identified in Carlisle and Gruby (2019), combined with a prior analysis applying resilience principles for socio-ecological systems to ABNJ (Yadav and Gjerde, 2020), this article suggests seven ways the emerging United Nations agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity of ABNJ (BBNJ Agreement) could stimulate coordinated and integrated action at both global and regional levels in ABNJ. These include: (1) overarching rules, goals and objectives; (2) formal and informal conflict resolution mechanisms; (3) robust global institutional arrangements; (4) strengthened global, regional and sectoral bodies with shared and overlapping responsibility for biodiversity conservation; (5) strengthened cooperation through integrated ecosystem assessments and strategic action programmes at ecologically meaningful scales that could include areas within and beyond national jurisdiction; (6) learning exchange mechanisms within and across regions; and (7) strengthened regional and national capacities for ecosystem-based management in ABNJ. Taken together, these tools could enhance the resilience of ocean institutions, ecosystems and biodiversity to cope with growing pressures, uncertainty and rapid change in ABNJ.

AB  - Plant diversity safeguards wetland ecosystem functions, stability, and resilience, but is threatened by habitat loss and degradation. Remote sensing could support the cost-effective management of biodiversity by providing consistent and frequent data at large scales. While identifying individual species from remote sensing datasets with low spatial and spectral resolution is challenging, studies can focus on factors known to correlate with or promote diversity. We tested the predictive potential of such factors - maximum annual greenness as an indicator of productivity, texture (i.e., spatial arrangement of grey tones) as a proxy for habitat heterogeneity, and spatial autocorrelation - across a dataset of 1115 wetlands in the conterminous United States surveyed by the EPA's National Wetland Condition Assessment. We used multivariate linear regressions to test whether spectral and spatial metrics derived from two open-source datasets - NASA's Landsat 5 TM and 7 ETM+ (30 m, 16-day revisit) and USDA's National Agriculture Inventory Program (1 m, biennial) - can predict wetland plant diversity and richness. Individual texture metrics showed different sensitivity to vegetation evenness, growth form, and spatial distribution and could together predict 35-36% of site variation in richness and diversity. This highlights the impact of habitat heterogeneity on species diversity and spectral variability. While maximum annual greenness and texture metrics had similar predictive capacity, their interactions and combined effects improved the fit of linear models by 11-14%, demonstrating their complementarity. Best results were achieved when including distance-based Moran's Eigenvector Maps (dbMEMs) describing spatial relations among sites at multiple scales and reflecting the role of spatially structured factors (e.g., climate, topography, dispersal) on diversity. Together greenness, texture, and dbMEMs could predict 59% of plant richness and 50% of plant diversity across the entire dataset and up to 71% of the richness of least disturbed sites. These results show the potential of open-source remote sensing datasets to monitor biodiversity resources at a large scale and prioritize the protection and field monitoring of wetlands.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity and higher complexity generally increase biodiversity in agroecosystems. Carabid beetles represent abundant and important predators of pests and weed seeds in temperate agroecosystems and are affected by landscape structure. Several studies have described the impact of permanent non-crop habitats such as woodlots, hedgerows, and grassy margins on carabid assemblages. However, temporal non-crop habitat islands within arable fields have been rarely investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate spatial distribution of carabid beetles within oilseed rape fields having temporary non-crop habitats (field defects). Field defects are areas where sown plants poorly develop due to sowing failures or extreme local conditions (soil humidity, missing nutrients). In twenty oilseed rape fields, we studied carabid assemblages collected with pitfall traps in three habitat types (field interiors, field defects, and boundaries between them) and in two sampling periods (spring and summer). Both activity-density and species richness were lower in field defects than in boundaries and field interiors during both sampling periods, indicating that field defects were not a preferred habitat for carabids. Activity-density and species richness significantly increased from spring to summer in all habitat types. Species composition of carabid assemblages significantly differed between field defects and field interiors or boundaries. Field defects were characterised by impoverished carabid assemblages and the presence of few indicator species. Interestingly, field defects with well-developed plant cover hosted carabid assemblages with species richness comparable to field interiors, indicating that re-sowing of field defects can support carabid populations within arable fields. However, the consequences of re-sowing on other arthropod taxa, e.g., insects requiring habitats with bare ground, and on populations of rare weeds need to be evaluated. The lack of effects of field defect size on carabid assemblages indicated that carabid beetles react to even very small patches with unsuitable conditions (e.g., very low humidity, high temperature or food scarcity).

AB  - The most significant risk factor for organisms living in an environment contaminated by heavy metals is the metal bioavailability. Therefore, an efficient ecotoxicological approach to metal contamination is the measure of bioaccumulation level in target organisms. In this work, we characterized the heavy metal bioaccumulation in honey bees, Apis mellifera ligustica, collected at 35 sites from Umbria (Central Italy). The comparison of our data with selected Italian investigations revealed metal bioaccumulation in honey bee matrix of the same order of magnitude, with Cd showing a higher variability. To generalize the results, we developed a Honeybee Contamination Index (HCI) based on metal bioaccumulation in honey bees. An application of the HCI to the present dataset revealed cases of low (sixteen sites), intermediate (eighteen sites), and high (one site) metal contaminations. The comparison of HCI values from the Umbrian dataset with values calculated for other Italian and European metadata showed that most of the Umbrian sites fell in the portion of low and intermediate contamination conditions. HCI represented a reliable tool that provided a piece of concise information on metal contamination in terrestrial environments. Parallel to this effort, we have determined, the metal concentrations in the airborne particulate matter (PM10) at three regional background-monitoring stations in Umbria. These stations are representative of the average air quality of the areas of the investigated apiaries. A comparative analysis of metal enrichment factors in PM10 , and honey bees suggested that the contamination in the bees was related to the PM10 values only to a minor extent. On the other side, a clear enrichment of metals such as Cd, Mn, Zn, and Cu in the honey bees appeared to depend on very local conditions and was probably related to the use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the resuspension of the locally contaminated soils and agriculture residues.

AB  - Scientific information for the chemistry and ecotoxicology of metals in soils has been obtained in the research conducted in recent years. However, the latest "science" obtained from this research has not yet been translated into "regulations" in China. In the present study, the predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) for Ni which denoted as soil ecological criteria for Ni were derived based on the effects of soil properties on bioavailability/ecotoxicity of Ni, incorporating the differences in species sensitivity as well as in laboratory and field conditions. First, collected all ecotoxicity data of Ni from bioassays in Chinese soils and filtered with given criteria to obtain reliable data. Second, corrected the compiled data with either aging factor or leaching and aging factors simultaneously to eliminate the discrepancy caused by difference between laboratory and realistic field conditions. Prior to being put into a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method to fit SSD curves, the corrected Ni ecotoxicity data were normalized with Ni ecotoxicity predictive models to modify the variation in Ni ecotoxicity caused by different soil properties. Then, the hazardous concentration for x% of the species (HCx) was figured out from the Ni SSD curve and the ecological criterion of Ni (PNEC) was set equal to HCx. Finally, predictive models for HCx were developed by quantifying the relationship between the Ni HCx and soil properties. Soil pH was the major factor controlling the values of HCx for Ni, with HC5 varying from 6.5 mg/kg in an acidic soil (pH 5.0) to 218.8 mg/kg in an alkaline soil (pH 8.5). The predictive models with parameters of soil pH and organic carbon (%) could calculate HCx with determination coefficients (R-2) of 0.90-0.95. When soil cation exchange capacity was taken into account the third parameter, the predictive models could predict HCx more accurate with R-2 values of 0.94-0.99.

AB  - This paper reviews the concentration, distribution, source, and potential risk of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface soils of China through analysis of data from >6000 surface soil samples in nearly 100 references. The mean value of total 16 PAHs was 730 ng.g(-1) in surface soil in China, a relatively lower or moderate level than other countries. Based on the Maliszewska-Kordybach classification criteria, the proportions of heavily contaminated, contaminated, weakly contaminated, and non-contaminated soil samples were 21.4%, 11.9%, 49.5%, and 17.2%, respectively. There was a clear geographical distribution, with concentrations of the total 16 PAHs descending in the following order: Northeast China (1467 ng.g(-1)) > North China (911 ng.g(-1)) > East China (737 ng.g(-1)) > South China (349 ng.g(-1)) > West China (209 ng.g(-1)). Moreover, it was found that the PAH concentrations in surface soil in China descended along the urban-suburban-rural gradient. The concentration and distribution of PAHs were mainly related to the degree of economic development, population density, climatic conditions, and soil organic matter, and the divergence of regional economic patterns and climatic conditions was the main reason for the observed PAH distribution in the soils. Traffic emissions, coal and biomass combustion mainly contributed to the PAH contamination of surface soil in China during the process of urbanization and industrialization, and the average Benzo(a) pyrene equivalent concentration ofSPAH7c (seven carcinogenic PAHs) was 99 ng.g(-1), which indicated the soil samples had a small potential carcinogenic risk. Despite soil pollution being generally low, PAH concentrations in some areas were relatively high, therefore it is necessary to produce strategies, such as establishing effective guidelines and developing environmental-friendly technology to reduce PAH emissions, and prevent further contamination.

AB  - A lacustrine sediment core from Store Koldewey, northeast Greenland, was biogeochemically, biologically and sedimentologically investigated in order to reconstruct long-and short-term climatic and environmental variability. The chronology of the uppermost 189 cm of the record is based on ten C-14 AMS age determinations of aquatic mosses. The record covers almost the entire Holocene and revealed changes on multidecadal to centennial scales. Dating of the oldest mosses shows that lacustrine biogenic productivity already began at around 11 cal. kyr BP. This age pre-dates the onset of biogenic productivity in other lakes on Store Koldewey by about 2 kyr. In spite of the early onset of biogenic production organic matter accumulation remained low and minerogenic sedimentation dominated. At about 9.5 cal. kyr BP moss, sulphur, organic carbon and biogenic silica content started to increase, indicating that the environment stabilized and the biogenic production in the lake adjusted to more preferable conditions. Subsequently, the biogenic productivity experienced repeated changes and varied both on long-and short-term scales. The long-term trend shows a maximum during the early Holocene thus responding to increased temperatures during the Holocene Thermal Maximum. Superimposed on the long-term trend, biogenic productivity also experienced repeated short-term fluctuations that match partly the NGRIP temperatures. The most pronounced decrease of biogenic productivity occurred at around 8.2 cal. kyr BP. Perennial lake ice coverage resulting from low temperatures is supposed to have caused decreased lacustrine biogenic productivity. From the middle Holocene to the present repeated decreases of productivity occurred that could be related to periods with severe sea-ice conditions of the East Greenland Current. Besides the dependence on air temperature it therefore demonstrates the sensitivity of lacustrine biogenic productivity in coastal high arctic areas to short-term cold spells that are mediated by the currents emanating from the Arctic Ocean. However, the data also emphasize the difficulties associated with the interpretation of lacustrine records.

AB  - This study compares the fish assemblages of the permanently open cool-temperate Olifants and warm-temperate Breede estuaries on the west and south coasts of South Africa respectively, and their responses to altered freshwater flows. Both estuaries have experienced a >35% reduction in mean annual runoff (MAR) from a historical reference condition to the present day with a >60% reduction possible under future flow scenarios. With the exception of species that have both marine and estuarine breeding populations, the Olifants Estuary fish assemblage has experienced an overall 20% decrease in abundance from reference (pristine state) to the present day and will gradually decline to 55% of reference with a predicted future 60% reduction in MAR. Consequently, future reductions in flow are likely to result in the Olifants Estuary progressing towards a low biomass, low diversity, marine-dominated system. In contrast, reduced freshwater flows in the Breede Estuary are likely to experience an overall reduction in the abundance of species that breed only in estuaries, and in freshwater and catadromous species. Collectively, entirely estuarine-dependent fish will increase in abundance, but considered individually some important exploited species such as Argyrosomus japonicus and Pomadasys commersonnii will collapse to 50% of historical numbers once there has been a 64% reduction in MAR. Overall, fish abundance in the estuary has increased by 6% from reference to the present day and is likely to increase to 115% of reference with future reductions in flow. Some species with a preference for fresh and brackish water will be all but lost from the system, but overall diversity is likely to increase with the range expansion of warm-temperate and subtropical marine species westward. In all, the fish assemblage of the Breede Estuary will experience a gradual change from a relatively high-diversity, low-abundance, freshwater-rich system under historical flow conditions to a high-diversity, high-abundance, marine-dominated system with future reductions in flow.

AB  - Farm animal behaviour science has pragmatically aimed to control the behaviour and improve the rearing condition of farm animals using behavioural indicators. Studies on the behaviour control have shown the physical, chemical, and psychological methods that facilitate good behaviours and suppress bad behaviours. Studies on the rearing condition have specified some psychological stressors, which were clarified into 3 aspects. These are the agonistic relationship among group members, the rough handling by stockpersons, and the restrictions of performing normal behaviour patterns. Further development in the 2 areas mentioned above will be one of the aims of research in farm animal behaviour science. In addition, farm animal behaviour scientists will be expected to study 3 new aspects and farm animal behaviour science to expand out to 'applied ethology'. One is the Field of environmental enrichment for zoo animals, laboratory animals, and pets, which behaviour scientists studying alternatives to the intensive husbandry systems for farm animals are subjected to. Though this field is quite pragmatic, it also contains many biological aspects such as the motivation model. The second aspect is the study of individuality of animals, which has shown 2 types of adaptive strategies to stressors in many species. It means that there is not only one behavioural strategy in each species, which may have a strong impact on considering rearing systems of animals. The study of the fitness of behavioural individuality will sophisticate behavioural ecology. The third is the study of wildlife management. Wild animals have recently been protected more than in the past under the pretext of environmentalism but then there a-re conflicts with human society. The studies in this field, however, have biases toward population dynamics and habitat management. In addition to the past research, micro-management or the symptomatic treatment of pests such as behaviour control, is necessary for pest control. Farm animal behaviour science is expected to participate in this area. Studies on wild animals in captivity will also contribute to our understanding of the abilities of wild animals such as cognition.

AB  - Over recent years there have been rapid changes occurring across marine ecosystems worldwide, with high latitude systems seeing ecosystem shifts emerging at unprecedented rates. The Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea marine ecosystems have experienced substantial fluctuation in fish stocks, with some species experiencing considerable decreases while others thrive. Following the marine heatwave of 2014, sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) had a historically unparalleled juvenile recruitment class that is now dominating the stock composition. While this recruitment class bodes well for future fisheries, it is currently undermining the value of the fishery with limited incentives to retain the smaller and less valuable fish, compounding adverse effects on earnings in the fishery due to whale depredation that has been occurring for years. This study examines the well-being implications of fishermen's adaptive strategies to these ecosystem conditions within the Alaska sablefish fishery using a socioecological system framework, operationalized as a qualitative network model (QNMs) and quantitative indicators. We examine the extent to which adaptation strategies, derived from a literature review and stakeholder interviews, are being utilized in the fishery with quantitative indicators. These strategies are then examined with QNMs that explore their impacts across the spectrum of well-being. By coupling quantitative indicators and QNMs, we were able to demonstrate how adaptive strategies can be examined to capture the multi-faceted well-being effects of fisheries participants' adaptations to changing conditions. This study directly addresses several of the key guiding principles of the U.S. EBFM Road Map, including advancing our understanding of ecosystem processes, exploring trade-offs within an ecosystem, and maintaining resilient ecosystems, inclusive of community well-being. Thus this paper demonstrates how coupled socio-ecological models can elevate the inclusion of human adaptive behaviors, providing a framework for the development of policymaking that can mitigate adverse effects on both the participants and the resource by facilitating the mixture of adaptive strategies that maximizes desired well-being outcomes.

AB  - Simple Summary Skin mucus biomarkers have become relevant indicators for studying fish physiological status and welfare. Here, we evaluated them in terms of the acute osmotic response of the sea bass. Change of mucus volume exuded and main stress-related metabolites explain the putative energy loss implied in a hyper/hypo-osmotic response. We demonstrated that skin mucus is a valuable tool, comparable to classical blood markers, for evaluating sea bass response to acute salinity challenges as well as some other potentially stressful situations. This technique will allow ecologists, physiologists, and aquafarmers to monitor fish welfare and to analyse endangered migrating species without affecting their vulnerable populations. European sea bass is a marine teleost which can inhabit a broad range of environmental salinities. So far, no research has studied the physiological response of this fish to salinity challenges using modifications in skin mucus as a potential biological matrix. Here, we used a skin mucus sampling technique to evaluate the response of sea bass to several acute osmotic challenges (for 3 h) from seawater (35 parts per thousand) to two hypoosmotic environments, diluted brackish water (3 parts per thousand) and estuarine waters (12 parts per thousand), and to one hyperosmotic condition (50 parts per thousand). For this, we recorded the volume of mucus exuded and compared the main stress-related biomarkers and osmosis-related parameters in skin mucus and plasma. Sea bass exuded the greatest volume of skin mucus with the highest total contents of cortisol, glucose, and protein under hypersalinity. This indicates an exacerbated acute stress response with possible energy losses if the condition is sustained over time. Under hyposalinity, the response depended on the magnitude of the osmotic change: shifting to 3 parts per thousand was an extreme salinity change, which affected fish aerobic metabolism by acutely modifying lactate exudation. All these data enhance the current scarce knowledge of skin mucus as a target through which to study environmental changes and fish status.

AB  - Exotic diseases have fundamentally altered the structure and function of forest ecosystems. Controlling exotic diseases across large expanses of forest has proven difficult, but fire may reduce the levels of diseases that are sensitive to environmental conditions. We examined Cornus florida populations in burned and unburned Quercus-Carya stands to determine if burning prior to anthracnose infection has reduced the impacts of an exotic fungal disease, dogwood anthracnose, caused by Discula destructiva. We hypothesized that fire has altered stand structure and created open conditions less conducive to dogwood anthracnose. We compared C. florida density, C. florida health, and species composition and density among four sampling categories: unburned stands, and stands that had burned once, twice, and 3 times over a 20-year period (late 1960s to late 1980s). Double burn stands contained the greatest density of C. florida stems (770 stems ha(-1)) followed by triple burn stands (233 stems ha(-1)), single burn stands (225 stems ha(-1)) and unburned stands (70 stems ha(-1); P < 0.01). We observed less crown dieback in small C. florida trees (< 5 cm diameter at breast height) in burned stands than in unburned stands (P < 0.05). Indicator species analysis showed that burning favored species historically associated with Quercus-Carya forests and excluded species associated with secondary succession following nearly a century of fire suppression. Our results suggest that fire may mitigate the decline of C. florida populations under attack by an exotic pathogen by altering forest structure and composition. Further, our results suggest that the burns we sampled have had an overall restorative effect on forest communities and were within the fire return interval of the historic fire regime. Consequently, prescribed fire may offer a management tool to reduce the impacts of fungal disease in forest ecosystems that developed under historic burning regimes.

AB  - In particular radical innovations can be important means to achieving improved sustainability. Due to the existence of path dependency and lock-in, however, the transition from one technological trajectory to another, more sustainable one is often impeded by significant barriers. Fortunately, these barriers are by their nature subject to substantial changes in time; so, it makes sense to carefully distinguish between periods of stability (showing high barriers) in which the given trajectory can hardly be left and periods of instability (characterized by low barriers) where a new trajectory can be reached more easily. The latter distinction matters since sustainable innovations often rely on governmental regulation and the economic burden arising from this regulation will be much lower in periods of instability. Moreover, due to the complexity and dynamics of change in their respective environments, innovations are generally associated with fundamental uncertainty such that it becomes impossible to predict the degree of sustainability yielded by specific innovations in the longer run. Under these circumstances, it is essential to facilitate the change between trajectories and to allow for the possibility to select between a variety of alternative trajectories within a process of trial and error. Sustainability as viewed from this evolutionary perspective is therefore better understood as the general capability to adapt, that is, to readily change from less to more sustainable technological trajectories. Since the latter kind of sustainability determines the conditions under which the former kind (i.e. sustainability, related to a specific technology) can be achieved, the two kinds are respectively called second-order and first-order sustainability.
   Finally, a series of determinants (and corresponding indicators) from the techno-economic, political, and socio-cultural sphere is identified which, after proper measurement and weighting, allow for making an assessment whether and when the incumbent industry is sufficiently destabilized and the political system rendered sufficiently favorable to the new, more sustainable technology such that a transition to the preferred trajectory is possible without too much effort.

AB  - 1. The structure of bryophyte communities in streams in relation to habitat characteristics, especially disturbance, is described. Disturbance in rivers is quantified as movement of the stream bed, whereas in small streams water level fluctuation is used as an indicator of disturbance frequency.
   2. Canonical correspondence analysis differentiated frequently disturbed sites from more stable ones. The existence of a disturbance gradient was confirmed in a subset of the study sites using long-term records of discharge variation. A parallel change was detected in the species composition of bryophyte communities with low-statured, potentially fast colonizers dominating the disturbed end and large perennial species the stable end of the gradient.
   3. A consistent pattern of zonation of bryophyte species was found along the gradient from continually submersed to persistently dry conditions in small streams and lake outlets. An abrupt increase in species richness occurred at or just above the water line, where facultatively aquatic species tolerant of both conditions formed the bulk of the community.
   4. The relationship between species richness and standing crop in stream bryophyte communities was consistent with the hump-backed model of Grime (1979), especially at the within-habitat scale. Quadrats of low and very high standing crop were characterized by low species richness, while peak richness was observed at intermediate standing crops.
   5. A few perennial species (e.g. Fontinalis spp. and Rhynchostegium riparioides) capable of monopolizing space dominated the most stable habitats. Species composition in low biomass sites was more variable, yet only one basic growth-form (small-statured species with high allocation to spore production) seemed possible in these highly disturbed streams. In habitats of intermediate biomass, small-scale disturbances apparently allow the formation of a more varied bryophyte community.
   6. A habitat templet for stream bryophyte life strategies and community structure is presented. Disturbance is proposed to be the factor filtering out traits unsuitable for a given environment. The potential of stream bryophytes for testing and developing general ecological theory is emphasized.

AB  - Use of Plantago ovata Forsk leaf (also known as blond plantain or isabgol) extract is a novel approach for ameliorating water stress in various agronomic crops such as maize (Zea mays L.). To examine the potential roles of P. ovata extract (0, 20 and 40%) in increasing seed germination, plant growth, photosynthetic measurements, stomatal properties, oxidative stress and antioxidant response, ions uptake and the relationship between studied parameters, we investigated the impacts of its short-term seed priming on Z. mays L. elite cultivar "Cimmyt-Pak" under a control environment and a water deficit stress environment (induced by PEG). It was evident that water deficit stress conditions induced a negative impact on plant growth, stomatal properties and ion uptake in different organs of Z. mays. The decrease in growth-related attributes might be due to overproduction of oxidative stress biomarkers, i.e., malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) initiation, and electrolyte leakage (%), which was also overcome by the enzymatic antioxidants, i.e., superoxidase dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and non-enzymatic antioxidants, which increased under the water stress environment. However, seed priming with P. ovata extract positively increased germination rate and growth profile, and protected photosynthetic apparatus and stomatal properties by decreasing oxidative stress indicators and increasing activities of antioxidant compounds. Our results also depicted that the optimum concentration of P. ovata extract for Z. mays seedlings under water stress conditions was 20%, while a further increase in P. ovata extract (40%) induced a non-significant negative impact on growth and biomass of Z. mays seedling. In addition, the effect was more promising on Z. mays seedlings when grown under controlled conditions. Here, we concluded that the understanding of the role of seed priming with P. ovata extract in the increment of growth-related attributes, photosynthetic apparatus (Pn, Gs, Ts and Ci) and nutrient uptake (Ca2+, Fe2+, P and Mg2+) introduces new possibilities for their effective use in water deficit stress environments and shows a promising foundation for Z. mays tolerance against water deficit stress conditions.

AB  - While emerging research suggests urban green space revegetation increases soil microbiota diversity and native plant species affect skin microbiome diversity, there is still a paucity of knowledge on relationships between neighborhood environmental conditions and the human microbiome. This study leveraged data on human microbiome samples (nose, mouth, rectum) taken at autopsy at the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office (2014-2015). We evaluated relationships between the microbiome and five measures of environmental conditions (NDVI standard deviation, NDVI mean, percent trees, percent grassland and soil type) near the home of 126 decedents. For the rectum microbiome, NDVI sd had negative, significant associations with diversity (ASVs beta = -020, p = 0.045; Faith PD beta = -0.22, p = 0.026). In contrast while insignificant, there were consistent, positive associations between diversity and NDVI sd for the mouth microbiome (ASVs beta = 0.09, p = 0.337, Faith PD beta = 0.14, p = 0.149, Shannon diversity beta = 0.14, p = 0.159, Heip's evenness beta = 0.11, p = 0.259) and a significant association for the nose microbiome (eigenvalues 3 beta= 0.18, p = 0.057). We found consistent, significant, negative associations between percent grassland and diversity of the nose microbiome (ASVs beta = -0.25, p = 0.008, Faith PD beta = -0.25, p = 0.009, Shannon diversity beta = -0.17, p = 0.062). For the mouth microbiome, we found a small effect of percent trees on diversity (eigenvalues 1 beta = -0.08, p = 0.053). Clay loam soil was negatively (eigenvalues 2 beta = -0.47, p = 0.053) and positively associated (eigenvalues 3 beta = 0.65, p = 0.008) with rectum microbiome diversity, compared to loam soil. There was no potential indicator taxon among NDVI quartiles. These findings may be relevant for urban planning and management of urban outdoor spaces in ways that may support healthy human microbiomes. Still, future research is needed to link variation in NDVI, vegetation, plant and/or soil microbe diversity and to confirm or negate our findings that environmental conditions may have contrasting influence on the microbiome of the rectum versus the nose and mouth and that grasslands affect the nose microbiome.

AB  - Even though indicators based on nematode community composition are among the best developed metrics of soil health, little research has been done to support their application to management. This work tested the hypothesis that organic farming systems could enhance nematode community structure where soil resource condition had been enhanced by reducing disturbance and using organic fertility inputs. We tested this hypothesis by exploring the relationship between soil biology and the condition of the soil resource in an organic trial using the Nematode Maturity (MI), Plant Parasitic (PPI), Enrichment (El), Channel (CI), and Structure (SI) indices. Shifts in nematode indices occurring during the growing season were compared with measures of labile soil organic matter and N availability [particulate organic matter-C and -N (POM-C, POM-N), particulate organic matter C:N ratio (POM C:N), potentially mineralizable N (PMN), hydrolysable N estimated with the Illinois-N test (IL-N), and heterotrophic activity estimated with fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA)]. Soil samples were collected four times during a single growing season from plots that had been transitioned from conventional to organic management under Ley-, Row Crop- and Vegetable-based regimes. Each of the three transition scenarios included three subplots that were either supplied with organic matter from raw and composted dairy manure or cover crop residues. High El and low CI values revealed a greater dominance of the bacterial decomposition pathway in soils transitioned under the Ley system and values were positively associated with measures of microbial activity and available N. Increases in the PPI values were stimulated where nutrient availability (and likely crop root growth) were enhanced. The SI was positively associated with the POM fraction and declined after primary tillage. This signalled a shift in the community towards an early stage of succession and demonstrates the detrimental effects of tillage on soil food web complexity. Recommendations for soil stewardship that are guided by nematode food web indices would encourage practices that enhance soil organic matter, reduce the frequency of cultivation, and conserve structure.

AB  - Two cores, one 1141-cm long (An-S) and the other 885-cm long (An-A), were retrieved from Anguli-nuur Lake (41 degrees 18'-24'N, 114 degrees 20'-27'E, similar to 1315 masl), one of the largest lakes in the transition zone between a semi-humid and semi-arid climate parallel to the present limit of the southeast monsoon along the southeastern Inner Mongolia Plateau in north China. Mineral-magnetic parameters (chi(If), ARM, IRM(300mT), SIRM and IRM(-300mT)) were measured on An-S and two additional parameters (chi(ARM) and HIRM) and four inter-parametric ratios (chi(ARM)/SIRM, IRM(300mT)/SIRM, IRM(-300mT)/SIRM and SIRM/chi(If)) were calculated. Potential sources of these lake sediments (catchment soils and dune materials close to the lake and in a distant sand plain) were sampled, and the magnetic properties of the surface-material specimens were measured. A chronological model was developed for An-S by comparing and combining AMS(14)C dates of An-S with (137)Cs, (210)Pb and AMS(14)C dates of An-A. With the help of surface-material magnetism, the magnetic data of An-S in combination with particle size, TOC and C/N and pollen analyses indicate the environmental changes during the last similar to 10,000 years around this lake. Conditions began to ameliorate at 10,900 cal.yr BP (9600 (14)C yrBP) and thus relatively wet and warm environments prevailed during 10,900-8900 cal. yr BP (9600-8000 (14)C yr BP). The Holocene optimum or the wettest and warmest conditions, was during 8900-7400 cal. yr BP (8000-6500 (14)C yr BP). The environment began to deteriorate from 7400 cal. yr BP (6500 (14)C yr BP) and the driest and coolest conditions occurred during 2200-480 cal. yr BP. There may have been a minor amelioration after 480 cal. yr BP. The inferred changes in palaeoenvironmental conditions around Anguli-nuur Lake are broadly in agreement with those around most other sites on the Inner Mongolia Plateau. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge is often considered a principal source of surface water contamination. In this study, a three-dimensional fully-integrated groundwater surface water model was used to simulate the transport characteristics and cumulative loading of an artificial sweetener (acesulfame) and fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia colt) from WWTPs within a 6800 km(2) mixed-use, highly impacted watershed in Ontario, Canada. The model, which employed 3.5 x 10(6) computational nodes and 15 layers, facilitated a comprehensive assessment of groundwater surface water interactions under high and low flow conditions; processes typically not accounted for in WWTP cumulative effects models. Simulations demonstrate that the model had significant capacity in reproducing the average and transient multi-year groundwater and surface water flow conditions in the watershed. As a proxy human-specific conservative tracer, acesulfame was useful for model validation and to help inform the representation of watershed-scale transport processes. Using a uniform WWTP acesulfame loading rate of 7.14 mg person(-1) day(-1), the general spatial trends and magnitudes of the acesulfame concentration profile along the main river reach within the watershed were reproduced; however, model performance was improved by tuning individual WWTP loading rates. Although instream dilution and groundwater surface water interactions were strongly dependent on flow conditions, the main reach primarily consisted of groundwater discharge zones. For this reason, hydrodynamic dispersion in the hyporheic zone is shown as the predominant mechanism driving acesulfame into near-stream shallow groundwater, while under high flow conditions, the simulations demonstrate the potential for advective flushing of the shallow groundwater. Regarding the cumulative impact of the WWTPs on E. coli concentrations in the surface flow system, simulated transient E. coli levels downstream of WWTPs in the watershed were significantly lower than observed values, thus highlighting the potential importance of other sources of E. coli in the watershed.

AB  - Background: Plant growth is a good indicator of crop performance and can be measured by different methods and on different spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we measured the canopy height growth of maize (Zea mays), soybean (Glycine max) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) under field conditions by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). We tested the hypotheses whether such measurements are capable to elucidate (1) differences in architecture that exist between genotypes; (2) genotypic differences between canopy height growth during the season and (3) short-term growth fluctuations (within 24 h), which could e.g. indicate responses to rapidly fluctuating environmental conditions. The canopies were scanned with a commercially available 3D laser scanner and canopy height growth over time was analyzed with a novel and simple approach using spherical targets with fixed positions during the whole season. This way, a high precision of the measurement was obtained allowing for comparison of canopy parameters (e.g. canopy height growth) at subsequent time points.
   Results: Three filtering approaches for canopy height calculation from TLS were evaluated and the most suitable approach was used for the subsequent analyses. For wheat, high coefficients of determination (R-2) of the linear regression between manually measured and TLS-derived canopy height were achieved. The temporal resolution that can be achieved with our approach depends on the scanned crop. For maize, a temporal resolution of several hours can be achieved, whereas soybean is ideally scanned only once per day, after leaves have reached their most horizontal orientation. Additionally, we could show for maize that plant architectural traits are potentially detectable with our method.
   Conclusions: The TLS approach presented here allows for measuring canopy height growth of different crops under field conditions with a high temporal resolution, depending on crop species. This method will enable advances in automated phenotyping for breeding and precision agriculture applications. In future studies, the TLS method can be readily applied to detect the effects of plant stresses such as drought, limited nutrient availability or compacted soil on different genotypes or on spatial variance in fields.

AB  - Proterozoic inliers in the central Anti-Atlas mountains expose predominantly siliciclastic sedimentary successions deposited in peritidal zones along the Neoproterozoic continental margin of the West African Craton (WAC). The low-grade metamorphic and modestly deformed sediments contain a wealth of sedimentary structures related to the former presence and activities of microbial mats and respective physicobiological processes. The well-preserved structures include wrinkle structures, erosion marks, microbial sand chips, spindle-shaped and subcircular microbial shrinkage cracks, and possibly gas domes and cabbage-head structures. Thin sections exhibit mat fragments and dispersed grains of hematite/limonite after pyrite in fine-grained quartzitic storm deposits. Post-storm layers frequently consist of matrix-supported sand-sized to silt-sized grains and are overlain by argillaceous veneers including isolated silt-sized grains and black carbonaceous laminae. The muddy veneers are considered to represent compacted stacks of microbial mats (biolaminites), which colonized and biostabilized storm and post-storm layers, and thus prevented them from eroding. In the absence of grazing and burrowing organisms and at suitable depositional and hydrodynamic conditions, it may be expected that Proterozoic microbial mats extensively grew from the supratidal to the intertidal zones and occasionally, e.g. behind protective barriers, in the subtidal zone and beyond. Mat-related structures, however, need specific conditions for their formation and preservation: Wrinkle structures, erosion marks, and microbial sand chips require tractional currents and soon deposition and burial, respectively. Such conditions are preferably met in intertidal and supratidal zones. Spindle-shaped and subcircular cracks require mat shrinkage due to either desiccation or "syneresis". Crack propagation implies progressive shrinkage, while superposition of crack generations indicates repeated alternation between mat exposure and flooding. Respective conditions prevail in the upper intertidal zone. Gas domes and cabbage-head structures are related to the production of gas from decaying organic material beneath a scaling cohesive mat. They may be some of the first features formed during genesis of petee structures in the intertidal to lower supratidal zones. Mat-related structures may serve as sensitive facies indicators once their modes of formation are revealed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of mineral fertilizers in agriculture has significantly increased to support the growing global food demand. Organic fertilizers are produced from renewable waste materials to overcome the drawbacks of inorganic fertilizers. The development of novel production processes of organic fertilizers entails a significant advance towards the circular economy that reincorporates waste materials into the production cycle. In this work, the economic and environmental feasibility of an industrial plant with a treatment capacity of 300 kg/h of organic waste for the production of liquid fertilizers has been performed. Two extraction technologies (conventional and microwave) and two solvents (water and alkaline) have been compared to select the most sustainable and profitable scenario for scaling-up. The extraction process consists of 2 steps: extraction followed by a concentration stage (necessary only if water extraction is applied). The resolution of the mass balances shows that the fertilizer production under alkaline conditions is ten times higher than for water-based extraction. The economic analysis demonstrated that the total investment cost of microwave technology ( 3.5 Meuro) is three times higher compared to the conventional extraction technology (<1.5 Meuro), mainly due to the higher complexity of the equipment. These facts directly impact the minimum selling price, because the fertilizers obtained by conventional extraction with alkaline solvent would have a lower selling price (about 1 euro/L). As for environmental assessment, the indicators show that the environmental impact produced by water-based extraction is higher than alkaline-solvent extraction, mainly due to the necessity of a concentration stage of the liquid extract to meet the requirements of European regulations. In view of the results obtained in the economic and environmental evaluation, it could be concluded that the most favourable scenario for scaling up the production of liquid fertilizers from organic waste is the conventional extraction under alkaline conditions.

AB  - During the "El Nino"-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event 2009-2010, trophic state uni (TSI's) and multimetric (TRIX's) indexes were determined in the north coast of the Rio de la Plata (RdlP). The relationships of such indexes with the hydrological, physical and chemical parameters were explored to identify climatic variability or anthropogenic effects on the eutrophication process. Eleven oceanographic sampling campaigns at 25 stations were conducted along the north coast of RdlP from 2009 to 2011. Temperature, salinity and oxygen saturation, water transparency (Secchi depth), chlorophyll (Chl a) content and total nutrient concentrations (total nitrogen and phosphorous) were determined. Trophic indexes (TSI Chl a, TSI TP, TRIX NP-Voll. and TRIX NP-Mvdeo.) were quantified and the RdlP flow was measured. RdlP flow showed significant differences between ENSO phases, with higher values during "El Nino" (EN), negative and significant correlations with salinity, Secchi depth and positive with total nutrients. The trophic status indexes showed spatial and temporal variability and associations with flow, physical and chemical parameters. Trophic state indexes showed spatial and temporal heterogeneity and were strongly associated to environmental conditions (hydrological and seasonal oscillations) during the study period but also to the anthropogenic factors affecting the north coast of RdlP. The system has been classified as mesotrophic to hypertrophic, depending on the selected indicator. According to these results, we suggest the use of a multimetric trophic state indicator, i.e., the TRIX index, as explains better the causes and effects of the eutrophication processes. To implement the TRIX index, (TRIX NP-Mvdeo.) we suggest researchers to consider a large number of local records (Chl a, nutrients, oxygen) at seasonal scales.

AB  - The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of north-central United States and south-central Canada supports greater than half of all breeding mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) annually counted in North America and is the focus of widespread conservation and research efforts. Allocation of conservation resources for this socioeconomically important population would benefit from an understanding of the nature of spatiotemporal variation in distribution of breeding mallards throughout the 850,000 km(2) landscape. We used mallard counts from the Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey to test for spatial heterogeneity and identify high-and low-abundance regions of breeding mallards over a 50-year time series. We found strong annual spatial heterogeneity in all years: 90% of mallards counted annually were on an average of only 15% of surveyed segments. Using a local indicator of spatial autocorrelation, we found a relatively static distribution of low-count clusters in northern Montana, USA, and southern Alberta, Canada, and a dynamic distribution of high-count clusters throughout the study period. Distribution of high-count clusters shifted southeast from northwestern portions of the PPR in Alberta and western Saskatchewan, Canada, to North and South Dakota, USA, during the latter half of the study period. This spatial redistribution of core mallard breeding populations was likely driven by interactions between environmental variation that created favorable hydrological conditions for wetlands in the eastern PPR and dynamic land-use patterns related to upland cropping practices and government land-retirement programs. Our results highlight an opportunity for prioritizing relatively small regions within the PPR for allocation of wetland and grassland conservation for mallard populations. However, the extensive spatial heterogeneity in core distributions over our study period suggests such spatial prioritization will have to overcome challenges presented by dynamic land-use and climate patterns in the region, and thus merits additional monitoring and empirical research to anticipate future population distribution.

AB  - Continuously identified natural frequencies of vibration can provide unique information for low-cost automated condition assessment of civil constructions and infrastructures. However, the effects of changes in environmental parameters, such as temperature and humidity, need to be effectively investigated and accurately removed from identified frequency data for an effective performance assessment. This task is particularly challenging in the case of historical constructions that are typically massive and heterogeneous masonry structures characterized by complex variations of materials' properties with varying environmental parameters and by a differential heat conduction process where thermal capacity plays a major role.
   While there is abundance of documented monitoring data highlighting correlations between environmental parameters and natural frequencies in the case of new structures, such as long-span bridges, similar studies for historical constructions are still missing, with only a few literature works occasionally reporting increments in natural frequencies with increasing temperature of construction materials due to the closure of internal micro-cracks in the mortar layers caused by thermal expansion.
   In order to gain some knowledge on the effects of changes in temperature and humidity on the natural frequencies of slender masonry buildings, the paper focuses on the case study of an Italian monumental bell tower that has been monitored by the authors for more than nine months. Correlations between natural frequencies and environmental parameters are investigated in detail and the predictive capabilities of linear statistical regressive models based on the use of several environmental continuous monitoring sensors are assessed. At the end, three basic mechanisms governing environmentally induced changes in the dynamic behavior of the tower are identified and essential information is achieved on the optimal location and minimum number of environmental sensors that are necessary in a structural health monitoring perspective.

AB  - Monthly hydrochemical data and delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in karst water samples from September 2007 to October 2012 were obtained to reveal the controlling mechanisms on DIC geochemistry and delta C-13(DIC) under different conditions of climate and land cover in three karst catchments: Banzhai, Dengzhanhe and Chenqi, in Guizhou Province, SW China. DIC of karst water at the Banzhai site comes mainly from carbonate dissolution under open system conditions with soil CO2 produced by root respiration and organic carbon decomposition with lowest delta C-13 values under its dense virgin forest coverage. Weaker carbonate bedrock dissolution due to sparse and thin soil cover results in lower delta C-13(DIC), pCO(2), DIC and EC, and lower cation and anion concentrations. At the Chenqi site, larger soil CO2 input from a thick layer of soil results in high pCO(2) and DIC, and low pH, SIc and delta C-13(DIC) in the karst water. At the Dengzhanhe site, a lesser soil CO2 input due to stronger karst rock desertification and strong gypsum dissolution contribute to higher delta C-13(DIC), high EC and high cation and anion concentrations. Soil CO2 inputs, controlled by biological activity and available soil moisture, carbonate bedrock dissolution, dilution and degassing effects, vary seasonally following rainfall and temperature changes. Consequently, there are seasonal cycles in hydrochemistry and delta C-13(DIC) of the karst water, with high pCO(2) and low pH, EC, SIc, and delta C-13(DIC) values in the warm and rainy seasons, and vice versa during the cold and dry seasons. A strongly positive shift (>3 parts per thousand) in delta C-13(DIC) occurred in the drought year, 2011, indicating that delta C-13(DIC) in groundwater systems can be an effective indicator of environmental and/or climate changes.

AB  - Triclosan (TCS) is a ubiquitous antibacterial agent found in soaps, scrubs, and consumer products. There is limited information on hazardous effects of TCS in the environment. Here, rotating annular reactors were used to cultivate river biofilm communities exposed to 1.8 mu gl(-1) TCS with the timing and duration of exposure and recovery during development varied. Two major treatment regimens were employed: (i) biofilm development for 2,4 or 6 weeks prior to TCS exposure and (ii) exposure of biofilms to TCS for 2,4 or 6 weeks followed by recovery. Biofilms not exposed to TCS were used as a reference condition. Communities cultivated without and then exposed to TCS all exhibited reductions in algal biomass and significant (p < 0.05) reductions in cyanobacterial biomass. No significant effects were observed on bacterial biomass. CLSM imaging of biofilms at 8 weeks revealed unique endpoints in terms of community architecture. Community composition was altered by any exposure to TCS, as indicated by significant shifts in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints and exopolymer composition relative to the reference. Bacterial, algal and cyanobacterial components initially exposed to TCS were significantly different from those TCS-free at time zero. Pigment analyses suggested that significant changes in composition of algal and cyanobacterial populations occurred with TCS exposure. Bacterial thymidine incorporation rates were reduced by TCS exposure and carbon utilization spectra shifted in terms substrate metabolism. Direct counts of protozoans indicated that TCS was suppressive, whereas micrometazoan populations were, in some instances, stimulated. These results indicate that even a relatively brief exposure of a river biofilm community to relatively low levels of TCS alters both the trajectory and final community structure. Although some evidence of recovery was observed, removal of TCS did not result in a return to the unexposed reference condition. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The research concerned flow-through reservoirs fed with contaminated river water. The aim of the research was to recognize the impact of reservoirs on fluvial transportation of contaminants. Three reservoirs, situated in the Upper-Silesian region (southern Poland) and operating in different environmental conditions, were selected for the research: Pogoria I reservoir - operating in the quasi-natural direct catchment (with fluvial load of industrial-municipal wastewater), Przeczyce reservoir - under agricultural anthropopressure, and Dzierzno Due reservoir - under urban-industrial anthropopressure. The research included analyses of the quality of river water flowing into and leaving the reservoirs and calculation of contaminant loads at the inflows and outflows.
   The research showed that Pogoria I reservoir neutralised inflowing contaminants, thus purifying the river water. Nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were particularly efficiently retained. Electrolytic conductance of water in Pogoria was reduced by up to 50%. Przeczyce reservoir was alimented with eutrophic water (especially rich in biogenic elements) from agricultural land. The reservoir accumulated contaminants at the initial stage of the research. After several years, however, it started releasing some of the accumulated substances, causing an increase in contamination of river water with e.g. organic substances. The data concerning Przeczyce reservoir revealed that reservoirs can purify water from some substances and simultaneously cause an increase in contamination with other substances. Selectivity of hydrochemical impact of reservoirs was particularly visible in case of Dzierzno Due reservoir, which received wastewater from the urban-industrial catchment. It largely reduced the loads of suspended matter, phosphates or zinc, among other substances, at the same time causing secondary contamination with substances like ammonia, lead or cadmium.
   The results of the research show individuality of reservoirs in terms of their impact on fluvial transportation of substances. It might be believed, however, that each reservoir which is fed with contaminated water will have at least partly (selectively) contaminating impact in the course of time. That should be related to increasing eutrophication in conditions of limited capacity of accumulation of contaminants in the limnic environment. Detailed assessment of transfer of substances by a particular reservoir would require individual research for that reservoir.

AB  - A large number of plots (306) were sampled for floristic data and variables of soil nutrient availability in a wide range of forest conditions in the Vosges mountains (NE France). Half of the data were used to model species presence/ absence as a function of nutritional variables using two numerical methods: parametric logistic regression and nonparametric Kernel estimation. Species responses were established for calcium, aluminium, Ca : Al ratio, base saturation, pH and C: N measured in the upper soil horizon. The other half were used to predict these variables with vegetation with three approaches: maximum likelihood, indicator values and ecological groups.
   More than 80 % of the 122 studied species showed a significant response to one or more nutrition factors. Species often had optima for maxima or minima of the studied values. For each variable, species were more frequent in conditions with good nutrition and/or low toxicity: maximum values were most frequent for Ca, Ca: Al, base saturation, pH and minimum values were most frequent for Al and C: N. For all variables, optima estimated by logistic regression were well correlated with those estimated by kernel estimation: R-2 > 0.9.
   Mean differences between measured values and predictions by vegetation were ca. 2.6 meq for Ca, 1.2 for log Ca, 3.1 meq for Al, 1.8 for log Al, 30 for Ca: Al, 2.1 for log Ca: Al, 0.21 for base saturation, 0.7 for pH and 5.7 for C: N. The quality of prediction as measured by R-2 between predicted and measured values varied from 0.60 to 0.14. The quality of prediction decreases from soil base saturation to aluminium according to the next order: base saturation > log Ca: Al > log Ca > Ca > C: N > pH > log Al > Al > Ca: At. Maximum likelihood and ecological groups methods of prediction were more efficient than the indicator values method.

AB  - Intensively reared rabbits are particularly sensitive to heat stress. For this reason if is useful to identify reliable stress indicators to evaluate peculiar stress conditions of the breeding environment.
   In order to recognize which changes in biochemical and functional measurements can be utilized as stress indicators, three groups of eight New Zealand White rabbits, of 2.8 kg body weight and 11 weeks of age, were kept in individual cages and submitted to different environmental conditions. Group 1 was located in a climatic chamber at 33.5 (s.e. 0.5)degrees C and relative humidity 0.62 (s.d. 0.05) and groups 2 and 3 (control) at 18.0 (s.d. 0.5)degrees C.
   Group 1 was given ad libitum a commercially pelleted diet, group 2 was pair-fed with group 1, and group 3 was given food ad libitum. For all the groups, at days 0, 1, 6, 12 and 24, the following measurements were made: body weight, rectal temperature, food consumption and plasma glucose, cholesterol, urea, triglycerides, uric acid, and glutamate oxalacetate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, vitamin A and vitamin E, SH-groups and total (peroxil) radical-frapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP).
   Food consumption of animals exposed to 33.5 degrees C was strongly reduced in the 1st day (13.6 v. 161.6 g/day); a gradual increase until the end of the trial was then observed (98.8 v. 177.3 g/day). Rectal temperature rapidly increased and remained stable and higher than in the control groups all through the trial (P < 0.01). The major changes in the measurements of the heat stressed animals were a significant increase of the plasma level of vitamin E at days 6, 12, 24 (P < 0.05), and a significant reduction of the plasma concentration of SH-groups and TRAP (P < 0.05).
   The results suggest all impairment or overload of antioxidant systems after thermal stress, indicating a reduced resistance to biological and environmental stress factors. The results also indicate that some parameters of antioxidant systems can be used to select a significant stress indicator.

AB  - This evaluation was designed to review the condemnation rate of poultry meat as well as grossly detectable abnormalities and conditions (GDACs) encountered in German poultry slaughter houses from 2002 to 2017 to determine which findings could indicate retrospective health conditions of live poultry. Modern chicken breeds for fattening are selected especially for fast growing and an optimal feed conversion together with a high proportion of the most valuable breast meat. In contrast, breeds for laying hens are selected for maximal egg production and less muscle volume. However, the unidirectional genetic selection focused to a higher muscle/bone-relation or maximal laying productivity has created (in connection with modern animal husbandry) breeds which are very sensitive for specific diseases and syndromes if their environment, feed and management is imbalanced. The evaluation of German meat inspection data concerning the overall condemnation rate from 2002 to 2006/2017 and GDACs from 2002 to 2017 indicates an almost constant rate both for the condemnation and the GDACs of broilers, laying hens and turkeys. The overall condemnation rate for broiler oscillates between 1 and 2% with falling tendency until 2014 and since then an increase for 2017 to 2.8%. For laying hens the portion of meat condemned amounts for an average rate of approximately 3.6%. The condemnation rate for turkey meat varies between 0.8 and 1.4% with a slight increase of condemnation since 2015. Although GDACs are created for food hygiene purposes, many of them like ascites, dermatitis and leg irritations arise undoubtful from animal health and animal welfare conditions. These findings together with the GDACs like hematoma, bruises, and breast blister were selected to indicate health conditions of live poultry. According to the evaluation of existing meat inspection for the last two decades the overall condemnation rate and most GDACs remained on the same level and could not prove a progress in an enhanced health status of poultry. Although the current scope of meat inspection performance is primarily to safeguard consumer health, a thorough evaluation of suitable findings and performance indicators associated with animal health and welfare would complement future meat inspection outcome.

AB  - The increasing accumulation of zinc (Zn) in agricultural soils has led to the need to assess the potential risk of this element for terrestrial organisms. However, the soil ecological criteria in agricultural soil as a function of soil properties have been sparsely reported. In the present study, we derived the ecological criteria (expressed as predicted no effect concentration (PNEC)) for Zn in soils, based on ecotoxicity data for 19 terrestrial species in Chinese soils, the effect of soil properties on Zn ecotoxicity, differences in species sensitivity, and differences between laboratory and realistic field conditions. First, all ecotoxicity data of Zn for terrestrial organisms in Chinese soils were collected and filtered with given criteria to obtain reliable database. Second, the ecotoxicity data were normalized using Zn ecotoxicity predictive models to eliminate the effect of soil properties on Zn ecotoxicity, and corrected with leaching and aging factors to minimize the differences in Zn ecotoxicity under laboratory and field conditions. Then, species sensitivity distribution (SSD) curves were generated with a Burr III function based on corrected ecotoxicity data. The concentration of Zn in soil that provides ecological safety for (100 - x)% of species (HCx), was calculated from the SSD curve and HC5 was used for estimation of PNEC. Finally, we developed the predictive models for HCx by quantifying the relationship between the Zn HCx and soil properties. Results showed that soil pH was the most crucial factor affecting Zn HCx values, with HC5 values varying from 38.3 mg/kg in an acidic soil to 263.3 mg/kg in an alkaline calcareous soil. Both the two-factor (soil pH and OC) and the three-factor (soil pH, OC and CEC) models predicted HCx values well, with determination coefficients (R-2) of 0.941-0.959 and 0.978-0.982, respectively. This study provides a scientific and reliable basis for the improvement of ecological risk assessment and the establishment of soil environmental quality standards.

AB  - Mycorrhizal symbioses are considered indicators of ecosystem biodiversity. However, their diversity and relevance in arid and semi-arid ecosystems are poorly understood. This study addressed this subject, the main objective being to evaluate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) diversity and heterogeneity in a semi-arid region. Samples of bulk and rhizosphere soil and fine roots of Medicago truncatula were collected at four different sites with the same aridity index (6.1), in Bou-Hedma National Park, Tunisia, a semi-arid ecosystem. AMF taxa were assessed by 454- pyrosequencing and identified by BLAST matching of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) against the MaarjAM database, targeting AMF SSU rRNA gene diversity. Roots were the hotspots of AMF diversity (107 OTUs out of a total of 138). Of the 138 OTUs, 113 found correspondence in the MaarjAM database, with 32 AMF virtual taxa (VTX), 19 Site-exclusive (SE) and 13 common to at least two sites (Non-site exclusive, NSE); the remaining 25 OTUs grouped in 16 putative new AMF taxa (pNTX), each one consisting of OTUs sharing pairwise distances not higher than 3%. We found a high diversity and heterogeneity of AMF across the four sites, which showed, in a regression analysis, significant relation to six out of the eight environmental parameters evaluated: grazing activity and soil texture, electrical conductivity, organic matter, total phosphorus and total nitrogen. AMF colonization of plants also presented significant differences among the four sites, as well as spore density, microbial biomass and several enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase and phosphatase) evaluated in rhizosphere soils. The four sites clustered in two groups in a hierarchical clustering evaluation based on their AMF diversity (total numbers of OTU, VTX and pNTX) and the parameters referred above. The crucial role of abiotic factors, other than aridity index, on AMF community composition, was evidenced by the high heterogeneity found between AMF communities across sites under identical aridity conditions.

AB  - The biodiversity response to climate change is a major focus in conservation research and policy. Predictive models that are used to project the impact of climate change scenarios - such as bioclimatic envelope models - are widely applied and have come under severe scrutiny. Criticisms of such models have focussed on at least two problems. First, there is an assumption that climate is the primary driver of observed species distributions ('climatic equilibrium'), when other biogeographical controls are often reliably established. Second, a species' sensitivity to macroclimate may become less relevant when impacts are down-scaled to a local level, incorporating a modifying effect of species interactions structuring communities. This article examines the role of different drivers (climate, pollution and landscape habitat structure) in explaining spatial community variation for a widely applied bioindicator group: lichen epiphytes. To provide an analysis free of 'legacy effects' (e. g. formerly higher pollution loads), the study focused on hazel stems as a relatively short-lived and recently colonized substratum. For communities during the present day, climate is shown to interact with stem size/age as the most likely explanation of community composition, thus coupling a macroclimatic and community-scale effect. The position of present-day communities was projected into ordination space for eight sites in England and compared to the position of historical epiphyte communities from the same sites, reconstructed using preserved hazel wattles dating mainly to the 16th Century. This comparison of community structure for the late-to post-Mediaeval period, with the post-Industrial period, demonstrated a consistent shift among independent sites towards warmer and drier conditions, concurrent with the end of the Little Ice Age. Long-term temporal sensitivity of epiphyte communities to climate variation thus complements spatial community patterns. If more widely applied, preserved lichen epiphytes have potential to generate new baseline conditions of environment and biodiversity for preindustrial lowland Europe.

AB  - Airborne hyperspectral remote observations, characterized by high spatial and spectral resolution, allow the estimation of quantitative vegetation variables useful in forest condition assessment. In this research, total chlorophyll (a + b) concentration (Cab), a biochemical variable describing crown discoloration rate, was mapped to assess oak (Quercus robur L.) condition in the Ticino Regional Park. A simulation experiment was conducted to evaluate the error in Cab estimation due to ecological variables (i.e. canopy leaf area index and understorey characteristics) and to sun-sensor configurations when optical indices are used. Canopy reflectance was simulated by means of the PROSPECT leaf radiative transfer model (Jacquemoud and Baret 1990) coupled with the SAILH canopy radiative transfer model, a variation of the SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) model modified to include the hot spot effect (Verhoef 1984, Kuusk 1991). The vegetation was modelled as a two layer medium with oak canopy as the top layer and the understorey as the bottom layer. Simulations were performed for varying leaf Cab and canopy Leaf Area Index (LAI) of the top layer, l (mean leaf inclination angle) and LAI of the bottom layer (LAIu) and sun-sensor geometry. Optical indices were calculated and used in Cab retrieval. Simulations demonstrated that errors in Cab estimation were negligible when MTCI (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index) was used, thus indicating that MTCI was the most reliable index in mapping Cab in this forest environment. Empirical models based on optical indices were developed to map Cab from Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) images acquired by an airborne survey on the Park forested area. A regression analysis between Cab concentration measured in leaves sampled in field and optical indices computed from hyperspectral MIVIS data was conducted. The MTCI index showed the highest performances and was therefore used to map Cab concentration of the Ticino Park oak forest. The Cab map was then used to assess crown discoloration level.

AB  - Key indicators of pro-/antioxidant status were studied in leaves of Plantago media L. (C-3 species) and Hylotelephium triphyllum (Haw.) Holub (facultative CAM species) grown in the unclosed floodplain meadow biogeocenosis in the middle taiga subzone of the Komi Republic (European Northeast of Russia). During the period of reproductive development, the average content of lipid peroxidation products in leaves of H. triphyllum was 400 nmol/g dry wt, which was 1.2 times higher than in P. media leaves. The content of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in leaves of H. triphyllum reached the level of 90 mu mol/g dry wt while it did not exceed 25 mu mol/g dry wt in P. media. Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in leaves of H. triphyllum ranged between 50 and 80 unit/mg protein, which was 2-3 times higher than in the leaves of P. media. The treatment of H. triphyllum leaves with an oxidative stress inducer methyl viologen (10 mu M) increased SOD activity by 1.6 times but had no significant influence on H2O2 content and the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products. Thus, H. triphyllum leaves were characterized by a higher pro-/antioxidant status than the leaves of a C3P. media plant grown under identical environmental conditions; this elevated status was due to the operation of CAM photosynthesis in H. triphyllum leaves. The transition of H. triphyllum to CAM photosynthesis during reproductive development is indicated by previously revealed regular diurnal changes in cell sap acidity, malate content, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity. The results are consistent with the notion that an increased pro-/antioxidant status is a general feature of CAM plant metabolism, while the consistently high H2O2 content provides evidence for the involvement of H2O2 in regulation of crassulacean acid metabolism.

AB  - Objectives: We followed the long-term changes of softwood floodplain forests strongly altered by water regime changes and examine the behaviour of neophytes in this environment. Here we ask: (1) How did the composition of neophyte and native species change? (2) How did the presence of species that prefer wetter conditions change? (3) What traditionally distinguished type of softwood floodplain forests (a wetter one or a more mesophilous one) do neophytes prefer? (4) What environmental factors affect the native species richness and the occurrence and cover of neophytes? Materials and Methods: Historical and recent phytosociological releves of the association Salicetum albae of the Slovak part of the inland delta of the Danube River were used (177 plots together). For each plot, the number and cover of neophytes and number of native species were measured, and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, the stand structure (cover of tree, shrub and herb layer) and the mean of Ellenberg indicator values were calculated and compared among time periods. Temporal trends of the soil moisture characterized by indicator values calculated for each plot were determined using a Linear Model. The synoptic table of traditional vegetation types was done to show preferences of neophytes for particular softwood forest types. The effect of site conditions on native species richness and occurrence of neophytes was determined using the Generalized Linear Model. Results: The relative number and cover of neophyte species increased and the absolute number of native species decreased over time; the vegetation of the area has changed from variable hygrophilous and mesophilous to homogenised mesophilous; most non-native species prefer the mesophilous vegetation of the floodplain forests; the wetter parts of the floodplain more successfully resisted invasions. Conclusions: The vegetation of the researched area has considerably changed over time to become less diverse and less hygrophilous, and has more invasive species. To preserve floodplain forests, natural hydrological and connectivity patterns should be adequately protected.

AB  - Forest canopy cover and carbon density are two pivotal biophysical parameters for assessing urban forest structure and its ecosystem services. While canopy cover (horizontal structure) has been extensively studied for understanding the relationship between socio-ecological dynamics and urban forests, carbon density (vertical structure) received little attention in the urban setting. The goal of this study was twofold: (i) exploring the differences between canopy cover and carbon density, and their relationships with socio-ecological factors across an urbanizing landscape, and (ii) assessing the effect of neighborhood category (i.e., low, medium and high development intensity) on the relationships at the neighborhood level. We used Mecklenburg County located in the Charlotte Metropolitan area of North Carolina, United States as a case study area, where rapid urban sprawl has fragmented the pine-oak-hickory dominated forests into a range of low to high housing density neighborhoods. We observed two major findings. First, canopy cover and carbon density demonstrated a generally weak correlation across various types of residential neighborhoods, although such relationship became relatively stronger in areas featuring a higher level of development intensity. Second, ecological factors (e.g., landscape spatial patterns) were found to dominate the statistical models explaining the variance in both canopy cover and carbon density compared to urban socioeconomic factors (e.g., income and age). However, the models and the explanatory factors were different for the two forest parameters, and they varied across neighborhoods of diverse development intensities. Based upon these findings, we argue that canopy cover and carbon density are different proxy indicators of forest functioning in the urban setting, and should be independently treated in urban forest management. The best management practices should be developed at the inner-city, neighborhood level, rather than the typical city level, owing to the significant, variable influence of socio-ecological conditions across neighborhood types.

AB  - Flower cultivation in greenhouses enhances productivity and ensures high-quality product supply throughout the year. However, under such protected environments, climate conditions are designed to favor flower growth and can intensify occupational exposure to pesticides. In this study, flower greenhouse workers were tested for cholinesterase inhibition, a valuable indicator of occupational exposure to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. The quantified inhibition was also associated with working practices using these outcomes to explore ways in which provisions of regulatory Occupational Health Control Programs can be met considering the peculiarities ofthis working environment. Despite their preliminary nature, and considering that workers had not been previously tested, the obtained results suggested that the designed pre-and post-screening process, enabled biomonitoring of the exposed population. The pre-exposure sample was collected after 11 days from pesticide spraying and the post-exposure sample was collected no later than 10 days after pesticide spraying. AChE activity was significantly depressed in flower greenhouse workers, comparing pre-and post-exposure intervals. Nursery workers, often overlooked, presented greater inhibition ofAChE activity. Such finding is consistent with effects believed to be associated with the described job and the way activities are conducted, once nursery workers are regularly exposed to low levels of pesticides owing to their continuous contact with sprayed crops. As predicted by Occupational Safety and Health Standards, establishing biomonitoring programs is achievable, despite the intensive use of pesticides. Quantification is important to target the exposed population but is not sufficient to assure good working conditions and avoid exposure. Administrative and working practices, such as job misclassification, non-compliance with national regulations for occupational health control, pesticide handling, lack of REI protocols, and unsuitable delivery of PPE, must be addressed. Anything less will contribute to worsening an already bleak picture in terms ofoccupational safety and health in flower and ornamental plant greenhouses. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Discharge event frequency, magnitude and duration all control river channel morphology and sedimentary architecture. Uncertainty persists as to whether alluvial deposits in the rock record are a time-averaged amalgam from all discharge events, or a biased record of larger events. This paper investigates the controls on channel deposit character and subsurface stratigraphic architecture in a river with seasonal discharge and very high inter-annual variability, the Burdekin River of north-east Australia. In such rivers, most sediment movement is restricted to a few days each year and at other times little sediment moves. However, the maximum discharge magnitude does not directly correlate with the amount of morphological change and some big events do not produce large deposits. The Burdekin channel deposits consist of five main depositional elements: (i) unit bars; (ii) vegetation-generated bars; (iii) gravel sheets and lags; (iv) antidune trains; and (v) sand sheets. The proportions of each depositional element preserved in the deposits depend on the history of successive large discharge events, their duration and the rate at which they wane. Events with similar peak magnitude but different rate of decline preserve different event deposits. The high intra-annual and inter-annual discharge variability and rapid rate of stage change make it likely that small to moderate-scale bed morphology will be in disequilibrium with flow conditions most of the time. Consequently, dune and unit bar size and cross-bed set thickness are not good indicators of event or channel size. Antidunes may be more useful as indicators of flow conditions at the time they formed. Rivers with very high coefficient of variance of maximum discharge, such as the Burdekin, form distinctive channel sediment bodies. However, the component parts are such that, if they are examined in isolation, they could lead to misleading interpretation of the nature of the depositional environment if conventional interpretations are used.

AB  - The operation of dam and reservoirs is one of the main reasons for the transformation of river runoff. The change in the hydrological regime affects a number of other processes taking place in the river channel, including the transformation of its geomorphological features. The article presents the impact of the Wloclawek Reservoir on the hydrological regime of the lower Vistula. The alterations of the river flow downstream of the dam in the conditions of the hydropeaking regime of hydroelectric plant operation and alter its change to the run-of-river and interventional operation were characterised. It was assessed how the change in flow conditions in connection with the deficit of sediments affected the transformation of the Vistula river channel downstream of the dam. The nature and magnitude of changes in the Vistula river flow regime caused by the functioning of the "Wloclawek" dam were determined using IHA (Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration) and the RVA (The Range of Variability Approach) method. It was demonstrated that the operation of the hydroelectric power plant in the hydropeaking system is the cause of a large flow alteration in respect of the frequency and duration of low- and high-flow pulses and the rate and frequency of change in the flow. The change in the manner of operation of the hydroelectric power plant affected the reduction in the degree of transformation of most features orate flow. The increase in water erosion force downstream of the dam led to the deepening and narrowing of the river channel. The presence of more resistant formations at the bottom of the river channel inhibited riverbed erosion, at the same time intensifying lateral erosion, which increased the width of the river channel. During the operation of the reservoir, the river channel downstream of the dam evolved towards the anabranching type system. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The dry cooling unit is integrated with a 25 MW recompression super-critical CO2 (sCO(2)) cycle for solar energy application. Based on the optimal operating condition, a natural draft dry cooling tower (NDDCT) is modelled for an ambient temperature of 20 degrees C and sCO(2) inlet condition of 67 degrees C and 7.96 MPa. The Kroger's detailed working principle of NDDCT is adapted in the simulation processes. The sCO(2) property variation with the change of bulk temperature is considered while modelling the heat exchanger unit inside the tower. The draft equation of the tower is solved by including various air-flow resistances at different parts of the tower. The heat input to the cycle is assumed to be supplied by the solar field with sufficient capacity of thermal storage. The seasonal effect on the performance of a dry-cooled sCO(2) recompression cycle is performed in Alice Spring, NT, Australia by using the daily meteorological data. The daily net power generation fluctuates in the range of 2.4% to 22.4% of the design value for the consecutive days. The year-round mean net power generation is 24.66 MW which corresponds to 50.9% cycle efficiency. The weekly and monthly seasonal variation of the plant performance in summer, autumn, winter, and spring is performed based on the mean maximum and minimum temperature data. The mean net power produced in summer and winter is 22.9 MW and 26.4 MW respectively. The fluctuation of heat input to the cycle, heat rejected by the cycle and air mass flow rate in NDDCT are demonstrated. Seven performance indicators (Thermal efficiency, exergetic performance criteria, exergy efficiency, maximum available work, ecological coefficient of performance, cooling efficiency, and ecological function criteria) are determined to evaluate the plant performance for the period of 1941 to 2018 using the mean temperature data.

AB  - A long-term study on a benthic community was conducted in two different localities, one in semi enclosed bay of Jinhae (n = 10, south coast) and the other in open sea area of Samcheok (n = 10, east coast), Korea, respectively. We aimed to identify the spatiotemporal patterns of macrozoobenthos and the environmental variables influencing such patterns in the two contrasting habitats. The macrozoobenthos assemblages on the soft bottom of the subtidal zone were analyzed over the 3 years, encompassing 12 consecutive seasons, in 2013-2016. Among the 22 environmental variables measured, organic matter, dissolved oxygen, mean grain size, and water depth showed clear differences between two study areas. Accordingly, several ecological indices (such as the number of species, abundance, dominant species, and diversity index (H')) generally reflected site-specific benthic conditions. The macrofaunal community in the Jinhae showed typical seasonal fluctuations, whereas the Samcheok community showed no significant change over time and space. Region- or site-dependent temporal variabilities of macrofaunal assemblages are depicted through cluster analysis (CA), indicating distinct temporal changes in the composition of dominant species. In particular, the abundance of some dominant species noticeably declined in certain seasons when several opportunistic species peaked. Such faunal succession might be explained by significant changes to specific environmental factors, such as bottom dissolved oxygen, grain size, and water depth. Principle component analysis further identified major environmental factors, i.e., sediment properties in Jinhae and water quality parameters in Samcheok community, respectively. In addition, discriminant analysis confirmed the presence of several site specific parameters for the faunal assemblage groups identified through CA. Finally, indicator value analysis identified species that were representative across stations and regions in accordance with their habitat preference and/or species tolerance. Overall, the two contrasting nearshore habitats showed distinct community differences, in time and space, that were influenced by site-dependent environmental conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The relationship between impervious land cover and tree development is an important component to understanding urban ecological systems. While impervious surfaces are associated with degraded soil conditions, rerouted hydrological networks and urban microclimates, the overall impact of these effects on tree development is highly variable. This study examines this relationship at two spatial scales: within the individual tree's local environment and across the broad-scale urban landscape. Using a fusion of airborne hyperspectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, a 1.0 m spatial resolution classified land cover map (accuracy of 88.6%) was produced for the city of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, from which landscape imperviousness was then derived. The stem heights of 1914 trees were estimated from the LiDAR data, to which species-specific height models were fit using planting dates recorded by city authorities. Having accounted for the age of the trees, the residuals from these models (i.e.: the difference between modelled and measured height) were then used as indicators of tree development. When aggregated to 0.5 km(2) spatial units, negative relationships (r(2) between 0.292 and 0.753) were found between height model residuals and the degree of land cover imperviousness. These relationships did not persist when examined at the individual tree level, for which imperviousness was measured within the direct vicinity of each tree using the same imperviousness map. We conclude that, using this approach, imperviousness does not appear to be a significant driver of tree height variation, with broad-scale relationships likely due to correlations with other environmental variables associated with the urban-rural gradient. Despite some limitations, the integration of hyperspectral and LiDAR data proved to be a powerful tool for mapping imperviousness, with LiDAR metrics being particularly important for distinguishing between types of urban land cover.

AB  - Upland headwater streams are dynamic systems, responding rapidly to changes in climatic conditions. This study examined the effects of a catastrophic rainfall event, that occured on 24 October 2011 on the east coast of Ireland, on the macroinvertebrate community composition and structure of four headwater streams in the river Liffey catchment located in the Wicklow Mountains. The ecological status before and after the storm were also evaluated. The water level and pH of each stream were recorded using continuous monitoring equipment, while rainfall data for the study period were sourced from a local weather station. Benthic macroinvertebrates were investigated before and after the storm event using Surber sampling. Results showed rapid and large increases in water level and significant declines in stream pH in response to intensive rainfall during the storm. The high water levels also caused major physical damage and abrasion in all four streams, that significantly altered instream habitats. The storm event induced significant losses to the richness and/or density of most taxonomic groups, with the exception of the Plecoptera. Furthermore, the overall community composition and structure changed significantly, most likely as a result of physical disturbance, given the relative persistence of acid-sensitive taxa and the relatively short period of harsh acidic conditions (<5 pH). Interestingly however, the ecological status of each of the four study sites, tested using the Small Stream Risk Score (SSRS), the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) and the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) indices, was unaltered by the loss in richness and densities. This was likely a result of the maintenance of plecopteran richness and the absence of organic pollution, thus highlighting the need to develop appropriate indices to assess the ecological status of streams and rivers affected by physical disturbance caused by large storm events. Ultimately, catastrophic storm events in upland headwater streams have potentially major implications for the maintanence of regional macroinvertebrate diversity within affected regions.

AB  - A multidisciplinary study has been carried out on the Late Miocene (Messinian) Caleare di Base Formation in northern Calabria, Italy, with the aim of understanding the depositional conditions of these enigmatic carbonate sediments that have been interpreted as evaporitic or diagenetic limestone. The research has been developed through sedimentological (microfacies), organic petrography and geochemical analyses (palynofacies, Rock-Eval pyrolysis and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry). The carbonates studied preserve their original mineralogy (aragonite) and microstructure.
   The prevailing microfacies consists of clotted peloidal micrite with antigravitative fabric. Larger and darker cylindrical-subcylindrical micritic grains, attributable to faceal pellets, are more or less randomly dispersed in the peloidal micrite. The faecal pellets have been ascribed to copepods because zooclasts of these arthropods were observed in the palynofacies. Bright epifluorescence characterizes the faecal pellets and peloidal micrite, indicating their high content of organic matter. Detrital and stromatolitic rnicrofacies occur rarely (around a few percent). The detrital microfacies is characterized by silt-sized grains organized in thin, sometimes bioturbated, graded laminae. The stromatolitic microfacies shows planar to gently curved/wrinkled laminae organized in dark and light couplets.
   The associated sedimentary organic matter shows low maturity, and preserves the original signatures of the source organisms. Rock-Eval pyrolysis revealed a transitional composition between Type II and Type III kerogen, suggesting a mixture of marine and terrigenous organic matter input. The molecular biogeochemical data indicate three main biological signatures: algae, bacteria and higher plants. Organic markers together with sedimentary evidence indicate a marine depositional scenario influenced by freshwater input rather than evaporitic concentration.
   We conclude that the most probable bacterial process involved in carbonate precipitation of the Caleare di Base, considering the freshwater input and consequent probable enrichment in organic matter and Ca2+ ions, is ammonification of amino-acids in aerobic conditions.

AB  - Pleistocene vegetation history on the Chinese Loess Plateau has been traditionally investigated using palynological methods, and questions remain regarding whether an extensive broadleaf deciduous forest ever developed on the loess table under favorable climatic conditions. The authors have employed a C isotope approach to address this question by comparing delta(13)C values in soil organic matter from different loess ecological domains with known source vegetation to the C isotope values obtained from a paleosol section that can be dated back to 130 ka. The C isotopic compositions of modern soils from the loess table and the loess-desert transition gave delta(13)C values of -24.5parts per thousand to -18.2parts per thousand and -25.7parts per thousand to -20.7parts per thousand, respectively. These C isotopic ratios are consistent with the standing modern vegetation that is dominated by a mixture of C-3 and C-4 plants and can be distinguished from that in the patchy forest areas where exclusive C-3 trees yield a narrow delta(13)C value range from -26.9parts per thousand to -25parts per thousand (average -26.1parts per thousand). Obtained delta(13)C compositions from paleosols and loess sediments in the Lantian and the Luochuan profiles vary from -24parts per thousand to -16.9parts per thousand, indicating a grass-dominated steppe with shifting C-3 and C-4 contributions controlled mainly by paleoclimatic changes during the late Pleistocene. The present results suggest no extensive forest coverage on the loess table during the past 130 ka even under the most suitable conditions for forest development. This conclusion supports the explanation of natural causes for the development of only patchy forests on the modern loess table and provides critical historical information toward the vegetation restoration project that is currently underway on the Chinese Loess Plateau.

AB  - Inappropriate land use practices, pollutants, exploitation, and overpopulation have simplified stream habitats and degraded water quality worldwide. Management agencies are now being tasked to ameliorate impacts and restore stream "health," yet there is a dearth of rigorous scientific methods and theory on which to base sound restoration design and monitoring. Despite this, many localized restoration projects are being constructed to stabilize erosion and enhance habitat heterogeneity in streams. Many restoration attempts adopt the paradigm that increasing habitat heterogeneity will lead to restoration of biotic diversity, yet there have been few studies that have manipulated variation of a physical parameter independent of the mean to isolate the effects of heterogeneity per se. We conducted a field experiment to mimic restoration of habitat heterogeneity in a shallow. stony stream. By using an experimental approach rather than a detailed assessment of existing restoration work, we were able to control the starting conditions of replicate riffles so that organism responses could be unambiguously attributed to the heterogeneity treatments. We successfully manipulated the variability of streambed particle sizes and consequently near-bed flow characteristics of entire riffles. These factors define axes of habitat heterogeneity at scales relevant to the resident macro invertebrate fauna. Despite this, we were unable to distinguish differences in community structure between high and low habitat heterogeneity treatments. Power analysis indicated that macroinvertebrate populations were more sensitive to individual site conditions at each riffle than to the heterogeneity treatments, suggesting that increasing habitat heterogeneity may be an ineffective technique if the restoration goals are to promote macroinvertebrate recovery in denuded streams. With extremely high variability between replicate riffles, monitoring programs for localized restoration projects or point source impacts are unlikely to detect gradual shifts in community structure until the differences between the reference and treatment sites are extreme. Innovative measurement of other parameters, such as ecosystem function variables (e.g., production, respiration, decomposition), may be more appropriate indicators of change at local scales.

AB  - The welfare of sheep transported by sea is a pertinent issue for Australia's agriculture industry and a subject of concern amongst the general public. Evaluating the effect of sea transport on the welfare of livestock requires an accurate system of reporting. This study piloted an animal welfare monitoring protocol during two sea voyages from Australia to the Middle East. Sheep health and behaviour were analysed to determine if the protocol could detect animal responses to voyage conditions such as feeding management and changes to the pen environment. Data were recorded for target pens of five different commercial lines of Merino sheep. Principle Components (PC) analysis on behavioural data identified three principal components which were compared with voyage day, management and environmental conditions using general linear mixed modelling (GLMM). PC factor 1 scores (23.35 % of total variance) showed that resting and recumbency increased as the voyage progressed. PC factor 2 scores (17.09 % variance) demonstrated that behavioural responses to heat fluctuated by voyage day. PC factor 3 scores (9.48 % variance) showed reduced flight distances and increasingly competitive feeding behaviour as the voyage progressed. Environment and management conditions were associated with behavioural changes, with Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) being the most influential measure affecting all three PC factors (p < 0.001). There were few diseases or symptoms of ill-health (including veterinary treatments) or mortalities recorded for sample pens; however, associations between ill-health and nutrition, environmental conditions and behaviour, were identified using GLMM. Increases in WBGT were linked to increased nasal discharge (p < 0.001), ocular discharge (p < 0.05), pink eye (p < 0.05) and Panting Score 4 (p < 0.01). With few recordings of ill-health, and a low mortality incidence, it was difficult to interpret the results of comparisons between health and behaviour. It is likely that associations between health indicators and behavioural variations will be more meaningful if a welfare monitoring protocol were applied to a larger sample size. The pen-side assessments presented in this study provided a practicable and comprehensive system for monitoring the behaviour and health of sheep during sea voyages. The application of such assessments on an industry basis could better inform all stakeholders about the welfare of sheep during sea transport.

AB  - Galactomannan (gum), a water-soluble polysaccharide, is widely used as a gelling agent in liquids, including in the oil and gas industry for hydraulic fracturing. The most effective source of this valuable plant material is seeds of guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.), a legume crop new for Russia. Although in recent years progress has been made in the selection of guar varieties adapted to the conditions of the Russian Federation, the question of the most appropriate region for the cultivation of this crop remains open. The purpose of the study was to investigate how a region and technology of guar cultivation can affect the main indicators of the final target product: the content and viscosity of guar gum extracted from the seeds of various guar genotypes. To understand this, ecogeographical tests of 13 guar accessions from the VIR collection were conducted at the experimental stations of the Vavilov Institute (VIR), where climatic conditions correspond to the temperature requirements of the crop. To compare the properties of gum extracted from the seeds of various genotypes, a fast-tracked laboratory method was suggested allowing gum extracts to be obtained for assessing their viscosity. The method allows fast screening of the breeding material and selecting guar genotypes with beneficial properties of guar gum which are in demand by the oil industry. Applying the fast laboratory method for assessing the properties of gum in seeds of 13 guar varieties showed that the content and viscosity of gum of the same variety vary greatly depending on growing conditions. The same set of 13 guar accessions was grown in 2018 at the Volgograd, Astrakhan, Dagestan and Kuban VIR experimental stations. As a result, the maximum viscosity values were obtained for the seeds reproduced at the Astrakhan region, where the guar was grown on irrigated lands. On the other hand, the maximum gum content in the seeds of all accessions was recorded when they were grown in the Volgograd region. The results showed that the guar gum extracted from seeds of guar plants grown in the Russian Federation can be used as a gelling agent in the processes of intensification of oil production by the method of hydraulic fracturing. This experience is new to the Russian Federation.

AB  - Management of semi-natural grasslands is essential to retain the characteristic diversity of flora and fauna found in these habitats. To maintain, restore or recreate favourable conditions for grassland species, knowledge regarding how they occur in relation to grazing intensity and soil nutrient availability is crucial. We focused on grassland plant species, i.e., species selected to indicate high natural values in semi-natural grasslands. Environmental monitoring data collected at 366 grassland sites in southern Sweden between 2006 and 2010 were used to relate the occurrence of indicator species to factors describing geographic location, local site conditions related to nutrients and moisture, and management. Site productivity, soil moisture and cover of trees and shrubs were the main structuring factors, while other factors related to management had a lesser effect (grass sward height, amount of litter, type of grazer). Not surprisingly, these patterns were also reflected in species-wise analyses of the 25 most commonly occurring indicator species, with almost all species negatively related to site productivity and most also to soil moisture. Furthermore, many species were negatively affected by increasing sward height and litter. In contrast, species-wise responses varied among species in relation to increasing cover of trees and shrubs. In comparison to cattle grazing, sheep grazing was detrimental to six species and beneficial to none, while horse grazing was detrimental to no species and beneficial to four species. When evaluating species traits, taller plant species were favoured when site productivity, grass sward height and the amount of grass litter were high. There were no strong patterns related to the flowering time, leaf arrangement, or nutrient and light requirements of species. These results highlight the importance of nutrient-poor and dry sites, e.g., when selecting sites for conservation, and the importance of the type of management executed.

AB  - The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) offers the coastal environmental monitoring community an unprecedented opportunity to observe changes in coastal and estuarine water quality across a range of spatial scales not feasible with traditional field-based monitoring or existing ocean colour satellites. HICO, an Office of Naval Research-sponsored programme, is the first space-based maritime hyperspectral imaging instrument designed specifically for the coastal ocean. HICO has been operating since September 2009 from the Japanese Experiment Module - Exposed Facility on the International Space Station (ISS). The high pixel resolution (approximately 95m at nadir) and hyperspectral imaging capability offer a unique opportunity for characterizing a wide range of water colour constituents that could be used to assess environmental condition. In this study, we transform atmospherically corrected ISS/HICO hyperspectral imagery and derive environmental response variables routinely used for evaluating the environmental condition of coastal ecosystem resources. Using atmospherically corrected HICO imagery and a comprehensive field validation programme, three regionally specific algorithms were developed to estimate basic water-quality properties traditionally measured by monitoring agencies. Results indicated that a three-band chlorophyll a algorithm performed best (R-2=0.62) when compared with in situ measurement data collected 2-4hours of HICO acquisitions. Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (R-2=0.93) and turbidity (R-2=0.67) were also highly correlated. The distributions of these water-quality indicators were mapped for four estuaries along the northwest coast of Florida from April 2010 to May 2012. However, before the HICO sensor can be transitioned from proof-of-concept to operational status and its data applied to benefit decisions made by coastal managers, problems with vicarious calibration of the sensor need to be resolved and standardized protocols are required for atmospheric correction. Ideally, the sensor should be placed on a polar orbiting platform for greater spatial and temporal coverage as well as for image synchronization with field validation efforts.

AB  - This study estimates the life cycle water consumption and wastewater generation impacts of a Marcellus shale gas well from its construction to end of life. Direct water consumption at the well site was assessed by analysis of data from approximately 500 individual well completion reports collected in 2010 by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Indirect water consumption for supply chain production at each life cycle stage of the well was estimated using the economic input-output life cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) method. Life cycle direct and indirect water quality pollution impacts were assessed and compared using the tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and other environmental impacts (TRACI). Wastewater treatment cost was proposed as an additional indicator for water quality pollution impacts from shale gas well wastewater. Four water management scenarios for Marcellus shale well wastewater were assessed: current conditions in Pennsylvania; complete discharge; direct reuse and desalination; and complete desalination. The results show that under the current conditions, an average Marcellus shale gas well consumes 20 000 m(3) (with a range from 6700 to 33 000 m(3)) of freshwater per well over its life cycle excluding final gas utilization, with 65% direct water consumption at the well site and 35% indirect water consumption across the supply chain production. If all flowback and produced water is released into the environment without treatment, direct wastewater from a Marcellus shale gas well is estimated to have 300-3000 kg N-eq eutrophication potential, 900-23 000 kg 2,4D-eq freshwater ecotoxicity potential, 0-370 kg benzene-eq carcinogenic potential, and 2800-71 000 MT toluene-eq noncarcinogenic potential. The potential toxicity of the chemicals in the wastewater from the well site exceeds those associated with supply chain production, except for carcinogenic effects. If all the Marcellus shale well wastewater is treated to surface discharge standards by desalination, $59 000-270 000 per well would be required. The life cycle study results indicate that when gas end use is not considered hydraulic fracturing is the largest contributor to the life cycle water impacts of a Marcellus shale gas well.

AB  - The article presents the results of a critical analysis of scientific positions on the interpretation of the content of capitalization, which were streamlined in the following approaches: process, resource, value, analytical, relational, cognitive. Based on the integration of various research aspects of the definition of capitalization, the authors logic of interpreting its managerial nature has been formed, which is disclosed on the basis of the interrelationship of the set of processes (turning the capabilities of the external environment into enterprise resources, activating resources, productive use of resources, turning cost flows into capital) and objects (organizational abilities, resources, assets), the priority impact on which ensures the growth of business value. The value aspects of capitalization are investigated on the basis of the fundamental value approach, which made it possible to determine systems of critical points and monitoring indicators that signal the state of capital management of enterprises. The results of the implementation of the proposed analytical model of capitalization in the practice of the engineering enterprises of Ukraine are presented. On the basis of assessments of critical points of the strategic level of analysis, the main reasons affecting the dynamics of changes in the value of the studied enterprises are determined. Taking into account the specifics of the development of the business environment in the modern conditions of activity of machine-building enterprises, it was concluded that the value level of capital formation depends on the level of intellectualization and digitalization of production. Within the framework of the new technological paradigm, it is appropriate to develop the machine-building production according to the principles of the Industry 4.0 concept. In accordance with it, changes in the transformation of the way business processes are organized into digital factories are updated, which leads to the acquisition by enterprises of such characteristics as: the rate of customization of reactions to market demands; digital certification; organization of activities on the principles of system engineering, etc.

AB  - In November 2015, the largest socio-environmental disaster in the history of Brazil occurred when approximately 50 million m(3) of mine tailings were released into the Doce River(SE Brazil), during the greatest failure of a tailings dam worldwide. The mine tailings passed through the Doce River basin, reaching the ecologically important estuary 17 days later. On the arrival of the mine wastes to the coastal area, contamination levels in the estuarine soils were measured to determine the base line level of contamination and to enable an environmental risk assessment. Soil and tailings samples were collected and analyzed to determine the redox potential(Eh), pH, grain size and mineralogical composition, total metal contents(Fe, Mn, Cr, Zn, Ni, Cu, Pb and Co) and organic matter content. The metals were fractionated to elucidate the mechanisms governing the trace metal dynamics. The mine tailings are mostly composed of Fe(mean values for Fe: 45,200 +/- 2850; Mn: 433 +/- 110; Cr: 63.9 +/- 15.1; Zn: 62.4 +/- 28.4; Ni: 24.7 +/- 10.4; Cu: 21.3 +/- 4.6; Pb: 20.2 +/- 4.6 and Co: 10.7 +/- 4.8 mg kg(-1)), consisting of Fe oxyhydroxides (goethite, hematite); kaolinite and quartz. The metal contents of the estuarine soils, especially the surface layers, indicate trace metal enrichment caused by the tailings. However, the metal contents were below threshold levels reported in Brazilian environmental legislation. Despite the fact that only a small fraction (<2%) of the metals identified are readily bioavailable (i.e. soluble and exchangeable fraction), trace metals associated with Fe oxyhydroxides contributed between 69.8 and 87.6% of the total contents. Control of the trace metal dynamics by Fe oxyhydroxides can be ephemeral, especially in wetland soils in which the redox conditions oscillate widely. Indeed, the physicochemical conditions(Eh < 100 mV and circumneutral pH) of estuarine soils favor Fe reduction microbial pathways, which will probably increase the trace metal bioavailability and contamination risk.

AB  - QuestionsLivestock grazing and abiotic environmental factors both shape grassland systems; however, the relative importance of their impacts on plant species composition and soil fertility has rarely been investigated. Focusing on Tibetan grasslands, which are of global ecological importance and exhibit broad climatic and elevational gradients, we asked whether grazing effects are pronounced in humid regions, while climate controls are overriding grazing effects in semi-arid regions.
   LocationTwenty-eight sites across Tibetan pastures, China; 2820-5150m a.s.l.
   MethodsWe used multivariate analyses and generalized linear mixed models to examine the effects of livestock activity (hotspots with excessive trampling and nutrient input, heavy, moderate and light grazing), habitat (meadow, steppe, steppe-meadow) and their interactions. We focused on plant species composition, richness and concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC), total N and other plant-available nutrients in soils. Major environmental factors were precipitation, temperature and elevation. Plant indicator species sensitive to trampling and/or grazing were identified.
   ResultsLivestock grazing changed plant species composition and overall soil fertility across habitats. However, effects were only pronounced in hotspots directly adjacent to herder camps, while differences between grazing intensity levels were weak. Heavy grazing favoured annual species, reduced concentrations of SOC and total N in meadows. The environmental factors that control plant communities and soil condition varied among habitats. Plants and soils were more tightly linked in steppes and steppe-meadows than in meadows.
   ConclusionsSeveral plant species were identified as frequently and reliably present in hotspots of livestock activity, thus are indicative of intensive trampling and excess plant available nutrient inputs. Overall, plant species composition and soil condition across Tibetan pastures were weakly affected by intensified grazing alone compared to that shaped by environmental factors. This clearly refutes the broadly held perception that increased grazing intensity leads to grassland degradation. Such differing and strong abiotic impacts should be considered in future grassland management and conservation.

AB  - Land degradation, a current environmental threat of global proportions, is a complex issue which needs an interdisciplinary approach in order to tackle a given territory's sensitivity to the process. This study aims to spatially analyse the land degradation sensitivity in south-western Romania, a region currently known for this type of environmental deterioration. The analysis is based on mapping and assessing land susceptibility to degradation by means of a multifactorial approach using GIS techniques, such as the well-established MEDALUS (Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use) method. Widely used in the Mediterranean region and other areas worldwide due to advantageous features such as simplicity, flexibility and rapid implementation, the method was used in this study for the analysis of the main indicators identified to be driving forces of land degradation, i.e. Climate Quality Index, Soil Quality Index, Vegetation Quality Index and Management Quality Index The paper aims to adjust the method in relation to local conditions by considering certain additional variables (sub-indicators) for computing the main indicators, as well as by integrating a new regionally relevant indicator for this environmental issue Water Quality Index. The final results, assessed with the proposed Land Degradation Sensitivity Index (based on 21 sub-indicators, of which 15 are included in the original MEDALUS method, and 6 are additional), showed that approximately 70% of the total study area is critically sensitive to degradation, mainly due to high agricultural pressures and very low vegetation cover. Surprisingly, in terms of administration, it was found that >80% of the region's territorial administrative units include sectors which are critically exposed to degradation that exceed half their area. The results can constitute a basic support for regional-level decision makers who can implement the appropriate measures in order to attenuate the restrictive environmental conditions.

AB  - Vegetation cover is a commonly used indicator to evaluate terrestrial environmental conditions. Changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation alter the structures and functions of the landscape, thereby affecting ecological processes. Hilly southern China is an important ecological restoration area, in which the vegetation cover and land use has changed significantly. However, very few studies have considered vegetation changes due to multiple factors in this region. We investigated the spatiotemporal variations in vegetation cover using a Normal Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data set obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and climate data from 2000 to 2010. Our results indicate that the NDVI during the growing season had increased by 0.03% during the 11-year period. Patterns of change in vegetation cover differed among locations, with 58.7% of the study area displaying increased NDVI values, and in 7.3% of the study area, within an ecological restoration zone, the increase was significant. Effective ecological restoration programs, such as Grain for Green and hill closure for afforestation, have improved the environmental conditions. The spatiotemporal variations in vegetation cover were likely to be a synergistic impact of climate change (fluctuations in temperature and precipitation) and human activities. A residual analysis of the changes in the NDVI indicated that human activities had either improved or degraded vegetation cover in some parts of southern China. Specifically, the negative effects of extreme weather events in 2009 and 2010 offset the positive benefits of ecological reconstruction programs in the western part of the study area. This indicates that extreme weather events should be considered in the design and planning of future ecological reconstruction. Drought-resistant plant species might be considered for future ecological projects. However, an eco-risk assessment should be conducted when introducing drought-resistant plant species.

AB  - Rainfed rice ecosystems account for more than 80% of the total rice area in sub-Saharan Africa, and large parts of this region frequently experience drought stress. One potential approach to improve the drought resistance and local adaptation of high-yielding rice varieties in rainfed regions of sub-Saharan Africa is to cross them with the African rice species Oryza glaberrima. In this study, 200 introgression lines (ILs) from crosses of O. sativa (IR64) and O. glaberrima (RAM90 and RAM54) were evaluated in three field experiments under different rainfed drought scenarios in Tanzania and the Philippines. The objectives of the study were to select ILs for yield and traits associated with drought resistance, and to analyze the genetic variation in water uptake, root growth, and drought response that were observed among the ILs in a previous greenhouse lysimeter study. Several ILs showed improved yield under drought stress and well-watered conditions compared with the recurrent parent IR64. One cluster of ILs that showed the highest yield across all environments included genotypes with the lowest canopy temperature under drought. In 10 selected ILs, root length density was negatively correlated with canopy temperature and soil moisture, and positively related to shoot biomass, but not significantly correlated with grain yield under drought. Although root growth in the field correlated well with root growth in the previous lysimeter study, only some of the highest-yielding lines under drought in the field were those that showed more water uptake in lysimeters. These results confirm the complex relationship among grain yield, root growth, and additional physiological mechanisms underlying crop growth and productivity in the field. The high-yielding ILs under both drought and well-watered conditions in this study can be used as donors to improve drought resistance in target rainfed rice environments in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Changes in traditional agricultural systems in Europe in recent decades have led to widespread abandonment and colonization of various habitats by shrubs and trees. We combined several vegetation databases to test whether patterns of changes in plant diversity after land abandonment in different habitats followed similar pathways. The impacts of land abandonment and subsequent woody colonization on vegetation composition and plant traits were studied in five semi-natural open habitats and two arable habitats in six regions of Europe. For each habitat, vegetation surveys were carried out in different stages of succession using either permanent or non-permanent plots. Consecutive stages of succession were defined on a physiognomic basis from initial open stages to late woody stages. Changes in vegetation composition, species richness, numbers of species on Red Lists, plant strategy types, Ellenberg indicator values of the vegetation, Grime CSR strategy types and seven ecological traits were assessed for each stage of the successional pathway. Abandonment of agro-pastoral land-use and subsequent woody colonization were associated with changes in floristic composition. Plant richness varied according to the different habitats and stages of succession, but semi-natural habitats differed from arable fields in several ecological traits and vegetation responses. Nevertheless, succession occurred along broadly predictable pathways. Vegetation in abandoned arable fields was characterized by a decreasing importance of R-strategists, annuals, seed plants with overwintering green leaves, insect-pollinated plants with hemi-rosette morphology and plants thriving in nutrient-rich conditions, but an increase in species considered as endangered according to the Red Lists. Conversely, changes in plant traits with succession within the initially-open semi-natural habitats showed an increase in plants thriving in nutrient-rich conditions, stress-tolerant plants and plants with sexual and vegetative reproduction, but a sharp decrease in protected species. In conclusion, our study showed a set of similarities in responses of the vegetation in plant traits after land abandonment, but we also highlighted differences between arable fields and semi-natural habitats, emphasizing the importance of land-use legacy.

AB  - In ecology, a synecological study deals with a group or community of organisms as well as their relationships to each other and to their environment, while an autecological study deals with the interactions of an individual organism or a single species with living and non-living factors of its environment. Following the autecological approach, fuzzy regression (FR) analysis (which is based on fuzzy set theory) has been used along with classic regression (CR) analysis to evaluate the reliability of protozoa as indicators of treated effluent quality. Both statistical analyses have been based on data collected from an aerobic reactor that operated under conditions of extended aeration. Some common protozoa (Opercularia, Vorticella and Trachelophyllum) have been found to be related to good effluent quality, but the statistical results were inconsistent. The statistical significance of classic regressions was improved when biovolume instead of cell abundance was used as a measure of the microfauna biomass. Generalizations of statistical results regarding protozoan indicators involve a high degree of uncertainty; therefore, we suggest that protozoan indicators should be used only as empiric tools of expert system development, and only for a particular plant. Following the synecological approach. die activated sludge (AS) community has been analysed on the basis of trophic relationships, employing three trophic levels (P-1, P-2, and P-3), with P-1 = all bacteria; P-2 = bacteria eating protozoa, rotifers and nematods; P-3 = top predators (arthropods and carnivorous protozoa). This simple community did not directly respond to changes in the quantity and quality of the substrate; however, the sizes of P-2 and P-3 became maximal when the sludge was 25 days old. The reactor's conditions were similar to those of a biological filter; this favored the development of rotifers, which at times predated intensively upon bacteria and caused severe reduction in sludge activity concentration. We concluded that the biovolume ratio (1), a measure of the relative dominance of rotifers in the second trophic level, is a satisfactory biological indicator of process stability and effluent quality.

AB  - Simple Summary The conservation status of a native fish species is often a key indicator of the state of habitat alteration, which supports strong anthropogenic disturbance. Ecuador contains the Guayas basin, the largest basin in the Pacific Ocean, which is a biodiversity reserve. However, there is little information regarding the morphometric characterization of Brycon dentex and its variations within this basin, although its plasticity has been proposed as an indicator of the maintenance of biodiversity. The goal of this study was to analyze the effects of anthropogenic activity and habitat modification on the morphological variation of Brycon dentex and to determine the usefulness of discriminant analysis in the morphometric differentiation of three populations of Brycon dentex in Ecuador. The Brycon dentex morphometric model could be used as a framework in conservation and, thus, an indicator of habitat status by quickly detecting changes in fish shape. The Guayas, located in Ecuador, is the largest basin in the Pacific Ocean and has an inventory of 123 native freshwater species. Most of these are endemic species that are threatened or at-risk due to anthropogenic activity and the modification, fragmentation, and destruction of habitats. The aim of this study was to determine the morphometric variation in three wild populations of Brycon dentex in the Guayas basin rivers and their connections to fishing management and environmental conditions. A total of 200 mature fish were captured, and 26 morphometric parameters were measured. The fishing policies (Hypothesis 1) and environmental conditions (Hypothesis 2) were considered fixed factors and were validated by t-tests. The morphological variation among the three populations (Hypothesis 3) was validated through a discriminant analysis. Fishing policies and resource management were found to generate morphological differences associated with body development. In addition, the environmental conditions were found to influence the size and structure of Brycon dentex populations. The analyzed populations were discriminated by the generated morphometric models, which differentiated Cluster 1 (Quevedo and Mocache rivers) with high fishing pressure from Cluster 2 (Pintado river) with medium-low fishing pressure. Morphometric differentiation by discriminant analysis is a direct and economic methodology that can be applied as an indicator of diversity maintenance.

AB  - In the last decade, flooding has caused the death of over 60,000 people and affected over 900 million people globally. This is expected to increase as a result of climate change, increased populations and urbanisation. Floods can cause infections due to the release of water-borne pathogenic microorganisms from surcharged combined sewers and other sources of fecal contamination. This research contributes to a better understanding of how the occurrence of water-borne pathogens in contaminated shallow water bodies is affected by different environmental conditions. The inactivation of fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli was studied in an open stirred reactor, under controlled exposure to simulated sunlight, mimicking the effect of different latitudes and seasons, and different concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) corresponding to different levels of dilution and runoff. While attachment of bacteria on the solid particles did not take place, the decay rate coefficient, k (d(-1)), was found to depend on light intensity, I (Wm(-2)), and duration of exposure to sunlight, T (hd(-1)), in a linear way (k=k(D)+0.03 center dot I and k=k(D)+0.65 center dot T, respectively) and on the concentration of TSS (mg L-1), in an inversely proportional exponential way (k=k(D)+14.57 center dot e(-0.02 center dot[TSS])). The first-order inactivation rate coefficient in dark conditions, k(D)=0.37 d(-1), represents the effect of stresses other than light. This study suggests that given the sunlight conditions during an urban flood, and the concentration of indicator organisms and TSS, the above equations can give an estimate of the fate of selected pathogens, allowing rapid implementation of appropriate measures to mitigate public health risks. Article HighlightsIt was demonstrated under controlled conditions that the inactivation of fecal indicator bacteria E. coli is higher under higher solar irradiance, longer duration of daylight and low TSS concentrations.The results indicate that under high TSS concentrations the bacteria, even if not attached on particles, are protected from photo-inactivation for a period of a few days, as the decay rate decreases exponentially with an increase in TSS concentration.

TI  - Analysis of Differences in the Level of Details of the Planning Provisions of Selected Municipalities in Poznan Agglomeration
T2  - ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA
LA  - Polish
AB  - In Polish legal conditions, conducting a coherent policy within urban areas is still hindered. These areas are subject to dynamic processes of suburbanization. Suburbanization is defined as a result of migration from the city centers to the suburbs. The process results in deterioration of city centers and dynamic, often uncontrolled development of the suburbs (urban sprawl). During the period of intensive suburbanization, in the years 2000-2010 In agglomeration of Poznan, 65 000 new dwellings were built, among them 31 000,were located in Poznan county. There are no national law regulations (agglomeration law) concerning this problem, that forces local governments to act. Municipality, as the basic unit of local government in Poland has the largest authority in planning, it decides about land use and its management. Study of the Conditions and Directions of Spatial Management is an indirect tool that defines a general outline of planning policy of local governments. Local Spatial Management Plan is a main tool for forming land functions, development principles. Local Spatial Management Plan has to be consistent with the policy expressed in the Study of the Conditions and Directions of Spatial Management. Therefore, the more accurate the document is, the more consistent local spatial management plans are, which leads to a rational functioning and use of the environment. The main issue in the process of forming agglomeration structures is building a cohesion on a sub-regional level. One of the obstacles on the way of reaching that point are quantitative and qualitative differences in documents that sets the planning policy. The study shows that there are significant differences in this area, between communities of Poznan agglomeration. The differences occurs in the number of parameters relating to land development and building development indicators. In all analyzed cases, the most regulated sphere concerns housing, the least amount of guidelines relate to production and service functions. It seems that this issue can be a significant obstacle in the study of current conditions (lack of comparability), as well as in setting strategic directions for the agglomeration as an independent entity. The basic conclusion of the paper is that there is a need to develop an uniform methodology for planning for the creation of strategic planning documents for suburbs of agglomerations.

AB  - Four of the 38 sediment cores, collected from the northwestern part of the Black Sea (French-Romanian BLASON Programme, 1998), were analysed in order to study the major hydrological and environmental change of the sea during the Holocene. This change was caused by the inflow of the marine Mediterranean waters into the freshwater basin of the Black Sea. Two cores from the northwestern shelf and two from the deep part of the sea, representing distinct sedimentary environments along the same profile, were chosen. Lacustrine sediments from deep-water cores and uppermost marine sediments in all studied bores are characterised by the presence of pyrite (FeS2), which indicates anoxic, sulphate reducing conditions in sediment and in water column (as it is observed now in the Black Sea). Pyrite formation in this anoxic environment takes place below the oxic/anoxic limit, by reduction and sulphidation of iron. The transition from freshwater to marine conditions is marked in all studied cores by the presence of ferrimagnetic iron sulphide-greigite (Fe3S4). Greigite is an intermediate mineral in the pyritisation reactions during early diagenesis, which can be preserved in the sediment if pyritisation cannot be accomplished, due to a high Fe/S ratio. In shallow water cores from the shelf, where marine transgression is marked by a discontinuity, greigite is present below and above it. This suggests that the anoxic, sulphate reducing conditions, allowing preservation of greigite, started in the sediment after marine transgression. In cores from the deep part of the sea, the transgression is represented by a level of sediments with high organic matter content (sapropel). The greigite is present only in the lower part of this level and its formation is related to the arrival of marine water. The presence of pyrite in the upper part of the lacustrine sediments indicates that anoxic conditions probably prevailed here during marine transgression. These results show the sensitivity of magnetic parameters to major environmental change in the Black Sea, and allow a correlation between cores from different depths, by recognition of greigite in the sediments marking the marine transgression.

AB  - Cultivars that can fill their grain quickly may have an advantage in environments with short, hot, dry grain-filling periods, but this hypothesis needs to be tested by selecting in breeding populations. The rate and duration of grain growth of 13 introductions and three local, standard cultivars were measured in nine environments over 3 years to identify new germplasm with faster grain growth and shorter durations of grain growth. Duration of grain growth was calculated from the cumulative daily average temperatures between anthesis and physiological maturity, and rate of grain growth was calculated from the mean kernel weight and duration. The loss of green colour from the peduncle was used as an indicator of physiological maturity. The aim was to identify parents to use in a subsequent breeding program.
   Genotypes were identified with improvements in grain growth characters over the standard cultivars. Kansu No. 32, SA 42, NIAB 75-509 and Maya 74 had the fastest rates of grain growth, e.g. 75, 84, 79 and 70 mu g/kernel . degrees C day respectively, compared with 64 for Aroona, the best standard cultivar, at sites with short periods of grain growth. Kansu No. 32 developed heavy kernels quickly, and differed from other genotypes in that it had a short duration of grain growth that was consistent regardless of environmental conditions. SA 42, NIAB 75-509 and CEP 8058 also developed grain quickly, with the flexibility to develop grain in a shorter time than the standard cultivars in hot grain-filling conditions, but similar time in favourable conditions. These four genotypes had less kernels/m(2) associated with the increased grain growth rate. Yu Mai 7, Maya 74 and V763-251 had smaller increases in rates of grain growth, but only a slight reduction in kernel numbers.
   Rate of grain growth is more important than duration as a selection criterion to improve kernel weight and grain yield in Western Australian conditions, as duration is influenced to a much greater extent by environment. Growth rate was negatively associated with number of kernels/m(2), so these two characters must be considered simultaneously in selection, to ensure grain numbers are maintained while improving rate of grain growth.

AB  - Shrubland has been identified as the most uncertain factor in the C sink in China, but little detail is available regarding the soil organic carbon (SOC) of this significant biome. The effects of influencing factors on the spatial distribution of SOC content have been extensively investigated, but whether these factors reflect a 'direct' or 'indirect' effect is not clear. In this study, 93 topsoil plots were surveyed to measure the SOC content and the influencing factors, including topography (elevation (Ele), slope gradient (SG), and aspect (SA)), soil conditions (pH, bulk density (BD), soil total porosity (STP), soil water content (SWC), soil temperature (ST), soil salinity (SS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and available potassium (AK)), and vegetation (aboveground biomass (AGB)) on the Bashang Plateau in China. The results indicated that the SOC content varied moderately across the entire catchment and was closely related to Ele and all soil conditions (P < 0.05), except for STP. All influencing factors were grouped into four driving indicators of the spatial distribution of SOC content: soil nutrients (TN, TP, and AK), migration of soil water and salt (pH, SWC, and SS), topography and biomass (Ele, SG, and AGB), and basic soil physical properties (BD, STP, and ST). Soil nutrients had the largest relative contribution to the spatial distribution of the SOC content. Ele influenced the spatial distribution of SOC content through direct and indirect effects, and TN had the greatest effect on the SOC content. Ele and TN were the critical factors controlling the spatial distribution of SOC content in the shrubland on the Bashang Plateau, China. The results of this study are a useful supplement to the study of SOC in shrublands and may provide support for the evaluation of the shrubland SOC dynamics after regional vegetation restoration in China and globally.

AB  - Hydrological connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic systems is influenced by landscape features. Topography. vegetation cover and type, lake morphometry and climate (seasonality, precipitation) drive the timing, concentration and quality of allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) inputs to lakes, influencing lake metabolism. The impact of climate changes on terrestrial-aquatic linkages depends on regional trends and ecosystems properties. We examined how landscape heterogeneity affects lake DOM in pristine temperate headwater lakes located in sharp bioclimatic gradients at the leeward side of the southern Andes (Patagonia, Argentina), and predicted their potential responses to forecasted changes in regional climate. We assessed DOM properties of deep and shallow lakes spotted along precipitation and altitudinal gradients which reflect on vegetation heterogeneity. Lake DOM (concentration, and chromophoric and fluorescent properties) was related to terrestrial bioclimatic conditions, addressing also DOM bio- and photodegradation processes. Co-effects of climate and vegetation determined the quantity and quality of allochthonous DOM inputs. Higher terrestrial signs showed up at the wettest extreme of the gradient and during the rainy season, being attributable to higher hydrological land-water connectivity, and dense vegetation cover. Under drier conditions, DOM displayed higher photobleaching signs at spatial and temporal scales. The ratio between non-humic and terrestrial humic substances indicated that DOM biodegradation dominates in shallow forested lakes and photodegradation prevails in deep ones, whereas coupled photo- and biological processing shaped the DOM pool of high altitude lakes. Overall, DOM optical metrics captured landscape heterogeneity. Under the forecasted climate changes for Patagonia (decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature), piedmont lakes may experience lower hydrological connectivity, lower terrestrial inputs and, enhanced photobleaching usually associated with longer water residence time. In high altitude lakes, terrestrial DOM inputs are expected to increase due to the upward expansion of native deciduous forests, thus becoming more similar to lakes located lower in the landscape.

AB  - Creating new lines and hybrids, with higher production capabilities than existing ones, suitable for particular ecological and agricultural environments, remains a continuing problem ahead of the maize breeding programs. For this purpose, the Genetic Improvement Center, Agroarfa Lushnja, works through a genetic improvement program for maize. The aim is to create hybrids of the 500-600 class, suitable in the irrigated conditions of the coastal area of Albania. This paper presents the testcross data of some inbred lines generated by the self-pollination of the hybrid 32F73, it is a late maturing hybrid, but which goes well in the conditions under which the study was conducted. From the F2 population of the 32F73 hybrid were selected the most interesting plants for production indicators and other agronomic traits. Then the plant selection work continued until their phenotypic uniformity reached at the sixth generation of self-pollination (I6). Parallel to this, some of the selected plants of the F2 population of 32F73 hybrid were crossed with some of our best lines (AS2, AS4, AS5, AS8, AS10 and AS13) and continued with selfpollination until they reached the minimum inbred. All the lines created after the selections were crossed with four different tester lines that were AS17, AS19, AS20 and AS23. Their hybrid combinations, obtained from the testcross, line x-tester, were tested in the second year to see the heteroz effect of any hybrid combination, inbred line x tester. This paper gives the data of hybrid combinations (line x tester) for two important indicators, yield (kv/ha) and weight of 1,000 kernels (g). If an inbred line represents high combining ability with all tester lines, it means that the line has general combining ability. On the contrary, it can be characterized for specific combining ability. The test was carried out with hybrid combinations of 35 inbred lines of 7 selected groups, crossed with 4 tester lines. From the study, interesting data were obtained from which some combinations are of interest to further work in the genetic improvement programs of maize.

AB  - Ecological theory and biodiversity conservation have traditionally relied on the number of species recorded at a site, but it is agreed that site richness represents only a portion of the species that can inhabit particular ecological conditions, that is, the habitat-specific species pool. Knowledge of the species pool at different sites enables meaningful comparisons of biodiversity and provides insights into processes of biodiversity formation. Empirical studies, however, are limited due to conceptual and methodological difficulties in determining both the size and composition of the absent part of species pools, the so-called dark diversity. We used >50,000 vegetation plots from 18 types of habitats throughout the Czech Republic, most of which served as a training dataset and 1083 as a subset of test sites. These data were used to compare predicted results from three quantitative methods with those of previously published expert estimates based on species habitat preferences: (1) species co-occurrence based on Beals' smoothing approach; (2) species ecological requirements, with envelopes around community mean Ellenberg values; and (3) species distribution models, using species environmental niches modeled by Biomod software. Dark diversity estimates were compared at both plot and habitat levels, and each method was applied in different configurations. While there were some differences in the results obtained by different methods, particularly at the plot level, there was a clear convergence, especially at the habitat level. The better convergence at the habitat level reflects less variation in local environmental conditions, whereas variation at the plot level is an effect of each particular method. The co-occurrence agreed closest the expert estimate, followed by the method based on species ecological requirements. We conclude that several analytical methods can estimate species pools of given habitats. However, the strengths and weaknesses of different methods need attention, especially when dark diversity is estimated at the plot level.

AB  - Krill (Euphausiids) play a vital ecosystem role in many of the world's most productive marine regions, providing an important trophic linkage. We introduce a robust modeling approach to link Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) abundance and distribution to large-scale and local oceanic and atmospheric conditions and relate these patterns to similarly modeled distributions of an important prey resource, krill. We carried out at-sea strip transect bird surveys and hydroacoustic assessments of euphausiids (2004-2013). Data informed separate, spatially-explicit predictive models of Cassin's auklet abundance (zero-inflated negative binomial regression) and krill biomass (two-part model) based on these surveys. We established the type of prey responsible for acoustic backscatter by conducting net tows of the upper 50 m during surveys. We determined the types of prey fed to Cassin's auklet chicks by collecting diet samples from provisioning adults. Using time-depth-recorders, we found Cassin's auklets utilized consistent areas in the upper water column, less than 30 m, where krill could be found (99.5% of dives were less than 30 m). Birds primarily preyed upon two species of euphausiids, Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera, which were available in the upper water column. Cassin's auklet abundance was best predicted by both large scale and localized oceanic processes (upwelling) while krill biomass was best predicted by local factors (temperature, salinity, and fluorescence) and both large scale and localized oceanic processes (upwelling). Models predicted varying krill and bird distribution by month and year. Our work informs the use of Cassin's auklet as a valuable indicator or krill abundance and distribution and strengthens our understanding of the link between Cassin's auklet and its primary prey. We expect future increases in frequency and magnitude of anomalous ocean conditions will result in decreased availability of krill leading to declines in the Farallon Islands population of Cassin's auklets.

AB  - While genotypically-distinct naturalized Escherichia coli strains have been shown to occur in riparian soils of Lake Michigan and Lake Superior watersheds, comparative analyses of E. coli populations in diverse soils across a range of geographic and climatic conditions have not been investigated. The main objectives of this study were to: (a) examine the population structure and genetic relatedness of E. coli isolates collected from different soil types on a tropical island (Hawaii), and (b) determine if E. coli populations from Hawaii and temperate soils (Indiana, Minnesota) shared similar genotypes that may be reflective of biome-related soil conditions. DNA fingerprint and multivariate statistical analyses were used to examine the population structure and genotypic characteristics of the E. coli isolates. About 33% (98 of 293) of the E. coli from different soil types and locations on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, had unique DNA fingerprints, indicating that these bacteria were relatively diverse; the Shannon diversity index for the population was 4.03. Nearly 60% (171 of 293) of the E. coli isolates from Hawaii clustered into two major groups and the rest, with two or more isolates, fell into one of 22 smaller groups, or individual lineages. Multivariate analysis of variance of 89, 21, and 106 unique E. coli DNA fingerprints for Hawaii, Indiana, and Minnesota soils, respectively, showed that isolates formed tight cohesive groups, clustering mainly by location. However, there were several instances of clonal isolates being shared between geographically different locations. Thus, while nearly identical E. coli strains were shared between disparate climatologically- and geographically-distinct locations, a vast majority of the soil E. coli strains were genotypically diverse and were likely derived from separate lineages. This supports the hypothesis that these bacteria are not unique and multiple genotypes can readily adapt to become part of the soil autochthonous microflora. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Resilient animals can remain productive under different environmental conditions. Rearing in increasingly heterogeneous environmental conditions increases the need of selecting resilient animals. Detection of environmental challenges that affect an entire population can provide a unique opportunity to select animals that are more resilient to these events. The objective of this study was two-fold: (1) to present a simple and practical data-driven approach to estimate the probability that, at a given date, an unrecorded environmental challenge occurred; and (2) to evaluate the genetic determinism of resilience to such events.
   Methods: Our method consists of inferring the existence of highly variable days (indicator of environmental challenges) via mixture models applied to frequently recorded phenotypic measures and then using the inferred probabilities of the occurrence of an environmental challenge in a reaction norm model to evaluate the genetic determinism of resilience to these events. These probabilities are estimated for each day (or other time frame). We illustrate the method by using an ovine dataset with daily feed intake (DFI) records.
   Results: Using the proposed method, we estimated the probability of the occurrence of an unrecorded environmental challenge, which proved to be informative and useful for inclusion as a covariate in a reaction norm animal model. We estimated the breeding values for sensitivity of the genetic potential for DFI of animals to environmental challenges. The level and slope of the reaction norm were negatively correlated (- 0.46 +/- 0.21).
   Conclusions: Our method is promising and appears to be viable to identify unrecorded events of environmental challenges, which is useful when selecting resilient animals and only productive data are available. It can be generalized to a wide variety of phenotypic records from different species and used with large datasets. The negative correlation between level and slope indicates that a hypothetical selection for increased DFI may not be optimal depending on the presence or absence of stress. We observed a reranking of individuals along the environmental gradient and low genetic correlations between extreme environmental conditions. These results confirm the existence of a G xE interaction and show that the best animals in one environmental condition are not the best in another one.

AB  - There is a growing literature on the assessment of quality of life conditions in geographically and/or politically divided regions. Sometimes these territories are countries within a specified supranational structure, such as the European Union, for instance, and sometimes they are regions within countries. There is also some research that focuses on the municipal level of analysis, measuring the quality of life in cities. In the end what the researcher obtains is, at best, an average of the living conditions in the specified territory. However, if results are intended to have policy implications, attention should be paid to the variance in living conditions within regions. In this paper we attempt to quantify the relative importance of three different geographic levels of analysis in assessing the quality of life of the Spanish population. The geo-political division in Spain consists firstly of regions called Comunidades Autnomas, which are then divided into provinces which in turn are divided into municipalities. We are interested in evaluating the extent to which the quality of life conditions of an average person living in a given municipality are explained by the province and region in which the municipality is located. To do so, we first construct a composite indicator of quality of life (QoL) for the 643 largest municipalities of Spain using 19 variables which are weighted using Value Efficiency Analysis (VEA). VEA is a refinement of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) that imposes some consistency on the weights of the indicators used to construct the aggregate index. The indicators cover aspects related to consumption, social services, housing, transport, environment, labour market, health, culture and leisure, education and security. We then make a variance decomposition of the VEA scores to assess the importance of the three levels of geo-political administration. The results show that the municipal level is the most important of these, accounting for 52% of the variance in QoL. Regions explain 38% while provinces only account for a moderate 10%. Therefore, political action at the regional and municipal level would seem to have a larger impact on QoL indicators.

AB  - Iron oxides are widely distributed across the surface of the Earth as a result of the aerobic weathering of primary Fe-bearing minerals. Pedogenic iron oxides which consist mainly of hematite (Hm), goethite (Gt), maghemite (Mgh), are often concentrated synchronously in aerobic soils under low to moderate rainfall regimes. Magnetic susceptibility (chi) and redness, which respectively reflect the content of Mgh and Hm in soils, are considered reasonable pedogenic and climatic indicators in soil taxonomy and paleorainfall reconstruction. However, under high rainfall regimes, the grain growth of Mgh and transformation to Hm, combined with the prior formation of Gt under conditions of high relative humidity (RH), can result in magnetic reduction and dramatic yellowing of soils and sediments, which explains the existence of rainfall thresholds for Mgh and Hm at a large scale even before the pedogenic environment turns anaerobic. In order to capture the rainfall thresholds for Mgh and Hm occurring under aerobic conditions, we explored a tropical transect across a granitic region where the soil color turned from red to yellow under a wide rainfall range of 900-2200 mm/yr and a corresponding mean annual RH range of 77%-85%. We observed a lower rainfall threshold of similar to 1500 mm/yr and a corresponding RH similar to 80% for Mgh and Hm along this transect, as well as a higher rainfall threshold of similar to 1700 mm/yr and a corresponding RH of similar to 81% for Gt and total pedogenic iron oxides (citrate/bicarbonate/dithionite-extractable Fe, Fed). Cross-referencing with comparable studies in temperate and subtropical regions, we noted that the rainfall or RH thresholds for Fed and Hm or Mgh likewise increase with temperature. Moreover, the different thresholds for total and individual iron oxide phase indicates that a negative correlation between chemical weathering intensity and redness or chi in sediment sequences can occur under the prevalent climate regime just between their thresholds. Finally, we developed an integrated model to interpret the sequential formation of rainfall thresholds for different pedogenic iron oxides in soils and sediments with conditions from aerobic to anaerobic.

AB  - Background: Routine weight recording in electronic health records (EHRs) could assist general practitioners (GPs) in the identification, prevention, and management of overweight patients. However, the extent to which weight management is embedded in general practice in the Netherlands has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of weight recording in general practice in the Netherlands for patients who self-reported as being overweight. The specific objectives of this study were to assess whether weight recording varied according to patient characteristics, and to determine the frequency of weight recording over time for patients with and without a chronic condition related to being overweight.
   Methods: Baseline data from the Occupational and Environmental Health Cohort Study (2012) were combined with data from EHRs of general practices (2012-2015). Data concerned 3446 self-reported overweight patients who visited their GP in 2012, and 1516 patients who visited their GP every year between 2012 and 2015. Logistic multilevel regression analyses were performed to identify associations between patient characteristics and weight recording.
   Results: In 2012, weight was recorded in the EHRs of a quarter of patients who self-reported as being overweight. Greater age, lower education level, higher self-reported body mass index, and the presence of diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and/or cardiovascular disorders were associated with higher rates of weight recording. The strongest association was found for diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR = 10.3; 95% CI [7.3, 14.5]). Between 2012 and 2015, 90% of patients with diabetes mellitus had at least one weight measurement recorded in their EHR. In the group of patients without a chronic condition related to being overweight, this percentage was 33%.
   Conclusions: Weight was frequently recorded for overweight patients with a chronic condition, for whom regular weight measurement is recommended in clinical guidelines, and for which weight recording is a performance indicator as part of the payment system. For younger patients and those without a chronic condition related to being overweight, weight was less frequently recorded. For these patients, routine recording of weight in EHRs deserves more attention, with the aim to support early recognition and treatment of overweight.

AB  - Nematodes are highly susceptible to environmental change and possess a wide array of morphological and functional characteristics for the assessment of the "Good Environmental Status", within Marine Strategy Framework Directive. However, while the taxonomic sufficiency of nematodes in detecting spatial gradients and related ecological niche conditions is well recognized, very little is known about nematodes functional morphometric attributes in response to environmental drivers. To explore this knowledge gap, we aimed to assess the efficacy and efficiency of nematode morphometric attributes (length, width, length/width ratio, biomass) in detecting spatial patterns along a Portuguese estuarine gradient, and compare it with the taxonomic approach. We hypothesized that abundance data weighted by the morphometric attributes will have a higher explanatory power in detecting spatial patterns than using abundance of morphometric data alone.
   Based on the recent recommendations regarding the time and cost related efficacy of methods in bio-monitoring and ecological assessments we also hypothesized that a reduced dataset based on the most common genera will suffice to capture the same distributional patterns displayed by the whole assemblage.
   Our results demonstrated that dataset solely based on genera abundances had consistently better explanatory power than combined datasets or morphometric datasets alone, however, combined dataset provided different spatial patterns and performed better at discriminating estuary areas. The main gradients described by the taxonomy-based dataset were related to the sediment particle size and water depth. Considering combined datasets, spatial discrimination was mainly driven by the variation in dissolved oxygen % saturation, pointing out to the importance of this variable in determining estuarine conditions substantial for nematodes morphometric distributional patterns.
   The same analysis repeated for the most frequent genera resulted in similar distributional patterns as for the whole assemblage dataset, clearly demonstrating that spatial estuarine gradients can be sufficiently described by using only the most frequent genera. Such information may substantially increase the efficiency of bio-assessment surveys by reducing the cost and work associated with identification and measurements of all of the individual nematode genera.

AB  - Purpose is to substantiate design factors and technological parameters of next-generation facilities of hydromechanical drilling basing upon the determined features of interaction between breaking pellets and rock mass.
   Methods. The studies of directionality features and bottomhole processes for rock mass breaking have been carried out using the current analytical methods and laboratory experiments. Among other things, certain mathematical and physical simulation techniques, methods of theoretical processing and interpretation of the research results under SolidWorks, Statgraphics, and \Mathcad environments, and a number of relevant instruments and materials have been applied. Following their technological sequence, the well bottomhole rock-breaking processes were simulated using a special laboratory stand equipped with a control-and-measuring unit (inclusive of a flowmeter, manometer, tachometer, and coordinate spacer among other things).
   Findings. Application perspectiveness of the combined techniques for rock breaking has been proved. Structural designs of the next-generation facilities for well drilling have been proposed. The pellet-impact drilling features have been analyzed from the viewpoint of its significant dynamic component during the rock mass breaking. Nature of the effect of breaking load rate on the results of bottomhole deformation processes has been identified. Efficiency of the proposed scheme to improve pellet-impact drilling based upon maximum use of a well bottomhole deformed by pellets has been proved. Measures to increase technical and technological indicators of pellet drilling have been considered. Requirements for the conditions stabilizing operation of a collar of the pellet-impact device have been outlined. Further research tendencies have been specified.
   Originality. It has been determined that compliance with specific geometrical and hydromechanical ratios, corresponding to the stable mode of a well sinking, is the factor required for reliable operation of hydromechanical drilling facilities.
   Practical implications. The results of stand-based tests as well as analytical studies may become the foundations to develop efficient engineering decision for hydromechanical well drilling with high technical and economic indicators. The data, concerning bottomhole rock breaking processes, are the basic ones to work out rational standard parameters of well sinking processes.

AB  - Active biomonitoring is used to assess environmental pollution of elements such as heavy metals by indicator species such as mosses. They are used, among others, in urbanized areas where no indicator species are found. In such study areas, mosses collected from sites considered to be ecologically clean shall be exposed. In this context, it is very important to prepare the mosses properly before the exposure, so that the information received about the condition of the environment is reliable. In 2018, studies were conducted in the forested areas of southern Poland-in Opolskie Province. Pleurozium schreberi mosses were used in these studies. Atomic absorption spectrometry with flame atomiser (F-AAS) was used to determine the concentrations of Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb present. The aim was to study the influence of preparation methodology on Pleurozium schreberi moss samples prior to use in active biomonitoring studies. Four different methodologies were tested across four different sample locations (with varying levels of pollution). The results of the research were analysed and the coefficient of variation (CV) was determined. The value of the CV is influenced, among other things, by the location of the particular sample and the level of pollution by, for example heavy metals, in the moss. The research conducted proves that of the four methods used to prepare mosses for later exposure in active biomonitoring, the best method is averaging with simultaneous conditioning of mosses in demineralised water. This treatment causes the CV coefficient to fall below 10% for most of the metals determined in the moss samples. It has also been shown that maintaining moss collection methodology in accordance with ICP Vegetation standards (open/wooded area-tree canopy) also has a significant impact on the result obtained. Statistical analysis confirmed (Wilcoxon test) that the method of processing the mosses significantly influenced the results obtained. Thanks to the appropriate preparation of the mosses before exposition, they can be used in active biomonitoring of, for example, urban areas.

AB  - The article presents the research results of the economic and social situation in Russian territories in 2013-2015 obtained by calculation of indicators characterising the level and quality of life in the territories under analysis. The assessment of the quality of life in territorial entities of the Russian Federation, including the Central Federal District (CFD) of the Russian Federation (except Moscow and Moscow Region), was carried out using the following group of indicators: quality of the population; level of the income of the population; working conditions; population provided with comfortable housing; healthcare services; safety of the population; quality of environmental management system.
   The authors assess strong and weak points of the reduction of social and economic asymmetry within territorial entities of the Russian Federation by 2016, which have to be considered when developing a qualitatively updated strategy of regional development for the 2020-2025 period.
   After carrying out the analysis for the CFD, the following findings have been obtained:
   The average income growth is observed in all the cities, except for Volgograd, Kostroma, Kurgan, Samara and Saratov. The population with the income below the subsistence level increased in all the analysed regions. The greatest natural population decline was observed in Vladimir, Smolensk, Tambov, Tver and Tula regions, whereas Belgorod, Yaroslavl, Voronezh, Lipetsk and Kostroma regions displayed a positive dynamic. The slow growth of housing indicator is observed in all the cities. The change in the number of doctors in the considered regions from 2013 to 2015 shows a beneficial situation in Oryol, Belgorod, Bryansk, Kostroma, Tambov and Tula regions where an increase in the number of doctors of all specialties per 10,000 inhabitants is observed. In other regions, we have noted a drop in the number of doctors. We noted an increase in the indicator "Number of the Registered Crimes per 100,000 inhabitants" in all the regions from 2014 to 2015, which is a negative trend.

AB  - 1. Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle, but the drivers of net forest biomass change (i.e. net carbon sequestration) are poorly understood. Here, we evaluate how abiotic factors (soil conditions and disturbance) and biotic factors (forest structure, diversity and community trait composition) shape three important demographic processes (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) and how these underlie net biomass change.
   2. To test this, we evaluated 9 years of biomass dynamics using 48 1-ha plots in a Bolivian tropical moist forest, and measured for the most abundant species eight functional traits that are important for plant carbon gain and loss. Demographic processes were related to the abiotic and biotic factors using structural equation models.
   3. Variation in net biomass change across plots was mostly due to stand-level mortality, but mortality itself could not be predicted at this scale. Contrary to expectations, we found that species richness and trait composition - which is an indicator for the mass-ratio theory - had little effect on the demographic processes. Biomass recruitment (i.e. the biomass growth by recruiting trees) increased with higher resource availability (i.e. water and light) and with high species richness, probably because of increased resource use efficiency. Biomass growth of larger, established trees increased with higher sand content, which may facilitate root growth of larger trees to deeper soil layers.
   4. In sum, diversity and mass-ratio are of limited importance for the productivity of this forest. Instead, in this moist tropical forest with a marked dry season, demographic processes are most strongly determined by soil texture, soil water availability and forest structure. Only by simultaneously evaluating multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of demographic processes, better insights can be gained into mechanisms playing a role in the carbon sequestration potential of tropical forests and natural systems in general.

AB  - All chondrites accreted similar to 3.5 wt.% C in their matrices, the bulk of which was in a macromolecular solvent and acid insoluble organic material (IOM). Similar material to IOM is found in interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) and comets. The IOM accounts for almost all of the C and N in chondrites, and a significant fraction of the H. Chondrites and, to a lesser extent, comets were probably the major sources of volatiles for the Earth and the other terrestrial planets. Hence, IOM was both the major source of Earth's volatiles and a potential source of complex prebiotic molecules.
   Large enrichments in D and N-15, relative to the bulk solar isotopic compositions, suggest that IOM or its precursors formed in very cold, radiation-rich environments. Whether these environments were in the interstellar medium (ISM) or the outer Solar System is unresolved. Nevertheless, the elemental and isotopic compositions and functional group chemistry of IOM provide important clues to the origin(s) of organic matter in protoplanetary disks. IOM is modified relatively easily by thermal and aqueous processes, so that it can also be used to constrain the conditions in the solar nebula prior to chondrite accretion and the conditions in the chondrite parent bodies after accretion.
   Here we review what is known about the abundances, compositions and physical nature of IOM in the most primitive chondrites. We also discuss how the IOM has been modified by thermal metamorphism and aqueous alteration in the chondrite parent bodies, and how these changes may be used both as petrologic indicators of the intensity of parent body processing and as tools for classification. Finally, we critically assess the various proposed mechanisms for the formation of IOM in the ISM or Solar System. I3/4 (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Four sample sets of the Upper and Middle Loire river sands were analyzed in order to study the impact of natural and anthropogenic factors on their petrographic composition in space (on an 800 km stretch) and time. Composition was determined by modal analysis of three sand-size fractions using a polarizing optical microscope and calculated for each sample ("standard sand" = Sst). The watershed is composed mainly of endogenic (Massif Central) and sedimentary (southern Parisian Basin) rocks. B-set sands collected in channels for different water flows in 1996 show that Sst compositions vary by only 5 %. Present-day sands in the Upper Loire and Middle Loire have very high petrographic immaturity comparing to others worldwide fluvial sands, although bio-climatic conditions favor sand maturation by source-rock weathering in the watershed. This shows the strong impact of the Massif Central on sediment yield due to relief rejuvenation as a consequence of the formation of the Alps during the Quaternary. Fluvial sands stored during the Weichselian and the Holocene in the Middle Loire floodplain, although partly weathered since their deposition, show higher inputs from the endogenic rocks of the Massif Central than present-day deposits. This can be explained by Weichselian periglacial conditions and the development of crop farming since the Neolithic, which favored mechanical erosion, particularly in the Massif Central which is characterized by a cold, humid climate and steep slopes. The upstream-downstream change in the composition of presently deposited sand is low in the diked area. It shows however that basalt and some heavy mineral grains are vulnerable to abrasion during transport and indicates a marked sediment yield from ancient sediment stored in the floodplain. This is in line with the high incision of the river bed over the last 150 years partly due to dam construction and aggregate mining.

AB  - Growth of the chalcone isomerase defective tt-5 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana and its Landsberg erecta progenitor were compared under a variety of full spectrum solar radiation conditions to determine if the tt-5 mutant could serve as an adequate subject for studies of the mechanisms of damage by UV-B radiation. An experiment was conducted in the fall of 1995 under open field filter frames using cellulose diacetate and Mylar filters to transmit and exclude natural UV-B irradiation, respectively. Even though growth under these conditions was slow and erratic owing to lack of temperature control, growth suppression as indicated by rosette diameter and harvest fresh weights provided a sensitive indicator of W-B stress. This experience led to development of temperature-controlled Teflon-covered field chambers that admit up to 88% of the total daily PAR and about 85% of ambient UV-B, omit predators, and provide a generally stable environment for quantitative plant growth studies. The chambers were designed to facilitate the addition of optical filters and/or shade cloth and to accommodate control of the gaseous environment for pollutant and climate change studies and to provide clean air for other experiments. Three additional experiments were conducted in these chambers. Measurements of rosette diameter, weights of various aboveground plant parts, and plant height were evaluated as potential methods of comparing growth sensitivities of the tt-5 mutant to W-B radiation. The weight of the reproductive parts (flowers and siliques) as a fraction of the total (e.g. harvest index) was consistently and negatively affected by solar UV-B, as was simple plant height. However, in no case, even in the virtual absence of UV-B, was growth of tt-5 comparable to that of Ler. We conclude that the disruption of secondary metabolism in tt-5 has growth implications far beyond the lack of UV-B protection, making it unsuitable as a surrogate for high UV-B experimentation.

AB  - The effects of climate warming on ecosystem dynamics are widespread throughout the world's oceans. In the Northeast Pacific, large-scale climate patterns such as the El Nino/Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and recently unprecedented warm ocean conditions from 2014 to 2016, referred to as a marine heatwave (MHW), resulted in large-scale ecosystem changes. Larval fishes quickly respond to environmental variability and are sensitive indicators of ecosystem change. Categorizing ichthyoplankton dynamics across marine ecosystem in the Northeast Pacific can help elucidate the magnitude of assemblage shifts, and whether responses are synchronous or alternatively governed by local responses to regional oceanographic conditions. We analyzed time-series data of ichthyoplankton abundances from four ecoregions in the Northeast Pacific ranging from subarctic to subtropical: the Gulf of Alaska (1981-2017), British Columbia (2001-2017), Oregon (1998-2017), and the southern California Current (1981-2017). We assessed the impact of the recent (2014-2016) MHW and how ichthyoplankton assemblages responded to past major climate perturbations since 1981 in these ecosystems. Our results indicate that the MHW caused widespread changes in the ichthyoplankton fauna along the coast of the Northeast Pacific Ocean, but impacts differed between marine ecosystems. For example, abundances for most dominant taxa were at all-time lows since the beginning of sampling in the Gulf of Alaska and British Columbia, while in Oregon and the southern California Current species richness increased as did abundances of species associated with warmer waters. Lastly, species associated with cold waters also increased in abundances close to shore in southern California during the MHW, a pattern that was distinctly different from previous El Nino events. We also found several large-scale, synchronized ichthyoplankton assemblage composition shifts during past major climate events. Current climate projections suggest that MHWs will become more intense and thus our findings can help project future changes in larval dynamics, allowing for improved ecosystem management decisions.

AB  - Plant phenology is the most salient and sensitive indicator of terrestrial ecosystem response to climate change. Studying its change is significantly important in understanding and predicting impressively changes in terrestrial ecosystem. Based on NDVI from SPOT VGT, this paper analyzed the spatiotemporal changes in alpine grassland phenology in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 1999 to 2009. The results are enumerated as follows: (1) The spatial distribution of the average alpine grassland phenology from 1999 to 2009 is closely related to water and heat conditions. Accompanying the deterioration in heat and water conditions from southeast to northwest, the start of growth season (SOG) was delayed gradually, the end of growth season (EOG) advanced slowly, and the length of growth season (LOG) shortened gradually. Elevation played an important role in the regional differentiation of phenology, but a dividing line of approximately 3500 m existed. Below this line, the phenology fluctuated irregularly with altitude change, whereas above the line, the phenology is closely related to altitude change. (2) From 1999 to 2009, SOG of the alpine grassland came earlier by six days per decade (R (2)=0.281, P=0.093), EOG was late by two days per decade (R (2)=0.031, P=0.605), and LOG lengthened by eight days per decade (R (2)=0.479, P=0.018). The early SOG, the late EOG, and the extended LOG mainly occurred at the center and east of the Plateau. SOG in most of the Plateau advanced significantly, especially in the eastern Plateau. (3) The inter-annual phenology changes of the alpine grassland in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau exhibited significant differentiation at different elevation and natural zones. The inter-annual changes at high altitude were more complicated than that at low altitude. The most significant phenology changes were found in the eastern Qinghai-Qilian montane steppe zone, and non-significant changes occurred in the Southern Tibet montane shrub-steppe zone.

AB  - Relationship between water quality variables and distribution, diversity and abundance of sedimentary chironomids (Diptera: Chironomidae) were examined in 51 limnologically different shallow lakes in Finland. The objective was to identify which of the water quality parameters influenced chironomids the most and to explore the potential of developing a palaeoecological tool to infer past changes in water quality for the use of lake management in conservation, preservation and restoration projects. In addition, taxon-specific optima and tolerances were calculated to identify indicators for ultraoligotrophic-hypereutrophic Finnish lakes. The statistical tests indicated that the chironomid assemblages were closely related to water quality. Of the examined environmental variables total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), colour, turbidity and hypolimnetic oxygen were the most important explanatory variables. Because autumnal epilimnetic TP had the highest eigenvalue (lambda(1):lambda(2)) ratio, which indicates the relative significance of particular variable in explaining the variance in the species data, and lowest statistical significance level, it was considered to have the greatest potential for the development of a calibration model for quantitative inferences of past limnological conditions. In addition to the complete model, a reduced model using 41 lakes was developed that is independent of covariance with temperature. Of the tested model types, weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) had the strongest relationship between observed and inferred TP values together with lowest error of prediction and maximum bias showing favourable model performance. In general, the results of taxon-specific indicator value showed close agreement with previous data. The results provided coherent autecological and synecological data that can be used in qualitative assessments of water quality and ecological status of lakes and most importantly as a basis for the new quantitative tool to be used in palaeolimnological studies and evaluations of TP reference conditions.

AB  - 1. As a baseline study of the nature and incidence of keel deformities in laying hens, keel condition was examined in three different strains of hen from a total of 4 different caged environments (two commercial farms and two experimental farms). Incidence of keel deformity on farms in end of lay hens ranged from 2.6 to 16.7%. Only 0.8% of younger 15-week-old pullets had deformed keels.
   2. Incidence of keel deformities was unchanged in 100 birds sampled from a free-range system compared to conventional caged siblings at the same farm.
   3. Keel condition was also examined in 5 selected generations of a study involving the use of a body-weight-restricted selection index for skeletal improvement. Divergent selection for skeletal characteristics decreased incidence of keel deformity and improved radiographic density (RD) in high bone index (BI) hens compared to low BI hens in all selected generations. Male high BI keels were also improved compared to low BI. Shear strength measured in normal keels in generation 6 (G6) of the genetic study was improved in high BI hens compared to low BI hens. For all hens in the genetic study, those with normal keels had stronger tibiotarsus and humerus breaking strengths than hens with deformed keels.
   4. Histopathology of keels representative of different deformities showed the presence of fracture callus material and new bone in all cases. This establishes that deformities are a result of trauma and are not developmental in origin.
   5. Ash contents of keels, tibiae and humeri showed no differences between hens with normal and deformed keels. There were no differences in indicators of collagen cross-linkage in other bones between hens with normal keels and those with deformed keels.
   6. It is concluded that lack of bone mass is the underlying cause of keel fracture and deformity in laying hens, rather than qualitative changes in bone, and that genetic selection can improve keel quality and prevent deformity.

AB  - In the present study, we investigated and compared the spatial variation in soft-bottom macrozoobenthic as-semblages and associated sediments in three coastal lagoons colonized by mixed serpulid reefs of Ficopomatus enigmaticus and Hydroides dianthus, differing in extension, density, and confinement condition. We hypothesized that the effect of serpulid reefs on the benthic assemblages varies among lagoons, and that the pattern of spatial variation in the benthic assemblages at two distances (<1 m and 10's m apart) from serpulid reefs also differs among lagoons. The PERMANOVA revealed significant differences in the benthic assemblages of the three la-goons. In particular, the most marine and species-rich lagoon of Corru S'Ittiri, and the Santa Giusta lagoon, were dominated by bivalves and polychaetes, while the most confined, brackish San Giovanni lagoon, which had the least number of species, was dominated by highly abundant crustaceans, consistent with the presence of mac-roalgal cover. Moreover, we found significant differences in the variation in the benthic assemblages at the <1 m and 10's m locations in Corru S'Ittiri and Santa Giusta, but not in San Giovanni. These differences paralleled differences in sediment composition which were reciprocally influenced by serpulid reefs. In particular, hard-bottom species, e.g. the bivalve Mytilaster minimus, dominated at locations rich in carbonates and calcareous tube fragments, whilst soft-bottom species, such as Naineris laevigata, Abra segmentum and Alitta succinea, occurred more abundantly at some organic-enriched, muddy locations near the reefs. This work represents an original approach to investigate the effect of serpulid reefs as a hotspot of biodiversity in Mediterranean lagoons. The three studied lagoons, used to encompass the high variability of these ecosystems, demonstrate for the first time that the effect of serpulid reefs on soft-bottom benthic assemblages and their spatial variation within a lagoon varies depending on local interlinked environmental conditions, including reefs characteristics, confinement levels, sediment composition, and marine influence.

AB  - The Arctic is experiencing dramatic changes including increases in precipitation, glacial melt, and permafrost thaw, resulting in increasing freshwater runoff to coastal waters. During the melt season, terrestrial runoff delivers carbon- and nutrient-rich freshwater to Arctic coastal waters, with unknown consequences for the microbial communities that play a key role in determining the cycling and fate of terrestrial matter at the land-ocean interface. To determine the impacts of runoff on coastal microbial (bacteria and archaea) communities, we investigated changes in pelagic microbial community structure between the early (June) and late (August) melt season in 2018 in the Isfjorden system (Svalbard). Amplicon sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were generated from water column, river and sediment samples collected in Isfjorden along fjord transects from shallow river estuaries and glacier fronts to the outer fjord. Community shifts were investigated in relation to environmental gradients, and compared to river and marine sediment microbial communities. We identified strong temporal and spatial reorganizations in the structure and composition of microbial communities during the summer months in relation to environmental conditions. Microbial diversity patterns highlighted a reorganization from rich communities in June toward more even and less rich communities in August. In June, waters enriched in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) provided a niche for copiotrophic taxa including Sulfitobacter and Octadecabacter. In August, lower DOC concentrations and Atlantic water inflow coincided with a shift toward more cosmopolitan taxa usually associated with summer stratified periods (e.g., SAR11 Clade Ia), and prevalent oligotrophic marine clades (OM60, SAR92). Higher riverine inputs of dissolved inorganic nutrients and suspended particulate matter also contributed to spatial reorganizations of communities in August. Sentinel taxa of this late summer fjord environment included taxa from the class Verrucomicrobiae (Roseibacillus, Luteolibacter), potentially indicative of a higher fraction of particle-attached bacteria. This study highlights the ecological relevance of terrestrial runoff for Arctic coastal microbial communities and how its impacts on biogeochemical conditions may make these communities susceptible to climate change.

AB  - Aims: The objective of our study was to detect spatial patterns in the relationship of plant communities and rare species of wet field depressions to environmental factors such as climate, the size or geographic position of the field depressions and the soil properties. Location: Fifteen temporarily flooded field depressions along a 150 km long gradient from Brandenburg (NE Germany) to West Pomerania (NW Poland). Methods: To identify factors which define the occurrence of rare species, the vegetation of depressions with and without documented occurrence of Elatine alsinastrum were pairwise compared in 10 m x 10 m sampling plots. As the field emergence of the rare wetland plants was severely restricted by low precipitation during the study period, we performed a soil seed bank analysis instead of field sampling. Results: Our study sites were placed along a gradient of decreasing precipitation from the westernmost sites in Brandenburg to West Pomerania in the east. With decreasing precipitation we also observed an increase in the number and area of water bodies surrounding the study plots. Increased concentrations of P in soil, the occurrence of typical arable weeds as "indicator species" in the west and more perennial plants in the east suggest more intensive cultivation of the westernmost field depressions. Small water bodies harbouring higher numbers of species may be the result of greater small-scale habitat variation within our 100 m(2) sampling plots. Records of E. alsinastrum at both sites with and without former proof do not allow for clear conclusions on the impact of environmental factors on the occurrence of such rare species. Conclusions: Finds of 12 Red List species and four near-threatened species together with former records of several very rare charophytes verify the high nature conservation value of the study sites. As ongoing intensification of arable cultivation and drainage may seriously impact rare wetland plants, conservation measures should be taken to maintain their reproduction and to prevent future decline of their seed reservoir.

AB  - The pine forests on shallow calcareous rendzina-like soils have a limited distribution in the northern Europe. Due to the peculiar ecological conditions, these forests include different floroelements together with red-listed species and have high value for biodiversity conservation. The calcareous pine forests are well represented in two biggest islands of the Baltic Sea - in Saaremaa and Gotland. The aim of the paper was to compare the floristic composition and environment conditions of calcareous pine forests on these islands, to elucidate their typological similarities and divergence, and to estimate the characteristic/indicator species in the established forest types. In Gotland 34 stands and in Saaremaa 35 stands were studied on 0.1 ha sample plots. For data processing the detrended correspondence analysis, cluster analysis, the multi-response permutation procedure, the indicator species analysis and the multiple regression analysis were used. The soil humus horizon chemistry characteristics (pH, nitrogen and carbon content, and their ratio) in the considered forests vary within quite narrow limits; the difference of soils is mainly expressed by the humus horizon thickness, from which depends the soil water holding capacity. Climatically, Saaremaa has a lower average temperatures and more precipitation than Gotland. For calcareous pine forests on both islands numerous significant indicator species are characteristic, whereby this list is two times longer for Gotland. The total number of species in Saaremaa depends significantly (negatively) only on the dominating pine trees abundance, in the forests of Gotland the shrub layer coverage has cardinal importance. On the number of shrub layer species on both islands the shrub layer coverage has a significant impact but in Gotland also abundance of spruce has considerable effect. On the communities level the disagreement between the compared islands is even more conspicuous than on the species level: from nine established community types three are connected exclusively with one island, with Saaremaa or Gotland; on both islands only communities of two types are represented more or less evenly.

AB  - In model laboratory and field conditions, the influence of pollution by antibiotics (benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, oxytetracycline, tylosin, pharmasin, tromexin, aliseryl, and nystatin) on the biological properties of ordinary chernozem was examined in concentrations of 1-1000 mg/kg. A decrease in the majority of the basic biological parameters (ammonifying bacteria, amylolytic bacteria, micromycetes, bacteria of the genus Azotobacter, activity of catalase, dehydrogenase, invertase, phosphatase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase) of chernozem occurs when the concentration of antibiotics is 100 mg/kg of soil. In most cases, there was a direct relationship between the content of antibiotics in the soil and the scale of a decrease in the studied parameters. The degree of the influence of antibiotics was determined by their nature, concentration, and time of exposure. Antibacterial antibiotics had more negative impact on the studied indicators than fungicidal ones. By the degree of inhibiting the biological properties of chernozem, antibiotics formed the following sequence: ampicillin > benzylpenicillin >= streptomycin >= oxytetracycline > tylosin >= pharmasin > nystatin > tromexin > aliseryl. Among the examined biological indicators, the number of ammonifying bacteria and the activity of dehydrogenases were reacting most sensitive to a soil pollution by antibiotics. From the investigated enzyme activities, the catalase shows a low response and was no suitable indicator for an antibiotic pollution. The abundance of bacteria of the genus Azotobacter in case of pollution by antibiotics was not informative. The degree of a decrease in biological indicators was more pronounced in laboratory conditions than in the field ones. The rate of the biological activity recovery of chernozem after pollution in the field was 2 times higher. According to the degree of resistance to antibiotics, the investigated microorganisms of chernozem formed the following sequence: bacteria of the genus Azotobacter > micromycetes > amylolytic bacteria > ammonifying bacteria. Enzymes formed the following sequence: peroxidase >= polyphenol oxidase > catalase > dehydrogenase > invertase >= phosphatase. Antibiotics had prolonged influence on the biological properties of ordinary chernozem. The examined parameters were observed not to be recovered to control values even on the 120th day after the pollution.

AB  - Quantifying change after large habitat restoration efforts is critical to assessing the effort's success. After river restoration activities, fish abundance is expected to increase and also fluctuates naturally by season and with environmental conditions. A side-looking hydroacoustic system was used to estimate fish abundance in the Penobscot River, ME, from 2010 to 2016 during predam (2010-2013) and postdam (2014-2016) removal years during nonice periods. Automated data processing enabled continuous abundance estimates from fish tracks. A threefold increase in mean fish abundance was recorded after dam removal. A fourfold increase in median fish abundance occurred in the fall relative to spring and summer of the same year, regardless of dam presence. Interannual fish abundance in every season monitored increased at least twofold after dam removal. We related variability in fish abundance to tide, discharge, temperature, diurnal cycle, daylength, moon phase, and restoration activities (focusing on dam presence). Daylength corresponding to the fall and summer was the most important indicator for higher fish abundance. Fish abundance was generally greatest in the fall during outgoing tides at night, with lesser peaks occurring during the month of June at night. Before dam removal, fish abundance peaked when water temperature was less than 9.25 degrees C, at night, during outgoing tides. After dam removal, fish abundance peaked when daylength was less than 11.3 hr, at night, during outgoing tides, when water temperature was above 4.56 degrees C and no full moon was present. Peak fish abundance occurred during only 0.02-2.3% of the total time sampled. The threefold increase in fish abundance recorded after dam removal was observed despite yearly stocking efforts of adult alewife increasing 24% in postdam removal years. Finally, parallel studies of fish presence in the Penobscot River were used to compare the utility of this method as an indicator of fish abundance in response to dam removal.

AB  - Peatlands are a type of wetland characterized by the accumulation of organic matter, called peat, and are important carbon reservoirs. In areas with poor drainage, human-induced forest fires and logging can produce flooded conditions and organic matter accumulation, which generates an ecosystem called anthropogenic peatland. Productive management activities such as Sphagnum moss harvesting and livestock grazing take place there. Our hypothesis was that productive management has a strong impact on the aboveground C reservoir and increases the presence of exotic species. We established 44 sampling points in a 16-ha anthropogenic peatland on Chiloe Island, Chile, comparing productive and conservation types of managements. Carbon stocks, vegetation structure and composition variables were quantified. These variables were used to classify the ecosystem into microsites to analyze the different locations in the peatland. In addition, predictive models of aboveground carbon were created using Landsat 8 OLI and Pleiades images. The results revealed a carbon stock of 11.99 +/- 0.77 kg C m(-2), which is smaller than in natural peatlands, and showed a wide variability of conditions within the peatland itself. This variability, mainly expressed in aboveground carbon, produces microsites dominated by either shrubs, species of the genus Juncus or grasses. Productive management reduced accumulated carbon in the aboveground stock and in the woody debris. However, the strongest impact was found on the vegetation variables, with a decrease in total cover, cover of shrubs and herbaceous plants, and in vegetation height. There was also an increase in the richness and presence of exotic species. The spatial prediction of aboveground carbon yielded significant results using only spectral indices, showing also that the impact of productive management is not homogenous, being less intense in waterlogged areas. This study is the first to quantify carbon reservoirs in this type of ecosystem and to propose variables that can be used as indicators of the impact of human activities.

AB  - Recent sedimentary history of natural environmental change and anthropogenic influence in an ephemeral river catchment has been reconstructed using selected major and trace elements, element ratios, and their different geochemical phases (Tessier sequential extraction methods), pollen, and grain size combined with Pb-210- and Cs-137-dating method in marsh sedimentary cores. Attempts were made to use selected element ratios with different geochemical phases-residual phase of Ti, Al, V, Cr, Ni, Rb, K, Sr, and Ba; mobile Sr and Ba-combined with Pb-210- and Cs-137-chronology to interpret certain time information of environmental changes saved within the marsh sediments. Results indicate that there were two marked humid periods during 1850-1860 AD and 1890-1920 AD, and sand storm activities prevailed during 1920-1930 Ad. After about 1900 AD, soil erosion has increased with the extensive agricultural activities in the Huolin River catchments, and further intensified after 1950s. After 1980, soil erosion has become even more intense, which is consistent with the reinforcement of human activities, the drastic loss of vegetation cover in the upstream lands, especially, the exploitation of the open cast coalmine in the upstream of Huolin River at that time. Influenced by the inundation of the Huolin River, the heavy metal pollution historical trends in Xianghai marsh wetland could be roughly divided into three periods by analysis of sediment enrichment factor (K-SEF) and the index of geoaccumulation (I (geo)):1760-1880 AD, 1880-1980 AD, and 1980-now. Human activities accelerate the inputs of heavy metal, which leads to degradation of the marsh. This study also investigated on source of marsh sediments (by Ti/Al), redox condition [by V/Cr and V/(V + Ni)], and salinization indicators (by Sr/Ba and Rb/K). The results demonstrate that sources of sediments and redox conditions were partly similar for both riparian and depressional marshes. Besides, some differences in degree of salinization between two types of marsh were also identified, especially after 1880.

AB  - Heavy metal(loid)s contamination in soil is a major environmental concern that limits agricultural yield and threatens human health worldwide. Arsenic (As) is the most toxic non-essential metalloid found in soil which comes from various natural as well as human activities. S. persica is a facultative halophyte found abundantly in dry, semiarid and saline areas. In the present study, growth, mineral nutrient homeostasis, MDA content, phytochelatin levels, and ROS-scavenging attributes were examined in S. persica imposed to solitary treatments of salinity (250 mM and 750 mM NaCl), solitary treatments of arsenic (200 mu M and 600 mu M As), and combined treatments of As with 250 mM NaCl with an aim to elucidate salinity and As tolerance mechanisms. The results demonstrated that S. persica plants sustained under high levels of As (600 mu M As) as well as NaC1 (750 mM). The activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione reductase were either elevated or unaffected under salt or As stress. However, ascorbate peroxidase activity declined under both solitary and combination of As with NaCl. Furthermore, the cellular redox status measured in terms of reduced ascorbate/dehydroascorbate, and reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratios also either increased or remained unaffected in seedlings treated with both solitary and combined treatments of As + NaCl. Significant accumulation of various oxidative stress indicators (H2O2 and O-2(center dot-)) were observed under high As stress condition. However, presence of salt with high As significantly reduced the levels of ROS. Furthermore, exogenous salt improved As tolerance index (Ti) under high As stress condition. The values of translocation factor (Tf) and As bioaccumulation factor (BF) were > 1 in all the treatments. From this study, it can be concluded that the facultative halophyte S. persica is a potential As accumulator and may find application for phytoextraction of arsenic-contaminated saline soil.

AB  - Objective Intensive ambulatory assessment, such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), is increasingly used to capture naturalistic patient-reported outcomes. EMA design features (eg, study duration, prompt frequency) vary widely between studies, but it is not known if such design decisions influence potential subjects' willingness to participate in a study. We hypothesise that intentions to participate will be higher in studies that are less burdensome and have higher reward (eg, compensation).
   Design This experimental study examined if four EMA study design features (study duration, prompt frequency, prompt length, compensation) affected intentions to participate in a hypothetical EMA study and participation appraisals (eg, participation effort). Participants were randomly assigned to conditions (reflecting a fully crossed design of the four features, each with two levels). Each condition presented a vignette describing a study (each a unique combination of design features) and asked them to report on likelihood of participating and study appraisals.
   Participants A convenience sample of participants (n=600; 46% female, Mage=40.39) were recruited using an online service.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary outcomes were willingness to participate (No/Yes) and reported participation likelihood (0-100 scale). Secondary outcomes included appraisals of interest, enjoyment, effort, and if the study makes a valuable contribution to science.
   Results We examined main effects, and two-way interactions for participation likelihood, across study design features. Overall, reported willingness to participate and participation likelihood were high (89%, M=83.90, respectively). Shorter study duration, fewer prompts, shorter prompts and higher compensation increased willingness to participate and elicited higher participation likelihood (each associated with similar to 6%-8% increases). Findings suggested that more intensive studies were judged as somewhat less interesting and enjoyable, and requiring more effort.
   Conclusion Hypotheses were generally supported. Design features influence behavioural intentions to participate in, and appraisals of, EMA studies. Implications for participant recruitment and generalisability, and remaining research questions, are discussed.

AB  - To reconstruct the timing and underlying forcing of major shifts in the composition of terrestrial ecosystems in arid Central Asia during the late Cenozoic (past similar to 7 Ma), we carry out palynological analysis of lake sediments from the Qaidam Basin (NE Tibetan Plateau, China). Our results show that the steppe/semi-desert biomes dominating the Qaidam Basin experienced marked turnovers at similar to 3.6 and 3.3 Ma. Most notably, the younger of these turnover events is characterized by a two- to three-fold expansion of Artemisia at the expense of other steppe/semi-desert taxa. This turnover event led to the replacement of the Ephedraceae/Chenopodiaceae-dominated and Nitraria-rich steppe/semi-deserts that were dominant in the Qaidam Basin during the Paleogene and abundant during the Miocene by Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae-dominated steppe/semi-deserts as they exist until today. The vegetation turnover events are synchronous with shifts towards drier conditions in Central Asia as documented in climate records from the Chinese Loess Plateau and the Central North Pacific Ocean. On a global scale, they can be correlated to early glaciation events in the Northern Hemisphere during the Pliocene. Integration of our palynological data from the Qaidam Basin with Northern Hemisphere climate-proxy and regional-scale tectonic information suggests that the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau posed ecological pressure on Central Asian plant communities, which made them susceptible to the effects of early Northern Hemisphere glaciations during the late Pliocene. Although these glaciations were relatively small in comparison to their Pleistocene counterparts, the transition towards drier/colder conditions pushed previously existing plant communities beyond their tolerance limits, thereby causing a fundamental reorganization of arid ecosystems. The Artemisia dominance since similar to 3.3 Ma resulting from this reorganization marks a point in time after which the Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae pollen ratio can serve as a reliable indicator for moisture availability in Central Asia.

AB  - Dead wood is a key forest structural component for maintaining biodiversity and storing carbon. Despite its important role in a forest ecosystem, quantifying dead wood alongside standing trees has often neglected when investigating the feasibility of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in forest inventories. The objective of this study was therefore to develop an automatic method for detecting and characterizing downed dead wood with a diameter exceeding 5 cm using multi-scan TLS data. The developed four-stage algorithm included (1) RANSAC-cylinder filtering, (2) point cloud rasterization, (3) raster image segmentation, and (4) dead wood trunk positioning. For each detected trunk, geometry-related quality attributes such as dimensions and volume were automatically determined from the point cloud. For method development and validation, reference data were collected from 20 sample plots representing diverse southern boreal forest conditions. Using the developed method, the downed dead wood trunks were detected with an overall completeness of 33% and correctness of 76%. Up to 92% of the downed dead wood volume were detected at plot level with mean value of 68%. We were able to improve the detection accuracy of individual trunks with visual interpretation of the point cloud, in which case the overall completeness was increased to 72% with mean proportion of detected dead wood volume of 83%. Downed dead wood volume was automatically estimated with an RMSE of 15.0 m(3)/ha (59.3%), which was reduced to 6.4 m(3)/ha (25.3%) as visual interpretation was utilized to aid the trunk detection. The reliability of TLS-based dead wood mapping was found to increase as the dimensions of dead wood trunks increased. Dense vegetation caused occlusion and reduced the trunk detection accuracy. Therefore, when collecting the data, attention must be paid to the point cloud quality. Nevertheless, the results of this study strengthen the feasibility of TLS-based approaches in mapping biodiversity indicators by demonstrating an improved performance in quantifying ecologically most valuable downed dead wood in diverse forest conditions.

AB  - The high nutrient concentration associated with the mixing dynamics of two warm and cold water masses supports high primary production in the Yellow Sea. Although various environmental changes have been reported, no recent information on small phytoplankton contribution to the total primary production as an important indicator for marine ecosystem changes is currently available in the Yellow Sea. The major objective of this study is to determine the small (< 2 mu m) phytoplankton contribution to the total primary production in the Yellow Sea during August, 2016. In this study, we found relatively lower chlorophyll a concentrations in the water column than those previously reported in the central waters of the Yellow Sea. Moreover, the overall contribution of small phytoplankton (53.1%) to the total chlorophyll a concentration was considerably higher in this study than that (10.7%) observed previously. Based on the N/P ratio (67.6 +/- 36.6) observed in this study, which is significantly higher than the Redfield ratio (16), we believe that phytoplankton experienced P-limiting conditions during the study period. The average daily carbon uptake rate of total phytoplankton in this study was 291.1 mg C m(-2) d(-1) (+/- 165.0 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) and the rate of small phytoplankton was 205.7 mg C m(-2) d(-1) (+/- 116.0 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) which is 71.9% (+/- 8.8%) of the total daily carbon uptake rate. This contribution of small phytoplankton observed in this study appears to be higher than that reported previously. Our recent measured primary production is approximately 50% lower than the previous values decades ago. The higher contributions of small phytoplankton to the total chlorophyll a concentration and primary production might be caused by P-limited conditions and this resulted in lower chlorophyll a concentration and total primary production in this study compared to previous studies.

AB  - Heavy metal content is assumed to be the most important edaphic factor determining vegetation composition on contaminated soil. We compared the relationships between vegetation composition and heavy metal content at 23 mining sites in the Hart Mountains in Germany with those of other soil environmental factors. 120 releves were assigned to the Armerierum halleri which was subdivided into three subassociations, A. cladonietosum, A. typicum and A. achilletosum. Within each of the latter subassociations a Typical variant and a Cardaminopsis halleri variant were classified. The first axis of a DCA was positively correlated with Ellenberg's indicator values for soil reaction, nitrogen and moisture, and the concentration of calcium, and negatively with the concentration of copper and the proportion of stones, indicating that these variables were most important for vegetation differentiation. Soil concentrations of lead and exchangeable zinc did not differ significantly between the communities, while concentrations of copper and water-soluble zinc were highest in the A. cladonietosum and lowest in the A. achilletosum. Ellenberg's indicator values for nitrogen indicate poorest nutrient conditions in the A. cladonietosum where soil depth was especially low and richest conditions in the A. achilletosum where soil depth was higher. Logistic regression showed that the presence of the metallicolous Minuartia verna subsp. hercymica increased with the concentration of soluble zinc in the soil, while the presence of Armeria maritima subsp. halleri and Cardaminopsis halleri decreased with increasing concentration of copper. Armeria was furthermore strongly negatively affected by altitude, while Cardaminopsis was positively affected by soil depth and moisture. Silene vulgaris var. humilis was neither influenced by heavy metals nor by other environmental factors. A comparison of the recent number of slag heaps with those listed in a 75 year old study demonstrates a strong decline of these habitats and their specific vegetation due to both human destruction and natural succession. - We conclude that heavy metals are by far not the only factor controlling vegetation on metalliferous soils. At the mining sites investigated vegetation is also strongly controlled by low soil fertility.

AB  - In geological history, volcanism is closely related to the deposition of many black shales. However, the specific mechanism between volcanism and the deposition of black shales is still unclear. The black shales developed in the Chang 7 Member of the Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin are considered the most important hydrocarbon source rocks in Central China. The shales are deposited by frequent volcanic activities and preserved by extremely rich volcanic ash layers, making them an excellent example when investigating the influence of volcanism on the deposition of black shales. In this paper, petrographic, mineralogical, and geochemical analyses of three typical tuff and black shale segments of the Chang 7 Member were carried out. The productivity indicators [total organic carbon (TOC), P/Al, Ni/Al, and Cu/Al], redox indicators (V/Al, Mo/Al, U/Al and U/Th), and clastic influx indicators (Ti/Al and Sigma REE) of the shales basically increased together in the longitudinal direction, and a relatively good positive correlation existed between P/Al, Ni/Al, Cu/Al, V/Al, Mo/Al, U/Al, U/Th, Ti/Al, Sigma REE, and TOC. This finding indicated that the development of the Chang 7 black shales is the result of a combination of high primary productivity, anoxic conditions, and increased clastic influx. Considering that increased clastic influx may dilute organic matter, many phosphate nodules represented high productivity above the volcanic ash layers, and anoxic conditions are likely to be the result of a large amount of organic matter degradation indicated by the covariations of TOC versus P/Al and TOC versus Ba/Al. Therefore, the Chang 7 black shales in this study may be mainly controlled by the increased primary productivity. In addition, compared with the Weathering Index of Parker of background shales (not the contact clip or tuff layer), that of the black shales was significantly reduced after tuff deposition. On the contrary, the clastic influx indicators, redox indicators, productivity indicators of black shales significantly increased. This finding suggested that a series of environmental effects, such as enhanced weathering of terrestrial sources, increased clastic influx, anoxic water, and productivity bloom, was likely caused by volcanic activity. Considering that hydrothermal activity at the same time as volcanism may not cause productivity bloom, the nutrients (P/Al and Fe/Al) of the Chang 7 tuffs were significantly depleted, and the total sulfur content of black shales was much higher than that in ordinary freshwater sedimentation. Therefore, this paper reviewed and proposed the volcanism hypothesis model of the Chang 7 black shales. Volcanism generates large amounts of SO2 and volcanic ash. SO2 forms large areas of acid rain and accelerates terrigenous weathering with an increase in the lake land-based sources of debris and nutrient supply, while volcanic ash is decomposed and releases nutrients. These phenomena lead to biological productivity bloom and massive accumulation of organic matter, which in turn results in lake water anoxia and the eventual formation of black shales.

AB  - Plant height is an important phenotypic trait that can be used not only as an indicator of overall plant growth but also a parameter to calculate advanced traits such as biomass and yield. Currently, cotton plant height is primarily measured manually, which is laborious and has become a bottleneck for cotton research and breeding programs. The goal of this research was to develop and evaluate a high throughput phenotyping (HTP) system using depth images for measuring cotton plant height under field conditions. For this purpose, a Kinect-v2 camera was evaluated in a static configuration to obtain a performance baseline and in a dynamic configuration to measure plant height in the field. In the static configuration, the camera was mounted on a partially covered wooden frame and oriented towards nadir to acquire depth images of potted cotton plants. Regions of interest of plants were manually selected in the depth images to calculate plant height. In the dynamic configuration, the Kinect-v2 camera was installed inside a partially covered metal-frame that was attached to a high-clearance tractor equipped with real time kinematic GPS. A six-step algorithm was developed to measure the maximum and average heights of individual plots by using the depth images acquired by the system. System performance was evaluated on 108 plots of cotton plants. Results showed that the Kinect-v2 camera could acquire valid depth images of cotton plants under field conditions, when a shaded environment was provided. The plot maximum and average heights calculated by the proposed algorithm were strongly correlated (adjusted R-2 = 0.922-0.987) with those measured manually with accuracies of over 92%. The average processing time was 0.01 s to calculate the heights of a plot that typically has 34 depth images, indicating that the proposed algorithm was computationally efficient. Therefore, these results confirmed the ability of the HTP system with depth images to measure cotton plant height under field conditions accurately and rapidly. Furthermore, the imaging-based system has great potential for measuring more complicated geometric traits of plants, which can significantly advance field-based HTP system development in general.

AB  - Understanding which environmental conditions are critical for species survival is a critical, ongoing question in ecology. These conditions can range from climate, at the broadest scale, through to elevation and other local landscape conditions, to fine scale landscape patterns of land cover and use. Remote sensing is an ideal technology to monitor and assess changes in these environmental conditions at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, with many studies focusing on the physiological state of vegetation derived from time series of satellite measurements. As vegetation occurs within specific climatic zones, over certain soil, terrain, and land cover types, it can be difficult to decipher the influence of the underlying role of climate, topography, soil, and land cover on the observed vegetation signal. In this article, we specifically addressed this problem by asking the question: what is the relative impact and importance of these different scales of environmental drivers on the temporal and spatial patterns observed on a habitat index derived from remotely sensed data? To find the solution, we utilized a SPOT VEGETATION-normalized difference vegetation index time series of Europe to create a remote-sensing-derived habitat index, which incorporates aspects of productivity, seasonality, and cover. We then compared the observed temporal and spatial variations in the index to a pan-Europe terrestrial classification system, which explicitly incorporates variations in climate, terrain, soil parent material, land cover, and use. Results indicated that the most accurate level of discrimination from the habitat index was at the broadest level of the hierarchy, climate, while the poorest degree of discrimination was associated with elevation. In terms of similarity on the index across time and space, we found that arable and forest cover classes were more similar across elevation and parent materials than across other land cover types within them. Analyzing the remote-sensing index, at multiple scales, provides significant insights into the drivers of satellite-derived greenness indices, as well as highlights the benefit and cautions associated with linking satellite-derived indirect indicators to species distribution modeling and biodiversity.

AB  - Management of large herbivores depends on providing habitats for forage supply and refuge from risks of temperature, predation and disease. Moose (Alces alces) accumulate body energy and nutrient stores during summer, while reducing the impact of warm temperatures through physiological and behavioural thermoregulation. Building on the animal indicator concept, we used rumen temperature sensors and GPS collars on captive moose (n = 6) kept in large natural enclosures to evaluate how behaviour and habitat selection influence the rate of change in rumen temperature during the growing season on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, USA. We compared movement and habitat selection of individual females during tolerance days (daily amplitude in rumen temperature was >= 1.2 degrees C in 24 h) with those of control days (daily amplitude in rumen temperature was < 1.2 degrees C) before and after the tolerance day. Moose moved more during tolerance days (172 m . h(-1); 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 149-191 m . h(-1)) than on control days (151 m . h(-1); 95% CI = 128-173 m . h(-1)). The rate of change in rumen temperature (degrees C . h(-1)) declined with low to moderate movement rates that were probably associated with foraging in all habitats. Movement only increased the rate of change in rumen temperature at high activity (similar to > 500 m . h(-1)). Additionally, the relationship between rate of change in rumen temperature and movement rate was different during tolerance and control days in open meadow and wetland habitats. In all habitats except wetlands, the rate of change in rumen temperature increased while resting, which probably is a result of diet-induced thermogenesis. Our study demonstrates that the behavioural choices of moose on the landscape are associated with the rate of change in rumen temperature and their ability to thermoregulate. Wildlife managers must consider high-value habitats where wildlife can employ both behavioural and physiological mechanisms to tolerate warm ambient conditions in a landscape of forage, predators and pests.

AB  - Fecal coliform bacteria (FCB) contamination of natural waters is a serious public health issue. Therefore, understanding and anticipating the fate and transport of FCB are important for reducing the risk of contracting diseases. The objective of this study was to analyze he impacts of climate change on he fate and transport of FCB. We modified both the soil and the in-stream bacteria modules in the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model and verified the prediction accuracy of seasonal variability of FCB loads using observations. Forty bias correcting GCM-RCM projections were applied in the modified SWAT model to examine various future climate conditions at the end of this century (2076-2100). Lastly, we also compared the variability of FCB loads under current and future weather conditions using multi-model ensemble simulations (MMES). The modified SWAT model yielded a satisfactory performance with regard to the seasonal variability of FCB amounts in the soil and FCB loading to water bodies. The modified SWAT model presented substantial proliferation of FCB in the soil (30.1%-147.5%) due to an increase in temperature (25.1%,). Also, increase in precipitation (53.3%) led to an increase in FCB loads (96.0%-115.5%) from the soil to water body. In the in-stream environment, resuspension from the stream bed was the dominant process affecting the amount of FCB in stream. Therefore, the final FCB loads increased by 71.2% because of the growing peak channel velocity and volume of water used clue to an increase in precipitation. Based on the results of MMES, we concluded that the level of FCB would increase simultaneously in the soil as well as in stream by the end of this century. This study will aid in understanding the future variability of FCB loads as well as in preparing an effective management plan for FCB levels in natural waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 1. Phenological changes have been observed in a variety of systems over the past century. There is concern that, as a consequence, ecological interactions are becoming increasingly mismatched in time, with negative consequences for ecological function.
   2. Significant spatial heterogeneity (inter-site) and temporal variability (inter-annual) can make it difficult to separate intrinsic, extrinsic and stochastic drivers of phenological variability. The goal of this study was to understand the timing and variability in breeding phenology of Adelie penguins under fixed environmental conditions and to use those data to identify a "null model" appropriate for disentangling the sources of variation in wild populations.
   3. Data on clutch initiation were collected from both wild and captive populations of Adelie penguins. Clutch initiation in the captive population was modelled as a function of year, individual and age to better understand phenological patterns observed in the wild population.
   4. Captive populations displayed as much inter-annual variability in breeding phenology as wild populations, suggesting that variability in breeding phenology is the norm and thus may be an unreliable indicator of environmental forcing. The distribution of clutch initiation dates was found to be moderately asymmetric (right skewed) both in the wild and in captivity, consistent with the pattern expected under social facilitation.
   5. The role of stochasticity in phenological processes has heretofore been largely ignored. However, these results suggest that inter-annual variability in breeding phenology can arise independent of any environmental or demographic drivers and that synchronous breeding can enhance inherent stochasticity. This complicates efforts to relate phenological variation to environmental variability in the wild. Accordingly, we must be careful to consider random forcing in phenological processes, lest we fit models to data dominated by random noise. This is particularly true for colonial species where breeding synchrony may outweigh each individual's effort to time breeding with optimal environmental conditions. Our study highlights the importance of identifying appropriate null models for studying phenology.

AB  - The study aims were to replicate initial findings of an environmental preference/environment type "congruence effect" on judgements of perceived restoration potential (Wilkie and Stavridou, 2013. Urban For. Urban Greening, 12,163) and explore if this congruence influenced restoration outcomes. University students (N =120) categorized themselves as 'country' or 'city' persons to indicate environmental preference (nature, urban), viewed an imagery slideshow of one environment (nature, urban green space, urban street), and completed pre-post imagery measures of directed attention, mood, and fatigue. They also rated environments like those in the slideshow for perceived restoration potential and then completed a place identity measure in reference to their preferred environment. The use of the dichotomous environmental preference variable as an indicator of place identity was supported with equal, moderateto-high levels of place identity reported by both groups. An environment type main effect indicated better positive/negative mood and fatigue outcomes for those in the nature condition compared to the urban street condition. Urban green space exposure resulted in a better improvement to negative mood compared to urban street exposure. Nature and urban green spaces provided equivalent changes in direct attention, mood, and fatigue. There was no environment type effect on directed attention or perceived restoration potential. The environmental preference/environment type congruence findings replicated the previously reported effect on perceived restoration potential (Wilkie and Stavridou, 2013. Urban For. Urban Greening, 12, 163). The highest ratings were after exposure to congruent nature environments and the lowest from exposure to urban street imagery incongruent with a nature preference. A pattern of both significant and non-significant results across outcomes indicated the congruence effect was more evident in those who preferred nature; urban preferences resulted in similar benefits outcomes across environments. These findings support growing evidence urban green spaces provide a range of benefits; and suggest person-place concepts such as place identity should also be considered in restoration research.

AB  - Freshwater inputs are major drivers of circulation, hydrographic structure, and productivity patterns along estuarine systems. We assessed the degree to which meroplankton community structure in the Baker/Martinez fjord complex (Chilean Patagonia, 47.5 degrees S) responds to spatial and temporal changes in hydrographic conditions driven by seasonal changes in Baker river outflow. Zooplankton and hydrographic measurements were conducted along the fjord in early spring (October) and late summer (February), when river outflow was minimal and maximal, respectively. Major meroplankton groups found on these surveys were larval barnacles, crabs, bivalves and gastropods. There was a clear change in community structure between October and February, explained by a switch in the numerically dominant group from barnacle to bivalve larvae. This change in community structure was related to changes in hydrographic structure along the fjord, which are mainly associated with seasonal changes in the Baker river outflow. A variance partition analysis showed no significant spatial trend that could account for the variation in meroplankton along the Martinez channel, whereas temporal variability and environmental variables accounted for 36.6% and 27.6% of the variance, respectively. When comparing meroplankton among the Baker and Martinez channels in October, changes in environmental variables explained 44.9% of total variance, whereas spatial variability accounted for 23.5%. Early and late-stage barnacle larvae (i.e. nauplii and cyprids) were more abundant in water with lower temperature, and higher dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a concentration, whereas bivalve larvae were more strongly associated to warmer waters. The seasonal shift in numerical dominance, from barnacle larvae in early spring to bivalve larvae in late summer, suggests that reproduction of these groups is triggered by substantially different sets of conditions, both in terms of hydrography and food availability. The analysis of a monthly zooplankton time series showed that barnacle nauplii were most abundant in spring, and one order of magnitude more abundant than cyprids. Larvae of decapods were most abundant in summer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A robust technique was developed to identify Phytophthora cinnamomi using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC) coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID) for analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Six fiber types were evaluated and results indicated that the three-phase fiber 50/30 mu m divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) had the highest extraction efficiency for both polar and nonpolar GC columns. The maximum extraction efficiency (equilibrium absorption) was achieved 16 h after fiber exposure in the HS. Absorbed compounds on the fiber were completely desorbed in the GC injector after 5 mm at 250 C. Compared with the nonpolar column, the polar column showed optimum separation of VOCs released from R cinnamomi. Under the optimized HS-SPME and GC/FID conditions, lower detection limits for the four external standards was found to be between 1.57 to 27.36 ng/liter. Relative standard deviations <9.010% showed that the method is precise and reliable. The method also showed good linearity for the concentration range that was analyzed using four standards, with regression coefficients between 0.989 and 0.995, and the sensitivity of the method was 10(4) times greater than that of the conventional HS method. In this study, the VOC profiles of six Phytophthora spp. and one Pythium sp. were characterized by the optimized HS-SPME-GC method. The combination of the VOCs creates a unique pattern for each pathogen; the chromatograms of different isolates of R cinnamomi were the same and the specific VOC pattern of P. cinnamomi remained consistently independent of the growth medium used. The chromatograms and morphological studies showed that R cinnamomi released specific VOCs at different stages of colony development. Using the optimized HS-SPME GC method, identification of P. cinnamomi from 15 in vivo diseased soil samples was as high as 100%. Results from this study demonstrate the feasibility of this method for identifying P. cinnamomi and the potential use of this method for physiological studies on R cinnamomi.

AB  - Three alluvial units, ranging from the middle to late Holocene in age, were distinguished in Bardenas Reales Natural Park (Ebro Basin, NE Spain) based on morphosedimentary analysis and radiocarbon data. In this sensitive Mediterranean alluvial system, the succession and isotopic composition of gastropods greatly contribute to establishing the prevailing palaeoenvironmental conditions. The oldest unit (4763 +/- 87 to 2848 +/- 55 cal. yr BP) represents fluvial channels and swamped areas, includes the greatest proportion of aquatic gastropods (Ancylus fluviatilis and Lymnaea truncatula) and marsh species (Vallonia pulchella) and presents the most negative values of delta O-18 (mean -2.21 parts per thousand PDB). The intermediate unit (1403 +/- 60 to 836 +/- 65 cal. yr BP) shows a high rate of alluvial activity related to irregular torrential rainfall, with sedimentary features of aridity, and this unit includes only dry open ground gastropods (Xeroplexa sp., Chondrinidae indet. and Granopupa granum) and presents the least negative values of delta O-18 (mean -1.17 parts per thousand PDB). The youngest unit (191 +/- 97 to 127 +/- 82 cal. yr BP) exhibits a recurrence of flooding events, mostly includes marsh (Truncatellina callicratis and Lauria cylindracea) and aquatic (Lymnae truncatula) species and shows a very heterogeneous isotopic signal, with -1.83 parts per thousand PDB as the mean value of delta O-18. As a consequence, a palaeoenvironmental pattern comprised of an early wetter/colder phase followed by a warmer/drier period and, finally, an increase in both cold conditions and hydrological variability, is deduced for the middle to late Holocene in the Ebro Basin. Gastropod shell delta C-13 values, related to vegetation, can also be linked to palaeoenvironmental changes. The succession and stable isotope composition of gastropods in alluvial sequences are revealed as very sensitive indicators of rapid Holocene climatic changes in fragile semi-arid landscape systems.

AB  - The Picos de Europa are a range of predominantly Carboniferous Limestone and Sandstone mountains mainly in the Cantabrian region of northern Spain. The highest peaks are precipitous and reach 2600 m. There are complex gradients between Lusitanian, Alpine and Mediterranean environmental zones, as well as variable soil types. In combination with the long history of traditional agricultural management, a wide range of diverse habitats and species is present. The herb-rich hay meadows have long been recognised as having a high nature conservation value but, as elsewhere in European mountains, such grasslands are threatened by changing agricultural practices. Accordingly, in 1993, 92 quadrats were recorded using a restricted list of indicator species from stratified random samples. The authors repeated the sample in 2009. Changed land use had only occurred in approximately 3% of meadows, however, farmyard manure was no longer used, probably because of shortage of labour. Statistical analysis of the vegetation data showed a range of significant changes consistent with the increased use of slurry, as well as re-seeding of some fields. The grass swards had not only become denser, with fewer species present, but there was also a loss of sensitive indicators especially of calcareous conditions and open vegetation. By contrast, competitors had increased and the vegetation had become simpler, with the balance of vegetation types shifting to more nutrient rich conditions. These changes have mainly occurred in the more fertile meadows used for silage. The core of about 35% of herb-rich meadows, mainly cut for hay, has remained relatively stable but the results show that they are at risk if the current trend continues. If management practices that form the core of traditional agriculture are not maintained, one of the most important resources of herb-rich meadows in Europe will be lost. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The paper presents a new algorithm for finding the best-fit age-depth model of a peat profile dated with C-14. This algorithm of free-shape modelling is useful when the age-depth curve is wiggly and difficult to approximate by a simple mathematical function. The performance of the free-shape algorithm is illustrated with the example of the MA2 peat profile from Mauntschas mire, using 29 radiocarbon dates spanning the last 1300a, and where the age-depth Curve revealed a relatively complicated shape.
   The best-fit age-depth model searched for is a Curve maximising the 'Fit quality', defined as a combination of fit of C-14 dates to the radiocarbon calibration Curve, general smoothness of the age-depth line, and similarity of relative changes in the modelled sediment accumulation rates to those Suggested by independent data. The algorithm of free-shape age-depth modelling searched for a reasonable equilibrium or compromise between the conditions above. Uncertainty of the free-shape model was assessed with a Monte Carlo Markov chain built from large number of age-depth lines accepted with probabilities dependent on the 'fit quality' defined as above.
   Parallel fluctuations in concentrations of most pollen taxa in MA2 strongly Suggest a complicated shape of the age-depth curve, which is Supported in the upper part of the profile by the record of spheroidal carbonaceous particles, and in some levels also by the C-14 dates. A modification of total pollen concentrations was therefore used as a quantitative indicator of relative changes of the peat accumulation rate. The use of pollen concentrations improved the fit of the C-14 dates in several cases.
   Application of the final age-depth model to the pollen data resulted in a diagram of pollen accumulation which allows interpretation in ecological terms, whereas age-depth models that did not use pollen concentrations led to problematic and Confusing results. The obtained age-depth model is therefore accepted as a good approximation of the actual conditions. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study focused on characterizing air-surface mercury Hg exchange for individual surfaces (soil, litter-covered soil and plant shoots) and ecosystem-level flux associated with tallgrass prairie ecosystems housed inside large mesocosms over three years. The major objectives of this project were to determine if individual surface fluxes could be combined to predict ecosystem-level exchange and if this low-Hg containing ecosystem was a net source or sink for atmospheric Hg. Data collected in the field were used to validate fluxes obtained in the mesocosm setting. Because of the controlled experimental design and ease of access to the mesocosms, data collected allowed for assessment of factors controlling flux and comparison of models developed for soil Hg flux versus environmental conditions at different temporal resolution (hourly, daily and monthly). Evaluation of hourly data showed that relationships between soil Hg flux and environmental conditions changed over time, and that there were interactions between parameters controlling exchange. Data analyses demonstrated that to estimate soil flux over broad temporal scales (e.g. annual flux) coarse-resolution data (monthly averages) are needed. Plant foliage was a sink for atmospheric Hg with uptake influenced by plant functional type and age. individual system component fluxes (bare soil and plant) could not be directly combined to predict the measured whole system flux (soil, litter and plant). Emissions of Hg from vegetated and litter-covered soil were lower than fluxes from adjacent bare soil and the difference between the two was seasonally dependent and greatest when canopy coverage was greatest. Thus, an index of plant canopy development (canopy greenness) was used to model Hg flux from vegetated soil. Accounting for ecosystem Hg inputs (precipitation, direct plant uptake of atmospheric Hg) and modeled net exchange between litter-and-plant covered soils, the tallgrass prairie was found to be a net annual sink of atmospheric Hg.

AB  - The effect of chlorophyll concentration, light intensity and leaf temperature on the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio F685/F730 of intact leaves was evaluated. Fluorescence reabsorption that affects mainly the F685 band increases with chlorophyll concentration. This phenomenon was studied on an aurea mutant of tomato and its wild type, with very different chlorophyll content. Fluorescence spectra of the two genotypes were corrected for reabsorption using their transmittance and reflectance properties. The correction removes most of the differences in the two fluorescence spectra. The F685/F730 decreases during the declining phase of the fluorescence induction kinetics. We demonstrated that when red light is used to induce the fluorescence kinetics the variation of F685/F730 is not due to a change in the leaf absorption, as proved by the simultaneous measurement of leaf transmittance. This evidence suggests that the F685/F730 ratio is sensitive to changes in the photosynthetic activity of the leaf Under natural conditions, the F685/F730 ratio markedly decreases as light intensity and leaf temperature increase during a daily cycle. This behaviour can be due to photoinhibitory and heat stresses. In controlled laboratory conditions, the F685/F730 ratio was seen to decrease under high light intensity (>1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) at constant leaf temperature. It decreases also when leaf temperature was decreased from 25 degrees C to 14 degrees C at low light intensity (150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). A possible interpretation of these experimental data relies on a non-negligible contribution of PST to the total fluorescence at physiological temperatures with respect to PSII fluorescence. Changes in the photosynthetic activity of the two photosystems may induce variation in the F685/F730 ratio. Our results indicate that light intensity and leaf temperature are Important parameters to take into account when the F685/F730 ratio is used as stress indicator.

AB  - Travertines from Tivoli area (Central Italy) possess abundant shrub-like fabrics that are laterally continuous over hundreds of square meters. They occur dominantly in horizontal layers with aggradational and progradational stacking patterns. Their fabrics and morphologies are remarkably similar to the shrubs lithotypes reported in literature for the Pre-Salt reservoirs, offshore Brazil and Angola, with huge oil accumulations. Petrographic and micro-computer tomography analyses allowed the identification of six shrub morpho-types (i.e., narrow dendriform, wide dendriform, fili dendriform, arborescent, arbustiform and pustular). Dendriform shrubs are the most common lithotype in Tivoli area, and three different subtypes could be distinguished according to the arrangement of their branches. The shrubs consist largely of peloidal micritic, aggregates engulfed in spar calcite, ranging in average from 1 to 3 cm in height. The shrubs are interpreted to have developed in very shallow extensive waterlogged slightly inclined flat areas, changing laterally into a slope system with crusts as the main lithotype. Changes in the hydrodynamic conditions with episodes of stagnancy influenced the shrub morpho-types making them very variegated.
   Shrub morphologies likely reflect specific (micro-) environments that are controlled by water flow rates, evaporation and microbial activity. The latter processes influenced shrub fabric and morphology. Under high flow conditions, CO2 degassing is the main process leading to carbonate precipitation. Consequently, denser and tightly packed morphologies will precipitate, composing mainly the crust lithotype. In this scenario microbes are less dominant. Dendriform shrubs, with narrow, wide and fili morphologies are interpreted to occur in moderate to low energy water flows. Narrow dendriform shrubs reflect faster flowing conditions, with decreasing impact of flow on the morphological aspects from wide dendriform shrubs to fili dendriform shrubs. Slow to very slow flowing waters are more characteristic for the arborescent, arbustiform and pustular shrubs that possibly are highly influenced by evaporation. A decrease of water flow likely allows higher microbial activity, and consequently, shrub morphologies become more fragile and enriched in peloidal micritic aggregate fabrics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - P>1. The distributions of subfossil remains of chironomid larvae in 28 large, deep and stratified lakes in Europe were examined in surface sediments along a latitudinal transect ranging from northern Sweden to southern Italy.
   2. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that summer surface water and July air temperature, as well as total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, hypolimnetic oxygen availability and conductivity were statistically significant (P < 0.05) explanatory variables explaining between 11 and 14% of the variance in the chironomid data.
   3. Owing to the spatial scale covered by our study, many environmental variables were covarying. Temperature, TP concentration and oxygen availability were positively or negatively correlated with the first axis of a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of chironomid assemblages, suggesting that climatic and trophic conditions influenced profundal chironomid assemblages either in a direct (food and oxygen) or in an indirect (temperature) way. Parameters related to local environmental conditions, lake morphology and bedrock geology, such as organic matter content of the sediment, maximum lake depth, Secchi depth and pH, were not significant in explaining the distribution of chironomid assemblages in our study lakes.
   4. The strong relationship between chironomid assemblages and summer temperature may be related to the covariation of temperature with parameters, such as nutrient and oxygen availability, known to affect chironomid assemblages in deep, stratified lakes. However, summer temperature explained a statistically significant proportion of the variance in the chironomid assemblages even when effects of oxygen availability and TP concentrations were partialled out. This suggests that summer temperature has an effect on chironomid assemblages in deep lakes, which is not related to its covariation with trophic state.
   5. The potential of fossil chironomid analysis for quantitatively reconstructing past nutrient conditions in deep, stratified lakes was examined by calculating the Benthic Quality Index (BQI) based on subfossil chironomids and by comparing BQI values with observed TP concentrations. BQI was linearly related to log-transformed TP. Applying this relationship to fossil chironomid assemblages from Lake Paijanne (Finland) produced a TP reconstruction in agreement with measured TP during the period 1970-1990, demonstrating that this approach can provide quantitative estimates of past nutrient concentrations in deep, stratified lakes.

AB  - The Qiangtang Basin is the largest Mesozoic marine basin in the Tibetan Plateau. The Upper Triassic black mudstones are among the most significant hydrocarbon source rocks in this basin. Here, we present geochemical data for the Upper Triassic black mudstones to determine their paleoenvironment conditions, provenance, and tectonic setting. To achieve these, 30 black mudstones formed in various sedimentary environments were collected from the Zangxiahe, Zana, and Bagong formations. The results show that the total REE concentrations of mudstones from these formations range from 169 to 214 ppm, 204 to 220 ppm, and 141 to 194 ppm, respectively. All samples have chondrite-normalized REE patterns with enrichment of LREE, depletion of HREE and negative Eu and Ce anomalies. Specifically, mudstones from the Bagong Formation exhibit higher negative Eu anomalies and lower REE contents than those from the Zangxiahe and Zana formations.
   Mudstones from the Zangxiahe and Zana formations with low Sr/Ba and Sr/Cu ratios indicate the humid climate, whereas the high Sr/Ba and Sr/Cu ratios of rocks from the Bagong Formation suggest the arid climate. The low U/Th, (Cu + Mo)/Zn, V/Cr and Ni/Co ratios of rocks from the Zangxiahe, Zana, and Bagong formations are indicators of oxidized conditions. The bivariate diagrams (TiO2 vs. Al2O3, TiO2 vs. Zr, La/Th vs. Hf, and Co/ Th vs. La/Sc) reveal that mudstones from the Zangxiahe and Zana formations were potentially derived from intermediate igneous rocks, whereas mudstones from the Bagong Formation were probably sourced from felsic igneous rocks. Their source rocks are mostly deposited in the collisional setting. REE of mudstones from the Zangxiahe, Zana, and Bagong formations were possibly originated from terrigenous detritus, with minor non-terrigenous contributions into the Zana samples. The REE contents of these mudstones are controlled mainly by terrigenous detrital minerals, rather than by the paleoclimate, paleoredox conditions, or organic matter. However, calcite minerals could dilute REE. Therefore, the REE contents of the Bagong Formation mudstones are significant lower than those of the Zangxiahe and Zana formations mudstones.

AB  - Background: The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) calculated from narrow-band spectral reflectance data is a vegetation index which is increasingly used as an indicator of photosynthetic activity. The leaf-level link between the status of photosynthetic apparatus and PRI has been robustly established under controlled light conditions. However, when a whole canopy is measured instantaneously, the PRI signal is heavily modified by vegetation structure and local variations in incident light conditions. To apply PRI for monitoring the photosynthesis of whole canopies under natural conditions, these large-scale measurements need to be validated against simultaneous leaf PRI. Unfortunately, PRI changes dynamically with incident light and has a large natural variation. No generally accepted procedure exists today for determining the PRI of canopy elements in situ.
   Results: We present a successful procedure for in situ measurements of needle PRI. We describe, characterize and test an optical measurement protocol and demonstrate its applicability in field conditions. The measurement apparatus consisted of a light source, needle clip, spectroradiometer and a controlling computer. The light level inside the clip was approximately two-thirds of that on sunlit needle surfaces at midday. During each measurement the needle was inserted into the clip for approximately 5 s. We found no near-instantaneous changes (sub-second scale jumps) in PRI during the measurements. The time constants for PRI variation in light to full shade acclimations were approximately 10 s. The procedure was successfully applied to monitor the greening-up of Scots pine trees. We detected both facultative (diurnal) PRI changes of 0.02 (unitless) and constitutive (seasonal) variations of 0.1. In order to reliably detect the facultative PRI change of 0.02, 20 needles need to be sampled from both sunlit and shaded locations.
   Conclusions: We established a robust procedure for irradiance-dependent leaf (needle) PRI measurements, facilitating empirical scaling of PRI from leaf (needle) to full canopy level and the application of PRI to monitoring the changes in highly structured vegetation. The measured time constants, and facultative and constitutive PRI variations support the use of an artificial light for in situ PRI measurements at leaf (needle) level.

AB  - Tropical estuaries are characterised by high spatial and temporal variability in the conditions they provide for living organisms, which in turn may affect their biochemical composition. Anthropogenic contaminants such as nutrients, antibiotics, pesticides and trace metals may also affect the biochemical composition of these coastal organisms, notably with regard to fatty acids (FA), of which optimal species-specific polyunsaturated FA ratios are required to maintain living species in healthy conditions. The objective of this study was to evidence changes in the FA profile of four ubiquist benthic species in relation to the salinity gradient of a human impacted and mangrove dominated tropical estuary (Can Gio, Southern Vietnam). Among the four benthic species studied, two exhibited spatial and seasonal changes in their FA composition: the varunid crab Metaplax elegans and the predatory mangrove murex snail Chicoreus capucinus. Proportions of the FA 16:1 omega 7, proportions of highly unsaturated FA and ratios of eicosapentanoic acid/arachidonic acid in the tissues of both species seemed related to upstream inputs. Different relative abundances of benthic microalgae affected both claw muscle and hepatopancreas FA composition of M. elegans, while the FA composition of C. capucinus shows that the influence of prey's diet might be transferred within trophic chains. Finally, some species, such as Nerita balteata and Metapenaeus ensis might have more adaptive capacities, because of their mobility, or because of their specific metabolic pathways, minimizing the potential impact of spatial and/or temporal changes in food resources quality. A starvation experiment involving N. balteata actually revealed the metabolic synthesis of non-methylene interrupted FA that may confer cell membranes a higher resistance to external stressors than common polyunsaturated FA. Our study highlights the future possibility of using the FA composition of sentinel organisms (i.e. feeding on specific food resources and/or especially subject to environmental stresses) as a bioindicator tool to assess mangrove ecosystems health.

AB  - Monitoring changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle and vegetation health can only be undertaken over large areas and on a regular basis using ecological indicators derived from satellite-based sensors. Climate conditions in Mediterranean ecosystems have undergone, and are projected to undergo, significant change in the future with marked impacts on forest and shrubland vegetation. In the southwest of Australia (SWAU), endemic tree species have experienced significant declines in health and mortality since the early 1990s primarily due to these climatic changes. In this paper we examine trends in Net Primary Production (NPP) from 2000 to 2011 as an indicator of productivity and health condition of the woody vegetation across the SWAU region. To do so, we examine NPP estimates derived from satellite imagery and climate data to answer the questions: (1) what is the extent and rate of change in NPP for the SWAU region over the study period, and (2) how important is fire as a contributing factor in the observed trends? Our results suggest that, similar to the global trend in Mediterranean ecosystems, between 2000 and 2011, overall NPP declined across the study region, with the majority of declines occurring in the ecological transition zone between trees and shrubs. Twenty-six percent of the 37,042 square kilometre of woody vegetation that showed a declining NPP trend, was affected by fire. The overall rate of NPP decline for the region was estimated to be 0.38 megaton C per year since 2000, indicating a reduction in the capacity of the region to act as a carbon sink. Under climate change projections, the observed decline trends are likely to continue and our results suggest that the carbon storage potential in this region is gradually decreasing following an ecological shift from tall tree-dominated to lower shrub-dominated vegetation.

AB  - Usnea hirta, an important member of the lichen family Parmeliaceae, has long been used as a bio-monitor of air pollution, particularly of sulphur dioxide in North America. Although U. hirta has a wide geographical distribution, it is important to be able to identify accurately the optimal habitat conditions for air pollution-sensitive species, thus making it possible to more effectively and efficiently establish air quality bio-monitoring stations. We modelled the distribution of U. hirta as a function of nine variables, five macroclimatic variables: average monthly precipitation, average monthly minimum temperature, average monthly maximum temperature, solar radiation, and integrated moisture index, and four topographic variables: elevation, slope, aspect, and land forms and uses for the White River National Forest, Colorado. The response variable was developed based on the presence or absence of U. hirta at each of 72 bio-monitoring baseline sites established in selected portions of four intermountain area states. Our model was developed using Non-Parametric Multiplicative Regression (NPMR) analysis, a modelling approach that analyzes environmental gradients, or predictor variables, against known locations for individuals of the model species. Finally, we evaluated our model on the basis of log beta values and overall improvement over a naive model and the Monte Carlo Permutation Test with 1000 randomized runs. The best model for U. hirta included four variables - solar radiation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly minimum and maximum temperatures (log beta = 3.68). Among these four variables, average monthly maximum temperature was the most influential predictor (sensitivity 0.71) for the distribution of U. hirta. The occurrence rate for U. hirta, based on field validation, was 45.5%, 65.4%, and 70.4% for low, medium, and high probability areas, respectively. This study showed that our model was successful in predicting the distribution of U. hirta in the White River National Forest. Based on these results, the north-eastern and western portions of the forest appear to offer the most favourable conditions for the installation of future air quality bio-monitoring baseline sites.

AB  - Plants are subjected to various environmental stressors, both natural and artificial. Environmental stressors that lead to an excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may adversely affect physiology and well-being of organisms. The amount of ROS, therefore, could potentially be used to quantify environmental stresses in plants. In this study, the effect of changes in the water levels and elevation at which plants are located was examined in the drawdown zone of a flood control dam (Miharu dam), located in Fukushima in northern Japan. The Salix subfragilis willows are an important plant species in the reservoir as these plants are resistant to prolonged submerged conditions and provide the most suitable habitat for the growth and reproduction of many aquatic organisms. S. subfragilis growing in the drawdown zone exhibited high mortality rates from 2008 to 2016. Leaf samples of S. subfragilis were collected in the drawdown zone at different elevations shortly after drawdown (June), and several months after drawdown (August and October). The samples were taken under light exposure; additionally, dark-adapted (30 min) samples were collected in order to evaluate photosystem-induced ROS generation. The mortality rate of S. subfragilis trees was abnormally high over the previous years, particularly at higher elevated sites. Foliar H2O2 concentrations were significantly increased in samples collected at August and October samples, compared to June samples. Catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and guaiacol peroxidase activities were also increased, corresponding with the H2O2 content. No significant difference in H2O2 concentrations was found between samples from the lower edge of the drawdown zone and those collected at constantly inundated sites. The H2O2 concentration of light-and dark-treated samples indicated that there was no additional ROS accumulation due to photosynthesis. The results indicated that the high mortality of the trees was associated with long-term exposure to drought conditions due to the drawdown, although this was not confirmed by conventional monitoring. These findings support the use of H2O2 as an environmental stress indicator in vegetation management.

AB  - The alliance Cynosurion cristati has been found by various authors across the European continent. However, the fact that its diagnosis is based on species that are found in a wide range of geographical and ecological conditions and on the absence of grazing-sensitive species has rendered the characterization of this alliance somewhat complicated.
   The aims of this paper were: i) to investigate differences in the composition of some European mesophilous pastures, with particular focus on Italy; ii) to assess the main factors underlying these changes; iii) to evaluate the need for a new classification for such communities in the Italian peninsula. We used previously published data from several other European countries and both published and unpublished data from Italy. A synoptic table of data from different parts of Europe was analysed by means of hierarchical clustering. We used Multi-Response Permutational Procedure and phi coefficient to test differences between Cynosurion clusters and identify their diagnostic species. We performed Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling on a table of 111 Italian releves. Kendall's correlation coefficient was calculated by relating the releve scores in the ordination with the geographical, environmental variables, and with the Ellenberg indices relative to soil conditions. The first axis scores were also used as the dependent variable in a regression tree. Important compositional differences were found within the Cynosurion cluster, with significant differences emerging between the Apennine pastures in central and southern Italy and those in northern and central Italy. The first axis ordination was strongly related to the latitudinal/thermal gradient. Indeed, latitude and temperature were the most important variables in the regression tree. Our results highlight marked compositional variation in Cynosurion grasslands. This variation, which is related in the Italian peninsula to bioclimatic and biogeographical factors, led us to propose a rearrangement of the existing classification of the alliance for this part of Europe.

AB  - Soils and sediments downstream of Midland, Michigan, USA have elevated polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) concentrations. To determine if the PCDD/DF concentrations have the potential to adversely affect terrestrial avian predators, a site-specific, multiple lines of evidence risk assessment was conducted for the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus; GHO). As long-lived resident top predators, the GHO has the potential to be exposed to relatively great concentrations of bioaccumulative compounds such as PCDD/DF. From 2005 to 2008, concentrations of PCDD/DF were measured in blood plasma of adult and nestling GHOs and addled eggs. Indicators of the condition of the population, including abundance and reproductive success, were collected along 115 km of river corridor. Fifty-five active 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) equivalents (TEQ(WHO-Avia)) nests were monitored in 21 breeding territories from 2005 to 2008. The geometric mean concentration in blood plasma of GHOs was greater in the study area (SA) than in the reference area (RA) for both adults (RA: 3.1; SA: 9.4 ng TEQ(WHO-Avian)/kg) and nestlings (RA: 0.82 ng TEQ(WHO-Avian)/kg, SA: 2.1 ng TEQ(WHO-Avian)/kg) GHOs, but less than concentrations expected to cause adverse effects based on laboratory studies. Concentrations of TEQ(WHO-Avian) in addled GHO eggs were also greater in the SA than the RA (50 and 7.3 ng/kg, wet weight, respectively), but were less than concentrations expected to cause adverse effects. The GHO population condition and productivity were both greater in the study area than in the reference area and were similar to other GHO populations. This result suggests the GHO population in the Tittabawassee River floodplain is consistent with what would be expected for this area. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:2341-2349. (C) 2010 SETAC

AB  - Metabolism is an integrative measurement of stream and river ecosystem functioning, and thus, could be used to assess impairment. Stream metabolism is measured by different methods which often yield contrasting results. Furthermore, open-channel measurements of metabolism, which offer the best potential for continuous monitoring of stream functioning, rely on calculations of gas exchange with the atmosphere, for which a plethora of methods exists. Therefore, to incorporate metabolism in stream monitoring programs, it is necessary to determine which methods yield comparable results under a given set of environmental conditions. We studied 21 streams in the Basque Country (northern Spain), ranging widely in physical characteristics and water quality. We calculated reaeration during summer baseflows using three different approaches: the night-time drop in oxygen, the lag between noon and peak oxygen concentration, and ten empirical equations relating depth and velocity with reaeration coefficients obtained from the literature. Differences among methods were very large, especially at the shallower sites. The results obtained with most empirical equations were highly correlated, but showed little agreement with the night-time and peak lag methods. We then analyzed the response of reaeration rate to river stage: reaeration calculated by the night-time method during 1 year of continuous monitoring was regressed against discharge at each site, and the resulting model was compared to the results of empirical equations, using software HecRas 2.2 to model hydraulic conditions at different river stages. The shape of reaeration-discharge plots differed greatly and in a site-dependent manner, and there was little agreement between methods. Finally, we investigated the effects of reaeration rate on estimates of metabolism. The choice of method greatly affected the estimates of both primary production and respiration. The empirical equations, except E-7 and E-10, yielded the most unrealistic estimations of stream metabolism. Overall, the night-time method, especially when regressed against discharge, seems to be the most robust and reliable among those tested, with the energy dissipation method (E-10) appearing to be a viable alternative when the night-time method does not work.

AB  - The management of contemporary agriculture is rapidly shifting from single-goal to multi-goal strategies. The bottleneck of implementing the strategies is the capacity of predicting the simultaneous impacts of change in management practices on agricultural production, soil and water resources and environmental safety. Process-based models provide an opportunity to quantify the impacts of farm management options on various pools and fluxes of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in agroecosystems. The denitrification-decomposition or DNDC model was recently modified for simulating N cycling for the U.S. Midwestern agricultural systems. This paper reports a continuous effort on applying the model for estimating the impacts of alternative management practices (e.g., no-till, cover crop, change in fertilizer rate or timing) on agroecosystems in the Midwestern U.S. A typical row-crop field in Iowa was selected for the sensitivity tests. The modeled results were assessed with a focus on four major indicators of agro-ecosystems, namely crop yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, nitrate-N leaching loss and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The results indicated that no-till practice significantly increased SOC storage and reduced nitrate-N leaching rate, but slightly decreased crop yield and increased N2O emissions. By modifying the methods of fertilizer application in conjunction with the no-till practice, the disadvantages of no-till could be overcome. For example, increasing the fertilizing depth and using a nitrification inhibitor could substantially reduce N2O emissions and increase crop yield under the no-till conditions. This study revealed the complexity of impacts of the alternative farming management practices across different climate conditions, soil properties and management regimes. Process-based models can play an important role in quantifying the comprehensive effects of management alternatives on agricultural production and the environment. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A study using a participatory research approach and simple field techniques found significant differences in agroecological resistance between plots on "conventional" and "sustainable" farms in Nicaragua after Hurricane Mitch. On average, agroecological plots on sustainable farms had more topsoil, higher field moisture, more vegetation, less erosion and lower economic losses after the hurricane than control plots on conventional farms. The differences in favor of agroecological plots tended to increase with increasing levels of storm, intensity, increasing slope and years under agroecological practices, though the patterns of resistance suggested complex interactions and thresholds. For some indicators agroecological resistance collapsed under extreme stress.
   With the help of 19 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and 45 fanner-technician teams, 833 farmers measured key agroecological indicators on 880 plots paired under the same topographical conditions. These paired observations covered 181 communities of smallholders from southern to northern Nicaragua. The broad geographical coverage took into account the diversity of ecological conditions, a variety of practices common to sustainable agriculture in Nicaragua, and moderate, high and extreme levels of hurricane impact. This coverage, and the massive mobilization of farmer-technician field research teams, was made possible by the existence of the Movimiento Campesino a Campesino (MCAC) (farmer-to-farmer movement), a widespread smallholders' network for sustainable land management.
   An approach for measuring agroecological resistance is introduced, and it is suggested that comparatively higher levels of agroecological resistance are an indication of lower vulnerability and higher sustainability. However, the effectiveness of practices appears to be bounded by a combination of steep slopes, maintenance and design of soil conservation structures, and extremely high storm intensity.
   The study concludes that the participatory research can contribute significantly to the monitoring and development of sustainable land management systems (SLM) among smallholders, and recommends a sustainable, participatory approach to agricultural reconstruction following natural disasters.

AB  - Questions Vegetation in forest understories is determined by a complex interplay of many different environmental factors, including light, water and nutrient availability. Changes in these conditions, especially changes in nitrogen (N) availability, have been widely discussed to cause shifts in species composition and loss of oligotrophic species. We examined whether nitrogen is the most important factor for the decline of nitrogen-sensitive species in understorey communities, as measured by average Ellenberg N values and the share and number of nitrogen-sensitive character species. Location Nine different oligo-mesotrophic types of temperate forest in southwest Germany. Methods We combined understorey vegetation and soil data from 135 forest stands. To study the importance of variables in explaining the vegetation gradients, we used random forest analyses and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordinations combined with fitting of environmental vectors. Results We detected strong differences between three examined forest type groups: eutrophication in the understorey vegetation of broad-leaved forests on carbonate soils was strongly related to high canopy closure and low soil carbon/phosphorus (C/P) ratio. In broad-leaved forests on acidic soil, base saturation played a major role, but the vegetation was also influenced by the C/N and C/P ratios. In coniferous forests on acidic soil, soil pH and organic layer depth were important, as were the C/N, C/P and N/P ratios. Conclusion Our results show that eutrophication in understorey forest vegetation is not monocausal. Rather, oligotrophic species of forest communities are reduced at sites with higher N or P availability and/or higher base saturation and soil pH. These conditions favor fast-growing ubiquitous species in the competition for light and other limiting factors. Since these factors were of varying importance between the forest types examined, differences shaping the forest communities need to be regarded when evaluating the impact of environmental changes, for example through atmospheric nitrogen deposition.

AB  - 1. Anthropogenic noise can affect animals physically, physiologically, and behaviourally. Although individual responses to noise are well documented, the consequences in terms of community structure, species coexistence, and ecosystem functioning remain fairly unknown.
   2. The impact of noise on predation has received a growing interest and alterations in trophic links are observed when animals shift from foraging to stress-related behaviours, are distracted by noise, or because of acoustic masking. However, the experimental procedures classically used to quantify predation do not inform on the potential demographic impact on prey.
   3. We derived the relationship between resource use and availability (the functional response) for European minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) feeding on dipteran larvae (Chaoborus sp.) under two noise conditions: ambient noise and ambient noise supplemented with motorboat noise. The shape and magnitude of the functional response are powerful indicators of population outcomes and predator-prey dynamics. We also recorded fish behaviour to explore some proximate determinants of altered predation.
   4. For both noise conditions, fish displayed a saturating (type II) functional response whose shape depends on two parameters: attack rate and handling time. Boat noise did not affect handling time but significantly reduced attack rate, resulting in a functional response curve of the same height but with a less steep initial slope. Fish exhibited a stress-related response to noise including increased swimming distance, more social interactions, and altered spatial distribution.
   5. Our study shows the usefulness of the functional response approach to study the ecological impacts of noise and illustrates how the behavioural responses of predators to noise can modify the demographic pressure on prey. It also suggests that prey availability might mediate the negative effect of noise on predation. Community outcomes are expected if the reduced consumption of the main food sources goes with the overconsumption of alternative food sources, changing the distribution pattern of interaction strengths. Predation release could also trigger a trophic cascade, propagating the effect of noise to lower trophic levels.

AB  - Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food producing industries in the world. This dramatic increase in growth has raised many environmental concerns. Evaluation of fish farm effluent is frequently assessed by physicochemical parameters. This approach indicates potential degradation caused by the effluent and not cumulative effects on aquatic ecosystems. This study investigated relationships between physicochemical parameters (temperature, pH, conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen and suspended solids), typically used to assess water quality with the Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata algal bioassay, which evaluated the potential ecotoxicological effects that freshwater fish farm effluent has on its receiving ecosystems and organisms. Influent and effluent samples were collected from a freshwater farm facility every two weeks from April 2018 to October 2018 in the Republic of Ireland. This monitoring period coincided with one of the warmest and driest periods recorded by meteorological stations in the Republic of Ireland. Physicochemical analyses were found to be similar to those in other farm studies. After exposure of algae to the effluent, stimulation of algal growth rates increased by >50%. This stimulation was observed during periods of increased temperatures which were as a result of heat wave and drought conditions experienced during monitoring. Correlation studies identified a moderately strong relationship between algal stimulation and temperature (r = -0.619). This study discovered that removal of Lemna minor (aquatic plant), impacted strongly on the freshwater farm pond-process to cope with nitrates. The constructed wetland system was unable to efficiently treat nitrates and phosphates during conditions of drought. These findings indicate that standard water quality parameters may not be applicable to inform appropriate suitability of fish farm effluent for discharge to receiving water. The research conducted in this study has suggested a potential toolbox that includes P. subcapitata may provide an early warning system for adverse effects as a result of climate change.

AB  - We tested the use of phytoliths and seeds as bioindicators in the paleoenvironmental reconstruction of fluvial islands and compared the results with those of facies and pollen analyses. The studied material was taken from a 215 cm core drilled in Mutum Island. The study included a) the quantification and identification of phytoliths and seeds, b) the determination of the distribution of biological material in the island sediment and sedimentary facies, c) the determination of organic material contents, and d) a chronological analysis with three C-14 dates. This study also determined the distribution of seeds and phytoliths over the sedimentary environment succession. We identified the following distributions of seeds and phytoliths over the paleoenvironmental hydrach succession. 1) Channel paleoenvironment (eupotamic stage): the sediment was deposited under lotic flow conditions, with the occurrence of Podostemaceae phytoliths and a predominance of Poliygonaceae seeds. 2) Blind channel paleoenvironment (parapotamic stage): this environment, which occurred 725-935 cal yrs BP., demonstrated an increase in the quantity of Podostemaceae phytoliths and seed quantity alternations. 3) Lake paleoenvironment (paleopotamic stage): a change from the blind channel to lake environment occurred at 631-797 cal yrs BP. An increase in the phytolith concentration was associated with a saddle morphology peak and general decrease in seeds, except for over the 110-100 cm interval, with a high occurrence of Cecropiaceae and Lentibulariaceae seeds. 4) Present swamp environment (paleopotamic to terrestrial stage): the present environment was settled approximately 300 cal yrs BP. (uncertainties range) with phytoliths. The seed assemblage in the sediment resembles the current vegetation on the island. The variation in the types of phytoliths and seeds from the base to the top of the sedimentary column reflect changes in the vegetation with changes in the environmental conditions and the great potential for these structures to be paleoindicators in fluvial systems. The seed and phytolith data were compared with the pollen analysis results.

AB  - The relation between invasion success of Prunus serotina and type of recipient habitat was studied in a large forest in central Belgium. The major emphasis in this study was the determination of factors controlling the abundance of P. serotina in understory strata. Environmental variables measured in 34 sample plots were slope, aspect, litter depth, soil type, pH, soil compaction, soil moisture, air humidity, soil temperature and light intensity in spring and late summer. Site conditions were also expressed indirectly for 210 sample plots using Ellenberg indicator values (soil nutrients, acidity, moisture, light conditions). Plots with P. serotina had lower mean indicator values for soil moisture, reaction (pH) and nitrogen, compared to plots without P. serotina. Twenty indicator species were identified for plots in which P. serotina occurs. The species richness of the herb layer was negatively correlated with the percentage cover of black cherry in the shrub layer. The percentage cover of P. serotina saplings in different overstory types was ranked as follows: Quercus > Pinus > Fagus > logging areas. Only three variables explained significant amounts of variation in Prunus abundance: slope, light intensity at 120 cm in April and light intensity at ground level in September. We found a positive response of black cherry seedlings to light intensity between 58 and 80% of full light (April measurements at 120 cm), while saplings showed a negative response within this range. Between 21 and 47% of full light (April measurements at 120 cm), seedlings were poorly represented whereas saplings showed a quite high cover. Between 0.3 and 1.8% light (September measurements at ground level), seedlings were almost absent while saplings maintained a high abundance. The results suggest that P. serotina shows a differential response to light intensity in relation to its development stage, i.e. the species is heliophilous at the seedling stage and becomes a shade plant at the sapling stage.

AB  - Systematic variations in the abundances of C-13 in kerogens and in saturated hydrocarbons were used to assess the paleoenvironments of the Neocomian lacustrine and Aptian lagoonal to restricted marine-evaporitic sediments of the Pendencia and Alagamar Formations, respectively, from the Potiguar Basin, Brazil. In the Pendencia Formation, the isotopic compositions of compounds formed in the photic zone, i.e., pristane, beta-carotane, and some of the n-alkanes, vary only slightly with depth, suggesting invariable conditions in the surface environment. However, dramatic changes occur in the carbon-isotopic compositions of hopanoid biomarkers produced by organisms inhabiting the lower part of the water column of the Pendencia paleolake. Parts of the section having finely laminated sediments with no burrowing coincide with the most significant C-13 depletion of the hopanoids relative to algal products, indicating effective stratification of the water column and active recycling of methane. In the Alagamar Formation, isotopic compositions of the n-alkanes vary systematically with depth but not with carbon number, indicating dominance of a single source for all n-alkanes, independent of carbon number, and secular variations in the isotopic composition of that source. The latter variations can be correlated with global changes in the isotopic composition of marine dissolved inorganic carbon associated with the oceanic anoxic event that occurred in the Upper Aptian (OAE-1, [Arthur, M. A. and Schlanger, S. O. (1979) AAPG Bull. 63, 870-885]). The 17 alpha(H),21 beta(H)-C-30 hopane is the most depleted in C-13 among the compounds and reflects contributions from chemoautotrophs, and in extreme cases from methanotrophs. The covariations between the delta(13)C Values of pristane and phytane, and these acyclic isoprenoids and beta-carotane suggest a common origin from phytoplankton. Gammacerane has delta(13)C values compatible with a derivation from bacterivorous ciliates feeding on algae and cyanobacteria growing under variable paleoenvironmental conditions.

AB  - To improve water quality and alleviate eutrophication in a polluted urban lake, water diversion, a common method of basin management, is planned. In this study, we used the physiology-based water quality model, the General Ecosystem Module (GEM) in FVCOM, to investigate the potential influence of transferred water on the water quality index (WQI) and comprehensive eutrophication state index (TLI) of the lake. A fuzzy synthetic evaluation algorithm was applied to quantify the value of the WQI objectively. Our results indicate that total nitrogen and total phosphorus (TN and TP) are the most dominant pollutants influencing water quality, accounting for 63.6% of the weighting. In addition, overflow of municipal sewage after rainfall contributed to the decrease of the WQI (class IV in spring and class V in summer). This slow-flow shallow water body was categorised as a light eutrophic lake according to the TLI calculation. As an important factor that influences pollutant retention and water exchange, residence time (tau(e)) was also considered. A multi-objective optimisation method was used as an effective method to guide practical management, considering the hydrodynamic conditions (tau(e)), water quality (WQI) and economic cost (M). First, the WQI, tau(e) and economic cost of different parts of the lake were investigated under different inflow discharge scenarios using our combined approach. Then, the Wolves Colony Search Algorithm was used to minimise the dimensionless objective function, which is comprised of the three factors above. The calculated environmental water demand of Lake Gantang (GTL) and Lake Nanmen (NML) was 0.0456 and 0.0417 million m(3) d(-1), respectively. Under optimal water diversion conditions, this lake changes to a mesotrophic lake of class III with good water body exchange capacity. Overall, our combined model can be a guide for the local government and decision-makers and used to evaluate the optimal amount of transferred water at a minimum cost for inter-basin management.

AB  - Preservation and sustainable use of soil biological communities represent major challenges in the current agroecological context. However, to identify the agricultural practices/systems that match with these challenges, innovative tools have to be developed to establish a diagnosis of the biological status of the soil. Here, we have developed a statistical polynomial model to predict the molecular biomass of the soil microbial community according to the soil physicochemical properties. For this, we used a dataset of soil molecular microbial biomass estimates and pedoclimatic properties derived from analyses of samples collected in the context of the "French monitoring soil quality network=Reseau de Mesures de la qualite des Sols" (RMQS). This sampling network has provided 2115 soil samples covering the range of variability of soil type and land use at the scale of France. The best model obtained from the data showed that soil organic carbon content, clay content, altitude, and pH were the best explanatory variables of soil microbial biomass while other variables such as longitude, latitude and annual temperature were negligeable. Based on these variables, the multilinear model developed allowed very accurate prediction of the soil microbial biomass, with an excellent adjusted coefficient of determination R-adi(2) of 0.6772 (P <10(-3)). In addition to R-adj(2). the model was further validated by results from cross validation and sensitivity analyses. The model provides a reference value for microbial biomass for a given pedoclimatic condition, which can then be compared with the corresponding measured data to provide for the first time a robust diagnosis of soil quality. Application of the model to a set of soil samples obtained at the scale of an agricultural landscape is presented and discussed, showing the suitability of the model to diagnose of the impact of particular agricultural practices such as tillage and catch crops in field conditions, at least over the French nation.

AB  - Dry grasslands are highly diverse vegetation types of great importance for livestock production in rural Balkan areas. We analysed a large data set of phytosociological releves of dry grasslands (Festuco-Brometea and Festucetea vaginatae classes) in Serbia to produce the first overview of its classification, distribution, environmental conditions and biodiversity patterns. Phytocoenological releves from relevant literature sources and our own investigations were stored in the Vegetation Database of Serbia (EU-RS-002) and the Balkan Dry Grassland Database (EU-00-013). After heterogeneity-constrained random resampling, the final dataset contained 1,897 releves and 1,323 species. Species composition was classified hierarchically by the beta flexible method. We used species ecological indicator values for the estimation of the ecological conditions. Floristic and vegetation diversity and the conservation relevance of various dry grassland types, based on an assessment of endemic and protected species, were analysed. We identified 11 clusters, which were well characterised by their species composition and ecology. The first three clusters included loess and sand steppe grasslands mostly found in the Pannonian part of Serbia (Festucion rupicolae and Festucion vaginatae). The next three clusters consisted of Balkan ultramafic rocky grasslands of the order Halacsyetalia sendtneri, Balkan submediterranean mountain steppe grasslands on calcareous substrates, belonging to the order Astragalo-Potentilletalia and grasslands of the Balkan alliance Saturejion montanae on limestone. The third group of releves comprised Balkan alliances of dry grasslands on deep soils, the Chrysopogono-Danthonion and sub-continental steppes of the alliance Festucion valesiacae in hilly areas of Serbia, mostly in the thermophilous oak zone. According to ordination analysis (DCA), the main floristic gradient was largely determined by temperature and moisture. The Festuco-Brometea class exhibited high floristic diversity (1,323 plant species) and very high conservation relevance in view of the large number of Balkan endemic species (204). A total of 233 species and subspecies protected by national legislation within the studied vegetation were recorded.

AB  - Questions Can forest site characteristics be used to predict Ellenberg indicator values for soil moisture? Which is the best averaged mean value for modelling? Does the distribution of soil moisture depend on spatial information? Location Bavarian Alps, Germany. Methods We used topographic, climatic and edaphic variables to model the mean soil moisture value as found on 1505 forest plots from the database WINALPecobase. All predictor variables were taken from area-wide geodata layers so that the model can be applied to some 250 000 ha of forest in the target region. We adopted methods developed in species distribution modelling to regionalize Ellenberg indicator values. Therefore, we use the additive georegression framework for spatial prediction of Ellenberg values with the R-library mboost, which is a feasible way to consider environmental effects, spatial autocorrelation, predictor interactions and non-stationarity simultaneously in our data. The framework is much more flexible than established statistical and machine-learning models in species distribution modelling. We estimated five different mboost models reflecting different model structures on 50 bootstrap samples in each case. Results Median R2 values calculated on independent test samples ranged from 0.28 to 0.45. Our results show a significant influence of interactions and non-stationarity in addition to environmental covariates. Unweighted mean indicator values can be modelled better than abundance-weighted values, and the consideration of bryophytes did not improve model performance. Partial response curves indicate meaningful dependencies between moisture indicator values and environmental covariates. However, mean indicator values <4.5 and >6.0 could not be modelled correctly, since they were poorly represented in our calibration sample. The final map represents high-resolution information of site hydrological conditions. Conclusions Indicator values offer an effect-oriented alternative to physically-based hydrological models to predict water-related site conditions, even at landscape scale. The presented approach is applicable to all kinds of Ellenberg indicator values. Therefore, it is a significant step towards a new generation of models of forest site types and potential natural vegetation.

AB  - The goal of mangrove restoration projects should be to improve community structure and ecosystem function of degraded coastal landscapes. This requires the ability to forecast how mangrove structure and function will respond to prescribed changes in site conditions including hydrology, topography, and geophysical energies. There are global, regional, and local factors that can explain gradients of regulators (e.g., salinity, sulfides), resources (nutrients, light, water), and hydroperiod (frequency, duration of flooding) that collectively account for stressors that result in diverse patterns of mangrove properties across a variety of environmental settings. Simulation models of hydrology, nutrient biogeochemistry, and vegetation dynamics have been developed to forecast patterns in mangroves in the Florida Coastal Everglades. These models provide insight to mangrove response to specific restoration alternatives, testing causal mechanisms of system degradation. We propose that these models can also assist in selecting performance measures for monitoring programs that evaluate project effectiveness. This selection process in turn improves model development and calibration for forecasting mangrove response to restoration alternatives. Hydrologic performance measures include soil regulators, particularly soil salinity, surface topography of mangrove landscape, and hydroperiod, including both the frequency and duration of flooding. Estuarine performance measures should include salinity of the bay, tidal amplitude, and conditions of fresh water discharge (included in the salinity value). The most important performance measures from the mangrove biogeochemistry model should include soil resources (bulk density, total nitrogen, and phosphorus) and soil accretion. Mangrove ecology performance measures should include forest dimension analysis (transects and/or plots), sapling recruitment, leaf area index, and faunal relationships. Estuarine ecology performance measures should include the habitat function of mangroves, which can be evaluated with growth rate of key species, habitat suitability analysis, isotope abundance of indicator species, and bird census. The list of performance measures can be modified according to the model output that is used to define the scientific goals during the restoration planning process that reflect specific goals of the project.

AB  - Indices derived from hyperspectral reflectance spectra have the potential to be used as indicators of environmental stress in crops, This study uses canopy-scale. ground-based measurements of hyperspectral reflectance to demonstrate the temporal patterns in corn development under imposed fertility (N rate) and environmental (water availability) stresses. In 1998. two large areas in a 30-ha corn (Zea mays, L.) field near Ottawa. Canada (45degrees 18'N. 75degrees44'W) were supplied with 99 and 17 kg N ha(-1), while the balance of the field received the recommended rate of 155 kg N ha(-1). Reflectance measurements, ere taken time times using a portable spectroradiometer at georeferenced locations within these areas. Individual reflectance-based indices demonstrated the relative differences between application rates and identified both nitrogen and water stresses at various times in the growing season. No single index was able to describe the status of the corn crop throughout the season. Canonical discriminant analysis provided accurate classification of samples by N rate during early, mid, and late season conditions with overall success rates of 70%. 88%. and 93%', respectively. A shift in importance from green-based derivatives to red-based derivatives was noted from mid to late season and attributed to the natural reduction in green pigments as the crop entered senescence. Canopy-scale photochemical reflectance index (PRI) was shown to be cot-related with canopy radiation use efficiency (RUE). Mid-season water stress affected the relationship. Multiple years of data are required to demonstrate robust relationships between hyperspectral indices and corn ecophysiological status because of the interaction between environmental and nutrient stresses. Identifying areas of fields sensitive to weather-induced stresses will allow better management of N application. Timing the collection of hyperspectral image data at early and late vegetative phase could enhance precision agriculture by allowing supplemental nutrient application. identifying stress patterns and aid in yield forecasting.

AB  - This paper reports the results of Rock-Eval pyrolysis and total organic carbon analysis of 46 core and cuttings samples from Upper Cretaceous potential source rocks from wells in the West Sirte Basin (Libya), together with stable carbon isotope (C-13) and biomarker analyses of eight oil samples from the Paleocene - Eocene Farrud/Facha Members and of 14 source rock extracts. Oil samples were analysed for bulk (degrees API gravity and C-13) properties and elemental (sulphur, nickel and vanadium) contents. Molecular compositions were analysed using liquid and gas chromatography, and quantitative biological marker investigations using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry for saturated hydrocarbon fractions, in order to classify the samples and to establish oil-source correlations. Core and cuttings samples from the Upper Cretaceous Etel, Rachmat, Sirte and Kalash Formations have variable organic content and hydrocarbon generation potential. Based on organofacies variations, samples from the Sirte and Kalash Formations have the potential to generate oil and gas from Type II/III kerogen, whereas samples from the Etel and Rachmat Formations, and some of the Sirte Formation samples, have the potential to generate gas from the abundant Type III kerogen. Carbon isotope compositions for these samples suggest mixed marine and terrigenous organic matter in varying proportions. Consistent with this, the distribution of n-alkanes, terpanes and steranes indicates source rock organofacies variations from Type II/III to III kerogen. The petroleum generation potential of these source rocks was controlled by variations in redox conditions during deposition together with variations in terrigenous organic matter input. Geochemical analyses suggest that all of the oil samples are of the same genetic type and originated from the same or similar source rock(s). Based on their bulk geochemical characteristics and biomarker compositions, the oil samples are interpreted to be derived from mixed aquatic algal/microbial and terrigenous organic matter. Weak salinity stratification and suboxic bottom-water conditions which favoured the preservation of organic matter in the sediments are indicated by low sulphur contents and by low V/Ni and Pr/Ph ratios. The characteristics of the oils, including low Pr/Ph ratio, CPI approximate to l, similar ratios of C-27:C-28:C-29 -steranes, medium to high proportions of rearranged steranes, C-29 <C-30-hopane, low Ts/Tm hopanes, low sulphur content and low V/Ni ratio, suggest a reducing depositional environment for the source rock, which was likely a marine shale. All of the oil samples show thermal maturity in the early phase of oil generation. Based on hierarchical cluster analysis of 16 source-related biomarker and isotope ratios, four genetic groups of extracts and oils were defined. The relative concentrations of marine algal/microbial input and reducing conditions decrease in the order Group 4 > Group 3 > Group 2 > Group1. Oil - source rock correlation studies show that some of the Sirte and Kalash Formations extracts correlate with oils based on specific parameters such as DBT/P versus Pr/Ph, C-13(saturates) versus C-13(aromatics), and gammacerane/hopane versus sterane/hopane.

AB  - Many geological and geodynamical studies of metamorphism in subduction zones have relied upon worldwide compilations of modelled slab-top pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions, although recent evaluation of such data sets suggests that these predictions are similar to 100-300 degrees C colder at any given pressure than the conditions recorded by exhumed metamorphic rocks. As such, geochemical, petrological and geophysical interpretations formulated using such 'cold' assumptions may be subject to error and uncertainty. Here, we apply thermodynamic phase equilibrium calculations to forward-model how phase assemblages, the P-T conditions of key devolatilization reactions and the effect of densification with depth vary for typical mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) along these newly defined 'hotter' subduction zone geotherms for cold, warm and average environments. The depth and extent of devolatilization of MORB is strongly dependent on the geotherm along which the oceanic crust subducts. At the onset of subduction along a warm geotherm, metabasites contain similar to 3 wt% H2O and release similar to 45% of this fluid in a single pulse at similar to 20 km, correlating with chlorite and epidote breakdown. Below these depths, metamorphosed MORB will dehydrate incrementally due to gradual amphibole breakdown, becoming almost completely dehydrated at similar to 70 km. Oceanic crust subducting along an average geotherm will contain similar to 3.5 wt% of H2O at the onset of subduction and will release similar to 40% of the bulk-rock H2O in two fluid pluses occurring at similar to 30 and 50 km, correlating with chlorite breakdown. Below these depths, gradual dehydration of similar to 50% of the bulkrock H2O due to amphibole breakdown leads to near-complete dehydration at similar to 80 km. By contrast, in cold subduction zones, metamorphosed MORB will typically be H2O-undersaturated and will dehydrate gradually at different depths, transporting similar to 0.6 wt% H2O to sub-arc depths. As the volume of fluid released via these dehydration reactions differs strongly between cold, average and warm scenarios, different degrees of serpentinization of the mantle forearc are expected worldwide and thus, the efficacy of buoyancy-driven exhumation should vary strongly in space and time. Metabasites subducting along a warm and average geotherm will liberate most of the fluids at shallower depths, suggesting that these lithologies might preferentially exhume, yet MORB subducting along cold geotherms will not dehydrate until greater depths, inhibiting its return to the surface. Critically, while we show that metabasites formed along warmer geotherms are denser than metabasites from colder geotherms at any equivalent depth, buoyancy-driven exhumation provoked by fluids plays a notably more important role in exhumation potential than the overall bulkrock 'metamorphic' density. Furthermore, we show that lawsonite does not stabilize in average and warmer subduction zones, which provides a simple but important solution to the mismatch between its predicted abundance in experiments and its rarity in nature and argues against its use as a reliable petrogenetic indicator of subduction throughout deep geological time, as has been suggested by some recent studies.

AB  - Boron nitride (BN) nanomaterials have been increasingly explored for potential applications in chemistry and biology fields (e.g., biomedical, pharmaceutical, and energy industries) due to their unique physico-chemical properties. However, their safe utilization requires a profound knowledge on their potential toxicological and environmental impact. To date, BN nanoparticles have been considered to have a high biocompatibility degree, but in some cases, contradictory results on their potential toxicity have been reported. Therefore, in the present study, we assessed two commercial 2D BN samples, namely BN-nanopowder (BN-PW) and BN-nanoplatelet (BN-PL), with the objective to identify whether distinct physico-chemical features may have an influence on the biological responses of exposed cellular models. Morphological, structural, and composition analyses showed that the most remarkable difference between both commercial samples was the diameter of their disk-like shape, which was of 200-300 nm for BN-PL and 100-150 nm for BN-PW. Their potential toxicity was investigated using adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549 cells) and the unicellular fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as human and environmental eukaryotic models respectively, employing in vitro assays. In both cases, cellular viability assays and reactive oxygen species (ROS) determinations where performed. The impact of the selected nanomaterials in the viability of both unicellular models was very low, with only a slight reduction of S. cerevisiae colony forming units being observed after a long exposure period (24 h) to high concentrations (800 mg/L) of both nanomaterials. Similarly, BN-PW and BN-PL showed a low capacity to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species in the studied conditions. Even at the highest concentration and exposure times, no major cytotoxicity indicators were observed in human cells and yeast. The results obtained in the present study provide novel insights into the safety of 2D BN nanomaterials, indicating no significant differences in the toxicological potential of similar commercial products with a distinct lateral size, which showed to be safe products in the concentrations and exposure conditions tested.

AB  - Aquaculture is a growing global industry; freshwater aquaculture has significant potential for expansion in Canada, but growth of the freshwater sector has been slow due to concerns over potential environmental impacts and a lack of information on potential impacts to native fish communities. To provide guidelines and target variables for evaluating aquaculture impacts on freshwater fish communities, we operated an experimental aquaculture farm as a whole-lake experiment where 10,000 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were raised annually from 2003 to 2007. Impacts were assessed using up to 8years of pre-impact and 8-10years of post-impact data. Prey fish abundance increased dramatically during aquaculture but declined sharply following the experiment. High abundance of littoral minnows in autumn was not observed during spring and, combined with size distribution data, suggests high overwinter mortality of adult minnows. White sucker (Catostomus commersonii) abundance and body condition declined during and after aquaculture, with evidence of overwinter juvenile recruitment failure in the last 2 years of operation, although size-at-age increased. The adult abundance of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) doubled during aquaculture, due to a combination of (a) increased growth rates of young trout and (b) earlier age and larger sizes at maturation. Within 2years following aquaculture, lake trout abundance declined by nearly 50% to background levels, suggesting a large increase in lake trout mortality once operations ceased. These changes were not observed in nearby reference lakes. While aquaculture appeared to benefit some species (slimy sculpin [Cottus cognatus], minnows, lake trout), prolonged declines in white sucker abundance and condition and continued depression of Mysis densities and optimal oxythermal habitat availability nearly a decade following operations suggest potentially long-term impacts at this magnitude. Importantly, this experiment highlights important indicator species and life history traits for monitoring of freshwater aquaculture impacts on native fish communities.

AB  - Ocean warming (OW) and ocean acidification (OA) are threatening coral reef ecosystems, with a bleak future forecast for reef-building corals, which are already experiencing global declines in abundance. In contrast, many coral reef sponge species are able to tolerate climate change conditions projected for 2100. To increase our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning this tolerance, we explored the lipid and fatty acid (FA) composition of four sponge species with differing sensitivities to climate change, experimentally exposed to OW and OA levels predicted for 2100, under two CO2 Representative Concentration Pathways. Sponges with greater concentrations of storage lipid, phospholipids, sterols and elevated concentrations of n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated FA (LC PUFA), were more resistant to OW. Such biochemical constituents likely contribute to the ability of these sponges to maintain membrane function and cell homeostasis in the face of environmental change. Our results suggest that n-3 and n-6 LC PUFA are important components of the sponge stress response potentially via chain elongation and the eicosanoid stress-signalling pathways. The capacity for sponges to compositionally alter their membrane lipids in response to stress was also explored using a number of specific homeoviscous adaptation (HVA) indicators. This revealed a potential mechanism via which additional CO2 could facilitate the resistance of phototrophic sponges to thermal stress through an increased synthesis of membrane-stabilizing sterols. Finally, OW induced an increase in FA unsaturation in phototrophic sponges but a decrease in heterotrophic species, providing support for a difference in the thermal response pathway between the sponge host and the associated photosymbionts. Here we have shown that sponge lipids and FA are likely to be an important component of the sponge stress response and may play a role in facilitating sponge survival under future climate conditions.

AB  - Cover crops are used during fallow periods to produce ecosystem services, especially those related to N management such as (i) capturing mineral-N from soil to reduce nitrate leaching, and (ii) improving N availability for the next main crop (green manuring). Bispecific mixtures consisting of legume and non-legume species could simultaneously produce these two services of nitrate saving and green manuring. The magnitude of these services can be estimated from indicators of agroecosystem functions such as crop growth rate, crop N acquisition rate and the C:N ratio of the cover crop. We developed a conceptual model for each indicator which was described using general linear models. A three-step procedure was used: (1) represent the behavior of each species based on a sub-model and calibrate each species in bispecific mixtures; (2) validate the complete-mixture models, corresponding to the sum of the two species sub-models, and the proportion of each species in the whole cover, and (3) validate the generality of sub-models and complete-mixture models to predict the agroecosystem function indicators of species in mixture not used for calibration. The combined use of (i) potential agroecosystem functions measured in sole crop in non-limiting conditions, (ii) difference in leaf functional traits, as indicators of plant strategies and (iii) environmental factors, was efficient in fitting and predicting the level of agroecosystem functions provided by a cover crop species in mixture in actual conditions. The models fitted for bispecific mixtures were efficient to represent the behavior of each species in mixture and to estimate the legume proportion which expressed the species dominance. The models were evaluated as satisfactory for crop growth rate and C:N ratio for their generality in predicting the agroecosystem functions provided in mixtures by other species not used in the model calibration step, which illustrates the relevance and robustness of the approach.

AB  - 1. Ecological stoichiometry provides a framework for understanding how fitness relates to acquisition and use of elements. This framework predicts a trade-off between the ability to grow quickly under good food conditions and to minimize growth depression on low-phosphorus (P) diets. These traits should both be related in some way to organism P content, a commonly used proxy of P demand. 2. Previous tests using Daphnia species did not consistently support this prediction, whereas comparisons made across genera or higher taxonomic groups did. One explanation could be that body P content measured at one point in time is a poor indicator of P demand for growth over an interval. 3. We measured the rate of both mass and phosphorus gain of seven Daphnia species under contrasting food conditions, including low- and high-P algal diets. 4. Similar to other studies, we found no significant relationship between body P content and maximum growth rate or sensitivity to P limitation. On the other hand, Carbon (C) and P specific growth rates were linearly related (R-2=083) to all treatments and species with a positive intercept and slope less than one. This relationship indicates that rapid growth does require high-P accrual as predicted by the growth rate hypothesis. These results reveal a fundamental and unexpected relationship between growth and P demand that transcends species and diets. 5. C and P coupling in growth represents an alternative measure of P demand that confirms theoretical predictions concerning maximum growth rate, sensitivity to P limitation and P demand as well as revealing unpredicted linkages between P demand and the degree of stoichiometric homeostasis. The straight line coupling of C and P in growth represents a new framework for understanding C and P linkages that does not assume strict homeostasis, but does allow generalization across species and diets.

AB  - Nitrogen-limited soil microbial activity has important implications for soil carbon storage and nutrient availability, but previous methods for assessing resource limitation have been restricted, due to enrichment criteria (i.e., long incubation periods, high substrate amendments) and/or logistical constraints (e.g. use of radioisotopes). A microtiter-based assay of basal and substrate induced soil respiration based on O-2 consumption may be a rapid, ecologically relevant means of assessing N limitation. The present study evaluated this approach by examining 1) the extent and duration of N limitation on soil respiratory activity following different levels of N fertilization in the field, and 2) the relationship between N-limited activities and growth under the assay conditions. Fertilization rate and the time since fertilization had significant impacts on the degree of N limitation of soil microbial activity. The highest fertilization rate showed the earliest and most persistent reduction in N limitation, as would be predicted from the higher concentration of extractable inorganic soil N observed with this treatment. Bacterial growth under the assay conditions, as estimated by quantitative-PCR of 165 rRNA genes, was less than twofold in soils demonstrating a rapid respiratory response (i.e. peak within 6-8 h of initiating incubation) to up to fourfold in soils demonstrating a slower respiratory response (i.e., peak response after 14 h of incubation). Increased respiratory response with N amendment was usually associated with increased cell growth, although for rapidly responding soils some C sources showed N-limited use without growth. This was likely due to exhaustion of the relatively low levels of available C amendment before growth was detected. The method appears useful for assessing N-limited microbial growth, and it may be effective as a rapid indicator of bioavailable soil N. It may also be a tool to evaluate the complexity of N limitation among various metabolic pathways found in soil microbial communities, particularly if linked to dynamics in community structure and gene activation.

AB  - Continental slopes are presumed key areas for deposition of organic carbon exported from the shelf. Analysis of across-slope differences in diatom and silicoflagellate fluxes recorded in bottom sediments of the Goban Spur margin, a typical North Atlantic slope environment, was carried out to test if they can provide information on the magnitude of advection of material from the shelf into deeper waters. Total diatom and silicoflagellate accumulation rates showed strong across-slope differences. Minimum values are recorded at the shelf break where maximum surface productivity conditions occur while the deeper sampling stations record fluxes as high as 183x10(6) valves cm(-2) ka(-1). While high diatom fluxes show a clear correspondence with the activity of a permanent bottom nepheloid layer operating in the region, they do not correlate with productivity patterns observed in the water column. Diatom assemblages are mainly composed of Chaetoceros resting spores and Thalassionema nitzschioides (Grunow) Grunow ex Hustedt, typical indicators of spring bloom conditions in the area. The absence of clear across-slope trends in the diatom assemblages is interpreted as the effect of random mixing driven by the strong hydrodynamic regime provoked by the activity of the bottom nepheloid layer. The dominance of Chaetoceros resting spores across the slope is related to important exportation of shelf-derived production. However, due to the broad ecological tolerances of the main taxa composing the diatom assemblages, they do not allow precise estimations on the magnitude of the primary vertical flux vs, the secondary lateral flux in this slope environment. Use of the tychoplanktonic and benthic diatoms, which are restricted to the neritic realm, allows only the estimation of the minimum amount of shelf-derived diatoms reaching the slope sediments (at least 13% of the total diatom assemblage for the upper slope area of the Goban Spur). This study shows that major limitations exist for the use of diatoms preserved in surface sediments of this area as tracers of shelf-derived production transported to the continental slope.

AB  - Inter-annual and seasonal variations in zooplankton community structure in the Yellow Sea, China were studied in relation to climatic events and local environment from 2014 to 2018. Three zooplankton assemblages were identified based on cluster analysis, which were associated with seasonal temperature changes. Group 1 composed spring stations with moderate water column temperatures. The spring zooplankton assemblage had the highest mean total abundance with crustaceans, including euphausiids, amphipods and copepods dominating samples. Stations in the basin area during summer-autumn and all stations in winter composed Group 2, with low bottom water temperatures being a prominent feature. Zooplankton assemblage of Group 2 mainly consisted of a mixture of low-temperature species and some tropical species that were transported into the region by the Yellow Sea Warm Current. Coastal stations with high water temperature during summer-autumn made up Group 3. Zooplankton was characterized as summer-autumn neritic assemblage with high jellyfish abundance. Some meroplankton and brackish water species, i.e. Labidocera euchaeta, were indicator species confirming the influence of the river discharge. Both PDO (from positive to negative) and ENSO (from negative to positive) reversed their signs in 2016/2017. The abundances of total zooplankton, Noctiluca scintillans, Calanus sinicus and small copepods were much higher in spring of 2017-2018 compared to spring 2015 due to the warmer conditions. In addition, zooplankton community of summer 2017 was characterized by high abundances of copepods and gelatinous zooplankton, Diphyes chamissonis and Doliolum denticulatum. This was influenced by a strong river runoff and warm current transport, and differed from 2014 and 2016 summers. Our results suggest that a regime shift occurred in 2016/2017, which was supported by sharp changes in physical settings as well as zooplankton community structure in the Yellow Sea. However, a longer time series is required to uncover detailed processes and response mechanisms of environmental conditions of the Yellow Sea to climate change.

AB  - The radiation and extinction of East African vertebrate fauna have been linked to key climatic changes that occurred around 2.8, 1.7, and 0.5 Ma. This study tests whether vegetation and diet changes were linked to these climatic fluctuations, focusing on the climatic event at 1.7 Ma, by analyzing the stable isotope composition of fossil herbivore teeth from the Olduvai Gorge's stratigraphic units Upper Bed I, Lower Bed II, and Upper Bed II, which span similar to 1.83-1.33 Ma, in order to detect shifts in herbivore diets from C-3 to C-4 plants in conjunction with their drinking water isotope geochemistry. C-4 grass expansion is known to be favored by drier conditions, and this study tests whether herbivore diets permanently changed to being C-4 dominant at this key time period. Crocodile teeth are also tested to determine if they may be used as paleoclimatic indicators, since large crocodiles prey on terrestrial herbivores in wetland settings.
   Vertebrate bioapatite carbon and oxygen isotope compositions are found to show similar trends as those of pedogenic carbonates (carbonate nodules, or concretions), which reflect a drying environment that was changing from C-3 woodland dominated habitats to mixed woodlands and grasslands from Bed Ito Lower Bed II times. While a return to more humid conditions in Upper Bed II might be expected to lead to a reversal to C-3 plants, herbivores in this study retained mostly the drought-resistant C-4 plant diet. These results indicate that vegetation and ecosystems passed through a threshold to C-4 domination that did not revert to C-3 despite partial reversals in climate that occurred later. Crocodile teeth were not useful in tracking C-4 plant expansion, but the oxygen isotopes from modern crocodiles are able to show seasonal cycles from wet to dry seasons, and Bed I crocodiles indicate a degree of annual seasonal changes during that time as well.

AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers have become ubiquitous in the environment and elevated concentrations have often been found in marine organisms. Using the gastropod Crepiduia onyx as a study model, this multigenerational study sets out to test the hypotheses that 1) parental dietary exposure to environmentally realistic levels of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE-47) would lead to trans-generational impairments on fitness traits of marine invertebrates, and 2) the organisms might develop adaptation/acclimation after exposure for one or more generations. F-0 generation of C. onyx was fed with the dinoflagellate Isochrysis galbana encapsulated with two concentrations of BDE-47 (1.78 and 16.0 ng million cells(-1), respectively), and half of the F-1 offspring from the higher concentration treatment was returned to control condition (transgenerational group), while the other half received BDE-47 treatment continuously (continuous treatment group). Bioaccumulation and maternal transfer of BDE-47 were evident in all life stages of the F-0 generation and in F-1 eggs, respectively. Exposure to BDE-47 reduced fecundity, delayed sexual maturity, and impeded embryonic development in F-0 to F-2. In particular, developmental toxicity of F-2 embryos was apparent in the transgenerational group, but not in the continuous treatment group, even when BDE-47 was not detected in the F-2 embryos nor in their mothers and they have never been exposed to the chemical. This study also suggested that the offspring might have developed adaptation/acclimation to the exposure of BDE-47 within two generations of exposure, and that the physiological alterations associated with acclimation/adaptation might have hindered the normal larval development under a stress free condition. These findings highlighted the need for long-term multigenerational studies in the ecological risk assessment of chemicals alike. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coral reefs in the South China Sea are threatened by environmental changes and anthropogenic disruptions. Foraminifera, a group of unicellular shelled protists, has been considered a reliable indicator of water quality and reef health. However, this indicator has not yet been used to study coral reefs in the South China Sea. In this study of foraminifera in the lagoon of Dongsha Atoll, both the assemblage diversity and the functional group composition were investigated. The FORAM index (FI), a numerical indicator based on functional group composition, was used to evaluate the condition of the coral reef of the Atoll lagoon. A typical assumption is that FI = 4 is the minimum index value corresponding to a suitable environment for the growth of calcifying organisms. Environments with FI values between 2 and 4 are unsuitable to marginal for recovery of coral communities after a mortality event. Data were recorded regarding a total of 287 foraminiferal species. Approximately 68% of the tests belonged to the porcelaneous taxa; the Quinqueloculina, Triloculina, and Pseudomassilina species were well represented. Hyaline foraminifera were less abundant than porcelaneous foraminifera; the agglutinated foraminifera were the least abundant. Multivariate analyses revealed four clustering groups. The functional groups were classified according to FI's definition; the heterotrophic group was the most abundant, accounting for 82% of foraminiferal abundance. The symbiont-bearing group was the second most abundant, with a relative abundance of 12%; and the stress-tolerant group was the least abundant. Two samples had FI values slightly higher than 4; Amphisorus and Calcarina were dominant, but the other symbiont-bearing foraminifera had lower values. These high FI values can be associated with seagrass meadows or relict shells in an altered environment. Eighty percent of the sediment samples had FI values lower than 4, indicating that most of the benthic habitats in the Dongsha lagoon are not suitable for coral growth and reef recovery. The present findings provide an alternative evaluation method based on foraminiferal assemblages for future studies on the environmental changes of coral reefs.

AB  - Soil respiration (Rs) is the second largest carbon flux in terrestrial ecosystems and therefore plays a crucial role in global carbon (C) cycling. This biogeochemical process is closely related to ecosystem productivity and soil fertility and is considered as a key indicator of soil health and quality reflecting the level of microbial activity. Wildfires can have a significant effect on Rs rates and the magnitude of the impacts will depend on environmental factors such as climate and vegetation, fire severity and meteorological conditions post-fire. In this research, we aimed to assess the impacts of a wildfire on the soil CO2 fluxes and soil respiration in a semi-arid ecosystem of Western Australia, and to understand the main edaphic and environmental drivers controlling these fluxes for different vegetation types. Our results demonstrated increased rates of Rs in the burnt areas compared to the unburnt control sites, although these differences were highly dependent on the type of vegetation cover and time since fire. The sensitivity of Rs to temperature (Q10) was also larger in the burnt site compared to the control. Both Rs and soil organic C were consistently higher under Eucalyptus trees, followed by Acacia shrubs. Triodia grasses had the lowest Rs rates and C contents, which were similar to those found under bare soil patches. Regardless of the site condition (unburnt or burnt), Rs was triggered during periods of higher temperatures and water availability and environmental factors (temperature and moisture) could explain a large fraction of Rs variability, improving the relationship of moisture or temperature as single factors with Rs. This study demonstrates the importance of assessing CO2 fluxes considering both abiotic factors and vegetation types after disturbances such as fire which is particularly important in heterogeneous semi-arid areas with patchy vegetation distribution where CO2 fluxes can be largely underestimated.

AB  - Mining and ore excavation can cause the acidification and heavy metal pollution of downstream water systems. It can be difficult to assess the load contributions from individual mining areas, which is commonly required for environmental impact assessments. In the current study, we quantified the net impact of the unmonitored mining activities in the Zaamar Goldfield (Mongolia) on heavy metal transport in the downstream Tuul River-Selenga River-Lake Baikal water systems. We also noted that the Zaamar site shares the conditions of limited monitoring with many rapidly developing regions of the world. The heavy metal concentrations and flow data were obtained from historical measurement campaigns, long-term monitoring, and a novel field campaign. The results indicate that natural mass flows of heavy metals in dissolved form increased by an order of magnitude because of mining. Prevailing alkaline conditions in the vicinity of Zaamar can limit the dissolution, maintaining the on-site concentrations below health-risk based guideline values. However, suspended river concentrations are much higher than the dissolved concentrations. The placer gold mining at the Zaamar site has increased the total riverine mass flows of Al, As, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn by 44.300, 30.1, 65.7, 47.800, 1.480, 76.0 and 65.0 tonnes per year respectively. We suggest that local to regional transformation and enrichment processes in combination with suspended sediment transport from numerous existing upstream mining areas contribute to high concentrations of dissolved heavy metals in downstream parts of the Selenga River, including its delta area at Lake Baikal. Furthermore, single hydrological events can increase the suspended load concentrations by at least one order of magnitude. Overall, the Selenga River Basin, which drains into Lake Baikal, should be recognised as one of the world's most impacted areas with regard to heavy metal loads, and it contributes to 1% and 3% of the world flux of dissolved Fe and Pb, respectively.

AB  - Global climate change and invasive species represent two of the biggest threats to the environment. Biological communities are responding to global climate change through poleward shifts in distribution, and changes in abundance and phenology of both native and non-native species. An increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events is predicted with global climate change. Much is known about mortality events of marine organisms in relation to warm thermal stress with relatively little known about cold thermal stress, particularly in the tropics. Intertidal species are particularly susceptible to fluctuations in aerial conditions and many are considered indicators of climate change. Perna viridis is a recent invader to the United States where it fouls hard substrates and soft sediment habitats. During winter 2007/08, a mortality event was observed for P. viridis across Tampa Bay, Florida. This mortality event coincided with extreme weather conditions when air temperatures dropped below 2 degrees C for a period of 6 h during low water. The minimum air temperature recorded was 0.53 degrees C. During this period water temperature remained relatively constant (similar to 20 degrees C). We provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that thermal stress relating to exposure to cold air temperatures during emersion was the primary factor underpinning the mortality event. Similar mortality events occurred in 2009 and 2010, also coinciding with prolonged exposure to low air temperatures. In the short term, weather may be responsible for the temporary trimming back of populations at the edge of their geographic range but in the longer-term, it is expected that climate warming will trigger the poleward movement of both native and non-native species potentially facilitating biotic homogenisation of marine communities. The challenge now is to devise adaptive management strategies in order to mitigate any potential negative impacts to native biodiversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water quality programs in Connecticut and nationally have focused on restoring impaired waters, while modest attention has been allocated to healthy watersheds in the least disturbed condition. The objective of our study was to document the geographic location of least disturbed streams in Connecticut, describe the aquatic biota from these systems, and describe important environmental variables that may help explain the distribution of these biota. We used geographic information systems to select drainage basins by their natural attributes and by eliminating anthropogenic stressor variables in order to best approximate a least disturbed watershed condition in Connecticut. We then sampled the fish and macroinvertebrate communities, water chemistry, and associated GIS-derived watershed attributes to determine the variables that best described the sampled biota. We identified 30 least disturbed streams that had drainage areas <29 km(2), whose stream order ranged from 1-4, and that contained <4% total impervious cover in the upstream watershed. Least disturbed streams were generally located in three geographic areas of the state northwest Connecticut, northeast Connecticut, and the central Connecticut valley and were absent from the southern coast of Connecticut and southwestern Connecticut. Cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling of macroinvertebrate taxa in the Orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera showed 3 macroinvertebrate stream classes, with 12 significant indicator species (P < 0.05). Drainage area, water temperature, alkalinity, hardness, chloride, ammonia, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) may explain some of the differences in taxa between macroinvertebrate stream classes. Cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling of fish species also showed three fish stream classes, with 9 significant indicator species (P < 0.05). Drainage area, stratified drift, dam density, water temperature, total suspended solids, alkalinity, hardness, ammonia, TN, and TP may explain some of the differences in species between fish stream classes. Ninety percent of the least disturbed streams sampled contained Salvelinus fontinalis (Brook Trout), which can be considered a sentinel fish species for small, least disturbed streams in Connecticut.

AB  - Background Croatia, as a Member State of the European Union, has to shape its water policy in accordance with the European Union Water Framework Directive. One of the tasks is to determine whether groundwater are susceptible to anthropogenic changes that would result in a significant surface water status reduction as well as terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that directly depend on the groundwater. Methods Quality and quantity data on groundwater and surface water, as well as ecosystems data were collected from multiple sources. Data were analyzed for the selection groundwater associated aquatic and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Chemical time series data were analyzed and compared with the national guideline limits set by the Croatian water quality standard. The impact of the groundwater abstraction on the groundwater-dependent ecosystem was considered by analyzing the aquifer hydrogeological characteristics, as well as location of the pumping site in relation of the ecosystem, the pumping rate and groundwater level or discharge. Results In karst areas of Croatia, groundwater-dependent aquatic ecosystems are predominant; while in the Pannonian area of Croatia, typically, there are groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystems. The status of groundwater bodies was defined as good. The analyzed chemical parameters are at acceptable concentration levels. Groundwater abstraction does not adversely affect most ecosystems. However, many springs that are captured for the water supply dry up in the summer. Given that this is also a common phenomenon at springs not captured, it has to be expected that such environments will be inhabited by organisms that have already adjusted to these conditions. Many different bioindicators have been found to indicate a good chemical and quantitative state of groundwater. Conclusions To increase the degree of reliability, research monitoring has been proposed. The monitoring should reduce knowledge gaps including an increase of knowledge of the status of the ecosystems, the definition boundary conditions and threshold values of a good quantitative and qualitative status for individual ecosystems. In future prospects, unavoidable focus has to be climate change that may compromise the availability of groundwater resources.

AB  - Bacteria are the most important microorganisms in the world oceans, accounting for up to 75% of the total biomass. They are responsible for fundamental biogeochemical processes and therefore often used as ecological indicators. In this study, bacteria were quantified by flow cytometry and their diversity assessed by High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) in the southern Adriatic Sea. The most abundant bacterial groups were also quantified by qPCR. The samples were collected from the surface to the seabed over a total of 16 different depths at four stations during the late winter BIOTA (BIO-Tracing Adriatic water masses) cruise conducted in March 2016. The investigated area showed unusual water mass properties and was characterized by a shallow mixed layer, which differed from the usual winter convection conditions, typical of middle-altitude ecosystems and important for the seasonal picoplankton dynamics of this area. Heterotrophic bacteria were separated into HNA (relative High Nucleic Acid content) and LNA (Low Nucleic Acid content) subpopulations with abundances up to 1.8 x 10(5) and 8.8 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) respectively. HNA dominated at offshore stations reaching their maximum at depths below the euphotic zone. The bacterial community was dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, accounting for > 40% of the total sequence reads and were mainly represented by the SAR11 Glade (90.84%), followed by Marinimicrobia (18% of the total sequence reads), mainly represented by Glade SAR406 (8.44%). Distinctive bacterial groups were found in the euphotic layer (Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria) and aphotic layer samples (Deltaproteobacteria, Marinimicrobia, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes). Results of the qPCR analyses further confirmed HTS results with highest abundances obtained for Alphaproteobacteria, followed by Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The adopted multiple approach, combining different molecular tools, critically supported by optics and flow cytometry, reveal changes in the bacterial assemblages during the unusual thermohaline conditions observed in 2016 in the southern Adriatic Sea.

AB  - The forest management plan is the basic document on which the functioning of the forest district in a ten-years-long perspective is based. To maximize the usage, the economic expertise of the forest district administration (EEN) utilises in the large part of the analyses data available in the Information System of the State Forests, which can be obtained at the forest district level. The EEN consists of three basic parts: the general characteristics of the forest district, analysis of the past economy and a prognostic analysis. To preserve the operational character of the information, the most important parameters set for the forest district should be compared with the values for selected forest districts from regional directorates of the State Forests. The quality of the prognostic part of EEN depends primarily on the correctness of the adopted indicators and set values in the part analysing the effects of the past economy. The significance of this part of the EEN means that it should contain the most important elements related to plannable economic events and the related economic consequences. The introductory part of the EEN should start with presenting the background, the period and the principles of forest district functioning. One should remember that this document is not only prepared for the forest environment, but also for the people not related to forestry. In the main part of the expertise the natural, organizational and economic conditions of the forest management implementation in the given forest district are presented in a synthetic form. The economic expertise of the forest district is an expert study. Its primary goal is to determine the economic consequences of the implementation of the forest management plan prepared based on a synthetic assessment of the results of the past economy, taking into account the current conditions in the medium-term planning. The economic expertise for the forest management plan may be an important tool in improving the functioning of forest district and planning at various levels of management. The data contained there also allow to follow the dynamics of economic phenomena in the organizational units of the State Forests.

AB  - In the conditions of economic depression it is very important for each organization to make correct decisions regarding financing and investments, to effectively manage the assets, and to command the timely and correct accounting information that allows reflecting financial results of the organization.
   The effectiveness of the organization activity is determined by the level of provision with tangible fixed assets and its rational usage in economic processes. The aforementioned accounting is important in the management system of any organization that provides valuable information for the production organizers. The organization managers and specialists must have operative knowledge about tangible fixed assets, its physical condition, depreciation and level of provision. Such knowledge is useful for control of asset's reception and its turnover, while analyzing its usage effectiveness. (Domeika, 2008).
   In the organization activity, accounting is becoming the system of registration, grouping and generalization of economic operations expressed in money, which is meant to adopt economical decisions and make financial reports. According to Valanciene, Strumickas (2009), one of the main tools that help to guarantee successful activity of the organization, is flexible accounting system suitable for management of changes and timely informing of management. According to Markovic (2008), the successful companies in the future will be the ones, which are wise enough to harness the full potential of the entire organization in the rapidly changing business environment. Accounting provides data about the results of organization's activity and money flows, and its information is used to evaluate the organization's activity, adopt management decisions and predict future perspectives. Such definition stresses the importance of accounting for economical processes. The success of each organization personal enterprise, major international organization or public institution, depends on the accounting conceptions and practical skills (Vecerskiene, Valanciene, Boguslauskas, 2008). Therefore accounting needs scientific researches, results of which would help to form the legislation basis and methods of accounting, to correct and develop accounting standards, to form accounting systems of companies' management, and to investigate the cases of their practical implementation. The practical accounting problems of long-term tangible result need scientific researches, while scientific researches require practical results. This helps to transfer accounting to another qualitative level and render knowledge for future practicians. The conditions of knowledge economy have determined global changes, which are changing the nature of organization's (Valanciene & Gimzauskiene, 2007). The real competitive advantage of the organization is made from the combination of several factors: knowledge, skills, technologies, work methods and information (Boguslaukas & Kvedaraviciene, 2009).
   In order to prepare correct and accurate financial and tax reports, the method of united configuration accounting of tangible fixed assets (TFA) is needed, which would help to coordinate the provisions of Business Accounting Standards (BAS) and requirements of Law on Corporate Income Tax (WIT), and which are needed for the preparation of an accurate and correct financial and tax report.
   The article reveals the significance of the selection of accounting methodology of tangible fixed assets for the reflection of organization's financial results, analyzes variety of TFA methods, statutory standards of accounting of tangible fixed assets and problems of their compatibility, reveals the influence of discrepancies in the accounting methods of depreciation of tangible fixed assets on the organization's activity results, and presents the research results on the application of TFA methods in the Lithuanian organizations.

AB  - Successful management of coastal environments requires reliable monitoring methods and indicators. Besides Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), water transparency measured as Secchi Depth (Z(SD)) is widely used in Baltic Sea management for water quality assessment as eutrophication indicator. However, in many coastal waters not only phytoplankton but also colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) influence the under-water light field, and therefore the Z(SD). In this study all three main optical variables (CDOM, Chl-a, and SPM [organic and inorganic]) as well as Z(SD) were measured in three Swedish regions: the Bothnian Sea, the Baltic Proper, and the Skagerrak in 2010-2014. Regional multiple regressions with Chl-a, CDOM, and inorganic SPM as predictors explained the variations in Z(SD) well (R-adj(2) = 0.53-0.84). Commonality analyses of the regressions indicated considerable differences between regions regarding the contribution of each factor to the variance, R-adj(2), in Z(SD). CDOM explained most of the variance in the Bothnian Sea and the Skagerrak; in general, Chl-a contributed only modestly to the Z(SD) variance. In the Baltic Proper the largest contribution was from the interaction of all three variables. As expected, the link between Chl-a and Z(SD) was much weaker in the Bothnian Sea with high CDOM absorption and SPM concentration. When applying the Swedish EU Water Framework Directive threshold for Good/Moderate Chl-a status in the models it was shown that Z(SD) is neither a sufficient indicator for eutrophication, nor for changes in Chl-a. Natural coastal gradients in CDOM and SPM influence the reference conditions for Z(SD) and other eutrophication indicators, such as the depth distribution of macro-algae. Hence, setting targets for these indicators based on reference Chl-a concentrations and simple Chl-a to Z(SD) relationships might in some cases be inappropriate and misleading due to overestimation of water transparency under natural conditions.

AB  - Health-relevant microorganisms present in natural surface waters and engineered treatment systems that are exposed to sunlight can be inactivated by a complex set of interacting mechanisms. The net impact of sunlight depends on the solar spectral irradiance, the susceptibility of the specific microorganism to each mechanism, and the water quality; inactivation rates can vary by orders of magnitude depending on the organism and environmental conditions. Natural organic matter (NOM) has a large influence, as it can attenuate radiation and thus decrease inactivation by endogenous mechanisms. Simultaneously NOM sensitizes the formation of reactive intermediates that can damage microorganisms via exogenous mechanisms. To accurately predict inactivation and design engineered systems that enhance solar inactivation, it is necessary to model these processes, although some details are not yet sufficiently well understood. In this critical review, we summarize the photo-physics, -chemistry, and -biology that underpin sunlight-mediated inactivation, as well as the targets of damage and cellular responses to sunlight exposure. Viruses that are not susceptible to exogenous inactivation are only inactivated if UVB wavelengths (280-320 nm) are present, such as in very clear, open waters or in containers that are transparent to UVB. Bacteria are susceptible to slightly longer wavelengths. Some viruses and bacteria (especially Gram-positive) are susceptible to exogenous inactivation, which can be initiated by visible as well as UV wavelengths. We review approaches to model sunlight-mediated inactivation and illustrate how the environmental conditions can dramatically shift the inactivation rate of organisms. The implications of this mechanistic understanding of solar inactivation are discussed for a range of applications, including recreational water quality, natural treatment systems, solar disinfection of drinking water (SODIS), and enhanced inactivation via the use of sensitizers and photocatalysts. Finally, priorities for future research are identified that will further our understanding of the key role that sunlight disinfection plays in natural systems and the potential to enhance this process in engineered systems.

AB  - The solar and wind power generation is stochastic in nature. Consequently, it is difficult to obtain steady power output from these renewable sources. Storage element (mainly battery) used in typical solar/wind hybrid system has also its inherent shortcomings. However, power generation from renewable energy sources like solar and wind is having paramount significance in the context of impending fossil fuel shortage, environmental degradation, remote electricity supply, etc. Hence, an alternate mechanism for hybridization of solar and wind resources to obtain a steady power output could undoubtedly be a great accomplishment in prevailing energy scenario across the world. The present paper analyses the performance of such an eccentric solar-wind hybridized model with spring storage system which is capable of delivering steady power yield despite intermittency of the sources. The likely annual performance of this unusual solar-wind hybridized model is evaluated under a sub-tropical climatic condition in north-east India in terms of various characteristics and effective performance indicators such as energy generation characteristics, effect of storage capacity, efficiency of the generating system, capacity factor of the plant, energy to load ratio, normalized power yield, and plant utilization factor. The considered system in the paper has been designed and simulated in LabVIEW graphical programming environment. It has been found for the given climatic condition that maximum wind energy and solar energy fraction of the plant reaches up to 84% and 16% respectively with annual average efficiency of 24.21% for wind turbine unit and 65.52% for solar thermal unit. To make evident the success of the system, a performative comparison has been drawn with obtained results in the proposed scheme and the testified results in existent solar-wind renewable energy system. The analysis in the study substantiates that performance of the proposed hybridized model is considerably superior to that of conventional and established solar-wind based hybrid technologies.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effects of Bt maize hybrid cultivation on soil nematode communities in two field trials, as well as to analyse other factors (fertilisation and moisture) responsible for the community structure of soil nematodes. Nematode communities were studied in maize plots at the locality of Borovce in western Slovakia. During 2012 and 2013, hybrids DK440 and DKC3871 (conventional) or DKC4442YG and DKC3872YG (Bt maize, event MON810) were sown in 10 repetitions each. Nematodes were extracted from soil samples collected at the maize flowering (July 11, 2012 and July 30, 2013). Altogether, 39 nematode species belonged to 35 genera were identified in two maize variants. The dominant taxa in both variants were Acrobeloides nanus, Cephalobus persegnis, Aphelenchoides composticola, Aphelenchus avenae, Eudorylaimus carteri and Filenchus vulgaris. Calculation of the maturity index, plant parasitic index, enrichment index and structure index did not confirm any clear influence of year or hybrid type on soil nematode communities. The proportional representation of cp-1, cp-2 and cp-3-5 groups of nematode fauna indicated conditions of low stability and high stress. Faunal profiles representing the structure and enrichment conditions of the soil food web showed an environment with a high C: N ratio and high levels of fungal feeders. Based on the calculation of the metabolic footprint of nematodes in the soil food web, a difference between the isoline maize variant and Bt maize variant in 2012 was found, but this difference was not readily apparent in 2013. The occurrence of nematodes, their abundance, proportion of feeding types and selected ecological indices did not depend on the type of maize hybrid (Bt or nonBt). Thus, the cultivation of genetically modified maize did not directly influence nematode populations. The application of fertiliser at certain periods does not influence the nematode community. The observed significant higher abundance of nematodes was correlated with soil moisture.

AB  - The natural distribution of early juvenile (<150 mm TL) dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus (Sciaenidae) along the east coast of South Africa appears to be restricted to the reduced salinity upper reaches of estuaries. This study experimentally tested the effect of salinity on growth indices in an attempt to explain the estuarine distribution of early juvenile A. japonicus. Growth under laboratory conditions was used as an indicator of relative energy expenditure for osmoregulation at salinities 5 (hypoosmotic), 12 (isosmotic) and 35 (hyperosmotic), as energy used for osmoregulation becomes unavailable for growth. Juveniles (81 +/- 1.5 mm SL and 9.6 +/- 0.5 g) survived and grew at all three salinities over a nine-week period. Contrary to what was hypothesised, growth of juveniles increased with increasing salinity (average weight 35.57 +/- 1.50 g, 42.31 +/- 2.70 g and 48.86 +/- 1.30 g for the 5, 12 and 35 treatments respectively), with specific growth rate of juveniles at the hypoosmotic salinity (2.05 +/- 0.15) significantly lower than at isosmotic (2.52 +/- 0.09) and hyperosmotic salinities (2.59 +/- 0.09). Food conversion ratio was significantly higher at the hypoosmotic (1.30 +/- 0.28) than the hyperosmotic salinity (0.94 +/- 0.05), but there was no difference between the isosmotic (1.01 +/- 0.08) and hyperosmotic salinity. Salinity did not affect condition factor (range: 2.67 +/- 0.03-2.75 0.10) or feed intake (range: 2.43 +/- 0.17-2.75 +/- 0.53). The results, in part, indicated that early juvenile A. japonicus expend more energy at salinities below isosmotic levels and that salinity alone does not explain their natural distribution within estuaries. It is possible that high conductivity in the upper reaches of certain South African estuaries may mitigate the negative effect of reduced salinity on growth and hence the estuarine distribution of early juveniles.

AB  - The not yet uploaded Trichoptera World Checklist (TWC) [http://entweb.clemson.edu/database/trichopt/search.htm], as at July 2006, recorded 12,627 species, 610 genera and 46 families of extant and in addition 488 species, 78 genera and 7 families of fossil Trichoptera. An analysis of the 2001 TWC list of present-day Trichoptera diversity at species, generic/subgeneric and family level along the selected Afrotropical, Neotropical, Australian, Oriental, Nearctic and Palaearctic (as a unit or assessed as Eastern and Western) regions reveals uneven distribution patterns. The Oriental and Neotropical are the two most species diverse with 47-77% of the species in widespread genera being recorded in these two regions. Five Trichoptera families comprise 55% of the world's species and 19 families contain fewer than 30 species per family. Ten out of 620 genera contain 29% of the world's known species. Considerable underestimates of Trichoptera diversity for certain regions are recognised. Historical processes in Trichoptera evolution dating back to the middle and late Triassic reveal that the major phylogenetic differentiation in Trichoptera had occurred during the Jurrasic and early Cretaceous. The breakup of Gondwana in the Cretaceous led to further isolation and diversification of Trichoptera. High species endemism is noted to be in tropical or mountainous regions correlated with humid or high rainfall conditions. Repetitive patterns of shared taxa between biogeographical regions suggest possible centres of origin, vicariant events or distribution routes. Related taxa associations between different regions suggest that an alternative biogeographical map reflecting Trichoptera distribution patterns different from the Wallace (The Geographical Distribution of Animals: With a Study of the Relations of Living and Extinct Faunas as Elucidating the Past Changes of the Earth's Surface, Vol. 1, 503 pp., Vol. 2, 607 pp., Macmillan, London, 1876) proposed biogeography patterns should be considered. Anthropogenic development threatens biodiversity and the value of Trichoptera as important functional components of aquatic ecosystems, indicator species of deteriorating conditions and custodians of environmental protection are realised.

AB  - Before the 20th century, groundwater circulation in the aquifers of the British Isles had largely adjusted to the temperate maritime climate and sea levels established over the past 10 ka since the end of the Pleistocene. However, in the last 100 a this natural regime has been disturbed by abstraction of water for public supply and industrial use, and palaeowaters from earlier recharge episodes are now becoming a factor to be considered in water balance estimates. This paper presents a synthesis of the existing palaeowater distribution in the British Isles, based on isotopic evidence (delta(18)O, delta(2)H and (14)C). As such, it has relevance to palaeoclimatic studies in addition to the water resource implications.
   The Triassic basins of England and Northern Ireland contain saline waters beyond the range of (14)C dating (> 40 ka). Stable isotopic ratios show enrichment in some basins and depletion in others, without an overall pattern that would explain all the observed compositions. The results for the Wessex basin suggest recharge in pre-quaternary times, but for the other basins some flushing by Pleistocene or Holocene meteoric waters is indicated. Isolated occurrences of apparently long-residence waters are found elsewhere throughout the British Isles, for example from Carboniferous and Lower Palaeozoic strata. In such cases, environmental isotopes are more useful as constraints on hydrogeological models than as indicators of palaeoconditions.
   Major water supply aquifers are restricted almost entirely to England. The two sandstone formations (Triassic Sherwood Sandstone and Cretaceous Lower Greensand) have a greater range of stable isotopic values between phreatic and confined conditions than the two carbonate formations (Jurassic Lincolnshire Limestone and Cretaceous Chalk). This indicates that the sandstone aquifers are better archives of information on palaeoconditions than the carbonate aquifers. They show that atmospheric circulation patterns over Britain have probably remained the same since the late Pleistocene. However, (14)C data from all four of the major aquifers emphasise the hiatus in recharge during periglacial conditions which occurred between the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. (C) 1997 NERC.

AB  - Behavioral reactions of fishes are measureable, adaptive features which contribute to their evolutionary fitness and, hence, can serve as biomarkers of stress. For a behavior to serve as an efficacious biomarker, it should be important to an individual's survival, growth and/or reproduction, be relatively stable under control conditions, and have a "concentration-effect" relationship with the stressor. This review summarizes the influence of numerous environmental stimuli on seven different behaviors in fishes. Avoidance-attractance behavior does not assess for stress, but rather allows a fish to avoia stressful chemicals. Of the 75 chemicals surveyed, about 1/3 are avoided at threshold concentrations that should mitigate harm, while approximately 2/3 were either not actively avoided or produced inconsistent results. Temperature selection behavior meets several criteria of a good indicator of stress. Several stimuli produced significant changes in selected/avoidance temperatures of various fishes. While only a few stimuli caused an increase, several resulted in a decrease in selected temperatures. Although conditioned learning appears to be a sensitive measure of environmentally induced stress, few studies have been published, and direct field validations are not possible. A variety of stimuli can disrupt the components of feeding, often in the parts per billion range of concentrations. Predator-prey interactions are sensitive to a variety of stressors. In trials where only prey were exposed to a potential stressor, 94% of the stressors caused an increase in prey vulnerability, usually at levels less than 96-hour LC50S. Neither of the other social behaviors reviewed, intraspecific and reproductive, although promising, has received large research attention. Studies featuring several different methods demonstrate that there is no single best behavioral bioassay method. However, depending upon the expected effects and possible mode of action, there probably is a "best" behavioral bioassay to illustrate the effects of each potential stressor.

AB  - The expansion of oil sands resource development in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region in the early 1990's led to concerns regarding the potential ecological and health effects of increased emissions and deposition of acidic substances. Conditions attached to a 1994 approval for an oil sands facility expansion led to the creation of the Wood Buffalo Environmental Association, and its Terrestrial Environmental Effects Monitoring committee. This multi-stakeholder body was tasked with development and operation of an environmental (forest health) monitoring program for the detection of ecological responses to atmospheric emissions and deposition. Initially focused on acid deposition monitoring, jack pine forest, growing on sandy soils with limited acid buffering capacity, was selected as the receptor system. An initial set of 10 monitoring locations was established using the Canadian Acid Rain Network Early Warning System methodology (since increased to 27, with three lost to development). Ecological monitoring is on a 6-year cycle, with concurrent measures of soil, needle and lichen chemistry, and tree and understory condition, together with ongoing measurements of air quality and atmospheric deposition. Because jack pine forest edges facing the emissions sources were expected to be more exposed to acidic emissions, evaluation of stand edge monitoring locations began in 2008. Monitoring of a targeted suite of indicators began in 2012 at 25 jack pine stand edge monitoring sites. This special issue presents the results derived from biophysical sampling campaigns (1998 to 2013), coupled with ongoing ambient atmospheric, deposition and epiphytic lichen monitoring (data through 2017) and source apportionment studies, as well as papers contributed by others engaged in regional research and monitoring programs. The Forest Health Monitoring Program provides data supportive of regulatory and stakeholder evaluations of environmental quality, and is adaptive to new needs, extreme environmental events and technological development while providing continuity of monitoring.

AB  - Background: Nematodes are an important component of deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities, but only few nematode species are able to cope to the harsh conditions of the most active vent sites. The genus Oncholaimus is known to tolerate extreme geothermal conditions and high sulphide concentrations in shallow water hydrothermal vents, but it was only occasionally reported in deep-sea vents. In this study, we performed morphological, genetic and ecological investigations (including feeding strategies) on an abundant species of Oncholaimus recently discovered at Lucky strike vent field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 1700 m water depth.
   Results: We described this species as Oncholaimus dyvae sp. nov.. This new species differs from all other members of the genus by the combination of the following characters: body length (up to 9 mm), the presence of a long spicule (79 mu m) with a distally pointed end, a complex pericloacal setal ornamentation with one precloacal papilla surrounded by short spines, and a body cuticule with very fine striation shortly posterior to the amphid opening. Overall, O. dyvae sp. nov. abundance increased with increasing temperature and vent emissions. Carbon isotopic ratios suggest that this species could consume both thiotroph and methanotrophic producers. Furthermore sulfur-oxidizing bacteria related to Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were detected in the cuticle, in the digestive cavity and in the intestine of O. dyvae sp. nov. suggesting a potential symbiotic association.
   Conclusions: This study improves our understanding of vent biology and ecology, revealing a new nematode species able to adapt and be very abundant in active vent areas due to their association with chemosynthetic micro-organisms. Faced by the rapid increase of anthropogenic pressure to access mineral resources in the deep sea, hydrothermal vents are particularly susceptible to be impacted by exploitation of seafloor massive sulfide deposits.

AB  - To generate mortality estimates for fish that are captured and released in recreational and commercial fisheries, it is common to temporarily hold fish in captivity. Typically, captured fish are placed in some form of pen, cage or tank with control individuals, yet little is known about how the type of holding environment influences fish condition or mortality. Here we captured freshwater fish (bluegill; Lepomis macrociarus) via angling and fyke net and retained them in one of four holding environments; a round flow-through tank on shore [TANK], a knotless nylon pen with natural substrate in the lake [PEN], a knotless nylon floating cage with a rigid structure [RCAGE], and a knotless nylon floating cage that lacked rigid structure [CAGE]. Mortality was low (1%) across both capture techniques and holding environments during the 14-day retention period. All mortalities were associated with capture by fyke net. A chronic stress indicator, blood glucose, was determined for a subset of fish on day 5. Although there were significant differences in blood glucose between angled RCAGE and angled PEN (Tukey, P=0.047) and angled RCAGE and fyke PEN (Tukey, P=0.015), the observed levels were generally quite low (range: 1.0-3.9 mmol L-1) and the differences were likely associated with differences in feeding; fish in the PEN group with access to substrate (and presumably the most food) had slightly higher glucose levels. At the conclusion of the study Fulton's condition factor was similar among all groups (ANOVA, P>0.05, all terms). However, fish held in the TANK treatment had the highest levels of external protozoan parasite infection by Ichthyopthirius (Tukey, P< 0.05). This study illustrates that in situ holding environments (rather than tanks) may help reduce mortality, stress, and disease during studies that estimate post-release mortality. We encourage additional research to explore how the holding environment can influence inferences made about post-release mortality and sublethal impacts of fishing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We present an approach to produce maps of Ellenberg values for soil reaction (R-value) in the Bavarian Alps. Eleven meaningful environmental predictors covering GIS-derived information on climatic, topographic and soil conditions were used to predict R-values. As dependent variables, Ellenberg indicator values for soil reaction were queried from plot records in the vegetation database WINALPecobase. We used an additive georegression model, which combines complex prediction models and the increased prediction accuracy of a boosting algorithm. In addition to environmental predictors we included spatial effects into the model to account for spatial autocorrelation. As we were particularly interested in the usefulness of averaged R-values for spatial prediction, we applied two different models: (1) a geo-additive regression model that estimates mean R-values and (2) a proportional odds model predicting the probability distribution over R-values 1 to 9. We found meaningful dependencies between the R-value and our predictors. Both models produced the same spatial pattern of predictions. Spatial effects had an impact only in the first model. The main drawback of mean R-values is the oversimplification of complex conditions of soil reaction, which is entailed by averaging and regression to mean values. Therefore, regionalized average indicator values provide only limited information on site-ecological characteristics. Model 1 failed to predict the range and shapes of original indicator spectra precisely. In contrast, the second model provided a more sophisticated picture of soil reaction. To make the multivariate output of model 2 comparable to that of model 1, we propose to plot the distribution in a three-dimensional color-space. In addition, comparison of both models based on a multiple linear regression model resulted in a R (2) of 0.93. The proportional odds model is a promising approach also for other indicator values and different regions as well as for other ordinal-scaled ecological parameters.

AB  - The 2014-2016 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave (MHW) induced the warmest 3-year period on record in the California Current Ecosystem. We tested whether larval fish assemblage structure, phenology, and diversity dynamics were comparable to past warming events from 1951 to 2013. First, we hypothesized, based on past observations of biological effect of warming, that mesopelagic species with southern distributions relative to southern California and Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax (a coastal pelagic species) would increase during the MHW while northern mesopelagics and northern anchovy Engraulis mordax (coastal pelagic) abundances would decline. Similar to past warming, southern mesopelagics increased and northern mesopelagics decreased. Unexpectedly, however, a common southern mesopelagic, Mexican lampfish Triphoturus mexicanus, was approximately three times more abundant than the previous annual high. Furthermore, whereas sardine abundance did not increase, larval anchovy abundance rose to near-record highs in summer 2016. Second, we hypothesized that fishes would spawn earlier during the MHW. Fishes did not spawn in an earlier season within a year, but five of six southern mesopelagic taxa spawned earlier than typical within winter and spring. Third, we predicted that species richness would increase moderately due to an influx of southern and exodus of northern species. Richness, however, was very high in all seasons and the highest ever during the summer as multiple species with primarily southern distributions were recorded spawning for the first time in southern California. The richness of northern species was also unexpectedly high during the MHW. Northern species likely persisted in the study area because in addition to the warm water, pockets of cold water were consistently present. If, as predicted, conditions similar to the MHW become more common as oceans warm, this unique and largely unexpected combination of fishes may reflect future biological conditions.

AB  - Maternal care is one of the key fitness parameters in all organisms. In plants, maternal care takes the form of seeds production. Although seed mass is the most studied proxy for this maternal provision due to its correlation with the overall amount of nutrients, this proxy does not take into account seed nutrient contents and the proportions of light-dependent resources (C) and soil-dependent resources (N and P), which can strongly affect seedling establishment and survival. We tested the hypothesis that seed nutrient contents is fine-tuned to the expected conditions of seed germination, namely, that seeds of plants from light-limited conditions will have proportionally more carbon than those of plants that are not light-limited and vice versa. We used a phylogenetically informed comparative approach with 510 central European herbaceous species to examine relationships between proportions of N, P and nonstructural C, and the environment in which their seedlings typically germinate. We showed that, in spite of the strong phylogenetic signal in nutrient contents, proportions of N and nonstructural C vary according to our hypothesis, i.e. seeds are primarily provided with nutrients expected to be limiting in a given environment. Namely, the proportion of nonstructural C in seeds was higher in species from nutrient-rich habitats. This enables seedlings to develop independent resource-acquiring organs quickly. We demonstrated that seed nutrient contents depends on seed mass; namely, the proportion of P out of the total seed mass was higher in small seeds, and the proportion of unusable structural C was higher in large seeds. Our results suggest that seed nutrient content is under selection driven by both seed mass and the environment in which seedlings are likely to germinate. It means that seed nutrient content is a seed trait of clear ecological relevance and hence deserves much closer attention.

AB  - Predicting the response of plant communities to variation in resources and disturbance is still a challenge, because findings depend on how ecological gradients are characterized and how grassland functional composition is assessed. Focusing on leaf dry matter content (LDMC), the efficacy of different methods for evaluating the best response of plant communities to either environmental or disturbance change is examined.
   Data were collected on 69 grasslands located at four sites in the Pyrenees and Massif Central. N-Ellenberg indices and plant nutrient content (Ni) were compared to assess fertility, and either LDMC (meas) measured or calculated from a trait database for which traits were measured under the same environmental conditions (db). Management regime (MR) was characterized in terms of categories (grazing, cutting) and plant height.
   LDMCdb was positively correlated to LDMCmeas, but depended significantly on site temperature. N-Ellenberg and Ni were significantly correlated, and there was a significant effect of MR and temperature. LDMC responded to fertility, MR and temperature. Replacing MR by plant height in an REML analysis reduced the uncertainty of the LDMC prediction. LDMC was correlated to plant height at community level, whereas the correlation was weak at species level. Differences in LDMC between plant communities under any of the management regimes were significantly correlated to the standing herbage mass.
   The N-Ellenberg index is a better indicator of fertility than Ni which is short-term and environment-dependent. LDMC taken from a database allows plant trait variation due to species abundance (excluding variation due to trait plasticity in response to management) to be captured. So the former is better suited for assessing agricultural services that mainly depend on plant phenology and tissue composition. LDMC responded to defoliation regime in addition to fertility because plant height is roughly correlated with LDMC at plant community level.

AB  - Lysosomal destabilization indices (based on a neutral red retention assay) were evaluated for digestive gland cells of oysters Crassostrea virginica. Laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of variable salinity regimes (a natural stressor) and copper exposures (a pollutant stressor) on lysosomal destabilization. Field studies were also conducted with native oysters and hatchery-reared juvenile oysters deployed in situ at reference and polluted sites. Lysosomal integrity was not affected by either short-term or longer-term variations in salinity during laboratory experiments, and the destabilization indices were similar to those of deployed and native oysters from reference sites characterized by a range of salinities. However, laboratory Cu exposures (ranging from 2.5 to 20 mu g Cu l(-1)) caused significant adverse effects on lysosomal destabilization after only 18 h, and the effects were sustained or worsened with increasing exposure time and concentration. Hatchery-reared oysters deployed at or native oysters collected from polluted sites had significantly higher lysosomal destabilization indices. Estuarine habitats are characterized by variable salinity regimes, so cellular responses that are sensitive to salinity stress as well as contaminant stress would be difficult to interpret if salinity effects cannot be distinguished from pollutant effects. A robust biomarker of anthropogenic effects should be insensitive to natural stressors such as salinity, but should be sensitive to pollutants. The salinity and contaminant studies described in this paper indicate that lysosomal destabilization responses in oysters are insensitive to salinity variations and sensitive to pollutants, and are therefore potentially valuable biomarkers of anthropogenic stress.

AB  - Hydropower is considered an important form of renewable energy, often involving hydropeaking. While the effects of hydropeaking on aquatic communities in areas downstream the dam are well understood, there is a lack of studies investigating potential impacts on tributaries located further upstream. In this study, we tested the effects of hydropeaking operations on upstream tributaries in a restored area of the Danube River, with a focus on the periods of backlog and release of water (up-ramping and down-ramping, respectively) during the filling and release of the reservoir. We used brown trout egg and larval mortality, linked to hydraulic, sedimentary and physiochemical changes in spawning grounds as an indicator. We compared hydropeaking-affected versus non-affected sites in upstream tributaries using HydroEcoSedimentary Tools (HESTs) loaded with clean gravels and brown trout eggs. Egg and larval mortalities were significantly higher in the hydropeaking-affected site with more than 80% egg mortality and almost 100% larval mortality compared to values of 55-63% and 80-85%, respectively, in non-affected sites. Spawning ground quality was significantly altered in the hydropeaking-affected site, where the highest mortalities were observed. Overall, duration of time periods with flow velocities close to zero were a key variable, potentially decreasing oxygen supply for eggs and larvae. Such periods of close to zero flow velocities were driven by backlog periods during the filling of the reservoir, revealing that such events can severely impair ecological integrity of spawning sites in tributaries upstream of dams by slowing the flows in upstream tributaries. Such altered processes can reduce fish population recruitment and need to be considered in future restoration projects.

AB  - Honeybee venom (Apitoxin, BV), a secretion substance expelled from the venom gland of bees, has being reported as antimicrobial against various bacterial species; however, the mechanism of action remains uncharacterized. In this study, the antibacterial activity of BV was investigated on hygiene indicator Escherichia coli and the environmental pathogen and spoilage bacterial species, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens. An array of methods was combined to elucidate the mode of action of BV. Viability by culture on media was combined with assessing cell injury with flow cytometry analysis. ATP depletion was monitored as an indicator to metabolic activity of cells, by varying BV concentration (75, 225and 500 mu g/mL), temperature (25 degrees C and 37 degrees C), and time of exposure (0 to 24 h). Venom presented moderate inhibitory effect on E. coli by viability assay, caused high membrane permeability and significant ATP loss where the effect was increased by increased concentration. The viability of P. putida was reduced to a greater extent than other tested bacteria at comparable venom concentrations and was dictated by exposure time. On the contrary, P. fluorescens appeared less affected by venom based on viability; however, flow cytometry and ATP analysis highlighted concentration- and time- dependent effect of venom. According to Transmission Electron Microscopy results, the deformation of the cell wall was evident for all species. This implies a common mechanism of action of the BV which is as follows: the cell wall destruction, change of membrane permeability, leakage of cell contents, inactivation of metabolic activity and finally cell death.

AB  - Lichens absorb water, gases, dissolved substances, and especially pollutants by the entire surface, and they are considered to be the indicators of air quality. In our experiment, a sensitivity of Cladonia arbuscula subsp. mitis and Cladonia furcata lichens with the same photobiont Trebouxia was tested to nitrogen excess through a sensitivity of both the photobiont and mycobiont. Lichen ecophysiological parameters like chlorophyll a fluorescence, chlorophyll a integrity, the content of photosynthetic pigments, ergosterol, soluble proteins, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and secondary compounds were measured during two experiments that differed in time of nitrogen exposure. In the short-term experiment, also higher nitrogen concentrations were used to evaluate the dependence of different nitrogen concentrations. In the short-term experiment, lichens were soaked at the different solutions of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) for describing an immediate effect of range of NH4NO3 concentrations. In the long-term experiment, lichens were sprayed with low NH4NO3 concentrations for 3 months for evaluating the effect of naturally occurring low nitrogen concentrations. Results showed that lichens responded differently in spite of having the same photobiont. The mycobiont of C. arbuscula subsp. mitis was more sensitive than mycobiont of C. furcata. In higher nitrogen concentrations, the photobiont of C. furcata was more sensitive than C. arbuscula subsp. mitis photobiont. Both lichens exhibited signs of damage; therefore, we conclude that they are sensitive to nitrogen excess, while C. arbuscula subsp. mitis is more sensitive species. The secondary compound content did not change in neither of lichen species. Cladonia sp. response to nitrogen excess depends on length and nitrogen dose exposure.

AB  - Concern that European forest biodiversity is depleted and declining has provoked widespread efforts to improve management practices. To gauge the success of these actions, appropriate monitoring of forest ecosystems is paramount. Multi-species indicators are frequently used to assess the state of biodiversity and its response to implemented management, but generally applicable and objective methodologies for species' selection are lacking. Here we use a niche-based approach, underpinned by coarse quantification of species' resource use, to objectively select species for inclusion in a pan-European forest bird indicator. We identify both the minimum number of species required to deliver full resource coverage and the most sensitive species' combination, and explore the trade-off between two key characteristics, sensitivity and redundancy, associated with indicators comprising different numbers of species. We compare our indicator to an existing forest bird indicator selected on the basis of expert opinion and show it is more representative of the wider community. We also present alternative indicators for regional and forest type specific monitoring and show that species' choice can have a significant impact on the indicator and consequent projections about the state of the biodiversity it represents. Furthermore, by comparing indicator sets drawn from currently monitored species and the full forest bird community, we identify gaps in the coverage of the current monitoring scheme. We believe that adopting this niche-based framework for species' selection supports the objective development of multi-species indicators and that it has good potential to be extended to a range of habitats and taxa.

AB  - Corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops L.), a protogynous, non-migratory lipfish species, living close to rocky shores was chosen as an indicator species for the monitoring of biological effects of contaminants. Fish were caught by local fisherman at the Norwegian west coast in fjord sites within the framework of the EU BEEP project. The sites represented different point source impacts of (1) copper (a former copper mine), (11) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, aluminium smelter discharge), (111) formaldehyde plus PAHs (kelp-factory and influence of the aluminium smelter). Livers of wrasse were studied for histopathological alterations and compared to healthy livers of fish from a reference location. Besides liver morphology, different functional and metabolic parameters were measured to link pathological alterations to functional disorders. The integrity of the lysosomal compartment was tested by the assessment of lysosomal membrane stability (lys), and the accumulation of neutral lipids and lipofuscin. Activity and intracellular localisation of the NADPH-producing enzymes in the liver were assessed histochemically and measured by compute r-assisted image analysis. Histopathological alterations were most severe at the site impacted by formaldehyde and PAHs. These findings were associated with highest tumor prevalence, lowest membrane stabilities in hepatocytes and highest accumulation rates of lipofuscin in the liver. The activities of the NADPH-producing enzymes phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGDH) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) were significantly lower compared to unimpacted reference fish. Histopathological alterations showed clear differences dependent on the input source. Potential links between specific contaminant impact and functional and morphological disorders are discussed.

AB  - The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation of the herbal extract on growth performance, carcass yield, and meat quality in quails raised under thermal-neutral (TN) and heat stress (HS) conditions. For this purpose, a total of 384 one-thy-old Japanese quail chicks (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were randomly allocated to 4 treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two levels of dietary herbal extract (Digestarom (R) Poultry; 0 and 100 mg/kg of diet) and two thermal environments (TN and GS). A corn-soybean meal-based diet was prepared for starter and grower phases according to NRC (1994) recommendations. Growth performance along with carcass and meat quality characteristics including color, pH levels, L*, a*, and b* values, cooking loss, and water holding capacity were recorded. Heat stress negatively affected the feed intake of birds during the second phase of the experiment (P < 0.001). Meat pH levels were decreased at the 15th minute postmortem in quails subjected to HS (P < 0.05), while other meat quality parameters were not affected. The HS also had no significant effect on blood stress indicators such as heterophil/lymphocyte ratio or malondialdehyde concentration. The herbal extract could not extremely improve growth performance and meat quality in quails, but it helped to some extent to buffer the negative effects of HS. In conclusion, it seems quails have a high tolerant capacity and the beneficial effect of dietary herbal extract addition might be achieved when quails are subjected to higher thermal conditions.

AB  - Drought stress poses a major threat to plant growth, development, and yield. Salicylic acid (SA) is one of the endogenous plant growth regulators that plays a key role in plant resistance against environmental stresses, including drought. A 2-yr field experiment was performed to assess the modifications in compatible solutes, water status, and seed yield of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) under drought stress and to see whether foliar application of SA ameliorates these modifications. For this purpose, seven sesame genotypes, namely Yekta, Shiraz, Naz-Takshakhe, Dashtestan, Isfahan, Varamin, and Oltan, were watered aft er 60% (control) and 80% (drought) depletion of the available soil water in the presence of two SA concentrations (0 and 0.6 mM). Drought was found to lead to significant reductions in leaf water potential (LWP), relative water content (RWC), seeds/capsule, capsules/plant, seeds/m(2), 1000-seed weight, and, thereby, seed yield and oil content. Significant increases were observed in proline and total soluble carbohydrates (TSC) concentrations in response to drought. Exogenously applied SA alleviated the stress impacts by enhancing all the studied attributes under both moisture conditions, more notably under water deficit conditions. The genotypes exhibited clear differences in their responses to water deficit and SA application. The genotype Yekta showed higher stability in terms of the majority of the studied attributes against drought stress. With the environmental conditions experienced in these 2 yr, osmoregulatory measures were found to serve as indicators of resistance to drought stress while SA seemed effective in the enhancing of these measures in this oilseed crop.

AB  - Fishing is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. In addition to the high risk of fatality, fish harvesters are also at risk of a wide range of non-fatal injuries during their work at sea. Weather factors are an intrinsic part of fish harvesters' operating environment and they consider the most dangerous situations at sea to be associated with weather-related factors. This research aims to answer questions regarding the effects of extratropical cyclone weather conditions on the severity level of maritime incidents to provide more insight for fish harvesters and/or marine traffic decision makers such as the Canadian Coast Guard. To achieve these goals, weather and incident data in Atlantic Canadian waters were matched spatially and temporally then analyzed to explore their relationships. Logistic Regression was used to examine how weather factors affect the severity level of fishing vessel incidents. Ice concentration, wind speed, sea surface temperature, and darkness were the most significant environmental factors with respect to severity level of fishing incidents. When only incidents associated with cyclones were taken into consideration, Laplacian of pressure as an indicator of cyclone's intensity replaced ice concentration as a significant factor. Logistic Regression was also applied for individual fishery types, revealing that distinct fisheries can be affected by different weather factors. Improving our understanding of extreme events and revising safety related policies in commercial fishing is particularly important under climate change scenarios as fish harvesters' reliance on traditional weather patterns becomes increasingly questionable.

AB  - In Tunisia, five Bahloul spaced sections, Bargou, Jerisa, Guern Halfaya, Kherij and Gafsa were analyzed for biostratigraphy (foraminifera and radiolarians) and major and trace elements. This high-resolution biostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic integrated analyses for the Late Cenomanian-Early Turonian Bahloul Formation provide new insight into the palaeoceanographic evolution of the southern Tethyan margin. Relative low abundance of related terrigenous Ti/Al and K/Al ratios and enrichment of some productivity proxies such as Ba, Cu, and Ni (organic matter related trace elements) suggests that the Bahloul, deposited during a relatively short period (0.5 Ma), was of relatively elevated primary productivity and minimal detrital input. While higher D* values concurrent with lower Ti/Al ratios are interpreted as caused by enhanced fluvial material contribution, due to more humid climate during the OAE-2. Enhanced humidity triggered probably fluvial influxes, resulted in a sluggish water circulation and consequent anoxic/euxinic conditions favoring the preservation of organic matter at the bottom. Enrichments in redox-sensitive trace metals U, V, and Mo in the Bahloul Formation deposits and redox indices, such as V/(V+Ni), U/Th, V/Cr, and Ni/Co, indicate that oxygen-restricted conditions prevailed during the Late Cenomanian to earliest Turonian times and correlate well with relative abundances of some foraminiferal and radiolarian paleo-environmental relevant indicators. High Baxs values and Uauth may indicate anoxic conditions at least at the watersediment interface during the Bahloul Formation deposition and provide information about low to moderate sulfate-reduction reactions.

AB  - Column outflow experiments operated at steady state flow conditions do not allow the identification of rate limited release processes. This requires an alternative experimental methodology. In this study, the aim was to apply such a methodology in order to identify and quantify effective release rates of heavy metals from granular wastes. Column experiments were conducted with demolition waste and municipal waste incineration (MSWI) bottom ash using different flow velocities and multiple flow interruptions. The effluent was analyzed for heavy metals, DOC, electrical conductivity and pH. The breakthrough-curves were inversely modeled with a numerical code based on the advection-dispersion equation with first order mass-transfer and nonlinear interaction terms. Chromium, Copper, Nickel and Arsenic are usually released under non-equilibrium conditions. DOC might play a role as carrier for those trace metals. By inverse simulations, generally good model fits are derived. Although some parameters are correlated and some model deficiencies can be revealed, we are able to deduce physically reasonable release-mass-transfer time scales. Applying forward simulations, the parameter space with equifinal parameter sets was delineated. The results demonstrate that the presented experimental design is capable of identifying and quantifying non-equilibrium conditions. They show also that the possibility of rate limited release must not be neglected in release and transport studies involving inorganic contaminants. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The end-Permian mass extinction left an indelible mark on trace-fossil assemblages. This is evident during the lag phase of the biotic-recovery interval that occurred in the Early Triassic. Research on the Spathian Virgin Limestone Member of the Moenkopi Formation, western United States, has yielded a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic trace fossil assemblage. The presence of such traces as Thalassinoides, Laevicyclus, and Gyrochorte indicate that previously unreported metazoan behaviors had reappeared in equatorial regions by the close of the Early Triassic. Whereas diversity of trace-fossil assemblages increased from earliest to late Early Triassic time, persistent small size, low average ichnofabric index, low bedding-plane coverage, and reduced tiering point to prolonged stressful environmental conditions following the end-Permian mass extinction-conditions for which there is an abundance of global sedimentological evidence. This trace-fossil assemblage provides a record of soft-bodied organisms that might not otherwise be detected from the study of body fossils alone; it therefore acts as a constraint on the timing of the biotic recovery. This assemblage from the Virgin Limestone Member also serves as an indicator of environmental conditions that might not otherwise be gleaned, illustrating the utility of using trace fossils as environmental proxies during the lag phase of a biotic recovery. The presence of some of these traces (i.e., Thalassinoides) in lowermost Triassic strata of western Canada suggests that the recovery of trace-makers after the end Permian mass extinction was asynchronous, and that northerly latitudes may have experienced a less-protracted biotic recovery than in equatorial regions.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress is a significant environmental challenge faced by food animal production worldwide because of its adverse effects on animal performance and productivity. Trillions of microorganisms living in the gut are essential for host health by participating in various digestive, immune, and metabolic activities. At the same time, they are known to be sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment. The present review summarizes current research progress of how the gut microbial community responds to elevated ambient heat in monogastric animal species and discusses the use of the gut microbiota composition as a potential indicator for heat stress. Heat stress is a current challenge for livestock production, and its impact could dramatically increase if global temperatures continue to climb. Exposure of agricultural animals to high ambient temperatures and humidity would lead to substantial economic losses because it compromises animal performance, productivity, health, and welfare. The gut microbiota plays essential roles in nutrient absorption, energy balance, and immune defenses through profound symbiotic interactions with the host. The homeostasis of those diverse gut microorganisms is critical for the host's overall health and welfare status and also is sensitive to environmental stressors, like heat stress, reflected in altered composition and functionality. This article aims to summarize the research progress on the interactions between heat stress and gut microbiome and discuss the potential use of the gut microbiota composition as a biomarker of heat stress in monogastric animal species. A comprehensive understanding of the gut microbiota's role in responding to or regulating physiological activities induced by heat stress would contribute to developing mitigation strategies.

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life-threatening disease lacking effective therapies. Osthole is a natural coumarin compound isolated from Angelica pubescens Maxim., which possesses hypotensive effect. Although its effects on isolated thoracic aorta (systemic circulating system) are clarified, it remains unclear whether Osthole relaxes isolated pulmonary arteries (PAs) (pulmonary circulating system). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Osthole on isolated PAs and the underlying mechanisms. We examined PA relaxation induced by Osthole in isolated human and rat PA rings with force-electricity transducers, the expression and activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and protein kinase B (Akt) with western blot, and nitric oxide (NO) production using DAF-FM DA fluorescent indicator. The results showed that Osthole elicited a dose-dependent vasorelaxation activity with phenylephrine-precontracted human and rat PA rings, which can be diminished by endothelium denudation and inhibition of eNOS, while having no effect on rat mesenteric arteries. Osthole increased NO release as well as activation of Aid and eNOS, indicated with increased phosphorylations of Aid at Ser-473 and eNOS at Ser-1177 in endothelial cells. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 also blocked Osthole induced vasodilation. In summary, dilative effect of Osthole was dependent on endothelial integrity and NO production, and was mediated by endothelial PI3K/Akt-eNOS-NO pathway. These may provide a new pulmonary vasodilator for the therapy of pulmonary arterial hypertension. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a statistical analysis performed for the watershed and stream corridor in the South Fork of the Clearwater River (SFCR) basin, in north central Idaho. The analysis was performed for 61 six-field hydrological unit codes (HUCs) of the SFCR basin using an extensive record (up to 100 years) for 50 watershed and in-stream parameters, including hydrologic, flow, fish, anthropogenic, and natural activity data. The objective of this research was twofold: first, the development of quantitative relations that describe the Index of Fish Density (IFD) of particular fish species as a function of watershed and instream parameters; and second, to provide a robust confirmation for the effects of some of these parameters, previously recorded by the fisheries profession, by using well established statistical techniques. The uniqueness of this work is the compilation and statistical analysis of large data sets to quantitatively describe the impacts of watershed and instream parameters on the IFD of all salmonids and specific fish species. Factor analysis was employed to regroup parameters that are highly correlated to each other into a set of single factors and to relate the IFD to these factors. Using factor extraction, 12 factors were developed from the 50 watershed and instream parameters. Multiple regression diagnostic tests indicated that only 7 of the 12 factors are strong predictors of fish indicators. The strongest predictors are longitude, latitude, elevation, watershed gradient, and water temperature. The analysis indicated that the present model has reasonable predictive power, considering the uncertainty involved in estimating the interdependence of IFD with watershed parameters.

AB  - Purpose Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, various tumors and invasive surgery can result in ejaculatory dysfunction and testicular insufficiency. Sperm cryopreservation is the only method which can provide a baby for couples. Cryopreservation freezes tissues and cells, allowing them to be stored for future use by stopping all biological activities. Cryopreservation can cause some harmful changes in the structure and function of the sperm. Leptin molecule plays many roles in most biological processes including the satiety and cell renewal, proliferation, angiogenesis, modulation of energy expenditure and regulation of the neuroendocrine system. Leptin was also reported to be associated with spermatogenesis in several studies. Methods This study aims to use leptin molecule as a parameter for sperm motility and DNA fragmentation before and after the cryopreservation. In this study, semen samples were taken from 30 normospermic male volunteers. Each semen sample was examined for the same parameters before and after the cryopreservation. Samples were analyzed before and after cryopreservation in terms of sperm motility by morphological sperm analysis with spermac stain dye, DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay, ultrastructural analysis with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), seminal leptin levels by ELISA method and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by colorimetric method. Results Decreased sperm motility, distribution of sperm morphology and increased DNA fragmentation were determined after cryopreservation. Similarly, seminal ROS and leptin levels were also increased significantly. There was a negative correlation between seminal leptin and sperm motility. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between seminal leptin and DNA fragmentation. Conclusion According to these results, leptin molecule can be used as a marker for sperm motility and DNA fragmentation before and after cryopreservation. We think that the results of this study can contribute to further studies in the clinical aspect.

AB  - Background: Grasslands are heavily utilised for livestock agriculture and the resultant degradation through mismanagement contributes to an estimated 60% of this biome being permanently transformed. This study focused on the impact of fire and grazing in moist highland grasslands.
   Objectives: To determine the contribution of burning frequency and grazing intensity combined (for domestic livestock and indigenous ungulates) on vegetation structure heterogeneity and species diversity.
   Methods: Eight study sites under different management regimes were sampled over two summers. Vegetation structure characteristics and diversity data were collected monthly within multiple replicates in each study site. A disc pasture meter was used to assess standing biomass. Differences in vegetation structure characteristics, plant community composition and plant species assemblage structure across sites were statistically analysed using analyses of variance, indicator species analyses, multidimensional scaling ordinations and two-way cluster analyses.
   Results: The combination of heavy grazing and annual burning leads to a distinct plant community dominated by disturbance specialist species. Selective grazing by indigenous herbivores promotes a community of unpalatable species. This study illustrates that fenced indigenous herbivores, even at moderate stocking densities, have a greater detrimental impact on plant diversity and structure than do domestic livestock.
   Conclusion: Intensive grazing and burning have a detrimental impact on plant species diversity and structure. This also affects resultant palatability for grazing livestock and fenced game. To promote both grazing quality and ecological integrity we recommend a minimum sustainable 'fodder capacity' or standing phytomass of 5000 kg per large-animal unit per hectare for domestic livestock in moist highland grasslands.

AB  - Development of rapid, sensitive and specific methods for detection of infectious enteric viruses in water is challenging but crucial for gaining reliable information for risk assessment. An immunocapture real-time PCR (IC-qPCR) was designed to detect jointly the two major viral particle components, i.e. the capsid protein and the viral genome. Targeting both constituents helps circumventing the technical limits of cell culture approaches and the inability of PCR based methods to predict the infectious status. Two waterborne pathogenic virus models, human adenovirus types 2 and 41, were chosen for this study. IC-qPCR showed a detection limit of 10 MPNCU/reaction with a dynamic range from 10(2) to 10(6) MPNCU/reaction. Sensitivity was thus 100-fold higher compared to ELISA-based capture employing the same anti-hexon antibodies. After optimisation, application on environmental water samples was validated, and specificity towards the targeted virus types was obtained through the qPCR step. Heat-treated pure samples as well as surface water samples brought evidence that this method achieves detection of encapsidated viral genomes while excluding free viral genome amplification. As a consequence, adenovirus concentrations estimated by IC-qPCR were below those calculated by direct qPCR. The results demonstrate that the IC-qPCR method is a sensitive and rapid tool for detecting, in a single-tube assay, structurally intact and thus potentially infectious viral particles in environmental samples.

AB  - The decomposition rates of a macrophyte (Phragmites australis) and an alga (Fucus vesiculosus) and the associated macrofauna communities were studied along a full salinity gradient, using the leaf-bag technique and four sampling times (days 3, 7, 15 and 30). A control was set up using an artificial substrate. A subsequent study conducted in the mesohaline part of the salinity gradient also included empty bags as procedure control. The decay rates of the alga and the macrophyte were significantly different, the alga decaying faster, and presented an opposite trend along the salinity gradient, with the faster decay rate for reed in the less saline areas and for the alga in the euhaline part of the gradient. The fauna associated with the decaying and the artificial substrate showed equally well the benthic succession from the marine to the freshwater areas, in all sampling times. Arthropods were dominant in all substrates along the estuarine gradient and replaced by annelids in freshwater. No significant differences were found between the benthic communities associated with P. australis and F. vesiculosus, despite the strong differences in the decay rates, suggesting that these do not seem to be primarily related to the benthic colonizers. Although the organic substrates sustained a more abundant fauna, the benthic communities did not show significant differences between the organic and the artificial substrates, especially at the level of the species composition, suggesting that the macroinvertebrates may colonize both substrates to feed on the biofilm and/or to seek shelter. The strongly impoverished benthic community sampled by the empty bags reinforced this idea. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Naturally occurring radium isotopes ( Ra-223, Ra-224, (226) Ra, and Ra-228) were measured in lake and tributary water of Cayuga Lake, New York, during the course of a vernal inflow event in the spring of 2001. A large influx of groundwater, probably from a carbonate aquifer, entered the lake at its extreme southern end early in the vernal inflow event and spread northward, covering an extensive part of the southern end of the lake. The low Ra-228/Ra-226 activity ratio of this water mass, compared with bulk lake water, allowed its identification through time. Estimates of mixing with bulk lake water were calculated from changes in the Ra-226 content. Groundwater inflow to the lake around the delta of a major tributary was detected on the basis of Ra-223 and Ra-224 activity of lake and tributary water. Inflow of a water mass to the surface of the take was also detected using Ra-223 and Ra-224 activity. The integrity of this water mass was monitored using short-lived radium isotopes. Suspended sediment in the lake water is a source of the short-lived radium isotopes Ra-223 (similar to2 X 10(-4) dpm L-1) and Ra-224 (similar to3 X 10(-3) dpm L-1), but bottom sediments are a more significant source of Ra-228. Radium isotopes can be valuable new tools in limnological investigations, allowing detection and monitoring of events and processes such as water inflow and mixing, determining sources of inflowing water, and monitoring introduced water masses as they move within the lake.

AB  - Cut flower production in the Bogota savanna is one of Colombia's main export products. Flower production is mainly carried out in greenhouses, as this type of production system has substantial advantages over crops grown in open fields. Protected agriculture provides timely climate management that improves crop yields. The objective of this work was to build and validate a 3D CFD numerical model to understand the spatial distribution of temperatures because of the air flow dynamics inside a typical greenhouse in the Bogota savanna. Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were the statistical indicators used between experimental and simulated wind speed and temperature data. The simulations considered twelve evaluation scenarios that were established based on the climatic conditions characteristic of the study region. The results indicate that under regional conditions of temperature and wind for this type of passive greenhouse, there is a deficient ventilation rate. This rate does not exceed 35 exchanges h(-1) compared to the recommended rates for crops, which is between 45 and 60 air exchanges h(-1) . This renewal rate contributes to the heterogeneity of the microclimatic dynamics of the greenhouse, presenting hot spots with temperature values above 32 degrees C in all examined scenarios. For the lower air speed scenarios (<1 ms(-1)), these areas of high temperature can reach up to 50% of the cultivated area. Therefore, it is suggested that future studies should seek technical solutions to optimize the microclimatic conditions of the greenhouse design used in the Colombian floriculture sector.

AB  - Agricultural water level control is the key to the combined control of water-saving irrigation and controlled drainage. It is easy to observe and master in farmland practice, and has important theoretical and practical significance. In this paper, a systematic study on stomatal regulation and photosynthetic-evapotranspiration coupling mechanism, as well as the effect of meteorological environmental factors on photosynthetic-evapotranspiration coupling mechanism of paddy rice in drought and flooding conditions was conducted by taking paddy field's water level as a regulation indicator of paddy rice's irrigation and drainage. Results showed that net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and evapotranspiration rate (Tr) had quadratic and linear relationship with stomatal conductance (Gs), respectively. The responding range of Gs in drought condition was lower than that in flooding condition. Drought stress aggravated the photosynthetic stomatal limitation of rice leaves at noon, and partial closure of stomata was the main reason resulting in the reduction of Pn suffering from drought at noon. Change curve of paddy rice's leaf temperature difference (T) showed a W or V type daily change curve and its change rule was rightly contrary to that of Tr. Pn had quadratic curve relationships with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and surrounding CO2 concentration (Cs) both in the morning and in the afternoon, Pn had quadratic curve relationships in the morning and linear relationships in the afternoon with air temperature (Ta), respectively. Tr showed linear relationships with PAR, Ta, relative air humidity (RH) and barometric pressure saturation deficit (VPD).

KW  - GAS
AB  - So as to better understand how the gas generation potential of coal changes with increasing rank, sameseam samples of bituminous coal from the Illinois Basin that were naturally matured to varying degrees by the intrusion of an igneous dike were subjected to hydrous pyrolysis (HP) conditions of 360 degrees C for 72 h. The accumulated methane in the reactor headspace was analyzed for delta C-13 and delta H-2, and mol percent composition. Maximum methane production (9.7 mg/g TOC) occurred in the most immature samples (0.5 % R-0), waning to minimal methane values at 2.44 % R-0 (0.67 mg/g TOC), and rebounding to 3.6 mg/g TOC methane in the most mature sample (6.76 % R-0). Methane from coal with the highest initial thermal maturity (6.76 % R-0) shows no isotopic dependence on the reactor water and has a microbial delta C-13 value of -61%. However, methane from coal of minimal initial thermal maturity (0.5 %R-0) shows hydrogen isotopic dependence on the reaction water and has a delta C-13 value of -37%. The gas released from coals under hydrous pyrolysis conditions represents a quantifiable mixture of ancient (270 Ma) methane (likely microbial) that was generated in situ and trapped within the rock during the rapid heating by the dike, and modern (laboratory) thermogenic methane that was generated from the indigenous organic matter due to thermal maturation induced by hydrous pyrolysis conditions. These findings provide an analytical framework for better assessment of natural gas sources and for differentiating generated gas from preexisting trapped gas in coals of various ranks.

AB  - Over the past few decades, the impact of large herbivorous ungulates on forest vegetation has been clearly highlighted. Among those impacts, bark stripping of coniferous trees is one of the most damaging. Bark stripping leads to rot development, inducing serious loss of timber value.
   The present study aimed firstly at evidencing the factors explaining the variations observed in fresh bark peeling rate for spruce and Douglas-fir in southern Belgium and secondly at identifying the key factors to consider when setting up a deer management plan.
   Fresh bark peeling rate was recorded with a systematic sampling survey from 2004 to 2007. The covered territory was then divided into 63 distinct hunting zones of area ranging from 1,000 to 25,000 ha. About 5,000 plots were monitored annually. Each zone was characterized with a large number of explanatory variables. The explanatory variables were integrated firstly into fixed linear models using a stepwise procedure, and then into a mixed model.
   The significant variables included in the model (R (2) = 44 %) are (by decreasing order of importance) red deer densities, proportion of coniferous stands and agricultural areas, snow cover, distance to urban habitats, and species diversity in the understory.
   The models revealed the impacts of several factors on bark peeling: deer density, deer-carrying capacity of the territory, landscape structure, and severity of winter conditions. The adjusted model allowed subtracting the impact of winter conditions in order to produce a relevant indicator for hunting management. In addition, the model was used to assess the sensitivity of a forested area to bark peeling based on its environmental characteristics.

AB  - Testate amoebae that inhabit peat are sensitive indicators of water table position. In this study, we used testate amoebae in sediments from a mire in the western Alps (Lac du Thyl) to: (1) reconstruct the hydrology of the site over the last 7,000 years, (2) determine how hydrological changes affected testate amoebae diversity and (3) infer past trophic state shifts. The study site is located in one of the driest valleys of the Alps and is thus very sensitive to hydrological changes. Our study revealed that the water table depth increased (dry conditions) between 5,800 and 4,000 cal year BP. This triggered establishment of a Sphagnum-type peat and acidic conditions from 5,700 to 4,000 cal year BP. These processes were independent of ongoing transformations of the terrestrial vegetation and soil in the catchment area. After 1,690 cal year BP, the depth to the water table decreased (wetter conditions) and a minerotrophic fen developed. At the same time, the diversity of testate amoebae increased, probably as a result of deforestation that supported the expansion of grassland. Climate and land use were apparently more important factors controlling the lake hydrology than were changes in vegetation and soil in the catchment. Testate amoebae diversity was linked to land cover. Changes in pH were controlled indirectly by external forcing (climate), but more directly by fluctuations in the level of the water table (internal forcing) and autogenous expansion of Sphagnum.

AB  - Tropical cloud forests are characterized by lower air temperature and high frequency of fog condensation at canopy level, as compared with forests at lower altitudes. Few studies have been conducted to understand differences of plant functional traits in relation to the environment in this kind of forest. In this paper, we explored the community-level differences of specific leaf area (SLA) and height of plants in relation to major environmental conditions between two adjacent tropical cloud forests on Hainan Island, South China. We measured the two functional traits for all individual plants within twenty-nine and thirty-two 10 m x 10 m plots located in a low altitude tropical montane evergreen forest (TMEF) and a high altitude tropical dwarf forest (TDF), respectively.
   The results showed that both mean SLA and height decreased from TMEF to TDF, while phenotypic plasticity for the two functional traits increased from TMEF to TDF. Correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis showed that the mean SLA and its plasticity were significantly correlated with both air temperature and soil phosphorus. The mean height was only significantly correlated with air temperature, but its plasticity was significantly correlated with both air temperature and soil phosphorus.
   Our results suggest that plants in dwarf tropical cloud forests have decreased SLA and height, correlated with less favorable soil and atmospheric conditions, with a higher plasticity of these traits, as compared with the tropical montane evergreen forest. Community-level differences in SLA and plant height thus can be taken as indicators characterizing plant distribution to different types of tropical cloud forests. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - This study provides insight into changes in sea ice conditions and the oceanographic environment over the past 500 kyr through analysis of the diatom record. Based on the relative abundance of 13 diatoms species in piston core MD012414, four types of environmental conditions in the central Okhotsk Sea over the last 330 ka BP have been distinguished: (1) open-ocean alternating with seasonal sea-ice cover in Stages 9, 5, and 1; (2) almost open-ocean free of sea-ice cover in Stages 7 and 3; (3) perennial sea-ice cover in Stages 6, 4, and 2; and (4) a warm ice-age dominated by open ocean assemblages in Stage 8. The littoral diatom species, Paralia sulcata, showed a sudden increase from the glacial period to the interglacial period over the last 330 ka BP, except during Stage 8. Such a result implies that melting sea-ice transported terrigenous materials from the north Okhotsk Sea continental shelves to the central ocean during deglaciation. From Stage 13 to Stage 10, however, cold and warm marine conditions unexpectedly occurred in the late interglacial periods and the glacial periods, respectively. One possible reason for this is a lack of age control points from Stage 13 to Stage 10, and the different sediment accumulation rates between glacial and interglacial periods. This study suggests not only the process by which oceanographic variation of sea ice occurred, but also new significance for Paralia sulcata as an indicator in the diatom record of the Okhotsk Sea.

AB  - Sexual selection often affects individuals of the two sexes differently by imposing severe survival costs on individuals of the chosen sex, usually males. These costs may be energetic, physiological, mechanical, or ecological, and they can give rise to sex differences in survival. We studied survival rates of male and female adult Barn Swallows Hirundo rustica in a Danish population during 1984-1998, for the first time using capture mark-recapture techniques to estimate the consequences of sexual selection for sex differences in survival. Males had slightly, but not significantly, higher survival than females. Females had annual survival estimates that were significantly more variable than those for males. Male annual survival rates were not positively correlated with those of females. Hence, different factors were hypothesized to affect male and. female Survival rate. Consistent with this prediction we found that annual male survival decreased with increasing, annual mean length of the outermost tail feathers, which is a secondary sexual character subject to intense directional sexual selection. Heavier females were more likely to survive. Furthermore, females with long tails survived better than short-tailed females. Since tail length in females is an indicator of female condition, both body mass and tail length relationships suggest that females survive better in years when they are in superior condition. Thus, sexual selection as reflected by differences in tail length of males and females contributes in different ways to survival of male and female Barn Swallows.

AB  - Experimental investigations were made into the basicity-acidity indices (pH) and soil biochemical activity (SBA) in the industrial city of Ust'-Ilimsk in conditions of Eastern Siberia. A cartographic representation of the distribution of values of integral indicators of soils in the city is presented for the first time. The significance of the method of mapping urban soils that are experiencing urbanization and technogenesis is emphasized. The investigation was made by using the express method of determining the soil biochemical activity. In addition to this indicator, pH conditions of soils were identified. The study encompassed the main functional zones of two parts of Ust'-Ilimsk: the Old Town (Levoberezhie) and the New Town (Pravoberezhie). The neutral and weakly alkaline soils are of widespread occurrence on the territory. The pH values vary from 7.4 to 7.8; in the control soils, they vary from 6.3 to 6.9. A significant area of the city (43.9%) is occupied by weakly alkaline soils. The level of soil biochemical activity permitted us to categorize the soils as active and very active. The proportion of very active soils makes up 32.9% of the total territory of the city. This indicates a trend of ecological regression, namely a loss of a biogenic element, nitrogen. The study revealed trends of a weak but positive dependence of SBA on pH. The coefficients of approximation are positive and vary, according to the zones of the city, from 0.2 to 0.5. The absolute and relative distribution of the areas with pH and SBA values is shown. A comparative analysis of data revealed a difference of the Ust'-Ilimsk soils from the soils in other cities of the Angara region.

AB  - In Quebec muck soils, Pythium stunt (Pythium tracheiphilum Matta) is responsible for important yield losses in head lettuce crops each year, which can reach up to 50% in certain cases. Despite the significance of the disease, factors influencing its development remain poorly documented, and no disease risk indicators are available, which makes the development of management strategies difficult. Hence, growers systematically use chemical fungicides throughout the growing season to reduce crop losses. However, it is known that soilborne disease incidence or severity may be influenced by soil inoculum density and environmental parameters. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the influence of inoculum density on lettuce growth under controlled conditions and evaluate the influence of soil inoculum density, air temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall on disease incidence under field conditions. In particular, this study aims to develop accurate predictors for Pythium stunt incidence. Results showed that, under controlled environment, thresholds of inoculum density of 97 and 46 propagules per gram of dry soil were needed to reduce lettuce dry weight by one-half for cultivars Estival and Prestige, respectively. These results were confirmed under field conditions, where a soil inoculum density >132 propagules per gram of dry soil combined with air temperatures <18 degrees C for the first 2 weeks and rain accumulation >64 mm for the first 3 weeks after transplanting accurately predicted disease incidence 79% of the time. These relationships improve understanding of seasonal Pythium stunt development and will provide useful tools to develop sustainable management strategies.

AB  - Irrigation water has been recognized as an important microbial risk factor for fruits and vegetables in many production areas, but there is still a lack of information about how the microbiological quality of different irrigation water sources and climatic conditions influence the safety of vegetables produced in Brazil. This study evaluated the distribution of generic E. coli and the prevalence of E. coil O157:H7 in two different water sources (ponds and streams bordering farmlands and urban areas) used for irrigation and on commercially produced lettuces in Southern Brazil. We also evaluated the effect of agricultural factors and meteorological conditions in the potential contamination of water and produce samples. A longitudinal study was conducted on four farms during a year (July 2014 to August 2015). The results showed generic E. coli prevalence of 84.8% and 38.3% in irrigation water samples and on lettuces, respectively, indicating irrigation water as an important source of contamination of lettuces. No significant differences were detected in the counts of E. coli between the two different surface water sources. The climatic conditions, particularly rainfall and environmental temperature, have influenced the high concentration of E. coil. The highest loads of E. coil in irrigation water and on lettuces were found during the warmest time of the year. E. coli O157:H7 was detected by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 13 water samples but only 4 were confirmed by isolation in culture media. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to apply club good theory to challenges in climate justice and to identify the opportunities for creating a club of countries or regions to support climate justice and/or mitigate climate change, as well as the threats that such clubs could lead to the real exclusion of large parts of the world from climate justice.
   Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical analysis is provided regarding the conditions for creating a club for climate change mitigation. Indicators of good governance and trust, as well as the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN), are used to assess the capacity for creating such a club.
   Findings - While opportunities for achieving climate justice are identified, climate change mitigation is likely to be at most a club good at the global level, thus excluding the most vulnerable countries, regions and groups of people. Although the threats of climate change may be acknowledged, they are easily neglected. Economic growth is likely to be a condition for economic sustainability, which in turn tends to be a condition for environmental sustainability. Decision makers should be conscious of the potential danger of creating a club for climate change mitigation based on the belief that economic growth and technology will solve these problems, as such a club is likely to be either unsustainable, or very small, while deepening existing injustice.
   Originality/value - The authors provide an overview of the complexity of issues involved, to gain an appreciation of the vast, perhaps insurmountable, challenges facing climate justice. A club good approach is applied to issues of climate justice, emphasizing the limitations of the all-inclusiveness of climate justice and sustainable development.

AB  - Vulnerability of agriculture to drought conditions is closely related to the challenges of sustainable agriculture and food security. Information on agricultural drought vulnerability status at different scales is crucial for prescription, development and implementation of long-term drought management measures. This study is on developing a composite index for measuring crop-generic agricultural drought vulnerability at disaggregated level, in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh state of India. By analyzing the data on soils, irrigation, farm holdings, rainfall, rainy days, cropping pattern and satellite-based crop condition, 22 input indicators for 1038 spatial units called "Mandals" (within-the-district administrative units) were generated and segregated into exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity components of vulnerability. The composite index was computed for each component by generating the weights for inputs through variance approach. Agricultural drought vulnerability index was generated for each Mandal by combining the three component indices and beta distribution was fitted to it to generate vulnerability classes. Results indicate that the vulnerable group of Mandals represents 57% of agricultural area and 67% of rain-fed crop area of the state. The geographical pattern of vulnerability is well captured by the composite index. Districts dominant with vulnerable Manclals showed frequent drought occurrence and higher crop yield variability. The vulnerability map can be instrumental in prioritizing the areas for drought management interventions. Since the methodology was applied over a large geographic area with diverse conditions of weather, soil and crop, its utility over other geographies is also established. Indicators selection and weights generation are the critical aspects for further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Early vigour is an important characteristic for direct-seeded rice systems. The genetic control of early vigour was studied using a population of 129 backcross lines derived from a cross between Vandana, an improved indica, and Moroberekan, a traditional japonica. Screening was conducted under controlled conditions in greenhouse and field conditions, and indicators of early vigour, including shoot length, shoot biomass, leaf area, number of roots, root biomass, partitioning coefficients, and growth rates, were measured. Phenotypic correlations suggested that traits that were related and combined could be used to define early vigour. Broad-sense heritability ranged from moderate to high. Many regions were identified containing more than one QTL, suggesting that these traits were controlled by pleiotropic and/or closely linked QTLs. Many QTLs were specific to one environment but G x E interaction analysis showed that the main effects of the environment were large. Differences in temperature between experiments resulted in large differences in seedling age when expressed in thermal time. Different genes (QTLs) may be expected to control growth at different time intervals and thus may partly explain the limited agreement between experiments. However, several regions showed co-location of QTLs from more than one experiment. Comparisons with published studies revealed that these regions were previously identified in different genetic backgrounds and could potentially be used as introgression targets in a marker-assisted breeding program to improve germplasm for direct-seeded environments.

AB  - We examined the performance of two household water treatment and safe storage (HWTS) systems, the Danvor plastic biosand filter and the Potters for Peace Filtron ceramic filter, under ideal as well as modified operating conditions using systematic and comparable measurements. The operating variables for the biosand filter were (i) pause times between filtration runs, (ii) water-dosing volumes and (iii) the effluent volume at which a filtered water sample was collected. For the ceramic filter we examined overflow filtration versus standard filtration. We used the bacterial indicators of total coliforms and Escherichia coli to quantify microbiological removal. With the biosand filter, a 12 h pause time had significantly higher total coliform removal than a 36 h pause time at the 20 1 collection point (79.1% versus 73.7%; p < 0.01) and borderline significance at the 10 1 collection point (81.0% versus 78.3%; p = 0.07). High-volume filtration ( 20 1) had significantly lower total coliform removal efficacy than low-volume ( 10 1) filtration at the 10 1 collection point (81.0% versus 84.2%; p = 0.03). We observed a decreasing trend in total coliform removal by sample collection volume with the highest removal efficacy at the 5 l sample collection point ( versus at the 10 and 20 l collection points). Using the ceramic filter, mean total coliform and E. coli removal were significantly lower ( p < 0.01) in overflow filtration than in standard filtration. The findings indicate that operating conditions can reduce the effectiveness of the systems in a field-based setting and increase environmental risk exposure.

AB  - Drought and heat are the major limitations to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production worldwide. Insufficient water supply, often accompanied by high temperature, reduces plant growth, hastens senescence, and produces considerable yield losses. Ethylene production has been often associated with reduced growth and premature senescence, and may therefore be an indicator of plant susceptibility to stress such as drought and heat. A system of rapid and sensitive measurement of plant ethylene production could have potential to identify cultivar-dependent response to environmental constraint. There have been no studies regarding genetic differences in ethylene production rate (EPR) in wheat. The purpose of this study was to compare EPR of two wheat cultivars previously characterized for field performance under drought with a new system of ethylene measurement. Seedlings of the winter wheat cultivars Dropia (stress resistant) and Delia (stress susceptible) were exposed to optimum and stress conditions and measured for EPR. Stress conditions included desiccation, high temperature, and paraquat (Pq; 1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium) induced oxidation. Ethylene was measured with a CO2 laser-driven intracavity photoacoustic (PA) detector which could detect ethylene concentrations as low as 10 pL L-1 and a time response of 40 s. Additional physiological parameters related to stress resistance were measured in eight wheat cultivars including Delia and Dropia. Under desiccation, EPR decreased in both cultivars, and then increased by 2 to 5 fold upon rewatering. Ethylene evolution decreased more in Delia than in Dropia under desiccation. However, Delia produced consistently and significantly more ethylene than Dropia under optimum and all other stress conditions. Enhanced EPR by Delia was consistent with all other physiological measurements, indicating that Delia was more stress-sensitive than Dropia.

AB  - Systemin is a signal peptide that promotes the response to wounding and herbivore attack in tomato. This 18-amino acid peptide is released from a larger precursor, prosystemin. To study the role of systemin as a modulator of defense signaling, we generated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) transgenic plants that overexpress the prosystemin cDNA. We carried out a transcriptomic analysis comparing two different transgenic events with the untransformed control. The Gene Ontology categories of the 503 differentially expressed genes indicated that several biological functions were affected. Systemin promotes the expression of an array of defense genes that are dependent on different signaling pathways and it downregulates genes connected with carbon fixation and carbohydrate metabolism. These alterations present a degree of overlap with the response programs that are classically associated to pathogen defense or abiotic stress protection, implying that end products of the systemin signaling pathway may be more diverse than expected. We show also that the observed transcriptional modifications have a relevant functional outcome, since transgenic lines were more resistant against very different biotic stressors such as aphids (Macrosiphum euphorbiae), phytopathogenic fungi (Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria alternata) and phytophagous larvae (Spodoptera littoralis). Our work demonstrated that in tomato the modulation of a single gene is sufficient to provide a wide resistance against stress by boosting endogenous defense pathways. Overall, the data provided evidence that the systemin peptide might serve as DAMP signal in tomato, acting as a broad indicator of tissue integrity.

AB  - The incorporation of plant-based ingredients, and the possible carry-over of pesticides such as endosulfan, in fish feeds may present new toxicological challenges to aquacultural species. Biological responses of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to a 35-day dietary endosulfan exposure at levels ranging from 4 to 7 10 mu g kg(-1) were assessed using tissue histology and biochemistry. Liver 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deacetylase (EROD) activity was significantly elevated in the highest exposure group (710 mu gkg(-1)) by day 35. Other hepatic indicators of stress impacts and responses (glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase activities and hepatic a-tocopherol content) remained unchanged. Branchial Na+ K+-ATPase activity was significantly reduced at day 14 in the highest exposure group, but returned to control levels by day 35. Conversely, intestinal Na+, K+-ATPase activity was significantly inhibited at day 35, but again only at the highest exposure level. In contrast to the biochemical results, hepatic and intestinal histology revealed effects of exposure even at the lowest dose tested (4 mu g kg(-1)). In the posterior intestine, pathology was characterised by vacuolation and fusion of villi, and in the most severe cases, loss of epithelial integrity in villi tips. In the liver the primary effects were glycogen depletion and lipidosis. These changes were typical of a generalised stress response. While histology endpoints may prove to be the most sensitive indicators of dietary endosulfan exposure, the organismal relevance of these structural changes must be considered in the absence of effects in other biomarkers at dietary levels less than 7 10 mu g kg(-1).

AB  - Urban regions have a high percentage of impervious surfaces which are critical nonpoint pollution sources. To evaluate the role of impervious surfaces on stream quality, a mobile field station was constructed into which stream water was pumped. Study sites were located within one low, two intermediate and two high percent impervious surface watersheds. Stream water entered three 20-gallon, flow-through aquaria which were divided by 1/8" mesh plastic screen into four equal compartments, each containing one male-female fathead minnow breeding pair (n = 12 pairs), and one 4" diameter PVC tube (4" x 4", cut lengthwise) as a breeding substrate. Temperature within the mobile unit (18-25 degreesC) maintained by air conditioners or heaters; water temperature in the aquaria (20-24 degreesC) maintained by aquarium heaters. Daily observations included: reproductive behavior, development of male secondary sexual characteristics, and egg counts. Time spent conducting nest and/or egg care activities, average daily spawn attempts, development of male secondary sexual characteristics (tubercles, dorso-ventral banding, head and body coloration) and male-initiated chasing of female were directly related to percent impervious surface in the watershed (ANOVA, p < 0.05). While spawning frequency and average day to first oviposition were not significantly different between study sites, average daily egg count, number of pairs breeding per day and number of eggs per breeding pair were all associated with land use patterns (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Using reproductive measures in a mobile field station show promise as a flexible method of evaluating water quality in watersheds in urban and urbanizing regions.

AB  - We sampled the carabid beetles in 22 forests managed by six different silvicultural systems, defined by treatment and tree species composition: even-aged conifer, even-aged beech, even-aged oak, uneven-aged conifer, uneven-aged beech and group mixed (beech + conifer). In each of these forests, we placed pitfall traps in young, medium-aged and mature stands (3 stages). We evaluated the effect of treatment, tree species composition, silvicultural system, stage and habitat type (silvicultural system + stage) on indicators of community conservation value and ecological structure. The species composition and the ecological structure of carabid beetles of the managed stands were then compared to that of nine unmanaged stands (without tree exploitation). In the managed forests, species richness was highest in large young stands (3-10 years old) and in forests managed by even-aged systems (with large clear-cuts), mainly due to eurytopic and opportunist carabid species with high dispersal abilities. Oak and beech, uneven-aged, and mature stands were mainly inhabited by typical forest species, and even-aged conifer stands mainly by ubiquitous species. Several typical forest species recorded in unmanaged stands were lacking from the managed forests. Large scale clear-cutting allows open-habitat species to enter the forest, which increases the species richness at a landscape level but can disfavour typical forest species by competition. Long rotations should be implemented and more areas left unmanaged in Belgium, in order to help typical forest species to re-colonise managed forests. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quantification of interactions of soil conditions, plant available water and weather conditions on crop development and production is the key for optimizing field management to achieve optimal production. The goal of this study was to quantify the effects of soil and weather conditions on cotton development and production using temporal aerial imagery data, weather and soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) of the field. Soil texture, i.e., percent of sand and clay content, was calculated from ECa to estimate three soil quality indicators, including field capacity, wilting point and total available water. A water stress coefficient K-s was calculated using soil texture and weather data. Image features of canopy size and vegetation indices (VIs) were extracted from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral images at three growth stages of cotton in 2018 and 2019. Pearson correlation (r), analysis of variance (ANOVA) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used to quantify the relationships between crop response derived from UAV images and environments (soil texture and weather). Results showed that soil clay content in shallower layers (0-0.4 m) affected crop development in earlier growth stages (June and July) while those in deeper layers (0.4-0.7 m) affected the later-season growth stages (August and September). Soil clay content at 0.4-0.7 m had a higher impact on crop development when water inputs were not sufficient, while K-s features had a higher contribution to the prediction of crop growth when irrigation was applied and water stress was less.

AB  - Purpose Catastrophe of steel-structured bridges due to progressive localized corrosion may lead to a major loss in terms of life and cost if not monitored continuously or periodically. The purpose of this paper is to present a vibration-based strategy to assess the severity and monitor the deterioration caused by corrosion-induced localized damage in a simply-supported steel beam. Design/methodology/approach The threshold damage level is defined up to the yield limit of a simply supported steel beam of size ISMB 150 x 8 x 5 under three-point bending test and the progressive damage is induced through a continuous accelerated corrosion test. Change in the fundamental natural frequency due to localized damage in the experimental beam and the modulus of elasticity (E) in the corroded zone of an updated finite element (FE) model is evaluated. Findings The updated FE model of the damaged beam shows a clear trend with the progressive damage of the beam and, hence, can be used to monitor the severity of damage and remaining capacity assessment of the monitored beam. Originality/value Steel-structured bridges are prone to localized corrosion attack, and there are no standardized process or predictive model available by international steel design codes on how to consider corrosion damage in the condition assessment analysis. The vibration-based methods have gained popularity for condition assessment, and are mostly confined to damage assessment of corroded reinforced concrete (RC) beams. In this work, a vibration-based approach is presented for degradation assessment of steel beam due to progressive localized corrosion using modal hammer test.

AB  - The article is devoted to the development of a multicomponent adaptive strategy for managing Russian high-tech enterprises in modern crisis conditions. Adaptability and flexibility are considered as the most important indicators of the efficiency of structures, their ability to ensure sustainable operation and effective innovative development of high-tech enterprises. A significant place in the article is devoted to possible approaches and methods of adaptive management of the enterprise in crisis, with the help of which changes in the internal and external environment are monitored, which can be expected and random, make current operational decisions that contribute to the achievement of pre-set goals based on correction of certain tasks. The questions about the quality of adaptation, adaptive characteristics of the structure and their consistency with the level and quality of adaptation of other elements of the enterprise, conjugation of adaptability and flexibility and pace of changes are considered. A number of modern techniques related to the development of strategies for the development of high-tech enterprises in crisis conditions are analyzed. The necessity of conducting a comprehensive accounting of the crisis as the main factor associated with the uncertainty of the external environment at the stage of strategic analysis is substantiated. There is an option, in which it is possible to include the crisis and its main characteristics into the strategic three competence model of the enterprise, as an additional controlled parameter. There is a general specificity of the formation of the strategy of a high-tech enterprise in conditions of risk and uncertainty.

AB  - Warming global temperatures are predicted to reduce population viability in many oviparous ectothermic taxa, with increased embryonic mortality likely to be a main cause. While research on embryonic upper thermal limits is extensive, sea turtle hatchling thermal tolerance has received less attention and our understanding of how incubation conditions influence hatchling thermal tolerance is limited. Here, we report green turtle Chelonia mydas hatchling hydration and thermal tolerance following incubation in dry and wet conditions. We used packed cell volume and total protein as indicators of hydration and measured the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of hatchlings in air. Neither hydration nor thermal tolerance was directly influenced by moisture treatment. However, hatchlings from moister nests had longer incubation durations (wet: 60.11 d vs. dry: 54.86 d), and, using incubation duration as a proxy for incubation temperature, hatchlings from cooler nests had significantly lower CTmax (wet: 39.84 degrees C vs. dry: 40.51 degrees C). Thus, despite not directly influencing thermal tolerance, moisture treatment influenced nest temperature indirectly; hatchlings that experienced warmer conditions in dry nests had a higher thermal tolerance than hatchlings from cooler and wetter nests. Ectothermic neonates may have greater plasticity in their thermal tolerance than previously thought, but their ability to adapt to increasing temperature is likely limited. Additionally, common management techniques to reduce nest temperatures, such as watering and shading nests, may only reduce embryonic mortality at the cost of decreased hatchling thermal tolerance and increased hatchling mortality during emergence. Nesting-site management interventions designed to reduce embryonic mortality will need to consider mitigation of the possible effects of those interventions on hatchling mortality.

AB  - 1. In studies of birds and their pathogens, spleen size has frequently been used to make inferences about immune system strength. However, the use of spleen size in mammals is more complicated because, in addition to having an immune function, the mammalian spleen is also a reservoir for red blood cells.
   2. To assess the reliability of mammalian spleen mass as an indicator of immune activity, we quantified the white and red pulp mass by histology of spleens from shot red deer Cervus elaphus. We then analysed the relationships among spleen mass, the amounts of white and red pulp, and the deer's body condition relative to faecal counts of the nematode parasite Elaphostrongylus cervi.
   3. White and red pulp mass were positively correlated so that an increase in spleen mass was a positive function of both components of the spleen. In male deer, which had significantly lower body condition and higher parasite loads than females, parasite counts were negatively correlated with spleen mass, white pulp mass, and red pulp mass.
   4. Our findings suggest that (i) spleen mass in shot red deer is a reliable measure of white and red pulp content; and (ii) when looking at the red deer life history, which is greatly influenced by sex of the deer, splenic mass and white pulp mass could be used as reflections of immune system strength.
   5. Future studies of mammalian spleens can contribute to the understanding of evolved strategies of immune response investment in mammals. However, determination of the white and red pulp spleen components using various sampling methods must be made prior to their application.

AB  - The comparison of selected soil mechanical parameters measured on plastic soils under remoulded and structurally intact conditions may provide an opportunity to assess soil structural quality on. a regional or even broader scale. This study was conducted to determine: (i) if existing pedotransfer functions developed for southwestern Ontario soils could be used outside this physiographic region, and (ii) if key mechanical parameters were sensitive to a range of land use conditions that are likely to influence soil structural quality. Soil profiles were sampled in natural (forested or grassland), agricultural and pipeline workspace areas (land use variable) located in southwestern Ontario, eastern Ontario, Alberta and Texas (mineralogy variable). Slurry consolidation and uniaxial compression tests were conducted on remoulded and structurally intact samples, the resulting void ratio-log stress [e(logsigma')]data were fitted to linear or nonlinear model equations, respectively, and several key mechanical parameters were derived. The effective stresses at the liquid and plastic limits could not be adequately estimated for soils with smectitic mineralogy using existing pedotransfer functions because of the absence of a significant relationship with organic carbon content. The difference between void ratio intercepts for remoulded and structurally intact soils (e(*) (1kPa) - e(0)) was found to be a suitable indicator of physical soil quality because of the convergence of remoulded and structured compression lines in e(logsigma') co-ordinates. Severely overconsolidated soils were identified when the (e(*) (1kPa) - e(0)) variable exceeded 0.40. This threshold also corresponded to soil conditions that could limit plant growth.

AB  - Soils formed in dark-colored glacial till (chroma 3, value < 4) are common in southern New England, The low chroma, low-value colors reflect the carboniferous nature of the sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks that compose the till. Much of this till is very dense, resulting in soils with seasonal high water tables. The inherent dark colors of the soils make it difficult to use hydromorphic features to estimate depths of seasonal saturation. We examined thin sections to determine if micromorphology could be used to elucidate the apparent lack of hydromorphic features in seasonally saturated Bw horizons formed in dark till. Observation wells were monitored for 18 months to establish water table seasonal fluctuations in soils on shoulder positions. Hydromorphic features were examined in the field and in thin sections to correlate with the seasonal water table levels. Soils showed seasonal saturation and were classified as Humic Epiaquepts and Typic Humaquepts. Water levels frequently rose into the upper Bw horizons. One of the soils examined met hydric soil criteria based on hydrology, Hydric soil indicators such as a depleted matrix (F3) were absent. The dark parent materials were most likely preventing the observation of morphologic indicators of reducing conditions. Redoximorphic features were not identified by field observations in the seasonally saturated upper Bw horizons. Thin sections of the upper Bw horizons revealed redoximorphic features that were too faint, fine, or had boundaries too diffuse to be observed in the field. Identifying hydromorphic features in lower horizons and, with the aid of magnification, tracing these features carefully into overlying horizons may help identify the depth to aquic conditions in low chroma-low value seasonally saturated soils.

AB  - Biological Cr(VI) reduction was studied in anaerobic sediments from an aquifer in Norman, Okla. Microcosms containing sediment and mineral medium were amended with various electron donors to determine those most important for biological Cr(VI) reduction. Cr(VI) (about 340 muM) was reduced with endogenous substrates (no donor), or acetate was added. The addition of formate, hydrogen, and glucose stimulated Cr(VI) reduction compared with reduction in unamended controls. From these sediments, an anaerobic Cr(VI)utilizing enrichment was obtained that was dependent upon hydrogen for both growth and Cr(VI) reduction. No methane was produced by the enrichment, which reduced about 750 muM Cr(VI) in less than six days. The dissolved hydrogen concentration was used as an indicator of the terminal electron accepting process occurring in the sediments. Microcosms with sediments, groundwater, and chromate metabolized hydrogen to a concentration below the detection limits of the mercury vapor gas chromatograph. In microcosms without chromate, the hydrogen concentration was about 8 muM, a concentration comparable to that under methanogenic conditions. When these microcosms were amended with 500 muM Cr(VI), the dissolved hydrogen concentration quickly fell below the detection limits. These results showed that the hydrogen concentration under chromate-reducing conditions became very low, as low as that reported under nitrate- and manganese-reducing conditions, a result consistent with the free energy changes for these reactions. The utilization of formate, lactate, hydrogen, and glucose as electron donors for Cr(VI) reduction indicates that increasing the availability of hydrogen results in a greater capacity for Cr(VI) reduction. This conclusion is supported by the existence of an enrichment dependent upon hydrogen for growth and Cr(VI) reduction.

AB  - In this study of the Southern Federal District (SFD) in mainland Russia, the spatial nature and temporal trends of the growing season duration, its provision with thermal energy and moisture, and the phenomena of stress temperature for plants were analyzed on the basis of climatic data from 20 meteorological stations for the period 1960-2018. The growing season length (GSL), frost-free period (FFP), last frost day (LFD), and first frost day (FFD) indices were used as an indicator of the onset time and the duration of the growing season. The growing degree day (GDD) index was used as an indicator of heat supply of the growing season. The Selyaninov's hydrothermal coefficient (HTC) was used to assess the moisture supply regime. Plant heat stress (PHS) and plant high heat stress (PHHS) were used as indicators of heat stress. In the southern part near the Black Sea coast and in the Caucasus foothills, the most favorable conditions were noted as regards the growing season duration, heat supply of plants, and the moisture regime. The most extreme conditions are typical for the eastern part, where the moisture supply level is low and there are many days with stressful temperatures for plants. Trend analysis of the agro-climatic indices for the SFD territory showed an increase in GSL and FFP mainly due to the later onset of FFD in 1960-2018. In almost every case, there is a statistically significant upward trend in GDD, PHS, and PHHS. For HTC, in general, there is an insignificant downward trend.

AB  - The advancement of vehicular technologies for automated driving will lead to a mixed traffic flow that depends on the interaction between automated vehicles (AVs) and manually driven vehicles (MVs) because the market penetration rate (MPR) of AVs will gradually increase over time. Because automated driving environments provide us with a valuable opportunity for controlling individual vehicle operation, a strategic policy for managing AVs operation is expected to enhance the performance of the traffic stream. Therefore, the operation of AVs needs to be properly determined to cope with various traffic and road conditions and thereby facilitate smooth and effective vehicle interactions. This study proposed a novel traffic management strategy in automated driving environments by adjusting the driving aggressiveness of AV operation, defined as automated driving aggressiveness (AuDA). VISSIM microscopic simulation experiments were conducted to derive the proper AuDAs to enhance both the traffic safety and the mobility performance. Traffic conflict rates and average travel speeds were used as indicators for the performance of safety and operations. While conducting the simulations, the level of service (LOS) and MPR of the AVs were also considered. In addition, the relationship between key variables for adaptive cruise control (ACC) operations and AuDA policies was explored to better support the understanding of how the proposed methodology works in practice. Promising results showed that the proposed methodology would be effective in optimizing the performance of mixed traffic conditions. Furthermore, the outcome will be valuable in developing various policies and guidelines to manage the operation of AV in automated driving environments.

AB  - Enrichment of strawberry juices with prebiotic fiber (inulin and oligofructose) and their preservation treatment (with ultrasound and geraniol) were optimized by response surface methodology with a Box-Behnken design in order to simultaneously maximize microbiological, nutritional, and sensory quality of juices after 2 weeks of refrigerated storage. The optimal conditions were inulin/oligofructose proportion of 5:3, 0.225 mu L/mL of geraniol and ultrasound time equal to 0, with a desirability value of 0.77. After that, strawberry juices were treated at optimal conditions to investigate changes on microbiological (native microflora), nutritional (including ascorbic acid content and antioxidant capacity indicators), sensory quality and safety (simulating an eventual postharvest contamination with Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria innocua) during storage. Finally, a study evaluating the performance of the optimized treatment on stability of prebiotics added to strawberry juices was carried out. The optimized treatment was highly effective to reduce native microflora counts, as well as, to inhibit those inoculated pathogens in juices. Treatment at optimal conditions did not induce any negative effect neither on antioxidant capacity indicators nor on ascorbic acid content of juices. Furthermore, the optimized treatment ensured the stability of inulin and oligofructose added to juices during storage. The simultaneous optimization allowed lower concentrations of geraniol, reducing the impact on sensory quality. Therefore, the enrichment and treatment of strawberry optimized and proposed in this work could be a feasible alternative to thermal pasteurization to ensure the microbiological quality and safety in juices, as well as, to improve nutritional and sensory quality.

AB  - This study investigates the geochemical characteristics of recent shallow-water aragonite-rich sediments from the karstic marine lakes located in the pristine environment on the island of Mljet (Adriatic Sea). Different trace elements were used as authigenic mineral formation, palaeoredox and pollution indicators. The distribution and the historical record of trace elements deposition mostly depended on the sedimentological processes associated with the formation of aragonite, early diagenetic processes governed by the prevailing physico-chemical conditions and on the recent anthropogenic activity. This study demonstrated that Sr could be used as a proxy indicating authigenic formation of aragonite in a marine carbonate sedimentological environment. Distribution of the redox sensitive elements Mo, TI, U and Cd was used to identify changes in redox conditions in the investigated lake system and to determine the geochemical cycle of these elements through environmental changes over the last 100 years. The significant enrichment of these elements and the presence of early formed nanostructured authigenic framboidal pyrite in laminated deeper parts of sediment in Malo Jezero, indicate sporadic events of oxygen-depleted euxinic conditions in the recent past. Concentrations of trace elements were in the range characteristic for non-contaminated marine carbonates. However, the increase in the concentrations of Zn, Cu, Pb, Sn, Bi in the upper-most sediment strata of Veliko Jezero indicates a low level of trace element pollution, resulting from anthropogenic inputs over the last 40 years. The presence of butyltin compounds (BuTs) in the surface sediment of Veliko Jezero additionally indicates the anthropogenic influence in the recent past. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems depend on terrestrial organic matter (tOM) to regulate many functions, such as food web production and water quality, but an increasing frequency and intensity of drought across northern ecosystems is threatening to disrupt this important connection. Dry conditions reduce tOM export and can also oxidize wetland soils and release stored contaminants into stream flow after rainfall. Here, we test whether these disruptions to terrestrial-aquatic linkages occur during mild summer drought and whether this affects biota across 43 littoral zone sites in 11 lakes. We use copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) as representative contaminants, and measure abundances of Hyalella azteca, a widespread indicator of ecosystem condition and food web production. We found that tOM concentrations were reduced but correlations with organic soils (wetlands and riparian forests) persisted during mild drought and were sufficient to suppress labile Cu concentrations. Wetlands, however, also became a source of labile Ni to littoral zones, which was linked to reduced abundances of the amphipod H. azteca, on average by up to 70 times across the range of observed Ni concentrations. This reveals a duality in the functional linkage of organic soils to aquatic ecosystems whereby they can help buffer the effects of hydrologic disconnection between catchments and lakes but at the cost of biogeochemical changes that release stored contaminants. As evidence of the toxicity of trace contaminant concentrations and their global dispersion grows, sustaining links among forests, organic soils and aquatic ecosystems in a changing climate will become increasingly important.

AB  - This work explores the possibilities of biomass production, for energy purposes, of Siberian elm in Mediterranean areas, including marginal lands with poor soil and low water availability. To achieve this, the influence of soil type, planting density, and water availability on biomass production were analyzed after the first 3 years of the growing cycle in 2 different locations. Moreover, a method to estimate biomass production as a function of some morphological parameters of the trees, as well as the use of leaf water potential as a good indicator of trees' water status, are discussed. The analysis of parameters having an influence on elm growth showed that soil type is the most important factor to obtain a good yield. In soils with enough nutrients and higher water-holding capacity, biomass productions in the range 13-14 Mg DM ha(-1) were achieved even under rainfed conditions. In irrigated plots, Siberian elm production was more than double the production of biomass under rainfed conditions; however, significant differences were not found between the 2 different irrigation doses under study. Biomass yield was greater for the highest planting density (6666 plants ha(-1)). Leaf water potential has been shown to be a useful tool for finding out plant water status. Tree growth showed a direct relationship to midmorning leaf water potential, and it was equal to 0 for leaf water potentials lower than -1.83 MPa; this value indicates a great resistance to drought by the species.

AB  - The late Holocene distribution of agglutinated foraminifera and freshwater thecamoebians was documented within a 12.26-m piston core (VEC02A04) deposited between 1090 to similar to 4560 cal. yr BP, collected from the glacier-carved Frederick Sound, Seymour-Belize Inlet Complex (SBIC), British Columbia. Core sediments contained unevenly distributed, massive and laminated intervals interrupted by occasional slumps and turbidites. The microfauna was characterized by low diversity and low abundances of agglutinated foraminifera (Shannon Diversity Index <= 1.36) with rare allochthonous freshwater thecamoebians. The predominance of low-oxygen-tolerant agglutinated foraminifera, and absence of calcareous species indicate that dysoxia was the main environmental stressor. Abundant organic matter in the core sediments provides additional evidence of low-oxygen conditions that excluded most organisms that might have utilized this rich food resource.
   A moderate up-core increase in the abundance of glaciomarine indicator species (e.g., Spiroplectammina biformis, Recurvoides turbinatus, Portatrochammina bipolaris, and Cribrostomoides jeffreysii) after 3125 cal. yr BP (above 7.19 m) indicates a subtle shift to progressively cooler bottom-water conditions. The presence of varying proportions of thecamoebians through this upper core interval was likely related to increased spring snowmelt or early summer precipitation, resulting in increased terrestrial erosion (e.g., reworking of marsh sediments into the fjord). Development of relatively cooler/drier climate conditions in the SBIC during the late Holocene corresponds to the neoglacial advances in the NE Pacific, which is directly linked to a weakened and/or westward shift in the center of action of the Aleutian Low Pressure System.

AB  - In the last two decades, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been used commonly as an indicator of the stress experienced by individual organisms during development, although the technique has not been without controversy. In general, estimates of FA in populations have been positively correlated with measures of stress but, in the few studies in which it has been investigated, the correlations between estimates of FA and stress in individuals have been inconsistent. This study compared the FA in the opposite spines of stems and flowers to other bio-indicators of physiological stress in plants, such as annual crown growth ratio, annual flower production, annual crown death ratio, and branch fractal dimension. The position of an individual Echinospartum horridum within a patch influenced the stress conditions, and influenced its colonization strategy. Plants in the interior of patches are under high intraspecific competition due to negative density feedback (low flower production and branch biomass, and high annual crown death ratio), showed larger flower FA and spines FA repeatability (within-individual variation in FA) than plants at the periphery. Plant growth rates and the FA of spines were negatively correlated, but flower asymmetry and flower production was not significantly correlated, which reflects the capacity of E. horridum to adjust flower production to its developing conditions. We concluded that because organisms respond differently to different conditions, enhanced by the plasticity of plants in the development of morphological structures in response to changes in the environment, it is advisable to use multiple parameters to assess physiological stress in plants.

AB  - Wetlands are natural resources that are protected under federal regulations; therefore, the delineation of wetlands is necessary to ensure their protection. Standard methods used for delineating wetlands can be time consuming, or a wetland could be problematic, i.e., lacking hydrophytic vegetation or hydric soil indicators, or periodically lacking hydrologic indicators. A magnetic susceptibility study could be an additional technique used to aid in the delineation process. A study using magnetic susceptibility was undertaken in central Mississippi to identify the transitional zone or boundary between non-hydric (uplands) and hydric (wetlands) soils. The soils were silt loam with a minor percentage of sand. A survey line that traversed the transitional zone between wetland and upland on each end of the transect was revisited four times during a single year and once two years later. One survey was conducted a few weeks after the winter inundation (moderately wet soil conditions), one was conducted several months after inundation but immediately after some heavy rainfall (moderately wet soil conditions), and two were conducted several weeks or months after inundation or significant rainfall (dry soil conditions). There were measurable differences between the magnetic susceptibility values collected in the upland and wetland regions during each survey. One transitional zone was easily identified using magnetic susceptibility, exhibiting a sharp decrease in susceptibility values between the upland and wetland. The other transitional zone contained an intermediate ridge, which made demarcation of the zone less obvious. The measured magnetic susceptibility values were comparable for the respective upland, transition, and wetland regions, and the characteristics of the curves were similar for all time-periods. Overall, magnetic susceptibility proved to be a successful method for delineating a wetland in this area.

AB  - The extreme effects of heat stress can cause losses exceeding 5% of all the cattle on feed in a single feedlot. These losses can be devastating to a localized area of feedlot producers. Animal heat stress is a result of the combination of three different components: environmental conditions, animal susceptibility, and management. This article describes the development of a model to predict individual animal susceptibility to heat stress. The model utilizes a hierarchical knowledge-based fuzzy inference system with 11 animal characteristics (color, sex, species, temperament, hair thickness, previous exposure to hot conditions, age, condition score, previous cases of pneumonia, previous other health issues, and current health) to predict susceptibility to heat stress. For model validation, a team of experts was asked to assess the susceptibility to heat stress of ten hypothetical animals. The output of the model was tested against the experts' opinions. The validation equation had a slope of 1.038 +/- 0.047 with an intercept of -0.063 +/- 0.028 and an R-2 value of 0.88. The opinions of the experts were also compared to the model output by comparing the stress susceptibility class of each of the ten hypothetical animals. The model and the experts agreed perfectly on seven of the ten animals. Further, the model prediction and the experts' opinions deviated by no more than one class on the remaining three animals. This exercise revealed that there was agreement between the model output and the experts' opinions.

AB  - Introduction. Human disturbance has recently led to increasingly serious destruction of Sphagnum L. wetlands in subtropical high mountains, resulting in an urgent need for wetland restoration. Methods. Through a field experiment conducted in western Hubei Province, China, the effects of four different microtopographic types [concave surface, convex surface, concave and convex surface (CC surface), and flat surface] and water table depth (0 to -30 cm) on three growth indicators (number of capitula, coverage and biomass) of Sphagnum palustre L. were examined. The objective was to identify the optimal hydrological conditions for S. palustre growth and thus facilitate its rapid recolonisation and restoration of these wetlands. Key results. The results showed that different microtopographic conditions significantly influenced S. palustre growth. Among them, S. palustre in the CC surface showed the worst growth, while no significant differences existed among the other three microtopographic types. Additionally, as the water table increased, the growth of S. palustre increased, but long-term flooding impeded growth. The water table affected S. palustre growth via effects on its tissue water content. Conclusions. Microtopographic reshaping was not essential for the success of S. palustre recolonisation, and microtopography that maintained the water table to within -10 cm of the surface without flooding were best, independent of the microtopographic types. In addition, the growth patterns of S. palustre changed with changes in the environment, which may be related to its long-term adaptation to conditions of a lower water table.

AB  - Lake sedimentation represents a collective record of atmospheric and surface processes operating over the catchment areas. Magnetic minerals along with heavy metal assemblages can selectively represent the ongoing impact of dominant environmental processes over the catchment regions. Lake bottom sediments collected from Anchar Lake were investigated to trace the magnetic and heavy metal signatures in context to quantify the environmental conditions from one of the ideal setup of lake catchment in the Srinagar valley of Kashmir Himalaya. Magnetic parameters such as chi(ARM), SIRM and Soft(IRM) revealed predominant soft ferrimagnetic mineralogy. The S-ratio showing a mean value of - 0.69 within a range of - 0.77 to - 0.57 depicted majority of PSD-SD ferrimagnetic grains. The chi(lf) versus chi(fd) % biplot suggest the presence of mixture of SP and coarser magnetic grains controlling the magnetic susceptibility signals in the lake bottom sediments. The magnetic parameters and heavy metal constituents in particular S-ratio, SIRM/chi(lf), chi(ARM)/chi(lf) and chi(ARM) exhibit significant correlation with Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn. Furthermore, spatial variability of these parameters depicts a complex of detritus influx, anthropogenic inputs, and the domain size of minerals reflecting oxidizing and reducing conditions with sharp changes in the peripheral part and gradual mixing towards the central and deeper parts of the lake basin. Multivariate statistical analyses (Pearson correlation, cluster and factor analyses) attest direct relation of the heavy metals with mineral magnetic assemblages. Overall, the results reflect heterogeneity in the record within the lake basin at the scales of 10's of meters attributed to basin lacustrine conditions.

AB  - Variable fluorescence normalized to maximal fluorescence, F-v/F-m, determined by Fast Repetition Rate Fluorometry (FRRF) is being increasingly used to compare photosynthetic electron transport capacity in natural phytoplankton communities. Interpreting results of such studies is, however, complicated by the fact that both nutrient status and light history (photoinhibition under in situ conditions) are known to influence F-v/F-m. Thus, the value of F-v/F-m measurements in the field would be greatly enhanced if the light history signal could be separated from other influences. Here, both field and laboratory studies demonstrate that dark treatment (30 min-4 h) before FRRF measurement is not sufficient to remove a light history signal in F-v/F-m. The signal could, however, be essentially eliminated by incubation of samples in low light prior to F-v/F-m determination. For the study conditions tested, the most effective treatment for removal of the signal was 4 h at 50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, the effectiveness of the light treatment in removing the light history was influenced by temperature. Therefore, no universal protocol for eliminating the light history signal can be developed, but recommendations are given for developing site-specific approaches for separating the light history signal from other factors influencing F-v/F-m. Carrying out light incubations before determining F-v/F-m not only provides the possibility for eliminating a light history signal in the measurements but the difference between F-v/F-m measured after light and dark incubations appears also to be a potentially useful indicator of the degree of photoinhibition experienced by phytoplankton under natural conditions.

AB  - Members of the nonbiting midge family Chironomidae have been used worldwide as water-quality indicators or toxicity test organisms. The purpose of this study was to establish the chironomid Glyptotendipes tokunagai Sasa as a new test species by conducting successive rearing under laboratory conditions. We monitored biological and genetic aspects of >42 successive generations over 7 yr, and also compared the development of the 39th generation with the fourth generation under five constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C. We observed that the number of eggs in an egg mass and the adult body sizes decreased rapidly in the early generations, and thereafter tended to stabilize from the fifth generation to the 42nd generation. In all generations, the mean hatching rate was >75%. Males were predominant in the early generations, but the sex ratio increased to 0.5 (ranged 0.24-0.61) in later generations. The genetic divergence of the reared generations, analyzed by using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, decreased from 0.0049 to 0.0004 as the generations progressed. In comparison with the fourth generation, the mortality and developmental time of the 39th generation were generally greater, and the adult body sizes were generally smaller. The estimated low developmental threshold temperatures of eggs, male larvae to male adults, and female larvae to female adults were 9.6, 11.3, and 9.7 degrees C, respectively. The optimal rearing temperature was determined to be 25 degrees C. This is the first record of domesticated rearing of a wild chironomid species under laboratory conditions for >7 yr.

AB  - After about 50 years of research on fluctuating asymmetry ( FA) as a reliable indicator of both individual quality and environmental stress, the enthusiasm is beginning to decline. The findings of many studies are inconsistent and the relationship between FA and stress appears both weaker and more complex than first thought. To provide clarification of the debate, new studies should use more efficient and unified statistical protocols, large sample sizes and joint analysis of several related traits. In addition, fitness-FA associations should be tested at the individual level, in different populations and under different environmental conditions. To achieve these criteria, we describe a 9-year study in which we measured six antler traits of 3 000 Iberian red deer, Cervus elaphus hispanicus, from three study areas in southwest Spain. Males were harvested during hunting activities and measured, weighed and aged post mortem. We found evidence of correlations between traits in FA, an association between asymmetry and stress conditions and a weak but significant negative relationship between FA and fitness surrogates (body mass and antler size), thus supporting some assumptions of the FA hypothesis. As also predicted by theory, antler traits of less functional importance were more asymmetric and more sensitive to stress than those directly used in fighting behaviour. The relationship between age and antler asymmetry was U-shaped, suggesting an effect of sexual selection on antler development in favour of larger and more symmetrical antlers during prime age.

AB  - We compared the within- and among-lake variability of benthic communities in small, nearpristine lakes vs lakes affected by nonpoint-source pollution in southern Finland. We used 2 sampling methods, profundal grab sampling and the chironomid pupal exuvial technique (CPET), and compared the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of the 2 data sets. We also assessed lake condition using the benthic quality index, identified macroinvertebrate taxa indicative of different trophic conditions, and evaluated the concordance of species ordinations obtained using the 2 collection methods. Both data sets discriminated effectively among the lake groups, and the 2 community ordinations were significantly concordant. The number of chironomid species in the CPET samples was higher than the total number of macroinvertebrate taxa found in the profundal grab samples, and the CPET method appeared more efficient than profundal grab sampling at detecting profundal taxa. Despite the slightly stronger signal strength of the profundal grab samples, randomization tests showed that only the CPET data had S/N significantly higher than expected by chance. CPET data also better reflected the trophic status of the lakes. Indicator species analysis showed that 7 chironomid taxa and Pisidium spp. (Sphaeridae) indicated good water quality, whereas 5 chironomid species and the phantom midge Chaoborus flavicans indicated impacted conditions in these lakes. Our results suggest that CPET might be more efficient than profundal grab sampling for describing the chironomid fauna and the ecological status of small mesohumic lakes, and it should be considered as an alternative or supplementary assessment tool to more traditional methods.

AB  - Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene is frequently used as a major metabolite and biological indicator of the overall exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, solid phase extraction was appropriately conditioned with regard to sample pH, sample concentration, loading flow rate, elution solvent, washing solvent, sample volume and sorbent mass. Octadecyl silica cartridge (C-18) was used as solid phase adsorbent and showed to be an efficient phase in simplifying sample preparation for 1-hydroxypyrene. Methanol extracted analyte from spiked urine gave a clean sample for reverse-phase HPLC-florescence. In the developed solid phase extraction, conditions (sample pH: 5, sample concentration: 10 mu/l, washing solvent: distilled water, eluent: methanol, sample volume: 200 ml sample flow rate: 10 ml/min), the extraction recovery exceeded 99.96%, achieving detection: limit of 0.02 mu g/l. The extraction factors (sample pH, sample, concentration, washing solvent, eluent, sample volume and sample flow rate), were evaluated statistically and also the procedure was validated with three different pools of spiked urine samples at low, medium, and high sample concentrations and showed a good reproducibility over six consecutive days as well as six within-day experiments. All coefficients of variations were less than 3.1%. Finally, urinary 1-hydroxypyrene of industrially exposed workers was also measured, using the appropriate conditions obtained in this study, in which, the amount of the compound of interest in the total exposed subjects was significantly higher than those of non-exposed.

AB  - The relationship between feather quality, estimated through the prevalence and intensity of feather holes, and the breeding performance and survival of the Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica was studied over a 5-year period. In addition, we present some indirect data on the role of chewing lice in producing the feather holes. The balanced distribution of feather holes (high prevalence, low aggregation) corresponds with the pattern of distribution of lice on colonial birds, and in the Barn Swallow. Feather holes were significantly and positively associated with the arrival dates of the birds, as both males and females with an increased number of feather holes started laying later. Females that survived the winter had significantly fewer holes than non-surviving females, whereas there was no difference in feather hole number between surviving and non-surviving males. Given that there was no association between the number of feather holes and body condition indices, except for the tail length of male Barn Swallows, we suggest that the negative effect of feather holes on the fitness of the birds is mainly apparent during periods of intensive locomotor activity, such as migration. Alternatively, if feather holes are an indicator of quality, those birds with a high intensity of feather holes may have been of poor quality. These birds may have been less able to cope with the environmental conditions, resulting in the lower survival and later arrival of the birds to the breeding grounds. The negative relationship between the length of the outermost tail feathers of males and the incidence of feather holes suggests that the tail is a condition-dependent secondary sexual characteristic.

AB  - Field experiments showed that sudden reductions in river flow may cause high mortality of juvenile salmonids through stranding. A 75-m(2) enclosure in the drawdown zone of a regulated river was stocked with a known number of wild 0 + and/or 1 + wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). The number stranded was estimated by counting the surviving fish collected in a bag as they left the enclosure.
   In general, a far higher incidence of fish stranding was found during winter conditions ( < 4.5 degreesC) compared with the higher temperatures during late summer and early autumn. This is probably mainly because of lower fish activity during the cold season and a substrate seeking behaviour especially during daytime. Stranding was lower at night, probably because of a predominant night active behaviour. Hatchery salmon behaved oppositely to wild fish, and studies based on cultivated fish may give wrong conclusions as to the consequences of hydropeaking. Searching for fish in the substrate underestimated the consequences of sudden flow reductions, as fish were difficult to find. Stranding is not equal to mortality, as fish were found to survive for several hours in the substrate after dewatering. Long shut down procedures of the turbines during daytime, decreased stranding of Atlantic salmon (7-9 cm) drastically under spring conditions. Temperature, season and light conditions have the most pronounced effect on stranding of juvenile salmonids. It is possible to reduce stranding by taking into account these ecological considerations during hydropeaking operations. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Several studies have used plant community biomass to predict species richness with varying success. In this study we examined the relationship between species richness and biomass for 36 marsh communities from two different watersheds. In addition, we measured several environmental variables and estimated the potential richness (the total number of species known to be able to occur in a community type) for each community. Above-ground living and dead biomass combined was found to be weakly correlated with species richness (R2 = 0.02). Instead, a multiple regression model based on elevation (R2 = 0.47), salinity (R2 = 0.30), soil organic matter (R2 = 0.18), and biomass was able to explain 82% of the variance in species richness.
   It was found that environmental conditions could explain 89% of the variation in potential richness. Biomass had no relation to potential richness. When used as a predictor variable, potential richness was found to explain 72% of the variation in realized (observed) richness and biomass explained an additional 9% of the variance in realized richness. This finding suggests that realized richness in our system was controlled primarily by environmental regulation of potential richness and secondarily by biomass (as an indicator of competition).
   Further examination of the data revealed that when sites exposed to extreme environmental conditions were eliminated from the analysis, biomass became the primary predictor of realized richness and potential richness was of secondary importance. We conclude that community biomass has a limited capacity to predict species richness across a broad range of habitat conditions. Of particular importance is the inability of biomass to indicate the effects of environmental factors and evolutionary history on the potential species richness at a site.

AB  - Oil wells that intersect a potential CO2 storage zone in a depleted oil and gas field may provide leakage pathways. It is essential to estimate the field-scale leakage risk associated with these wells. In this study, a risk-based approach is used to estimate the risk of leakage. Existing reduced-order models for well leakage are used to quantitatively estimate well leakage rates for cased-cemented, cased-uncemented, and open wellbores. For each existing well that intersects the storage zone, we introduce the well leakage index (WLI), which accounts for wellbore geometry, distance from the injection well, buffer layers between the storage zone and underground sources of drinking water, and the nature of storage zone boundary type. For an initial injection well location, the total site well leakage index (SWLI) is calculated, which is the summation of the WLI for all of the wells. Next, the injector location is varied areally and SWLI is calculated for a specified number of potential injector well locations in the storage zone area. Small values for the SWLI correspond to low well leakage potential, indicating where injection well locations can be considered. The developed criterion provides a means to systemically find the areas with highest and lowest well leakage potential for a storage zone. Due to the reduced order nature of the developed method, it should be a useful tool in the planning and execution phase of the CO2 geological sequestration process.

AB  - Restoration in seriously polluted streams has become an urgent issue in developing countries. In this study, we attempted to propose an effective restoration approach in a heavily polluted stream in China with the aid of relationships between ecosystem properties and landscape across multiple scales. Land cover and physical geometry at a fine gradient of spatial scales (doubling 60-960 m and whole catchment) were included as landscape predictive variables, while water quality and macroinvertebrate were involved as ecosystem response variables. The strong relationship between the stream properties and surrounding landscape indicated the stream still maintain its resilience, that is, the capacity to recover from disturbance without changing its fundamental functions and state, even undergoing severe pollution. Further, the primary predictors for water quality were agriculture and urban land, with most effective scale at local 60 m buffer, but independence tests pointed out most correlations between agriculture and water quality were attributed to urban land and spatial covariation. No direct association was detected between macroinvertebrate and surrounding land cover at all scales, but macroinvertebrate exhibited significant relationship with physical variables at in-stream habitat scale. Overall, it was quite possible for this heavily polluted stream to go back to its initial health state if appropriate restorations were taken. The extent and intensity of riparian urbanizations were high priority factors when performing water quality improvement, and increasing habitat complexity and heterogeneity at in-stream scale was crucial for increasing macroinvertebrates diversity.

AB  - Background/objective: Obesity has been associated with brain alterations characterised by poorer interaction between a hypersensitive reward system and a comparatively weaker prefrontal-cognitive control system. These alterations may occur as early as in adolescence, but this notion remains unclear, as no studies so far have examined global functional connectivity in adolescents with excess weight.
   Subjects/methods: We investigated functional connectivity in a sample of 60 adolescents with excess weight and 55 normal weight controls. We first identified parts of the brain displaying between-group global connectivity differences and then characterised the extent of the differences in functional network integrity and their association with reward sensitivity.
   Results: Adolescent obesity was linked to neuroadaptations in functional connectivity within brain hubs linked to interoception (insula), emotionalmemory (middle temporal gyrus) and cognitive control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) (pFWE < 0.05). The connectivity between the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex was reduced in comparison to controls, as was the connectivity between the middle temporal gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex and cuneus/precuneus (pFWE < 0.05). Conversely, the middle temporal gyrus displayed increased connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex (pFWE < 0.05). Critically, these networks were correlated with sensitivity to reward (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that adolescent obesity is linked to disrupted functional connectivity in brain networks relevant to maintaining balance between reward, emotional memories and cognitive control. Our findings may contribute to reconceptualization of obesity as a multi-layered brain disorder leading to compromised motivation and control, and provide a biological account to target prevention strategies for adolescent obesity.

AB  - Freshwater research and management efforts could be greatly enhanced by a better understanding of the relationship between landscape-scale factors and water quality indicators. This is particularly true in urban areas, where land transformation impacts stream systems at a variety of scales. Despite advances in landscape quantification methods, several studies attempting to elucidate the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) and water quality have resulted in mixed conclusions. However, these studies have largely relied on compositional landscape metrics. For urban and urbanizing watersheds in particular, the use of metrics that capture spatial pattern may further aid in distinguishing the effects of various urban growth patterns, as well as exploring the interplay between environmental and socioeconomic variables. However, to be truly useful for freshwater applications, pattern metrics must be optimized based on iaracteristic watershed properties and common water quality point sampling methods. Using a freely vailable LULC data set for the Santa Clara Basin, California, USA, we quantified landscape composition and configuration for subwatershed areas upstream of individual sampling sites, reducing the number of metrics based on: (1) sensitivity to changes in extent and (2) redundancy, as determined by a multivariate factor analysis. The first two factors, interpreted as (1) patch density and distribution and (2) patch shape and landscape subdivision, explained approximately 85% of the variation in the data set, and are highly reflective of the heterogeneous urban development pattern found in the study area. Although offering slightly less explanatory power, compositional metrics can provide important contextual information.

AB  - Application of water treatment residuals (WTR) and biosolids (BS) might ameliorate fragile soils. However, studies integrating impacts of waste preparation methods such as liming and grinding associated with co-application approaches for soil conditioning are lacking. The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of agricultural use of WTR as well as their co-application with BS to ameliorate a sandy soil through assessing impacts on selected soil quality indicators and on nutrient and potentially toxic element concentration in plant tissue in addition to the biomass yield of annual crops. The following treatments were evaluated: non-amended soil (control); drying plus grinding and liming WTR; WTR co-application with BS at 3:1 ratio; and a soil amendment commercially available in Brazil. All treatments were soil incorporated in the 0.0-0.2 m layer at 30 Mg ha(-1) dose (dry mass). Selected soil physical, hydraulic, and chemical parameters were determined. Furthermore, nutrients and potentially toxic elements concentration in plant tissue as well as the agronomic performance of maize and ryegrass were measured. The co-application of WTR and BS increased the soil content of P, Zn, and Cu in the 0.0-0.1 m layer. The concentration of these nutrients also was greater in ryegrass tissue and promoted the biomass yield in 51%. WTR did not increase contaminants and did not decrease the P content in soil and in plant tissue, independently of drying plus grinding and liming. Considering the conditions investigated in our study, WTR/BS co-application was environmentally safe and effective in ameliorating soil quality.

AB  - Microbial growth and fluctuations in environmental conditions have been shown to cause microbial contamination and deterioration of food. Thus, it is paramount to develop reliable strategies to effectively prevent the sale and consumption of contaminated or spoiled food. Responsive packaging systems are designed to react to specific stimuli in the food or environment, such as microorganisms or temperature, then implement an informational or corrective response. Informative responsive packaging is aimed at continuously monitoring the changes in food or environmental conditions and conveys this information to the users in real time. Meanwhile, packaging systems with the capacity to control contamination or deterioration are also of great interest. Encouragingly, corrective responsive packaging attempting to mitigate the adverse effects of condition fluctuations on food has been investigated. This packaging exerts its effects through the triggered release of active agents by environmental stimuli. In this review, informative and corrective responsive packaging is conceptualized clearly and concisely. The mechanism and characteristics of each type of packaging are discussed in depth. This review also summarized the latest research progress of responsive packaging and objectively appraised their advantages. Evidently, the mechanism through which packaging systems respond to microbial contamination and associated environmental factors was also highlighted. Moreover, risk concerns, related legislation, and consumer perspective in the application of responsive packaging are discussed as well. Broadly, this comprehensive review covering the latest information on responsive packaging aims to provide a timely reference for scientific research and offer guidance for presenting their applications in food industry.

AB  - Improvement and development of technologies for laboratory and instrumental examination of patients in recent years have greatly facilitated the diagnosis of ischemic myocardial damage. However, a decrease in the rating of cardiovascular diseases is not expected in the short term. This is due to an increase in the life expectancy of the population, general aging of the population and improving diagnostic capabilities and the provision of medical care. The time for verification of the diagnosis of ischemic disease, simplified the decision on treatment tactics were significantly reduced by introduction of X-ray contrast visualization examination methods such as angiography, quantitative and qualitative laboratory tests, development of diagnostic criteria based on the results of ultrasound and electrophysiological examination methods. Unfortunately, all these techniques are secondary in nature and are applied, when organ damage is for the most part already irreversible. Full restoration of organs is possible only if the patient is successfully evacuated to the hospital and there are specialists of the appropriate level of experiebce, X-ray surgical equipment with suitable supplies or pharmacological agents, usefull for quickly restoration the patency of the great vessels and normal blood flow. A large number of studies appear on the phenomenon of preconditioning at the present stage of development of fundamental medical science. The purpose of this article is to reveal the possibilities of using molecular markers of the phenomenon of preconditioning in the framework of the early detection of hypoxic conditions, the assessment of their diagnostic use in the clinic and the prevention of hypoxia-associated diseases.

AB  - Indirect evaporative cooling is well-recognized as a sustainable air-cooling solution to pursue a high quality indoor thermal environment with less energy consumption. In hot and humid areas, the application of an Indirect Evaporative Cooling Energy Recovery System (ERIEC) can cool fresh air to its dew point temperature or lower through water evaporation by using exhaust air from air-conditioned spaces. In this research, a statistical modeling approach is developed to predict the performance of the ERIEC under varying outdoor climates, taking into account possible latent heat transfer from fresh air condensation. Based on training data extracted from numerical simulation, a decision tree model was built to identify the occurrence of condensation through conditional expressions on inlet air temperature and relative humidity. A 2-level factorial design was performed to derive correlations for ERIEC performance indicators under non-condensation and condensation states, respectively. As results, the proposed practical model was validated by experimental data within the deviation of 9.52% on wet-bulb efficiency (eta(wb)) and 7.69% on enlargement coefficient (epsilon). A field measurement conducted in Hong Kong shows that the proposed model allows fast and precise prediction on ERIEC performance, with the measured total energy recovery of 5.85 kWh/m(2) and the predicted value of 5.40 kWh/m(2) for 30 days in cooling season. The model developed in this study can be efficiently integrated into simulation tools for the performance prediction of ERIEC assisted air-conditioning system in the building energy assessment.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the altitude at which construction equipment operates affects or contributes to increased engine wear. Design/methodology/approach The study includes the evaluation of two John Deere PowerTech Plus 6,068 Tier 3 diesel engines, the utilization of OSA3 oil analysis laboratory equipment to analyze oil samples, the employment of standard sampling scope and methods, and the analysis of key Engine Control Unit (ECU) data points (machine utilization, Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) and engine sensor data). Findings At 250 h of engine oil use, the engine operating at 3,657 meters above sea level (MASL) had considerably more wear than the engine operating at 416 MASL. The leading and earliest indicator of engine wear was a high level of iron particles in the engine oil, reaching abnormal levels at 218 h. The following engine oil contaminants were more prevalent in the engine operating at the higher altitude: potassium, glycol, water and soot. Furthermore, the engine operating at higher altitude also presented abnormal and critical levels of oil viscosity, Total Base Number and oxidation. When comparing the oil sample analysis with the engine ECU data, it was determined that engine idling is a contributor for soot accumulation in the engine operating at the higher altitude. The most prevalent DTCs were water in fuel, extreme low coolant levels and extreme high exhaust manifold temperature. The ECU operating data demonstrated that the higher altitude environment caused the engine to miss-fire and rail pressure was irregular. Originality/value The main contribution of this paper will help construction equipment end-users, maintenance engineers and manufacturers to implement mitigation strategies to improve engine durability for countries with operating conditions similar to those described in this research.

AB  - The Rabotnov nonlinear constitutive equation with two arbitrary material functions for rheonomous materials in the one-dimensional case is analytically investigated. An equation for a set of theoretical strain diagrams at constant loading rates is derived. Their general qualitative properties are analytically analyzed depending on the properties of material functions. The following points are investigated: the monotonic intervals and convexity of the strain diagrams, the nature of their dependence on the loading rate, the existence and type of limit curves when the loading rate tends to zero or infinity, the conditions of existence of the inflection point and the limiting stress (flow stress), the cutoff conditions (simulation of fraction), formulas for instantaneous and long-term moduli, the conditions of their finiteness and the difference from zero. Based on a comparison of the properties of theoretical diagrams with typical properties of experimental diagrams for rheonomous materials, the minimal restrictions on the material functions have been established to provide an adequate description of the main rheological effects. Indicators of the applicability of the constitutive equation and the effects that cannot be described using any material functions have been found. The characteristic features of the strain diagrams for three main classes of models, namely, with a regular, unbounded, and singular relaxation function are shown. The advantages of the Rabotnov constitutive equation compared with the linear constitutive equation of viscoelasticity (from which it was obtained by introducing the second material function) are discussed. The additional effects that can be described by using the mentioned nonlinear relation are pointed out.

AB  - Few efforts have been made to quantify the amount and variety of deadwood in frequently burned ecosystems, particularly the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystem of the southeastern United States. Moreover, comparisons of coarse woody debris between old-growth and secondary longleaf pine forests are lacking despite the widely recognized value of deadwood to biodiversity in many forest types. We measured standing and fallen deadwood in three old-growth and four mature (100-125 years-old) secondary forests in two landscapes characterized by either sandy or clayey soils within the historic range of P. palustris. Downed coarse woody debris volume was variable at the old-growth locations, ranging from 2.51 +/- 0.79 to 29.10 +/- 14.55 m(3) per ha, which includes perhaps the lowest values ever reported from any old-growth forest. Factors likely contributing to these low volumes include frequent fire, the low basal area characteristic of this forest type, subtropical climatic conditions of the southeastern Coastal Plain, and large termite populations. The high variability observed among the three old-growth locations probably reflect interactions between fire and other disturbances (e.g., wind damage). The old-growth location on sandy soils had significantly higher coarse woody debris volume and deadwood variety (e.g., diameter increments, posture, tree genera and decay classes) than secondary forests sampled nearby. Highly resinous heartwood is a significant indicator of old-growth conditions relative to secondary locations, appearing to accumulate as a persistent fraction of the deadwood pool over time.

AB  - Fatty acids composition of two marine copepods, Acartia tonsa and Centropages brachiatus, and lipid profiles of natural food assemblages were studied during the austral summer 2006 at three upwelling sites in the coastal upwelling zone off Chile, along with oceanographic conditions. Fatty acids of food supply were assessed for the picoplankton, nanoplankton and microplankton size fractions. There were marked differences in upwelling conditions among locations, as well as in their food supply in terms of quantity and quality. Differences in fatty acid composition were also found, both among food assemblages and between copepod species. Essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; linoleic acid) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA; oleic acid) dominated the picoplankton and nanoplankton size fractions of food, and they were highly represented in both species of copepods, indicating these size fractions were the major contributors to their diet. These fatty acids can thus be considered as useful trophic markers for copepods. Variation in lipid profiles between species depended on sampling sites, whereas differences in lipid composition among sampling sites were attributed to distinct upwelling conditions, which drive the changes in food quality, such that trophic response is highly dependent on food offer. Variation in fatty acids compositions of copepods may thus act as an indicator of upwelling variability. Our findings suggest that lipid transfer from primary producers to primary consumers can have a crucial role for carbon cycling in the marine food web, and that picoplankton and nanoplankton fractions are the key items of copepod diet in this upwelling system.

AB  - Agricultural droughts afflicting the contiguous United States (CONUS) are serious and costly natural hazards. Widespread damage to a single cash crop may be crippling to rural communities that produce it. While drought is insidious in nature, drought indices derived from meteorological data and drought impact reports both provide essential guidance to decision-makers about the location and intensity of developing and ongoing droughts. However, response to dry meteorological conditions is not consistent from one crop type to the next, making crop-specific drought appraisal difficult using weather data alone. Additionally, drought impact reports are often subjective, latent, or both. To rectify this, we developed drought indices using meteorological data, and phenological information for the row crops most commonly grown over CONUS: corn, soybeans, and winter wheat. These are referred to as crop-specific standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration indices (CSPEIs). CSPEIs correlate more closely with end-of-season yields than traditional meteorological indicators for the eastern two thirds of CONUS for corn, and offer an advantage in predicting winter wheat yields for the High Plains. CSPEIs do not always explain a higher fraction of variance than traditional meteorological indicators. In such cases, results provide insight on which meteorological indicators to use to most effectively supplement impacts information.
   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This manuscript is expected to advance the science of drought monitoring and appraisal over CONUS.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has a close relationship with local environmental conditions. This study explores the effects of climate characteristics and air pollution on COVID-19 in Isfahan province, Iran. A number of COVID-19 positive cases, main air pollutants, air quality index (AQI), and climatic variables were received from March 1, 2020, to January 19, 2021. Moreover, CO, NO2, and O-3 tropospheric levels were collected using Sentinel-5P satellite data. The spatial distribution of variables was estimated by the ordinary Kriging and inverse weighted distance (IDW) models. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to analyze the relationship between environmental variables and COVID-19. The seasonal trend of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), wind speed, solar energy, and rainfall like COVID-19 was upward in spring and summer. The high and low temperatures increased from April to August. All variables had a spatial autocorrelation and clustered pattern except AQI. Furthermore, COVID-19 showed a significant association with month, climate, solar energy, and NO2. Suitable policy implications are recommended to be performed for improving people's healthcare and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study could survey the local spread of COVID-19, with consideration of the effect of environmental variables, and provides helpful information to health ministry decisions for mitigating harmful effects of environmental change. By means of the proposed approach, probably the COVID-19 spread can be recognized by knowing the regional climate in major cities. The present study also finds that COVID-19 may have an effect on climatic condition and air pollutants.

AB  - Veterinary pharmaceuticals are pollutants that received much attention during the last 20 years. Macrocyclic lactones are a class of drugs globally used in animal and human health, as well as crops protection. Some of its members are key substances for global food security. In this research, the mobility of eprinomectin (EPM) in soil columns (25 cm soil height; 10 cm diameter) was assessed for the first time. Soil density in the columns was 1.1-1.2 g/cm(3). Porosity was 0.54-0.60. Three different soil types were used (agricultural, pastoral, wetland). In the experiment, chloride was used as a non-reactive tracer to determine the hydrodynamic conditions in the columns. Therefore, water velocity (v) was 0.146 -0.151 cm/h, dispersion coefficient (D) 0.011-0.017 cm(2)/h and dispersivity (D/v) was 0.072-0.121. Our results showed that the drug remained in the top layers of the columns, after applying an extreme irrigation scenario. The retardation factor for EPM was 43.4-54.5 while for chloride was 0.99-1. EPM fraction (% of applied mass) in 0-1 cm was 13.8-18.0% and in 1-5 cm was 53.3-73.0%. An amount 13-29% was irreversibly bound or degraded during this experiment. From a soil management perspective, the continuous application of EPM contaminated manure, could result in high concentrations in the top 10 cm of the soil profile. Soil column experiments, where hydrodynamic conditions are well defined, are useful for the environmental impact assessment of veterinary pharmaceuticals. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The main objective of the research is to assess the ability of the Ukrainian economy and its individual industries to ensure, in the conditions of economic growth, a stable reduction of natural gas consumption and, consequently, to reduce dependence on its imports. Six types of relationships were identified between the change in sectoral added value and the change in the consumption of certain energy resources, in particular natural gas. The conditions are established under which the growth of sectoral added value is accompanied by a decrease in the consumption of certain energy resources. The index of sectoral efficiency of the use of certain energy resources was proposed and a model of the decomposition of the growth rate of this indicator was constructed. Quantitative indicators of measuring economic barriers on the way to introduction of energy-saving technologies are presented. Conditions under which economic growth is accompanied by a decrease in the level of dependence of the economy on imports of energy resources are modeled. The dynamics of natural gas consumption by sectors of the Ukrainian economy is analyzed. It is proved that reduction of natural gas consumption due to increased energy efficiency occurs mainly in industries with an average value of share of the cost of purchasing this energy in the total operating expenses. An estimation is undertaken of the possibility of achieving independence of the Ukrainian economy from the import of natural gas in different scenarios of changing main parameters that determine the probability of such an achievement.

AB  - As the process of urbanization progresses, coastal engineering are posing serious threat to the local ecosystems. The poorly designed coastal engineering will have irreversible effects on local ecosystems, such as the biodiversity declination, the connectivity destruction and the ecosystems deterioration. Therefore, it is very necessary to improve the concept of ecosystem-based coastal engineering design. In strict accordance with the notion of eco-seawall, in this research, the hydrodynamic change in 20 engineering scenarios was discussed and determined the spatial distribution of suitable habitats for aquatic species, which defined as the niche of aquatic organisms in the dimension of hydrodynamic. This research was conducted by carrying out pilot-scale experiment with an aim to enhance the traditional coastal engineering in terms of (a) measuring the intensity of hydrodynamic variations by adding artificial beach or buffer zone (b) determining the overtopping risks in varying working conditions (c) visualizing the distribution of optimal habitat areas with hydrodynamic parameters as eco-niche dimension. As revealed by the results, four working conditions pose low overtopping risk and exhibit uniform distribution of flow (No.1, No.2, No.8 and No.14). Additionally, the suitable habitats distribution have been visualized for 4 types of working condition with safety structure. A conclusion can be drawn that there are significantly fewer unsuitable habitat areas in the No.14 scenario as compared to other schemes. In general, this research is conducive to improving the development of ecosystem-based coastal engineering. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Seedling vigour is an important indicator of crop establishment, subsequent crop growth and yield. Initial seedling vigour is most vital in case of water-limited conditions and in environments where the crop is exposed to different stresses at the early growth stage. Wild and weedy species are well known for their vigour and survival in adverse environmental conditions. Seedling vigour traits of backcross introgression lines (BILs) derived from Swarna x Oryza nivara IRGC81848(S) (accession from Uttar Pradesh, India) and IRGC81832 (K) (accession from Bihar, India) were studied in wet (Kharif) and dry (Rabi) seasons. Seedling vigour was estimated in terms of plant height and tiller number at 30 and 60 d after transplanting under field conditions. In both the seasons, 148S showed highest seedling vigour for plant height. The highest number of tillers were produced by 7K in Kharif and 248S in Rabi season. 75S showed the highest percentage increase in tiller number consistently. High yielding BILs 166S, 14S and 148S showed higher seedling vigour indices compared with checks Tulasi and Sahbhagidhan. Seedling vigour was also evaluated using paper roll method and shoot length, root length and dry weight were used to estimate vigour index. Season-wise association studies were conducted to determine the relative contribution of seedling vigour to yield traits. Seedling vigour was significantly correlated with yield traits. Markers RM217 and RM253 on chromosome 6 differentiated lines with high seedling vigour from those with low seedling vigour and have the potential for use in marker-assisted breeding.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and depression are extremely prevalent and debilitating conditions. Evidence suggest that there is a two-way relationship between depression and CVD. Inflammation is implicated in the pathophysiology of both conditions, thus representing a central candidate mediating the link between these disorders. Depression is consistently associated with increased inflammation and increased blood levels of inflammatory molecules. In recent years, studies have shown that depression significantly increases the risk of developing inflammatory-related diseases such as CVD, precipitated by the same inflammatory pathways involved in the pathophysiology of CVD.
   Objective and Method: The aim of this work is to discuss the role of inflammation in depression and CVD and review the evidence of the benefits and side effects of anti-inflammatory drugs in both the diseases.
   Results: Drugs with anti-inflammatory properties have shown benefit in alleviating signs and symptoms in CVD and in depression. This was shown to be particularly true for the following classes of drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) statins and cytokine inhibitors. Finally, antidepressant drugs initially used exclusively to treat depression also lead to improvement in CVD indicators, while lowering inflammation markers in patients at the same time. This evidence further strengthens the suggestion of the biological link between depression and CVD through inflammation.
   Conclusion: Strategies that can mitigate this risk profile are highly needed in the clinical setting, and these particular groups of drugs have the possibility of becoming increasingly important in treatment strategies aiming to improve both the conditions.

AB  - The organic-rich Upper Ordovician sediments (Wufeng and Guanyinqiao Formations) on the Yangtze platform are considered to be one of the main source rocks. Here we present geochemical proxies, including redox indicator (S/C ratios and sulfur isotopes) and productivity indices (TOC, Mo and Ba contents), from Nanbazi section in North Guizhou province, South China, in order to investigate the mechanism of organic matter accumulation. The geochemical data suggest a stagnant and anoxic environment predominated the Yangtze Sea during the Wufeng period, whereas ventilated and oxygenated marine conditions pervaded the Yangtze Sea during the Guanyinqiao period. Variations in the concentration of TOC, Mo and Ba indicate that higher organic carbon export in the Wufeng intervals than those in the Guanyinqiao intervals. These variations in redox and productivity during the late Ordovician were associated with different mechanisms and forcing processes. The abrupt change from anoxic to oxygenated condition at the beginning of the Guanyinqiao was concomitant with the global glacial period, likely resulted from the glacio-eustatic sea-level fall and subsequent circulation of cold, dense oxygenated waters upon the shelf seabed. The productivity variations were related to the change of nutrient supply, which is consistent with volcanic activities and runoff to the Yangtze Sea. Redox changes, together with primary productivity fluctuations could have played a significant role on the variation of organic matter accumulation during the late Ordovician in South China.

AB  - We used 10 years of data on clutch size, egg size and diet, and 8 years of data on timing of laying on Little Terns (Sternula albifrons) breeding in Ria Formosa lagoon system, Algarve, Portugal to assess whether diet acts as an important intermediary between climatic conditions and breeding parameters. We used Generalized Linear Models to relate (1) the relative occurrence and size of the main prey species, sand smelts (Atherina spp.), with environmental variables, a large-scale climate variable, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, and a local scale variable, the sea-surface temperature (SST), and (2) the respective effects of sand smelts relative occurrence, NAO index and SST on Little Tern breeding parameters. The diet of Little Terns was dominated by sand smelts, with a frequency occurrence of over 60% in all years. The winter SST (February) was negatively associated with the relative occurrence of sand smelts in the diet of Little Terns during the breeding season which, in turn, was positively associated with Little Tern clutch size. Our results suggest that negative NAO conditions in the Atlantic Ocean, often associated with rougher sea conditions (greater vertical mixing, stronger winds and lower SST) were related with earlier breeding, and lower SST in the surroundings of the colony during winter-spring favour the abundance of prey fish for Little Terns as well as their reproductive parameters. Climate patterns at both large and local scales are likely to change in the future, which may have important implications for estuarine seabirds in Southern Europe. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an essential role in the sustainability of natural and agricultural systems. The identification of sensitive SOC fractions can be crucial for an understanding of SOC dynamics and stabilization. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of long-term no-tillage (NT) on SOC content and its distribution between particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (Min) fractions in five different cereal production areas of Aragon (north-east Spain). The study was conducted under on-farm conditions where pairs of adjacent fields under NT and conventional tillage (CT) were compared. An undisturbed soil nearby under native vegetation (NAT) was included. The results indicate that SOC was significantly affected by tillage in the first 5cm with the greatest concentrations found in NT (1.5-43% more than in CT). Below 40cm, SOC under NT decreased (20-40%) to values similar or less than those under CT. However, the stratification ratio (SR) never reached the threshold value of 2. The POM-C fraction, disproportionate to its small contribution to total SOC (10-30%), was greatly affected by soil management. The pronounced stratification in this fraction (SR>2 in NT) and its usefulness for differentiating the study sites in terms of response to NT make POM-C a good indicator of changes in soil management under the study conditions. Results from this on-farm study indicate that NT can be recommended as an alternative strategy to increase organic carbon at the soil surface in the cereal production areas of Aragon and in other analogous areas.

AB  - Community-based management (CBM) has been implemented in socio-ecological systems (SES) worldwide. CBM has also been the prevailing policy in Sami pastoral SES in Norway, but the outcomes tend to vary extensively among resource groups ("siidas"). We asked why do some siidas self-organize to manage common pool resources sustainably and others do not? To answer this question we used a mixed methods approach. First, in the statistical analyses we analyzed the relationship between sustainability indicators and structural variables. We found that small winter pastures that are shared by few siidas were managed more sustainably than larger pastures. Seasonal siida stability, i.e., a low turnover of pastoralists working together throughout the year, and equality among herders, also contributed to more sustainable outcomes. Second, interviews were conducted in the five largest pastures to explain the relationships between the structural variables and sustainability. The pastoralists expressed a high level of agreement with respect to sustainable policies, but reported a low level of trust and cooperation among the siidas. The pastoralists requested siida tenures or clear rules and sanctioning mechanisms by an impartial authority rather than flexible organization or more autonomy for the siidas. The lack of nestedness in self-organization for managing pastures on larger scales, combined with the past economic policies, could explain why CBM is less sustainable on the largest winter pastures. We conclude that the scale mis-match between self-organization and the formal governance is a key condition for sustainability.

AB  - Hyporheic flows, which stem from the interaction between stream flow and bedform, transport solute-laden surface waters into the streambed sediments, where reactive solutes undergo biogeochemical transformations. Despite the importance of hyporheic exchange on riverine ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles, research is limited on the effects of hyporheic fluxes on the fate of reactive solutes within the hyporheic zone. Consequently, we investigate the controls of hyporheic flowpaths, which we link to stream morphology and streamflow, on prevailing hyporheic redox conditions and on biogeochemical transformations occurring within streambeds. We focus on the dissolved inorganic reactive forms of nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate, because nitrogen is one of the most common reactive solutes and an essential nutrient found in stream waters. Our objectives are to explore the influence of stream morphology, hyporheic water temperature and relative abundance of ammonium and nitrate, on transformation of ammonium, removal of nitrates and production of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. We address our objectives with analytical solutions of the Multispecies Reactive Advection-Dispersion Equation coupled with linearized Monod's kinetics and analytical solutions of the hyporheic flow for alternate-bar morphology. We introduce a new Damkohler number, Da, defined as the ratio between the median hyporheic residence time and the time scale of oxygen consumption, which we prove to be a good indicator of where aerobic or anaerobic conditions prevail. In addition, Da is a key index to quantify hyporheic nitrification and denitrification efficiencies and defines a new theoretical framework for scaling results at both the morphological-unit and stream-reach scales.

AB  - Stereoselective dissipation of epoxiconazole had been studied in grape and soil during plant growing under field conditions in this paper. A sensitive and rapid chiral method was developed and validated for the determination of epoxiconazole stereoisomers in grape and soil based on liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Phenomenex Lux Cellulose-1 column was used for enantioseparation with a mixture of acetonitrile/water (90/10, v/v) as mobile phase at flow rate of 0.3 mL min(-1). Fortified recoveries in grape and soil samples ranged from 76.0% to 91.9% and relative standard deviations were less than 11.4% with fortified levels of 0.025-1.0 mg kg(-1). The limits of detection and quantification were 0.005 mg kg(-1) and 0.025 mg kg(-1), respectively, with linear calibration curves extending up to 5.0 mg kg(-1). The field experimental results showed that dissipations of epoxiconazole stereoisomers in grape followed first-order kinetics (R-2 > 0.92) and stereoselectivity occurred in 2 h after spraying. The (-)-stereoisomer with half-life of 9.3 d degraded faster than (+)-stereoisomer with that of 13.2 d, and resulted in relative enrichment of (+)-stereoisomer. However, the stereoisomeric dissipations in soil were triphasic ("increase-decrease-steady") with lower dissipation rates, and also occurred with preferential degradation of (-)-stereoisomer under field condition. The results for stereoselective dissipations can be applied for food and environmental assessments of chiral pesticides. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chlorophyll a fluorescence has been applied to study the evolution of leaf photoprotection processes to dissipate excess absorbed energy that can not be fully utilized in photochemical reactions, and reflects the plants ability to adapt to environmental conditions. Plants environmental conditions can be modified by forest restoration techniques to ensure successful seedlings establishment, hence chlorophyll a fluorescence can be a useful tool for assessing plant response to planting stress. The objective of this paper was to analyze the chlorophyll a fluorescence as an early indicator of oak seedling response to the establishment stress and as a useful tool for the assessment of different competition control and individualized protection techniques (tillage, herbicide, mulch, tree shelter) used in forest restoration. A field experimental plot with these restoration treatments was established and a monthly monitoring of chlorophyll a fluorescence and a vitality analysis were carried out between August 2003 and October 2004 on oak seedlings. Results showed that fluorescence parameters were sensitive to stress conditions prevailing in each analysed period. On the evaluation of herbaceous competition control techniques, no significant results on the chlorophyll a fluorescence were observed. However, tree shelters exercised a protection effect on seedling limiting the photoinhibition processes during spring and winter periods. Finally, protected plants showed major photochemical efficiency than that showed by unprotected ones according to vitality tests. Therefore, the chlorophyll a fluorescence analysis was proved to be a useful tool for early assessment of oak seedlings establishment stress and for the assessment of certain forest restoration techniques, such as those that combine control of herbaceous competition and individualized seedling protection.

AB  - The influence of growth parameters on the production of bacteriocins (aureocins) by five strains of Staphylococcus aureus was investigated. These aureocins have a broad spectrum of activity and can inhibit important human and animal pathogens. All strains produced large inhibition zones upon the indicator strain when they were grown in rich media such as brain-heart infusion (BHI), N2GT and 2 x YT. Bacteriocin production was not influenced by the initial pH of the medium (6.0-8.0). At lower temperature (28degreesC), there was a marked reduction in bacteriocin production. Incubation of the producers under anaerobiosis affected profoundly the production of two related bacteriocins, aureocins MB92 and 146L, and slightly increased the production of aureocins A53 and 215FN. Production of aureocins MB92 and 215FN was apparently abolished in media containing greater than or equal to2.5 g and greater than or equal to3.5 g NaCl/100 ml, respectively. Although production of the remaining aureocins was observed in all NaCl concentrations tested (0.5-7.5 g/100 ml), the larger inhibition zones were detected in media containing up to either 1.5 g (for aureocins A70 and 146L) or 2.5 g NaCl/100 ml (for aureocin A53). Aureocin 215FN could not be detected in the culture supernatant. For the remaining aureocins tested, the highest levels of bacteriocin production occurred in either the late-log or early stationary growth phase of cultures grown in BHI medium at 37degreesC. Changes in environmental conditions can, therefore, have detrimental effects on the production of active aureocins. Such factors are relevant when considering the potential biotechnological applications of these substances and when testing new S. aureus isolates for bacteriocin production.

AB  - The development and application of geochemical techniques to identify redox conditions in modern and ancient aquatic environments has intensified over recent years. Iron (Fe) speciation has emerged as one of the most widely used procedures to distinguish different redox regimes in both the water column and sediments, and is the main technique used to identify oxic, ferruginous (anoxic, Fe(II) containing) and euxinic (anoxic, sulfidic) water column conditions. However, an international sediment reference material has never been developed. This has led to concern over the consistency of results published by the many laboratories that now utilise the technique. Here, we report an interlaboratory comparison of four Fe speciation reference materials for palaeoredox analysis, which span a range of compositions and reflect deposition under different redox conditions. We provide an update of extraction techniques used in Fe speciation and assess the effects of both test portion mass, and the use of different analytical procedures, on the quantification of different Fe fractions in sedimentary rocks. While atomic absorption spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry produced comparable Fe measurements for all extraction stages, the use of ferrozine consistently underestimated Fe in the extraction step targeting mixed ferrous-ferric minerals such as magnetite. We therefore suggest that the use of ferrozine is discontinued for this Fe pool. Finally, we report the combined data of four independent Fe speciation laboratories to characterise the Fe speciation composition of the reference materials. These reference materials are available to the community to provide an essential validation of in-house Fe speciation measurements.

AB  - The unicellular photosynthetic organisms known as microalgae are becoming one of the most important models for aquatic system studies. Among them, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is widely used as a bioindicator of pollution or of different changes in the environment. Numerous pollutants are present in aquatic environments, particularly plastics and nanoplastics. Physiological variations after an environmental change highlight variation in the macromolecular composition of microalgae (proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates). Recently, Fourier transform infrared vibrational spectroscopy has been described as a reliable tool, sensitive and allowing rapid measurement of macromolecular composition of microalgae. Coupled with preprocessing and principal component analysis, it is well adapted to monitoring the effect of environmental stress on biochemical composition. In this study, infrared spectroscopy, combined with multivariate analysis, has been tested first on known environmental stresses such as light intensity variation and nitrogen limitation. Then, this technique has been applied to monitor the interaction and potential impacts of polystyrene nanoparticles on microalgae. The results showed slight variations on protein and carbohydrates bands in the presence of nanoplastics, suggesting that their presence led to modifications in the biochemical composition of the microalgae. To confirm the interaction between microalgae and nanoplastics, visualization by confocal microscopy and cytotoxicity measurement has been carried out. Results showed that polystyrene nanoparticles seemed to adsorb on microalgae surface, leading to a loss of plasma membrane integrity. The resulting chemical modifications, even if moderate, could be detected by infrared spectroscopy, showing that this tool could be very helpful in the understanding of nanoparticle-microalgae interaction mechanisms.

AB  - Populus simonii is an important tree in the genus Populus, widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere and having a long cultivation history. Although this species has ecologically and economically important values, its genome sequence is currently not available, hindering the development of new varieties with wider adaptive and commercial traits. Here, we report a chromosome-level genome assembly of P. simonii using PacBio long-read sequencing data aided by Illumina paired-end reads and related genetic linkage maps. The assembly is 441.38 Mb in length and contain 686 contigs with a contig N50 of 1.94 Mb. With the linkage maps, 336 contigs were successfully anchored into 19 pseudochromosomes, accounting for 90.2% of the assembled genome size. Genomic integrity assessment showed that 1,347 (97.9%) of the 1,375 genes conserved among all embryophytes can be found in the P. simonii assembly. Genomic repeat analysis revealed that 41.47% of the P. simonii genome is composed of repetitive elements, of which 40.17% contained interspersed repeats. A total of 45,459 genes were predicted from the P. simonii genome sequence and 39,833 (87.6%) of the genes were annotated with one or more related functions. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that P. simonii and Populus trichocarpa should be placed in different sections, contrary to the previous classification according to morphology. The genome assembly not only provides an important genetic resource for the comparative and functional genomics of different Populus species, but also furnishes one of the closest reference sequences for identifying genomic variants in an F-1 hybrid population derived by crossing P. simonii with other Populus species.

AB  - The development of cryopreservation techniques has led to important changes in animal reproductive biotechnology. However, these techniques are associated with cellular and molecular damage, affecting the mitochondrial function and quality of spermatozoa; moreover studies in fish are limited. In this work, the effects of cryopreservation on ultrastructure, mitochondrial function and antioxidant defences in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) spermatozoa were assessed, along with intracellular calcium (Ca2+) mitochondrial DNA sequence and sperm function (motility and fertilization rate). Significant ultrastructure alterations of the middle piece and mitochondria were observed in cryopreserved spermatozoa as compared to controls. Oxygen consumption and ATP were also significantly different in cryopreserved spermatozoa, and in spermatozoa incubated with electron transport chain (ETC) uncouplers and inhibitors. Mitochondrial membrane potential, motility, fertilization rate and Ca-i(2+) in cryopreserved spermatozoa displayed significant reductions compared to fresh spermatozoa. Mitochondrial potential correlated significantly with motility and fertilization rate. A redox imbalance was observed in frozen spermatozoa due to increased lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion production as compared to fresh spermatozoa. Likewise, increased activity of glutathione peroxidase and total glutathione (GSH/GSSG), as well as reduced catalase activity, were observed in comparison with fresh spermatozoa. Our results contribute to a better understanding of cryodamage to mitochondrial functions in fish spermatozoa, and enabled us to establish potential quality assessment indicators. The data suggest that cryopreservation induces a reduction in overall sperm quality and functionality through disruption of the mitochondrial ultrastructure and function, leading to energy depletion and increased oxidative stress. This knowledge may also lead to the identification of a potential biotechnological tool for improving reproductive efficiency in species of commercial and biological interest.

AB  - Chlorine is globally the most widely used chemical for water disinfection. Whereas disinfection efficiency is well known to depend on water pH and temperature, the effect of turbidity is less well studied. Although turbidity is measured online in most drinking water works and most countries where regulations exist have set limits of <1 NTU for water leaving the works, the composition of turbidity is typically unknown. Given the heterogeneous nature of substances contributing to turbidity, the aim of this work was to study the effect of selected compounds on chlorination efficacy. The effect of humic acids and chalk on the inactivation of the indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis was assessed at neutral pH at different turbidity levels using both plate counting and flow cytometry in combination with membrane integrity staining. For humic acids, a turbidity of 1 NTU (corresponding to 2 mg L-1) was identified as a critical threshold, which when exceeded was found to have a negative impact on chlorine disinfection. Chalk, on the other hand, had no measurable impact up to 5 NTU. The observation applied to both bacterial species with identical conclusions from the two diagnostic methods. Results corroborate that different turbidity causing substances affect chlorination efficiency to very different extents with chlorine demand by organic material probably being the most important determinant. In the case of turbidities >1 NTU, turbidity measurement benefits from the consideration of the organic content as mere NTU values do not allow predicting an impact on chlorination efficiency.

AB  - Urban and suburban streams experience rapid changes in flow during flood events, which can affect ecosystem function and stream metabolism (i.e., gross primary production [GPP], ecosystem respiration [ER], and net ecosystem production [NEP]). To assess these effects, we calculated stream metabolism from hourly measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, and flow at seven sites around the Chicago region during summer and fall of 2009 to 2013. We examined the biophysical effect of flood events by calculating metrics that characterized GPP and ER's resistance (magnitude of change) and resilience (speed of recovery) to flooding as well as flood flashiness. Diel patterns in DO and GPP were observed during base flow conditions and flood events. Streams showed net heterotrophy at most of the sites, as GPP ranged from 0.98 - 6.61 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1), ER ranged from -3.62 to -19.53 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1), and NEP ranged from -16.84 to 1.06 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1). Following floods, both GPP and ER decreased but ER exhibited a significantly higher resistance (i.e., changed less) than GPP. ER and GPP recovered to preflood levels within approximately 1 to 10 days, and there was no significant difference between ER and GPP resilience. Overall, our study indicates that large flow events sustain heterotrophic conditions more than autotrophic conditions. We concluded that flood events significantly affected stream metabolism and flood flashiness was a primary controlling factor on reducing metabolism rates.

AB  - As attrition of telomeres, DNA caps that protect chromosome integrity, is accelerated by various forms of stress, telomere length (TL) has been proposed as an indicator of lifetime accumulated stress. In ecological studies, it has been used to provide insights into ageing, life history trade-offs, the costs of reproduction and disease. qPCR is a high-throughput and cost-effective tool to measure relative TL (rTL) that can be applied to newly collected and archived ecological samples. However, qPCR is susceptible to error both from the method itself and pre-analytical steps. Here, repeatability was assessed overall and separately across multiple levels (intra-assay, inter-assay and inter-extraction) to elucidate the causes of measurement error, as a step towards improving precision. We also tested how accuracy, defined as the correlation between the "gold standard" for TL estimation (telomere restriction fragment length analysis with in-gel hybridization), could be improved. We find qPCR repeatability (intra- and inter-assay levels) to be at similar levels across three common storage media (ethanol, Longmire's and Queen's). However, inter-extraction repeatability was 50% lower for samples stored in Queen's lysis buffer, indicating storage medium can influence precision. Precision as well as accuracy could be increased by estimating rTL from multiple qPCR reactions and from multiple extractions. Repetition increased statistical power equivalent to a 25% (single extraction analysed twice) and 17% (two extractions) increase in sample size. Overall, this study identifies novel sources of variability in high-throughput telomere quantification and provides guidance on sampling strategy design and how to increase rTL precision and accuracy.

AB  - Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is an approach to measure the relative efficiency of a set of decision-making units (DMUs) which uses multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. In real world situations, due to uncertainty, DEA is sometimes faced with imprecise inputs and/or outputs. Therefore, performance measurement must often be performed under uncertainty conditions. Generally, the performance of DMUs can be evaluated from two perspectives-optimistic and pessimistic. As a result, two different evaluations are obtained for each DMU. In this article, we first obtain the efficiencies of the DMUs under evaluation from both optimistic and pessimistic views. The optimistic view evaluates each DMU with a set of the most desirable weights; the efficiencies measured by the optimistic approach are called optimistic efficiencies. The pessimistic view evaluates each DMU with a set of the most undesirable weights; the efficiencies measured by the pessimistic approach are called pessimistic efficiencies. Then it is shown that the outcomes of these two evaluations are conflicting with each other, being undoubtedly biased, unrealistic, and unconvincing. To overcome this problem, we propose a new measure of overall performance which is used for integrating the measures obtained from optimistic and pessimistic views and we will use it to identify the DMU with the best performance under uncertainty conditions. Also, we propose new fuzzy DEA models that evaluate a DMU from the pessimistic perspective in a fuzzy context. The proposed measure will be shown with two numerical examples, including the selection of a flexible manufacturing system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge of macroinvertebrate distributions and associated environmental drivers in subtropical Asian rivers is relatively scarce. To fill this knowledge gap, we examined the spatial variation of macroinvertebrate community structure and associated environmental conditions in a subtropical river system, the Dongjiang River Basin, in southeastern China. A total of 70 families and 9 classes of macroinvertebrates were identified from 74 sites sampled in January 2013. Our study has the following findings: (1) a distinct spatial differentiation of macroinvertebrate communities was present in the Dongjiang River Basin indicated by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), which corresponded to the northern region (NR), middle region (MR), and southern region (SR) gradient; (2) ANOVAs showed that diversity indices (total taxa, Margalef index and the Shannon diversity index), biotic indices (richness of EPT, percentage of EPT, and family biotic index) and most of the studied environmental conditions (elevation, slope, steam order, water temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, substrates, ammoniacal nitrogen, total phosphorus, percentage of urban land, percentage of rural land, and percentage of forest land) differed significantly among the three regions and a degradation gradient was observed in the NR-MR-SR direction; (3) Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that NR sites were characterized by steep slope and coarse substrate, MR sites were characterized by high water temperatures and shallow slopes, and SR sites were primarily characterized by high total phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations; and (4) the Indicator Species Analysis, in conjunction with CCA analysis indicated that the most representative indicator taxon is Tipulidae for NR, Semisulcospira sp. for MR, and Branchiura sp. for SR.

AB  - In this study long-term (1984-2001) phytoplankton and physico-chemical monitoring data representing different salinity regimes of the Baltic Sea were compiled from HELCOM, national and regional databases. The aim was to define seasonal succession patterns of phytoplankton in seven different areas of the Baltic sea, characterised by different salinity, climate, and trophic conditions and to delineate a set of phytoplankton community indicators that are independent of season and salinity, but indicative of trophic status of different coastal areas. The cluster analysis of the combined data set resulted in eight phytoplankton community types, common for all locations, and characterised by different taxonomic composition representing different stages of seasonal succession. A hierarchy of explanatory variables that best predicted the communities, dominated by either diatoms, cyanophytes, cryptophytes or dinoflagellates, was revealed through a redundancy analysis (RDA). Nutrients were not found to be significant factors shaping the common phytoplankton community types for all locations. RDA analysis at the location level, covering all seasonal succession stages, confirmed phytoplankton community composition to be sensitive to nutrient concentrations. Even with the limitations of utilizing databases from different sources we identified community types that were indicative of climatic conditions (particularly temperature), salinity and eutrophication. The dominance of cyanobacteria as such, would not be an appropriate indicator of trophic conditions in the Baltic Sea, in the areas where cyanobacteria blooms occur naturally. The structure of both diatom- and cyanophyte-dominated communities is governed by salinity, and thus the abundances of these groups cannot be directly used as an indicator across the whole Baltic Sea.

AB  - The chironomid subfossils from a single sediment core in the floodplain of the Aa river (Saint-Omer basin, Northern France) were analysed. This study was a pioneering attempt to use sedimentary chironomid assemblages and lithostratigraphic analysis to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment and the past hydrodynamic conditions in a river system during the mid-Holocene period. In this paper, a chironomid subfossil typology is proposed, based on the current scientific knowledge about the present distribution of chironomid species through the cross-section of a floodplain (from lotic to more lentic habitats). A hydrological status is attributed to 27 subfossil chironomid taxa (limnophilous taxa and rheophilous taxa) from the Saint-Omer sediment sample. Based on these chironomid hydrological statuses and in regard with the lithostratigraphic data, the dynamics of chironomid subfossil assemblages showed the occurrence of some fluctuations between periods with lower (lentic periods SMch-1, SMch-3 and SMch-5) and higher (lotic periods SMch-2 and SMch-4) Aa river discharge rates during the Late-Atlantic and Subboreal periods. The lotic periods were correlated with several climatic events known to have occurred during these periods in Europe. Several hypotheses are put forward and discussed, as to the potential relationships between the levels of precipitation and the hydrological conditions in the Saint-Omer basin. Although chironomid analysis in river systems is still in its developmental phase, the conclusions drawn from the present findings on subfossil chironomids show that these can provide a useful tool for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction purposes.

AB  - This article describes and illustrates an accounting method to assess and compare "early" carbon sequestration investments and trades on the basis of the number of standardized CO2 emission offset credits they will provide. The "gold standard" for such credits is assumed to be a relatively riskless credit based on a CO2 emission reduction that provides offsets against CO2 emissions on a one-for-one basis. The number of credits associated with carbon sequestration needs to account for time, risk, durability, permanence, additionality, and other factors that future trade regulators will most certainly use to assign "official" credits to sequestration projects. The method that is presented here uses established principles of natural resource accounting and conventional rules of asset valuation to "score" projects. A review of 20 "early" voluntary United States based CO2 offset trades that involve carbon sequestration reveals that the assumptions that buyers, sellers, brokers, and traders are using to characterize the economic potential of their investments and trades vary enormously. The article develops a "universal carbon sequestration credit scoring equation" and uses two of these trades to illustrate the sensitivity of trade outcomes to various assumptions about how future trade auditors are likely to "score" carbon sequestration projects in terms of their "equivalency" with CO2 emission reductions. The article emphasizes the importance of using a standard credit scoring method that accounts for time and risk to assess and compare even unofficial prototype carbon sequestration trades. The scoring method illustrated in this article is a tool that can protect the integrity of carbon sequestration credit trading and can assist buyers and sellers in evaluating the real economic potential of prospective trades.

AB  - Altered gut microbiota has been identified during psychological stress, which causes severe health issues worldwide. The integrity of the intestinal barrier and blood-brain barrier regulates the process of bacterial translocation and can supply the nervous system with real-time information about the environment. However, the association of gut microbiota with psychological stress remains to be fully interpreted. In this study, we established a psychological stress model using an improved communication box and compared the expression of tight junction proteins in multiple regions of the intestinal (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and blood-brain (amygdala, hippocampus) barriers between model and control rats. We also conducted fecal microbiota analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Expression levels of the stress-related indicators adrenocorticotropic hormone, NR3C1,2, and norepinephrine were increased in the model group compared to control group. Psychological stress reduced brain and intestinal levels of tight junction proteins, including claudin5, occludin, alpha-actin, and ZO-1. Microbiota analysis revealed elevated microbial diversity and fecal proportions of Intestinimonas, Catenisphaera, and Globicatella in the model group. Further analysis indicated a negative correlation of Allisonella and Odoribacter, as well as a positive correlation of norank_f__Peptococcaceae, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, and Coprococcus_2, with claudin5, occludin, alpha-actin, and ZO-1. Our use of a rodent model to explore the association between compromised intestinal and blood-brain barriers and altered fecal microbiota under psychological stress improves our understanding of the gut-brain axis. Here, cues converge to control basic developmental processes in the intestine and brain such as barrier function. This study provides new directions for investigating the pathogenesis of emotional disorders and the formulation of clinical treatment.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis in Hevea is stimulated when the embryogenesis induction medium contains maltose, rather than glucose, fructose, or sucrose, in equimolarity (Blanc et al., 1999). Kinetic analyses were carried out on various physiological and biochemical indicators over the 8 weeks that the induction phase then expression of somatic embryogenesis can take. Embryogenesis induction in the presence of glucose, fructose or sucrose revealed strong callus growth in the first 3-4 weeks, associated with a high intra- and extracellular hexose content, a high starch content and a substantial decline in protein synthesis. In the presence of maltose, callus growth was slow and only half that seen with sucrose. This morphogenetic behaviour is associated with a drop in endogenous hexose and starch contents, and an increase in protein synthesis in the first three weeks of culture. The induction of embryogenesis in the presence of maltose was uniform and twice as fast as with sucrose supply. At the end of culture, peroxidase activity, antioxidant and membrane protein contents increased in these calluses; these characteristics may be associated with somatic embryo organization and with the maintenance of effective membrane integrity within a nutrient environment that has become limiting. These new results tally with data in the literature on the roles of sugars, and provide some precise information with regard to the 'carbohydrate deficit' hypothesis usually put forward to explain maltose action. An analysis of these results led to the hypothesis that regulation of endogenous hexose contents at a low level, through slow maltose hydrolysis, was a key element of the biochemical signal leading this callus towards somatic embryogenesis.

AB  - Four hundred piglets were housed in 20 pens and offered for 42 days a pre-starter and then a starter compound supplemented with trace elements given as sulphates (SULF) or proteinates (PROT) at a common level (100) or at a reduced level (20) of inclusion. The common level supplied 278, 148, 315 and 98 mg/kg and the reduced level supplied 128, 38, 135 and 50 mg/kg of iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn), respectively taking into account the natural food contents. Proteinates used in the trial were analysed and described in terms of content and quality of different potential ligands. Piglet growth was not affected by any treatment. At the end of the trial blood samples were collected from eight pigs for each treatment. These animals were slaughtered and their livers were removed, weighed and analysed. Compared with SULF, PROT increased significantly plasma levels of Fe (25.1 v. 15.7 mu mol/l), haemoglobin (10.9 v. 10.4 g/dl) and the number of red blood cells (6.4 v. 6.1 millions per mu l) but the liver recovery of Fe was not affected by any treatment. In piglets receiving PROT the liver content of Cu and Zn increased significantly compared with those receiving SULF On reducing the dosage, CEI in the liver significantly decreased with SULF but not with PROT and the amount of Zn decreased move with SULF than with PROT. The results may reflect a better availability of Cu and Zn when proteinates rather than sulphates were used as mineral supplements.

AB  - Almost half of Australian freshwater turtle species are formally listed as threatened, but little is known about the effects of water management and other factors on the abundance and health of freshwater turtles in arid and semi-arid regions. This study investigated how river flows (including the controlled release of water from an upstream storage facility, or 'environmental flow') and water quality might affect the abundance and nutritional status of three freshwater turtle species in three dryland rivers of the Murray-Darling basin in south-eastern Australia. No response in abundance or nutritional status of the broad-shelled turtle, Chelodina expansa, the eastern long-necked turtle, Chelodina longicollis, and the Macquarie turtle, Emydura macquarii, was detected in relation to river flows, possibly because of the small magnitude of the environmental flow. However, for C. expansa, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) was negatively related to increasing macrophyte cover, electrical conductivity (EC, an indicator of salinity), and turbidity. CPUE for C. longicollis was positively related to macrophyte cover and EC, and for E. macquarii it was positively related to macrophyte cover. Haematological measurements suggested that the turtles had healthy nutritional status. Body condition and blood glucose and protein were related significantly to EC, whereas haematological measurements varied significantly among species and between spring and summer. The main conclusion is that water management measures to help the conservation of these turtles should include sufficient environmental flow to produce overbank flooding, thereby creating and maintaining a wide range of habitat suitable for the differing needs of the individual species.

AB  - Subterranean habitats represent focal habitats in many conservation strategies; however, these environments are some of the most difficult to sample. New sampling methods, such as environmental DNA (eDNA), show promise to improve stygobiont detection, but sources of sampling bias are poorly understood. Therefore, we determined the factors affecting detection probability using traditional visual surveys and eDNA surveys for both cavefishes and cave crayfishes and demonstrated how detection affects survey efforts for these taxa. We sampled 40 sites (179 visual and 183 eDNA surveys) across the Ozark Highlands ecoregion. We estimated the detection probability of cave crayfishes and cavefishes using both survey methods under varying environmental conditions. The effectiveness of eDNA or visual surveys varied by environmental conditions (i.e., water volume, prevailing substrate, and water velocity) and the target taxa. When sampling in areas with average water velocity, no flow, and coarse substrate, eDNA surveys had a higher detection probability (0.49) than visual surveys (0.35) for cavefishes and visual surveys (0.67) had a higher detection probability than eDNA surveys (0.40) for cave crayfishes. Under the same sampling conditions, 5 visual surveys compared to 10 eDNA surveys would be needed to confidently detect cave crayfishes and 9 visual surveys compared to 4 eDNA surveys for cavefishes. Environmental DNA is a complementary tool to traditional visual surveys; however, the limitations we identified indicate eDNA currently cannot replace visual surveys in subterranean environments. Although sampling designs that account for imperfect sampling are particularly useful, they may not be practical; thus, increasing sampling efforts to offset known detection bias would benefit conservation strategies.

AB  - Treatment wetlands can remove a wide range of pollutants from wastewater and stormwater runoff, including microbial pollutants such as Escherichia coli. Filter feeding zooplankton play an important role in improving water quality in treatment wetlands through grazing and subsequent inactivation of E. coli. Understanding how climate change will impact the various processes governing microbial inactivation in treatment wetlands is essential to ensure adequately treated water. We investigated the impact of interacting environmental factors on the E. coli clearance rate of a keystone zooplankton species, Daphnia magna. We utilized a full factorial experimental design to test the impacts of food abundance, food type, and temperature in flow-through mesocosms under environmentally relevant conditions. Temperature and food abundance interactions were significant, which highlights the importance of studying multiple environmental variables when considering the filter feeding contributions of zooplankton. While both food abundance and temperature had a significant impact on clearance rate, daphnids did not exhibit a preference between algae or E. coli, which were the two food sources used in our studies. We observed that at 25 degrees C, food abundance and type had a larger impact on E. coli clearance rate than at 15 degrees C, which has important implications when considering resiliency of treatment wetlands in a warming climate. Our findings show that zooplankton filtration behavior will be impacted by environmental conditions that are projected due to climatic changes, but populations can still inactivate E. coli and improve water quality when exposed to these conditions.

AB  - Persistent hypoxic or low-oxygen conditions in aquatic systems are becoming more frequent worldwide, causing large-scale mortalities to the aquaculture animals. Hence, it would be of great benefit to search for natural compounds that are clinically safe, yet able to induce host health and antioxidant defence system. In the experiment, Lateolabrax maculatus were fed with ketone compound teprenone and subsequently exposed to hypoxia condition. Afterwards, the effect of teprenone on the antioxidative response, non-specific immunity and hypoxia induced oxidative stress were investigated. We found that dietary supplementation of teprenone at 200 mg/kg (HT200), 400 mg/kg (HT400) and 800 mg/kg (HT800) significantly increase the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) during hypoxia stress. While, lower values of malondialdehyde (MDA) content, an indicator of oxidative stress, were recorded in teprenone supplemented groups. In addition, upregulation of non-specific immune parameters including lysozyme (LZM), Hsp70 and Hsp90 was observed in L.maculatus. We further demonstrated that teprenone supplementation protects L.maculatus from hypoxia and oxidative stress generated apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic signalling molecules, i.e., cytochrome C (Cty-C), caspase-9 and caspase-3 production were significantly decreased in response to teprenone supplementation during the hypoxia stress. In contrast, the anti-apoptotic response, BCL-2 gene expression, was significantly increased. We have shown that dietary teprenone induces innate immunity and antioxidative response and protects L.maculatus against hypoxia induced-oxidative stress and apoptosis; therefore, suggesting their possible role to manage the stressful condition, in particular, hypoxia stress in aquaculture.

AB  - The assessment of environmental conditions in the creation of dairy cattle in feedlots must be carried out to identify possible causes of stress and assist producers in the decision-making process. The objective was to characterize the abiotic factors and bed temperature, in the comfort conditions of dairy cows, through geo-statistics and exploratory data inference, in a Compost Barn System in the Brazilian semiarid region. The data were obtained in a milk production unit, located in the municipality of Lajedo, Pernambuco, Brazil. The variables air temperature (Tair), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), illuminance (Lux), skin temperature (Ts), bed temperature (Tb) were recorded and the temperature index was determined and humidity (THI). Data were recorded at 9:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., and 03:00 p.m., over 5 days in the summer season. For geostatistical analysis, the classic semivariances were determined. The principal component analysis was performed to establish an index that characterized the condition of animal comfort. The variables Tair, RH, Tb, and THI showed a low coefficient of variation for all times. The best fit to the models of the semivariograms was the Gaussian at 9:00 a. m. and 03:00 p.m., and the spherical at 12:00 p.m. The Tb spatial variability was low for all studied hours. Tair showed a strong correlation with Tb, due to the process of heat transfer by convection from the floor to the environment. Geostatistics and exploratory data analysis allowed the establishment of a comfort index for Compost Barn production systems in the Brazilian semiarid region (R-2 = 0.996; p < 0.0001).

AB  - Machine learning algorithms are becoming more and more popular in natural disaster assessment. Although the technology has been tested in flood susceptibility analysis of several watersheds, research on global flood disaster risk assessment based on machine learning methods is still rare. Considering that the watershed is the basic unit of water management, the purpose of this study was to conduct a risk assessment of floods in the global fourth-level watersheds. Thirteen conditioning factors were selected, including: maximum daily precipitation, precipitation concentration degree, altitude, slope, relief degree of land surface, soil type, Manning coefficient, proportion of forest and shrubland, proportion of artificial surface, proportion of cropland, drainage density, population, and gross domestic product. Four machine learning algorithms were selected in this study: logistic regression, naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and random forest. The global susceptibility assessment model was constructed based on four machine learning algorithms, thirteen conditioning factors, and global flood inventories. The evaluation results of the model show that the random forest performed better in the test, and is an efficient and reliable tool in flood susceptibility assessment. Sensitivity analysis of the conditioning factors showed that precipitation concentration degree and Manning coefficient were the main factors affecting flood risk in the watersheds. The susceptibility map showed that fourth-level watersheds in the global high-risk area accounted for a large proportion of the total watersheds. With the increase of extreme hydrological events caused by climate change, global flood disasters are still one of the most threatening natural disasters. The global flood susceptibility map from this study can provide a reference for global flood management.

AB  - This study sought to investigate the feasibility of using field data and remote sensing structural and functional indices in the evaluation and monitoring of semi-steppe rangelands of Isfahan Province, Iran. The study area was first divided into 40 sub-catchments, and rangeland conditions in each sub-catchment were classified into three classes using the four-factor method (FFM). Landsat TM and OLI images for 1987 and 2015 were obtained, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated. The structure of the area was evaluated using landscape function analysis (LFA) and rangeland landscape metrics. Rangeland function was also assessed and statistically compared using LFA and the leakiness index (LI). In order to clarify the effects of climate and management on rangeland function, changes in the standardized precipitation index (SPI) were computed and monitored at different intervals. The results indicated the reduction of structural indices, rangeland conditions, and patch sizes over time. Structural metrics suggested the fragmentation of the rangelands with 40-60% canopy cover and the development of rangelands with 0-20%. The structural changes affected rangeland function, and thus reduced the functions of the studied sub-catchments over the 28-year period (p<0.05). The trend of SPI revealed several periods of drought with different intensities and durations. Reduced precipitation caused structural changes and further decreased function in 2015. According to the obtained results, the combined field-based and remotely sensed approach applied in this research can be used to assess and monitor the functionality and structure of semi-steppe rangeland ecosystems at sub-catchment scale.

AB  - Livestock contribution in agricultural economy is significantly higher in hilly regions of India. A detailed study was carried out to assess the productivity, species richness and diversity of grasses of the grasslands in different hill agro-ecosystems of Kangra district of IIimachal Pradesh in western Himalaya. Saccharuin spontaneum (low hills), Chtysopogon echinulatus (mid hills) and Festuca spp. (high hills) were observed as the most dominant species in hill agro-ecosystems. Productivity assessment was done at five locations, viz. open forest area; enclosed forest area; community land; farmers' field; and wasteland in each hill zone. High species richness and diversity was observed in mid hill zone as compared to low and high hills. The mean production level was recorded highest in low hills closely followed by mid hills; much less in high hills. Amongst the land-use systems. highest biomass production was recorded at farmers' field followed by community land and least in wasteland situation. The average herbage production obtained through six cuts at periodic intervals (March to December) was 3,202 DM kg/ha, while in single harvest it was 2.249 DM kg/ba (low-hill conditions); 2,893 and 1.924 DM kg/ha (mid-hill conditions) and 1,399 and 850 DM kg/ha (high-hill conditions), respectively. Averaged over the different locations, 6.01, 6.64 and 10.87% crude protein (CP) was observed (in multicut situation) in low, mid and high hills respectively. Average herbage production obtained through six cuts at periodical intervals (March-December) was consistently higher as compared to single harvest in all the three zones.

AB  - Various climatic and hydrological variables such as precipitation, soil moisture, stream flow, and water level can be used to assess drought conditions, however, the response of ecosystem productivity to such metrics is not very clear. In this study, we examined the sensitivity of GPP anomalies to five drought indicators: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), deficit of soil moisture (DSM), and the difference between precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET) (D(P-ET)). The global spatial distributions of drying and wetting trends from 2000 to 2014 determined by these five indices were similar. Additionally, the percent of drought-impacted areas decreased over the study period, indicating a reduction in drought conditions. GPP increased over the study period in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) but decreased in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), resulting in a net increase in global GPP. GPP anomalies were more sensitive to drought indices in the SH than in the NH. Among the five indices, GPP anomalies were most closely correlated with SPI in the NH (R = 0.60, P < 0.05) and SPEI in the SH (R = 0.93, P < 0.01). Regionally speaking, annual and seasonal GPP anomalies were most sensitive to DSM and PDSI, highlighting the importance of soil moisture observations to regional drought monitoring and assessment. The results of this study are important for evaluating the impacts of drought on ecosystem production and the global carbon cycle. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The choice of bedding material affects the quality of air in a stable and, consequently, the respiratory health of horses and humans. The risk of respiratory problems can be mitigated by improving the quality of air in the stable. The choice of bedding material is particularly important in cold climate conditions where horses are kept indoors throughout the year. This study examined the impact of three bedding materials: straw (S), peat with shavings (PS), and crushed wood pellets (CWP). The investigated factors were air contamination, including dust contamination and microbial (bacterial and fungal) contamination, and the condition of the equine respiratory tract. The condition of the respiratory tract was evaluated based on the results of arterial blood biochemistry tests and endoscopic evaluations of the upper respiratory tract. Mechanical dust contamination was lowest for PS (1.09 mg/m(3)) and highest for CWP (4.07 mg/m(3)). Bacterial contamination (in CFU colony forming units) was highest for PS (5.14 logio CFU/m(3)) and lowest for CWP (4.81 logic, CFU/m(3)). Fungal air contamination was lowest for CWP (4.54 logio CFU/m(3)) and highest for S (4.82 logio CFU/m(3)) and PS (4.88 logio CFU/m(3)). An analysis of physiological indicators revealed that all horses were clinically healthy regardless of the type of applied bedding. The type of bedding material did not exert a clear influence on arterial blood biochemistry or the results of endoscopic evaluations of the respiratory tract; however, the use of alternative for straw bedding materials improved endoscopy results.

AB  - Phospholipid vesicles loaded with Quin-2 and 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) have been used to investigate the effects of pH conditions on Ca2+ transport catalyzed by ionophores A23187, 4-BrA23187, and ionomycin. At an external pH of 7.0, a Delta pH (inside basic) of 0.4-0.6 U decreases the rate of Ca2+ transport into the vesicles by severalfold under some conditions. The apparent extent of transport is also decreased. In contrast, raising the pH by 0.4-0.6 U in the absence of a Delta pH increases both of these parameters, although by smaller factors. The relatively large effects of a Delta pH on the transport properties of Ca2+ ionophores seem to reflect a partial equilibration of the transmembrane ionophore distribution with the H+ concentration gradient across the vesicle membrane. This unequal distribution of ionophore can cause a very slow or incomplete ionophore-dependent equilibration of Delta pCa with Delta pH. A second factor of less certain origin retards full equilibration of Delta pCa when Delta pH = 0. These findings call into question several ionophore-based methods that are used to investigate the regulatory activities of Ca2+ and other divalent cations in biological systems. Notable among these are the null-point titration method for determining the concentration of free cations within cells and the use of ionophores plus external cation buffers to calibrate intracellular cation indicators. The present findings also indicate that the transport mode of Ca2+ ionophores is more strictly electroneutral than was thought, based upon previous studies.

AB  - Fifty-eight spring malting barley crops (Hordeum vulgare L. 'Triumph') were monitored in the Rangitikei district, New Zealand (40-degrees-20'S), over three seasons beginning 1987/88 and covering a wide variation in soil moisture conditions during grain filling but small deficits before anthesis. The objectives were to: (1) document the range of variability of grain yield among locations and years; (2) determine if systematic patterns occurred in the dry matter (DM) accumulation and nitrogen (N) uptake; and (3) evaluate the effects these processes have on the partitioning of DM and N between the grain and the rest of the plant. Mean yearly grain yields (14% moisture) were 6.85, 5.12, and 5.07 t/ha, respectively. Grain number/m2 accounted for 79% of the variation in grain yield. On average, 63% of the N in the above ground crop was derived from soil reserves, and 87% of the total N uptake occurred before anthesis. Pre-anthesis processes had a major effect on crop characteristics at maturity. For example, the level of crop N at anthesis (indicative of pre-anthesis N uptake) was a good predictor of the extent of post-anthesis partitioning of N to the grain (r = -0.75). Conversely, high post-anthesis N uptake was generally not related to grain N concentration. Therefore, under dryland conditions, there is scope for improving yield by late applications of N without causing grain quality reductions. Management options for obtaining high yields of malting barley under non-irrigated conditions are discussed. These include the use of crop N concentration at anthesis as an indicator of crop N status.

AB  - The use of canopy thermography is an innovative approach for salinity stress detection in plants. But its applicability for landscape scale studies using satellite sensors is still not well investigated. The aim of this research is to test the satellite thermography soil salinity assessment approach on a study area with different crops, grown both in irrigated and rainfed conditions, to evaluate whether the approach has general applicability. Four study areas in four different states of Australia were selected to give broad representation of different crops cultivated under irrigated and rainfed conditions. The soil salinity map was prepared by the staff of Geoscience Australia and CSIRO Land and Water and it is based on thorough soil sampling together with environmental modelling. Remote sensing data was captured by the Landsat 5 TM satellite. In the analysis we used vegetation indices and brightness temperature as an indicator for canopy temperature. Applying analysis of variance and time series we have investigated the applicability of satellite remote sensing of canopy temperature as an approach of soil salinity assessment for different crops grown under irrigated and rainfed conditions. We concluded that in all cases average canopy temperatures were significantly correlated with soil salinity of the area. This relation is valid for all investigated crops, grown both irrigated and rainfed. Nevertheless, crop type does influence the strength of the relations. In our case cotton shows only minor temperature difference compared to other vegetation classes. The strongest relations between canopy temperature and soil salinity were observed at the moment of a maximum green biomass of the crops which is thus considered to be the best time for application of the approach.

AB  - Wetlands maintain biodiversity and provide numerous ecosystem services, so the pressure to perform successful restoration consequently is high. However, restoration projects rarely include an in-depth assessment of wetland potential for recovery, and restoration techniques may not be tailored to site-specific concerns. This study examined the seed bank of disturbed wetlands slotted for hydrologic, but not vegetation, restoration to determine if a seed bank comparable to that of nearby undisturbed wetlands persisted despite long-term anthropogenic disturbance. We compared the aboveground vegetation and seed bank compositions under drained, drawdown, and flooded conditions between undisturbed and historically ditched ("disturbed") wetlands. Disturbed and undisturbed wetlands shared fewer than 30 % of total aboveground species. While undisturbed wetlands were dominated by graminoids, disturbed wetlands had greater cover of forbs. The seed banks of disturbed wetlands had high species diversity, but their composition was dissimilar to that of nearby undisturbed wetlands. In total, the seed banks of both disturbance histories germinated 56 species; drained conditions had the fewest germinants while flooded conditions had the most. Germinant richness was significantly affected by disturbance, moisture, and their interaction; evenness was significantly affected by moisture, and Shannon diversity by disturbance. Because the seed bank of disturbed wetlands included many fast-growing wetland plants, passive vegetation restoration and active hydrologic restoration may result in wetlands overgrown with weedy species and with fewer conservative wetland plants. An understanding of the capacity for seed banks to re-vegetate wetlands post-restoration and approximate undisturbed wetlands is crucial to the overall success of restoration projects.

AB  - The present study was aimed at estimation of the genetic parameters and the effect of season and year of birth on performance traits of Holstein Friesian cattle maintained at Agricultural University Dairy Farm Peshawar, Pakistan from the period 1 999 to 2008. Genetic parameters for studied traits were estimated using multiple-trait animal model by DMU Software package with year and season of birth as fixed effects. The effect of year and season of birth was found significant on all the traits under study. Mean Puberty Age (PA), Age at First Calving (AFC) first lactation 305 Days Milk Yield (305 DMY) and Reproductive Efficiency (RE) were 794.32 +/- 45.35 days, 1172.27 +/- 79.65 days, 3553 +/- 423.26 kg and 62.50 +/- 3.56%, respectively. Heritability estimates of PA, AFC, RE and first lactation 305 DMY were 0.17, 0.11, 0.12 and 0.22, respectively. Genetic correlation of PA with AFC was highly positive (0.67) whereas, genetic and phenotypic correlation of RE with PA and AFC was moderately negative. Genetic correlations of 305 DMY was highly negative with AFC and RE and moderately negative with PA. In the present study, Holstein outperformed indigenous breeds in terms of performance and genetically inheritable potential under the prevailing subtropical conditions of Pakistan. RE parameter studied is useful indicator for moderately inheritable reproductive traits and should be considered in future studies using large dataset. Interestingly, the genetic parameters of holstein in. the present study were in. normal range but the production was markedly lower than other studies in the temperate environmental conditions.

AB  - Behaviour is a significant component of well-being and should be properly considered in a pig welfare assessment. However, interpretation of variations in behaviour is usually not straightforward, especially when dealing with animals housed and managed in a variety of systems. The fourth principle of the Welfare Quality (R) project, labelled "Appropriate behaviour", was assessed on 21 farms (11 extensive and 10 intensive) with a total of 25,856 Iberian pigs (Sus scrofa). The methodology included scan samplings of social and exploratory behaviour, human-animal relationship tests and qualitative behaviour assessments (QBA). Changes in occurrence of behaviour and qualitative measures were evaluated and discussed when comparing Iberian pigs either in intensive or extensive rearing conditions. Negative as well as positive social behaviours were significantly (P < 0.001) more frequent among intensive Iberian pigs compared to extensive animals. In intensive Iberian pigs, both types of social behaviours were highly correlated (rs = +0.62). No significant differences were observed in the occurrence of exploratory behaviour and in the proportion of animals exhibiting a panic response to the presence of humans between intensive and extensive Iberian pigs. It is suggested that the high occurrences of social negative behaviours recorded in intensive conditions are clearly an indicator of poor welfare; but that interpretations of variations in "positive" social and explorative behaviour are not straightforward and may lead to misinterpretations. Despite its subjectivity, the qualitative behaviour assessment appears useful to discriminate farms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Commercial laying hens are commonly housed in noisy and dim environments, yet relatively little is known about whether these conditions, particularly in combination, have any effect on welfare or egg production.
   2. The study was designed to investigate whether chronic exposure to continuous noise (60 dB(A) vs. 80 dB(A)) and/or light intensity (150 lux vs. 5 lux) during the critical period of coming into lay (16-24 weeks of age) influenced behaviour (activity, resting and feather maintenance), physiological stress (plasma corticosterone and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio) and production (number and weight of eggs laid) in laying hens.
   3. Hens in the low light pens were less active and preened and dust-bathed more than those housed in 150 lux; hens in the high noise pens rested more frequently than those in quieter pens.
   4. There was no evidence that chronic exposure to low light or high noise caused appreciable physiological stress but egg production was affected by these conditions. Hens kept in pens with low light or high noise laid fewer eggs per day than those kept in high light or low noise pens. These effects were additive, so that the fewest eggs were laid by hens subject to both low light and high noise.
   5. These results show that low light intensity and continual high background noise have a detrimental effect on egg production in the early laying phase as well as influencing the time allocated to different behaviours. However there was no strong evidence for a physiological stress response to either of these conditions or their combination.

AB  - Distribution systems management is becoming an increasingly complicated issue due to the introduction of new technologies, new energy trading strategies and a new deregulated environment. In the new deregulated energy market and considering the incentives coming from the technical and economic fields, it is reasonable to consider Distributed Generation (DG) as a viable option for systems reinforcement in competition with voltage regulator devices, to solve the lacking electric power supply problem and meet the load growth requirements with a reasonable price as well as the system power quality problems. The problem of optimal placement and size is formulated in two stages; minimization of the total costs to find optimal sizing and mounting of DG with different payback time, and maximization of the social welfare to find optimal payback time. In this framework, the object function is investment costs, which are evaluated as the annualized total investment cost, plus total running cost as well as cost of Energy Not Supply (ENS) and losses. Different system conditions are assumed to indicate the effect of the system conditions on planning decision as well as the effect of DG placement on improvement of system conditions. An optimal placement, size and investment payback time is identified. The proposed two-stage model aspects of system operation and economic aspects of market operation act as good indicators for the placement of Microturbine as a common type of DG, especially in a market environment. A software package is developed for this reason, which runs each type of planning problem very fast. The proposed methodology is tested in the IEEE 30-bus test system.

AB  - Several studies have demonstrated that localized heating of tree sterns induces localized cambial reactivation. We analyzed by light microscopy the effects of early spring increases in ambient temperature in 2005 and 2007 on the timing of cambial reactivation and xylem differentiation in stems of two trees of a cloned deciduous hardwood hybrid poplar (Populus sieboldii Miquel. x P grandidentata Michx.) growing under natural conditions. Meteorological data at the study site showed that temperatures in late winter and early spring differed markedly between 2005 and 2007, with trends toward higher temperatures starting around April 3 in 2005 and around March 20 in 2007. Cambial reactivation occurred about 17 days earlier in 2007 than in 2005. The cumulative daily maximum temperature in excess of 15 degrees C (maximum daily temperatures minus 15 degrees C) in late winter and early spring before cambial reactivation was defined as the cambial reactivation index (CRI15). Cambial reactivation, which began when the minimum temperature rose above 0 degrees C, occurred when the CRI15 was 93 and 96 degrees C in 2005 and 2007, respectively. The differentiation of secondary xylem started earlier in 2007 than in 2005. On May 27, we found a wider current-year band of xylem and a higher frequency of small-diameter vessel elements in 2007 than in 2005. We propose that the timing of cambial reactivation is controlled by air temperature and that earlier cambial reactivation induces earlier differentiation of xylem in hybrid poplar under natural conditions. Our results indicate that the CRI might be a useful indicator of the timing of cambial reactivation.

Data on long-term (more than 2000 days) experiments on the estimation of the (85)Kr and (137)Cs release rate from spent nuclear fuel (fragments of irradiated UO(2) pellets) were first obtained; these estimates prove the correctness of the hypothesis put forward by us in the early 1990s concerning an earlier (85)Kr release (by one order of magnitude higher than that of (137)Cs) as compared to other fission fragments in the case of the loss of integrity of a fuel containment as a result of corrosion on the sea bottom. The method and technique of the onboard (85)Kr and (137)Cs sampling and extraction (as well as the sampling of tritium, a product of triple (235)U fission) and their radiometric analysis at coastal laboratories are developed. Priority data on the (85)Kr background in the bottom layers of the Barents and Kara Seas and the (137)Cs and (3)H in these seas (state of 2003) are presented. Models necessary for the estimation of the dilution of the fission products of spent nuclear fuel and their transport on the bottom in accident and dumping regions are developed. An experimental method for the examination of the state of spent nuclear fuel on the sea bottom (1 expedition each 2-3 years) by the (85)Kr release into the environment (a leak tracer) is proposed; this release is an indicator of the destruction of a fuel containment and the release of products of spent nuclear fuel in the case of (235)UO(2) corrosion in sea water.

AB  - Small mammals have been proposed as indicators of sustainability in forests in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere. Mammal community composition and species abundances purportedly result from interactions among species, forest-floor characteristics, large coarse woody debris, understory vegetation, and overstory composition. Coarse woody debris is thought to be particularly important because of its diverse ecological functions; covers from 10 to 15% have been recommended based on retrospective studies of forests and small mammals. Unfortunately, ecological correlations are not necessarily indicative of causal relationships and magnitudes depend on composition of finite, usually non-random, cross-sectional samples. Retrospective studies must be replicated to confirm relationships. We conducted a large-scale, cross-sectional survey of 30- to 70-year-old coniferous forests in western Washington to determine if previously reported relationships would hold with an unrelated, larger sample. Coarse woody debris cover was 8.3 +/- 0.6% ((x) over bar +/- S.E., n = 8 blocks of forest, range 4-13%). Understory cover was too low (18 +/- 8% for shrubs) to allow examining interactions between understory and coarse woody debris. Overstory composition covaried with coarse woody debris. One or two of four statistically extracted habitat factors (overstory composition, herbaceous cover, abundance of Acer circinatum, and abundance of Acer macrophyllum) accounted for 18-70% of variance in abundance of I I mammal species. Our results support hypotheses that: (1) biocomplexity resulting from interactions of decadence, understory development, and overstory composition provides pre-interactive niche diversification with predictable, diverse, small-mammal communities; (2) these communities incorporate numerous species and multiple trophic pathways, and thus, their integrity measures resiliency and sustainability.

AB  - El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are well-known to be related to dry and hot extremes and have considerable impacts on the terrestrial ecosystem in southern Africa. However, the impact pathway from ENSO to vegetation (i.e., relationship among ENSO, climate anomalies, and vegetation) is still unclear in southern Africa. In this study, we investigated the impact of ENSO on vegetation (represented by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) through its impacts on compound dry and hot extremes in austral summers (December-January-February, DJF) from 1982 to 2015 in southern Africa. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Temperature Index (STI) are used as dry and hot indicators, respectively. The response of NDVI to ENSO during DJF is assessed based on correlation analysis and negative correlation coefficients are present for 87.3% of southern Africa. In addition, the response of NDVI anomaly (NDVIA) to both dry and hot conditions are also investigated, which shows positive NDVIA-SPI correlations and negative NDVIA-STI correlations for 83.2% and 76.5% of the area, respectively. The area percentage with significant impacts of ENSO on concurrent dry and hot events is estimated as 45.29%. Finally, we also evaluated lag effects between vegetation and dry/hot conditions and between dry/hot conditions and ENSO. Vegetation changes from September to December 2015 illustrate the connection among ENSO, compound dry and hot events, and vegetation decline in southern Africa. This study can aid our understanding of ENSO induced climate extremes and their impacts on vegetation in southern Africa.

AB  - Avian diversity has long been used as a surrogate for overall diversity. In forest ecosystems, it has been assumed that vegetation structure, composition, and condition have a significant impact on avian diversity. Today, these features can be evaluated via remote sensing. This study examined how structure metrics from lidar data and narrowband indices from hyperspectral data relate with avian diversity. This was assessed in four deciduous-dominated woods with differing age and structure set in an agricultural matrix in eastern England. The woods were delineated into cells within which metrics of avian diversity and remote sensing based predictors were calculated. Best subset regression was used to obtain best lidar models, hyperspectral models, and finally, the best models combining variables from both data sets. The aims were not only to examine the drivers of avian diversity, but to assess the capabilities of the two remote sensing techniques for the task. The amount of understorey vegetation was the best single predictor, followed by foliage height diversity, reflectance at 830 nm, anthocyanin reflectance index 1, and Vogelmann red edge index 2. This showed the significance of the full vertical profile of vegetation, the condition of the upper canopy, and potentially tree species composition. The results thus agree with the role that vegetation structure, condition, and floristics are assumed to have for diversity. However, the inclusion of hyperspectral data resulted in such minor improvements to models that its collection for these purposes should be assessed critically.

AB  - This work raises the problem of subsidy distribution to Russian regions for agrarian sector support. Having synthesized legal acts, the authors generated data on the state of support tools in the form of allocations from the federal budget to budgets of Russia's territorial subjects. It is shown that the new budgetary transfer procedures do not correlate with the efficiency of their use, which contradicts the principles of laws on strategic planning and the use of budgetary funds. On the basis of a methodological review, the main tools for subsidy efficiency analysis are generalized and their applicability in Russian practice is revealed. These methods are largely directed towards the description of efficiency assessment processes and diagnose the result of the use of budgetary funds insufficiently. The authors haw improved VNIOPTUSH's method through adding a number of tools, which ensure the assessment of returns from state support use, taking into account the regions' natural and economic capacity. New communications are revealed, and the functional dependence of support results on natural and economic conditions of reproduction is examined. These tools increase the objectivity of analytical procedures and the effectiveness of the mechanism of fund distribution between regions. Research based on the advanced method provides new data on the efficiency of budgetary funds use, which considerably depends on the extent to which the agrarian capacity of territorial subjects of the Russian Federation is used. Regions with difficult natural and economic conditions have the best efficiency indicators, whereas regions with favorable conditions for agricultural activities have essential reserves to increase the efficiency of subsidy use, which needs to be considered in future state support distribution.

AB  - Modelling groundwater depths in floodplains and peatlands remains a basic approach to assessing hydrological conditions of habitats. Groundwater flow models used to compute groundwater heads are known for their uncertainties, and the calibration of these models and the uncertainty assessments of parameters remain fundamental steps in providing reliable data. However, the elevation data used to determine the geometry of model domains are frequently considered deterministic and hence are seldom considered a source of uncertainty in model-based groundwater level estimations. Knowing that even the cutting-edge laser-scanning-based digital elevation models have errors due to vegetation effects and scanning procedure failures, we provide an assessment of uncertainty of water level estimations that remain basic data for wetland ecosystem assessment and management. We found that the uncertainty of the digital elevation model (DEM) significantly influenced the results of the assessment of the habitat's hydrological conditions expressed as groundwater depths. In extreme cases, although the average habitat suitability index (HSI) assessed in a deterministic manner was defined as 'unsuitable', in a probabilistic approach (grid-cell-scale estimation), it reached a value of 40% probability, signifying 'optimum' or 'tolerant'. For the 24 habitats analysed, we revealed vast differences between HSI scores calculated for individual grid cells of the model and HSI scores computed as average values from the set of grid cells located within the habitat patches. We conclude that groundwater-modelling-based decision support approaches to wetland assessment can result in incorrect management if the quality of DEM has not been addressed in studies referring to groundwater depths.

AB  - Salt stress is one of the environmental threats that have devastating impacts on plant distribution, growth and production. Different plants are believed to have salt tolerance mechanisms that occur at the cellular level. One facet of the cellular mechanisms of adaptation to salinity stress is to accumulate either inorganic and/or organic solutes. Glycinebetaine (GB), as well as other organic solutes, has been referred to as compatible solutes, for the reason that they are innocent with essential biochemical reactions even at high concentrations. GB has been assumed to be involved in osmotic adjustment and/or osmoprotection of cellular functional macromolecules and, hence, can improve tolerance to saline conditions. However, the exact mechanism and direct evidences for such correlative data are still lacking despite many attempts to improve growth under saline conditions by exogenous application as well as genetic engineering of metabolic pathways involved in metabolism of GB. Despite the enormous amount of information accumulated in this regard, the exact function of GB in the adaptation to saline environments is not fully clear to this point, and even GB functions have been argued. Because of that, inconsistencies exist in the published data regarding GB accumulation and functions under salt stress. In this review, we provide an update on evidence supporting each of these arguments to reassess how GB affects plant growth and physiological traits under salt imposition, and whether its effects correlate with salt tolerance.

AB  - A total of 37 oils from three basins in China were analyzed using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS) to investigate the distributions of low molecular weight (LMW) alkylbenzenes (C-0-C-4). Thermal maturity and depositional environment exert dominant controls on the carbon number and isomer distributions of LMW alkylbenzenes, while secondary alteration, such as biodegradation or evaporative fractionation, cannot be ruled out. With increasing maturity, the relative abundance of C-3 and C-4 decreases while the C-0-C-2 alkylbenzenes increase. Some variations in isomer distributions of C4 alkylbenzenes are also attributed to maturation, as illustrated by ratios of (m- + p-)/o-propyltoluene and (3,5- + 3,4-)/(2,5- + 2,4-ethylxylene). The 1,2,3,5-/1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene ratio (TeMBr) is proposed to distinguish oils derived from source rocks formed under anoxic rather than oxic/dysoxic depositional conditions. The data suggest that TeMBr <1.0 indicates anoxia, while TeMBr >1.5 suggests an oxic/dysoxic depositional environment. Quantitative data show that the differences in TeMBr values are mainly due to variable 1,2,3,5-TeMB concentrations, whereas the range of 1,2,3,4-TeMB concentration is relatively constant. 1,2,3,5-TeMB is enriched in oils derived from source rocks deposited under oxic/dysoxic conditions, but depleted in oils from source rocks deposited under reducing conditions.

AB  - In an era of the availability of very large databases, the problem of efficient methods to analyze such datasets remains. In large scale forest and landscape monitoring projects for instance, appropriate data mining techniques that can summarize the overall status of landscapes are necessary for planning and implementing follow-up management strategies. We consider a vegetation data set consisting of species data from more than 120 mires spread across Switzerland with a total of 20,134 plots on 2658 vascular and non-vascular plant species. Using species indicator values as proxy for site conditions, we propose some simple strategies for data mining involving multidimensional scaling and nonparametric probability density function estimation, both of which are known in the classical statistical literature. We show how commonly known techniques can be adapted in a novel and effective approach for the specific purpose of analyzing plant species occurrence in the plots to identify site conditions that influence species configurations and species diversity, thus providing important information concerning aspects of large scale vegetation structure. Our results indicate high variations among the mires with respect to site conditions that affect species assemblage and species diversity. While species indicator values continue to be popular as well as subject of much debate and research in the ecological community, our experience shows that careful methods of analysis at large landscape scales can reveal some powerful results, which can be taken up as the starting point for the next level of investigation.

AB  - An extensive set of column experiments was performed with freshly harvested Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts to evaluate the effects of solution chemistry, surface coatings, interactions with other suspended particles, and pore fluid velocity on the fate and transport of this widely occurring waterborne pathogen in sandy porous media. We synthesized our data set with a comprehensive literature survey of similar experiments, to compute attachment (collision) efficiencies (alpha) used in colloid filtration theory (CFT) using three models for the single collector efficiency (eta) across a wide range of experimental conditions. Most prior experiments have observed the transport of surface-treated, sterile C. parvum oocyst in porous media. Our column data confirm for freshly harvested oocysts that the presence of iron coatings on the sand medium and the presence of suspended illite clay drastically enhance oocyst deposition. Increasing ionic strength and decreasing pH also systematically enhance the attachment efficiency. Attachment efficiency decreases only at a very high ionic strength, most likely as a result of steric repulsion and possibly other changes in oocyst surface properties. Attachment efficiencies vary with fluid flow rate but without showing specific trends. We found that the computed attachment efficiency across all reported experiments could be reliably estimated using a regression model based on parameters related to ionic strength and pH. The regression model performed better with the Nelson-Ginn eta model and Tufenkji-Elimelech eta model than with the Rajagopalan-Tien eta model. When CFT is used in environmental assessments, the proposed regression model provides a practical estimator for attachment efficiencies of C. parvum oocyst deposition in porous media for a variety of environmental conditions unfavorable to attachment.

AB  - Calcareous grasslands have long been recognized as biodiversity hotspots in Europe. However, in recent decades these ecosystems have seen rapid decline. In Belgium, more than 100 ha of calcareous grasslands have been restored from oak coppices and pine forests since the 1990s. The aim of the present study was to provide a quantitative assessment of the success of these restoration efforts, using two sets of indicators: one related to soil conditions, the other related to vascular plant communities. Soil conditions were evaluated by comparing soil samples from pre-restoration forest stands, restored grasslands (3-age classes: 2-4 years; 5-8 years, and 10-15 years) and reference grasslands. The analysis revealed no significant differences in soil N, P. and K contents between pre-restoration forests and restored and reference grasslands. We observed a decrease in the mineralization rate indicators in both pre-restoration forests and recent grassland restorations, which was resorbed in older restorations. Floristic surveys revealed that plant species composition of older restorations was most like reference grasslands. However, some differences in species composition persisted after 15 years. Moreover, a few rare species did not colonize restored grasslands despite a close seed source. Non-recolonization by a set of species expected on calcareous grasslands may be due to dispersal limitation and higher cover by native invasive grasses in restored parcels. These results were discussed in term of implications for management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is a serious problem on the North China Plain (NCP) because it imposes a considerable nutrient burden on the local environment. However, it also makes a substantial contribution to agricultural crop N requirements. The integrated total N input (ITNI) system is a method to quantify total atmospheric N deposition by using N-15-labeled monitor plants grown in pots. The effect of pot surface area and variety of indicator plant on the amount of airborne N input quantified by the ITNI system was investigated in this study. Total N deposition to the soil-maize/soil-wheat plant system at key growth stages was also quantified to improve N-fertilizer recommendations. When indicator plants having a high space requirement were used a correction factor was needed and this could be obtained only by simulating commercial field conditions, especially plant density, because the factor depends largely on pot area or the difference in plant density between pot conditions and field conditions. The total airborne N input measured by the ITNI system was not influenced by the variety of monitoring plant. N deposition was 20-25 kg N ha(-1) during growth from three expanded leaf to ten expanded leaf and also from ten expanded leaf to maturity of maize. N deposition was 29.1 kg N ha(-1) between planting and the jointing stage and 10.1 kg N ha(-1) from jointing to maturity of wheat. This high measured N deposition indicates that N deposition should be taken into account when calculating the N fertilizer requirements of maize and wheat in this region.

AB  - Two Holocene sediment sequences from arctic lakes on Store Koldewey, an island in Northeast Greenland, were investigated for fossil chironomid assemblages. A total of 18 and 21 chironomid taxa were identified in 290- and 252-cm-long sediment sequences from Duck Lake and Hjort Lake, respectively. The chironomid assemblages were very similar in the two lakes. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to compare fossil chironomid assemblages from Store Koldewey with chironomid assemblages and environmental conditions presently found in Canadian Arctic lakes and, hence, to infer environmental changes for Northeast Greenland. The first chironomids appeared at c. 9500 cal. a BP in Hjort Lake, and 500 years later in Duck Lake. Taxa typical for cold and nutrient-poor arctic lakes dominated the earliest assemblages. Chironomid assemblages with taxa typical of higher summer air temperatures and lakes with higher nutrient availability occur between 8000 and 5000 cal. a BP. This period probably marks the regional Holocene thermal maximum, which is relatively late compared with some palaeoenvironmental records from East Greenland. One possible reason could be the location of Store Koldewey at the very outer coast, with local climatic conditions strongly influenced by the cold East Greenland Current. From around 5000 cal. a BP, chironomid assemblages in Duck Lake and Hjort Lake again became more typical of those presently found in Northeast Greenland, indicating relatively cold and nutrient-poor conditions. This shift coincides with an increase of ice-rafting debris off East Greenland and an intensification of the East Greenland Current.

AB  - This paper reports an investigation of 60 samples of lacustrine sedimentary rocks of Neogene age lying at depths of 0-400 m in the Valjevo-Mionica Basin, Serbia. The goal of the study was to determine the origin and type of primary organic matter (OM), the degree of thermal alteration, the generation potential of OM from the rocks of this basin, and conditions in the sedimentation environment during the formation of the rocks. The potential of OM of the rocks was estimated on the basis of the thermolysis of a representative sample after its preliminary debituminization.
   Using data on C-org and bitumen contents and S1, S2, and HI Rock-Eval pyrolysis parameters, the samples were divided into three groups. The first and second groups include rocks recovered from depths up to 200 m, and the third group comprises samples from depths of 200-400 m. The investigation of the inorganic constituents of the rocks and biomarker composition showed that the samples of each of these groups were formed under significantly different climatic conditions, which influenced both the composition of primary organic matter and the conditions of the sedimentation environment, which eventually affected the abundance and quality of OM in the rocks.
   The yield of the liquid fraction and concentration of hydrocarbons obtained during the thermolysis of the debituminized sample of the first group (showing the highest C-org content), the character of n-alkane and sterane distribution in the saturated fraction of thermolysis products, and the thermal maturity indices calculated from the composition of steranes supported the high generation potential of OM from these rocks.

AB  - Non-glaciated Arctic lowlands in north-east Siberia were subjected to extensive landscape and environmental changes during the Late Quaternary. Coastal cliffs along the Arctic shelf seas expose terrestrial archives containing numerous palaeoenvironmental indicators (e.g., pollen, plant macro-fossils and mammal fossils) preserved in the permafrost. The presented sedimentological (grain size, magnetic susceptibility and biogeochemical parameters), cryolithological, geochronological (radiocarbon, accelerator mass spectrometry and infrared-stimulated luminescence), heavy mineral and palaeoecological records from Cape Mamontov Klyk record the environmental dynamics of an Arctic shelf lowland east of the Taymyr Peninsula, and thus, near the eastern edge of the Eurasian ice sheet, over the last 60 Ky. This region is also considered to be the westernmost part of Beringia, the non-glaciated landmass that lay between the Eurasian and the Laurentian ice caps during the Late Pleistocene. Several units and subunits of sand deposits, peat-sand alternations, ice-rich palaeocryosol sequences (Ice Complex) and peaty fillings of thermokarst depressions and valleys were presented. The recorded proxy data sets reflect cold stadial climate conditions between 60 and 50 Kya, moderate inderstadial conditions between 50 and 25 Kya and cold stadial conditions from 25 to 15 Kya. The Late Pleistocene to Holocene transition, including the Allerod warm period, the early to middle Holocene thermal optimum and the late Holocene cooling, are also recorded. Three phases of landscape dynamic (fluvial/alluvial, irregular slope run-off and thermokarst) were presented in a schematic model, and were subsequently correlated with the supraregional environmental history between the Early Weichselian and the Holocene.

AB  - Seasonal variations in seawater temperature require extensive metabolic acclimatization in cold-blooded organisms inhabiting the coastal waters of Europe. Given the energetic costs of acclimatization, differences in adaptive capacity to climatic conditions are to be expected among distinct populations of species that are distributed over a wide geographic range. We studied seasonal variations in the metabolic adjustments of two very common bivalve taxa at European scale. To this end we sampled 16 populations of Mytilus spp. and 10 Macoma balthica populations distributed from 39 degrees to 69 degrees N. The results from this large-scale comprehensive comparison demonstrated seasonal cycles in metabolic rates which were maximized during winter and springtime, and often reduced in the summer and autumn. Studying the sensitivity of metabolic rates to thermal variations, we found that a broad range of Q(10) values occurred under relatively cold conditions. As habitat temperatures increased the range of Q(10) narrowed, reaching a bottleneck in southern marginal populations during summer. For Mytilus spp., genetic-group-specific clines and limits on Q(10) values were observed at temperatures corresponding to the maximum climatic conditions these geographic populations presently experience. Such specific limitations indicate differential thermal adaptation among these divergent groups. They may explain currently observed migrations in mussel distributions and invasions. Our results provide a practical framework for the thermal ecophysiology of bivalves, the assessment of environmental changes due to climate change and its impact on (and consequences for) aquaculture.

AB  - Groundwater with high concentration of geogenic arsenic (As) occurs extensively in the Holocene alluvial aquifers of Bangladesh. Local drillers in Matlab Upazilla are constructing deeper tubewells than in the recent past, primarily because of low concentrations of dissolved Fe and As. Locally a thick layer of black to grey sediments overlies an oxidised unit of yellowish-grey to reddish-brown sediments. The correlation between the colour of both units and the groundwater redox conditions was investigated to provide an easy tool for targeting low-arsenic groundwater. Based on the sediment colour at the screen depths described by local drillers, 40 domestic shallow tubewells were selected for water sampling. Four colours were used to describe the sediments: black, white, off-white (buff) and red. Generally, the groundwater was anoxic and the As concentrations ranged from less than 5.2 to 355 mu g/L. Water derived from the black sediment is characterized by relatively higher concentrations of dissolved NH4+, DOC, Fe, P, As and by low Mn and SO42- concentrations. The off-white and red sediments had high concentration of Mn and low NH4+, DOC, Fe, P and As concentrations. The water abstracted from the black sediments indicated the most reducing environment, followed by white, off-white and red respectively. Three boreholes verified the driller's perception of the subsurface lithologic conditions. Discrepancies between the driller's and the research team description of the sediment colours were insignificant.

AB  - Two Aptian pelagic stratigraphic sections from the northern Gargano Promontory, Apulia, southern Italy, were investigated on the basis of foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils. The successions are characterized by cyclically arranged marls and marly/cherty limestones and can be referred to the Scisti a Fucoidi Formation. In the lower portion of this unit a thin black shale segment was recognized. Planktonic foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphic data enable the level to be attributed to the upper part of the Globigerinelloides blowi and Chiastozygus litterarius Zones of late Early Aptian age. These data suggest that the black shale is equivalent to the Selli Level of the Umbria-Marche Basin, which is considered to be the sedimentary expression of the global oceanic anoxic event OAE la. A perturbation of the biotic signal occurs across the Selli Level. A crisis of Globigerinelloidids and nannoconids precedes and follows the anoxic episode, and a marked increase in the eutrophic indicators (hedbergellids, Zygodiscus erectus, Biscutum constans, radiolaria) was observed. These critical conditions associated to the OAE1a are widely documented and generally related to a high fertility episode of surface water. However, with respect to the Gorge a Cerbara section (Umbria-Marche Basin), the Selli Level from the Gargano is not completely barren of calcareous plankton, probably suggesting slightly less fertile conditions in the surface water or a shallower environment. Moreover, the occurrence of the benthonic genus Spirillina indicates local dysaerobic conditions versus complete anoxia on the sea floor. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - Benthic diatoms are important indicators of human impacts on streams. Epilithic diatoms are collected most often for bioassessments, but potentially important ecological information from other habitats could be missed. Within our study region, substrata ranged from 100% rock to 100% sandy silt at 61 sites, leading us to question the appropriateness of sampling solely epilithic surfaces in riffles. We compared two protocols for collecting diatoms: (1) epilithic habitat samples (EHS) within riffles and (2) multi-habitat samples (MHS), which proportionately included different habitats (e.g., riffles and pools) and substrata (e.g., sand, silt, and rock). Three streams were not compared because rocks were absent. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling indicated that diatom communities from EHS and MHS responded similarly to alkalinity and agricultural gradients, and Procrustes analysis showed that ordinations were similar (P < 0.01). Percent motile diatoms and metrics indicating high or low P and N from MHS showed stronger relationships with land use variables than those metrics from EHS. Bray-Curtis (BC) similarity between the protocols increased as diversity and richness decreased in MHS, as agricultural impacts increased, and as motile diatoms became more abundant in EHS, which likely indicated greater habitat homogeneity or an overriding effect of water chemistry. The two protocols classified 78% of sites concordantly as minimally impacted or impacted. Multi-habitat sampling is preferred where stream habitats vary greatly because it assessed land use impacts more effectively than EHS, while indicating water chemistry impacts as effectively. Multiple habitats also contained greater species diversity, which is important to documenting species distributions, and were always available for sampling, whereas epilithic habitats could be sparse or absent.

AB  - Using a series of aerial photographs taken between 1956 and 1996, we trace coevolution of floodplain and riparian forest on the Willamette River. Within-channel bar-forms appear to be the predominant incipient floodplain landform and habitat for primary succession. Interlinked development of bar(s) and erosion of near banks, filling of channels, and establishment and growth of cottonwoods and willows results in coalescence with older floodplain. Size and internal structure of riparian forest patches reflect evolution of underlying barforms or chan nel beds. Floodplain matures as the active channel migrates away by repetition of the bar formation and near-bank erosion process, or is progressively abandoned by infilling and/or constriction with a bar. Other parts of the floodplain are recycled as eroding banks provide the coarse sediment and large woody debris for building new bars. A multichannel planform is maintained as building bars split flow, channels lengthen as bars and islands join into larger assemblages. Avulsion appears to cut new channels only short distances. Given the central role of bars and islands in building new floodplain habitat, we identify their area as a geomorphic indicator of river-flood plain integrity. We measure an 80% decline in bar and island area between 1910 and 1988 within a 22-km section. Dams, rip-rap, logging, and gravel mining may all be contributing to diminished bar formation rates. Removing obstacles to natural riparian forest creation mechanisms is necessary to regenerate the river-floodplain system and realize its productive potential.

AB  - Study of the concentration of major, trace, and rare earth elements (REE) in the Shahindezh karst bauxite deposit, northwestern Iran clarifies the relationship of the tetrad effect with geochemical parameters in the bauxite ores. The existence of irregular curves in the chondrite-normalized REE patterns as well as non-CHARAC behavior of geochemically isovalent pairs (Y/Ho) are related to the tetrad effect. The meaningful positive correlation between the sizes of the calculated T-3 tetrad effect and some geochemical factors such as Y/Ho, sigma REE, La/Y, (La/Yb)(N), and (LREE/HREE)(N) as well as some major oxides-based parameters like Al2O3 + LOI/SiO2 + Fe2O3, Al2O3/Fe2O3, Al2O3 + LOI, IOL, and SiO2 + Fe2O3 indicate that the studied bauxite horizon was likely deposited by different (acidic and/or alkalic) solutions at different stages. The lower part of the studied horizon with a thickness of similar to 4.7 m displays alkali characteristics whereas the upper parts of the horizon with a thickness of similar to 5.3 m are characterized by more acidic conditions. These results are fully supported by the co-occurrence of convex-concave tetrad effect curves in the chondrite-normalized REE patterns. Therefore, the tetrad effect phenomenon used in this study has proved to be a good and reliable geochemical proxy to assess the conditions of the depositional environment in the Shahindezh bauxite ores.

AB  - Bivalves from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous stratigraphic section at Las Zabacheras (Galve Sub-basin Teruel, northern Spain), are reviewed from both systematic and palaeoautoecological perspectives. For this study the Villar del Arzobispo Formation, well known for important dinosaur occurrences, was sampled from the boundary with the underlying Higueruelas Formation (Late Jurassic), to the first levels of the overlying El Castellar Formation (Early Cretaceous). The bivalve taxa have Late Jurassic affinity, pointing to a possible Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary towards the top of the Villar del Arzobispo Formation. We have sampled oncoids, whose nuclei are bivalves, through the section to study environment change in this lithostratigraphical formation. Geochemical trace elements and delta C-13 and delta O-18 stable isotope analysis of the oncoids enable us to determine the conditions in which the microbialites were formed and provide further palaeoenvironmental data from the deposits containing the bivalves. Bivalve taxa change from the lower part of the Villar del Arzobispo Formation, where Ceratomya excentrica and Unicardium cf. subregulare are characteristic of marine conditions, becoming more continental towards the top of the formation with the presence of Unionoidean bivalves, and in the "Wealden" facies of the El Castellar Formation, where Teruella gautieri, has been found. Bivalves and oncoids allow us to recognize continental conditions where the first dinosaur of Spain, the sauropodAragosaurus ischiatus was found, in an open water system, where there was limited evaporation, and with enough energy to produce well oxygenated water.

AB  - Desmethyl and A-ring methyl triaromatic (TA) steroids, including dinosteroids, were analyzed in the sediments deposited during the mid-Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) 1a (Goguel), 1b (Jacob, Kilian and Paquier) and 1d (Breistroffer) from the Vocontian Basin, SE France. These TA steroids were identified by GC-MS using non-polar (DB5-HT) and mid-polar (VF-200 ms) columns; their peaks are more clearly separated by the mid-polar column. The triaromatic dinosteroid indices (TADS and TADS') are defined as alternative indicators for reconstructing dinoflagellate production. In these relationships, the TADS' values tend to increase in the samples that have higher abundances of the co-eluted 3-methyl TA steroids. The TADS values are lower in the Goguel, Jacob and Kilian samples but increase in the Paquier and Breistroffer samples, and are especially consistently higher in the Paquier. These results suggest that dinoflagellates flourished under the stratified and eutrophic conditions in surface waters during the Paquier deposition (OAE1b). Moreover, an inverse correlation between the TADS and C-27 TA steroid (TAS) values is noticeable in the samples from the Kilian and Paquier deposits. Thus, the C-27 TA steroids in these sediments, which originated from C-28 sterols, may be primarily derived from an ecological competitor of dinoflagellates. We propose that their competitors are possibly coccolithophorids and/or prasinophyte algae. During the mid-Cretaceous hothouse period, coccolithophorids/prasinophytes had the potential to flourish under more oligotrophic conditions, whereas dinoflagellates were dominant as primary producers under eutrophic conditions.

AB  - Clay-bearing rocks exhibit a broad range of disintegration behaviors, with second-cycle slake durability index values from 0 percent for some claystones to nearly 100 percent for some siltstones. This variability comes from their geologic makeup, especially clay content, clay mineral composition, and related index properties. To investigate the influence of geologic and index properties on disintegration behavior under natural climatic conditions, 12 replicate samples of each of 20 clay-bearing rocks (five claystones, five mudstones, five siltstones, and five shales) were exposed to natural conditions for 12 months. After each month, one replicate sample of each rock was tested for grain size distribution. Disintegration ratio (DR), the ratio of the area under the grain size distribution curve of slaked material for a given rock to the total area encompassing all grain size distribution curves of the tested samples, was used to quantify the amount of disintegration. Additionally, clay mineralogy, natural water content, dry density, void ratio, absorption, adsorption, Atterberg limits, and slake durability index were determined. Clay mineralogy and index properties were correlated with DR values after 1, 6, and 12 months of exposure. Results show that clay content, percentage of expandable clay minerals, plasticity index, adsorption, and slake durability index are better indicators of short-term disintegration behavior, whereas expandable clay mineral content and absorption influence long-term be havior. Regression models suggest that short-term disintegration behavior can be predicted more accurately than long-term behavior, as indicated by decreasing R-2 values for samples exposed for 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively.

AB  - Specific oxygen uptake rate, q(o2), on Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 cultures has been measured under different fluid dynamic conditions in a STBR, changing stirrer speed, between 100 and 700 rpm, and air flow rate, between 1 and 10 L min(-1). Experimental results indicate that q(o2) values for R. erythropolis cultures can be influenced by the fluid dynamics inside the bioreactor. Under non oxygen limited conditions, the oxygen consumption rate by the cells does not depend on the oxygen transfer rate; hence, the specific oxygen uptake rate is constant. However, when the stirrer speed is increased over a limit value, around 450 rpm in the culture studied, a change is clearly detected and, as higher stirrer speeds are used, specific oxygen uptake rate suffers a significant decrease. Nevertheless, when the hydrodynamics are varied changing the air flow rate, between 1 and 10 L min (1), this variable does not affect the oxygen uptake rate. According to these results, specific oxygen uptake rate measurement provides a good indication of whole stress generated by the hydrodynamic conditions into the bioreactor. A simple method to determine changes into the cell response due to the fluid dynamic environment in the bioreactor is heroin proposed. According to this method, shear effects on the culture can be detected by the change on specific oxygen uptake rate measured at laboratory scale, employing the usual gas in-gas out dynamic method. This assay combines oxygen transfer, oxygen uptake rate and possible cell damage in a one simple method that can considerably simplify and accelerate fundamental research On the development and scale-up of bioprocesses.

AB  - A comprehensive multi-proxy study of mini-core Ash-2009-08 from the inner shelf of the northeastern Black Sea, allowed us to define recent environmental changes in the area, on a sub-decadal resolution. The age model of the core based on radionuclide (Pb-210 and Cs-137) measurements suggests an average sedimentation rate of 2 mm/y and, consequently, a sedimentary record spanning the last similar to 140 years. Overall, four fossil groups studied from the core indicate subtle environmental changes. The dinocyst assemblages show stable surface water conditions with a possible cooling in the 1930s-1950s and a slight decline in salinity from the 1960s, which corresponds to an increase in precipitation and the fresh water balance of the Black Sea, known from the published instrumental data. A gradually increasing abundance of the heterotroph species suggests a nutrient increase from the 1920s. Ostracods and molluscs demonstrate rather stable bottom-water salinity and biotopes over the last similar to 75 years. Changes in abundance of ostracods and benthic foraminifers, as well as changes in the mollusc diversity, most likely reflect variations in trophic conditions with the higher food supply to the sea floor in the 1940s-1960s and from the late 1990s. Enhanced bottom-water energy is inferred from the mollusc enrichment and a relatively high content of the fine sand grain-size fraction in the 1990s. In the pollen assemblages, trees mainly represented by Pinus strongly prevail over herbs throughout the record. However, the trees to herbs ratio demonstrates a slight decline from the 1920s, most likely resulting from human impact on the vegetation of the nearby land. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - The practical aim of this study was to estimate biomass in two subregions, inshore (<60 m depth) and offshore (>60 m), for application to rock lobster management. To account for lobster movement between these subregions, movement estimation was integrated into the length-structured stock assessment model. Tagged lobsters were released inshore and offshore in the mid-1990s. For fitting to these conventional single tag-recoveries, a recapture-conditioned movement rate estimation method was adapted and integrated into the assessment model. The individually-tailored probabilities of survival during time-at-large and of subsequent capture in each subregion needed to estimate movement rates are provided by the over-arching stock assessment estimator. Calculating a probability specific for each lobster recapture permits the estimator to account for naturally varying times and locations of tag release and recapture. Seasonality of tagged lobster movements indicated that inshore-to-offshore migration occurred predominantly in winter. Yearly movement rates of lobsters were relatively low. Biomass was approximately 3-4 times higher inshore than offshore. Testing using simulated data confirmed the accuracy of model-integrated recapture-conditioned movement estimates. Using these same simulated data, conventional movement rate estimates, calculated as raw proportions of recaptured lobsters that moved, were positively biased. Incorporating survival and recovery rates in movement estimation can thus substantially improve the accuracy of movement, and thus biomass, estimates in spatially-resolved stock assessments.

AB  - Unplanned logging is one of the greatest current threats to native forests biodiversity. About 90% of the pied-mont forest in the Southern Andean Yungas has been converted to other land-use types and the remaining forests fragments are being intensively logged without management plans. Bird species, especially understory birds, are good indicators of forest diversity and integrity. The aim of this study was to identify understory bird species associated with changes in the forest structure caused by selective logging and to explore whether it is possible to use these species as a monitoring tool. We observed that Sittasomus griseicapillus, Turdus rufiventris, Lepidocolaptes angustirostris, Casiornis rufus, Thraupis sayaca, and Tolmomyias sulphurescens were associated to unlogged sites with higher density of timber-yielding and standing dead trees. Thamnophilus caerulescens, Leptotila megalura, Synallaxis scutata, Poecilotriccus plumbeiceps, and Catharus ustulatus were favoured by logging activities and associated with understory visual obstruction. Mean cut-off abundance thresholds were 2.74 ind/ha for the avian guild associated with unlogged forest and 1.79 ind/ha for the guild associated with logged forest. Sustainable forest management schemes need to retain the understory visual obstruction at values similar to those of unlogged forest (43.75%), together with an adequate density (>= 10 ind/ha) of standing dead trees with at least 19.5 cm in DBH, and a minimum of 210 ind/ha of timber tree species. Bird species identified in this study can be used in monitoring schemes to evaluate the implementation of these guidelines.

AB  - Ocean acidification is a threat to the net growth of tropical and deep-sea coral reefs, due to gradual changes in the balance between reef growth and loss processes. Here we go beyond identification of coral dissolution induced by ocean acidification and identify a mechanism that will lead to a loss of habitat in cold-water coral reef habitats on an ecosystem-scale. To quantify this, we present in situ and year-long laboratory evidence detailing the type of habitat shift that can be expected (in situ evidence), the mechanisms underlying this (in situ and laboratory evidence), and the timescale within which the process begins (laboratory evidence). Through application of engineering principals, we detail how increased porosity in structurally critical sections of coral framework will lead to crumbling of load-bearing material, and a potential collapse and loss of complexity of the larger habitat. Importantly, in situ evidence highlights that cold-water corals can survive beneath the aragonite saturation horizon, but in a fundamentally different way to what is currently considered a biogenic cold-water coral reef, with a loss of the majority of reef habitat. The shift from a habitat with high 3-dimensional complexity provided by both live and dead coral framework, to a habitat restricted primarily to live coral colonies with lower 3-dimensional complexity represents the main threat to cold-water coral reefs of the future and the biodiversity they support. Ocean acidification can cause ecosystem-scale habitat loss for the majority of cold-water coral reefs.

AB  - Mountaintop removal/valley fill (MTR/VF) mining in the central Appalachians is a major driver of landscape change within terrestrial ecosystems.
   We quantified avian community and individual taxa thresholds in response to changing landscapes from MTR/VF using a Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis approach.
   We conducted 50-m fixed radius avian surveys (n = 707) within forest adjacent to mine lands in 2012-2013 and obtained data for additional surveys (n = 905) sampled using comparable methods during 2008-2013. We quantified positive and negative community, habitat guild, and species thresholds in abundance and occurrence for each of five landscape metrics within a 1-km radius of each survey point.
   Reclaimed mine-dominated landscapes (less forest and more grassland/shrubland cover) elicited more negative (57 %) than positive (39 %) species responses. Negative thresholds for each landscape metric generally occurred at lower values than positive thresholds, thus negatively responding species were detrimentally affected before positively responding species benefitted. Forest interior birds generally responded negatively to landscape metric thresholds, interior edge species responses were mixed, and early successional birds responded positively. The forest interior guild declined most at 4 % forest loss, while the shrubland guild increased greatest after 52 % loss. Based on random forest importance ranks, total amount of landscape grassland/shrubland had the most influence, although this varied by guild.
   Because of little overlap in habitat requirements, managing landscapes simultaneously to maximally benefit both guilds may not be possible. Our avian thresholds identify single community management targets accounting for scarce species. Guild or individual species thresholds allow for species-specific management.

AB  - Biomonitoring with living organisms is most often used in order to gather quick information about environmental quality - for example the level of heavy metals polluting the air. Experiments are not often performed when the bioindicator is exposed to pollutants over the long time (6 months and more) because this period required to obtain credible results and the risk not yet studied of physiological changes and of degeneration of the living material which would undoubtedly affect the biomonitoring results. The aim of study was to evaluate the physiological condition of Pleurozium schreberi moss species subjected to continuous exposure for a year, using the moss-bag method, under variable environmental conditions, including atmospheric aerosol contaminated by selected analytes: Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg, Pb determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometer. AMA apparatus was used to measure mercury. The survival of the moss during exposure was assessed based on the measurement of chlorophyll content. As a result of the research, it was found that the concentrations of metals in mosses increased depending on the exposure time and the certain element. It was also found that mosses, despite the long period of exposure to environmental factors and the decreasing content of chlorophyll, still revealed the features of a living organism during the study and can be used in long-term biomonitoring of the environment. It was also proposed to correct the period and duration of P. schreberi exposure to air pollution in relation to the previous literature and recommend the period of 3-6 months.

AB  - Ski tourism plays a major socio-economic role in the snowy and mountainous areas of Europe such as the Alps, the Pyrenees, Nordic Europe, Eastern Europe, Anatolia, etc. Past and future climate change has an impact on the operating conditions of ski resorts, due to their reliance on natural snowfall and favorable conditions for snowmaking. However, there is currently a lack of assessment of past and future operating conditions of ski resorts at the pan-European scale in the context of climate change. The presented work aims at filling this gap, as part of the "European Tourism" Sectoral Information System (SIS) of the Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S). The Mountain Tourism Meteorological and Snow Indicators (MTMSI) were co-designed with representatives of the ski tourism industry, including consulting companies. They were derived from statistically adjusted EURO-CORDEX climate projections (multiple GCM/RCM pairs for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) using the UERRA 5.5 km resolution surface reanalysis as a reference, used as input to the snow cover model Crocus, with and without accounting for snow management (grooming, snowmaking). Results are generated for 100 m elevation bands for NUTS-3 geographical areas spanning all areas relevant to ski tourism in Europe. This article introduces the underpinning elements for the generation of this product, and illustrates results at the pan-European scale as well as for smaller scale case studies. A dedicated visualization app allows for easy navigation into the multiple dimensions of this dataset, thereby fulfilling the needs of a broad range of users.

AB  - Metal casting industry including is an industry which produce high dust pollution (fly ash). Improvements in the form of ergonomic interventions have been carried out by many companies, but do not guarantee all parameters run well. The total indoor suspended dust (TSP) measurement results are not enough to guarantee healthy working conditions. Additional assessment of workers' inhaled dust is needed to change pollution control and work improvement to ergonomics. The design of this study is Cross Sectional Study. Research subjects numbered 84 people. All samples met the inclusion criteria. Measurement results of Characteristic of research subject, Working Environment Conditions, Exposition of dust inhaled by workers, Total Indoor Suspended Dust of the Company (p > 0.05). Found critical hours of workers exposed to dust (fly ash), starting from 4 h after working (Department of Process Cement, Department of Black Sand) and 2 h after working for the Department of Loam. Critical hours exposed to dust (fly ash) used as the basis for company management and regulators to take new policies in controlling fly ash pollution and ergonomic interventions. Ergonomic interventions can be carried out by activating the dust collector at critical hours, applying active resting hours at critical hours and conditioning workers to breathe fresh air. The impact of this ergonomic intervention is a decrease in musculoskeletal complaints by 25.27%, reduction in boredom 25.01%, and an increase in job satisfaction 38.46%.

AB  - Tors represent one of the most characteristic landforms in the uplands and mountains of Central Europe, including the Sudetes, Czech-Moravian Highlands, tumava/Bayerischer Wald, Fichtel-gebirge or Harz. These features occur in a range of lithologies, although granites and gneisses are particularly prone to tor formation. Various models of tor formation and development have been presented, and for each model the tors were thought to have evolved under specific environmental conditions. The two most common theories emphasised their progressive emergence from pre-Quaternary weathering mantles in a two-stage scenario, and their development across slopes under periglacial conditions in a one-stage scenario. More recently, tors have been analysed in relation to ice sheet extent, the selectivity of glacial erosion, and the preservation of landforms under ice. In this paper we describe for distribution across Central Europe along with hypotheses relating to their formation and development, arguing that specific evolutionary histories are not supported by unequivocal evidence and that the scenarios presented were invariably model-driven. Several examples from the Sudetes are presented to demonstrate that tor morphology is strongly controlled by lithology and structure. The juxtaposition of tors of different types is not necessarily evidence that they differ in their mode of origin or age. Pathways of tor remodelling and degradation under subaerial conditions are identified and it is argued that processes of tor formation and development are ongoing. Thus, tors are not reliable indicators of past environments, because they are considerably influenced by both geological factors, such as lithology and structure, and geomorphological factors such as hillslope setting.

AB  - This paper presents relatively high-resolution geochemical records spanning the past 4000 cal yr BP obtained from the lacustrine sediments of Poyang Lake in central China. The variations in the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) are traced using the K/Na, Ti/Na, Al/K, kaolinite/illite and clay/feldspar ratios, together with the chemical index of alteration (CIA), as indicators of chemical weathering. During the last 4000 years, the proxy records of chemical weathering from Poyang Lake exhibit an overall enhanced trend, consistent with regional hydrological changes in previous independent records. Further comparisons and analyses demonstrate that regional moisture variations in central China is inversely correlated with the EASM intensity, with weak EASM generating high precipitation in central China. Our data reveal three intervals of dramatically dry climatic conditions (i.e., ca. 4000-3200 cal yr BP, ca. 2800-2400 cal yr BP, and ca. 500-200 cal yr BP). A period of weak chemical weathering, related to cold and dry climatic conditions, occurred during the Little Ice Age (LIA), whereas more intense chemical weathering, reflecting warm and humid climatic conditions, was recorded during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Besides, an intensification of chemical weathering in Poyang Lake during the late Holocene agrees well with strong ENSO activity, suggesting that moisture variations in central China may be predominantly driven by ENSO variability.

AB  - This study was to investigate the potential enhancing effect of heat stress on mental fatigue progression during sustained attention task using arterial spin labeling (ASL) imaging. Twenty participants under-Went two thermal exposures in an environmental chamber: normothermic (NT)-condition (25 degrees C, 1 h) and hyperthermic (HT) condition (50 degrees C, 1 h). After thermal exposure, they performed a twenty-minute psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) in the scanner. Behavioral analysis revealed progressively increasing subjective fatigue ratings and reaction time as PVT progressed. Moreover, heat stress caused worse performance. Perfusion imaging analyses showed significant resting-state cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations after heat exposure. Specifically, increased CBF mainly gathered in thalamic-brainstem area while decreased CBF predominantly located in fronto-parietal areas, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and medial frontal cortex. More importantly, diverse CBF distributions and trend of changes between both conditions were observed as the fatigue level progressed during subsequent PVT task. Specifically, higher CBF and enhanced rising trend were presented in superior parietal lobe, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, while lower CBF or inhibited rising trend was found in dorsolateral frontal cortex, medial frontal cortex, inferior parietal lobe and thalamic-brainstem areas. Furthermore, the decrease of post-heat resting-state CBF in fronto-parietal cortex was correlated with subsequent slower reaction time, suggesting prior disturbed resting-state CBF might be indicator of performance potential and fatigue level in following task. These findings may provide proof for such a view: heat stress has a potential fatigue-enhancing effect when individual is performing highly cognition-demanding attention task. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The recent development of genetically modified sugarcane, with the aim of commercial production, requires an understanding of the potential risks of increased weediness of sugarcane as a result of spread and persistence of volunteer sugarcane. As sugarcane is propagated vegetatively from pieces of stalk and the seed plays no part in the production cycle, the fate of seed in the environment is yet to be studied. In this study, sugarcane seed samples, collected in fields over a 2-year period, were used to determine the overall level of sugarcane fertility, seed dormancy, and longevity of seed under field conditions. A survey of the soil seed bank in and around sugarcane fields was used to quantify the presence of sugarcane seeds and to identify and quantify the weeds that would compete with sugarcane seedlings. We demonstrated that under field conditions, sugarcane has low fertility and produces non-dormant seed. The viability of the seeds decayed rapidly (half-life between 1.5 and 2.1 months). This means that, in Australia, sugarcane seeds die before they encounter climatic conditions that could allow them to germinate and establish. Finally, the soil seed bank analysis revealed that there were very few sugarcane seeds relative to the large number of weed seeds that exert a large competitive effect. In conclusion, low fertility, short persistence, and poor ability to compete limit the capacity of sugarcane seed spread and persistence in the environment.

AB  - Aquatic fauna provide an important subsidy to terrestrial consumers. In the wet-dry tropics, important subsidies from rivers to riparian-zone consumers are expected in the dry season but may vary depending on riparian zone condition. We investigated the potential subsidy of aquatic fauna to consumers in riparian zones in 2 highly seasonal rivers in Australia's wet-dry tropics. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of invertebrate predators in riparian zones were closely aligned with aquatic invertebrates and emergent adult insects. Further, a considerable proportion (40-50%) of the observed vertebrate fauna in riparian zones were consumers of aquatic fauna, which included fish, crustaceans, invertebrates, and flying adult insects with aquatic larval stages. For hydrologically disconnected waterbodies, estimates of potential insect emergence and the proportion of vertebrate species (in riparian zones) that consume these insects both increased as indicators of riparian plant regeneration and condition improved. Our findings suggest that aquatic fauna provide important subsidies to terrestrial-zone consumers (both invertebrates and vertebrates) during the dry season, and that these transfers can be moderated by riparian zone condition. The wide home and foraging ranges of some consumers also suggest that the importance of these subsidies may extend far beyond the waterbody of origin. Human activities and climate-driven alteration of flow regimes and riparian zones that reduce the availability of dry-season waterbodies or degrade their riparian zones are likely to have negative impacts on aquatic-terrestrial linkages in these systems.

AB  - Coumarins are a large group of natural substances with diverse pharmacological properties that may predetermine some of them for the prevention and/or treatment of cardiovascular diseases and also other pathologies. Free iron participates in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, chelation of iron may attenuate some ROS consequences, but on the other hand, reduction of ferric ions to ferrous ones is unfavourable and leads to intensification of ROS production. In this study, we have examined the interaction of iron with coumarins which has been rarely analyzed.
   A series of naturally occurring and chemically synthesized 4-methylcoumarins were analyzed for their ferrous and total iron-chelating properties and compared with standard iron chelator deferoxamine. The iron chelation activity was assessed by a simple spectrophotometric approach based on the specific indicator for ferrous ions - ferrozine. The methodology was also extended for the measurement of total iron.
   Among the tested coumarins, ortho-dihydroxyderivatives were the most potent iron chelators and 7,8-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin even reached the efficiency of deferoxamine in neutral pH. However, these ortho-dihydroxycoumarins did not bind iron firmly in acidic conditions (e.g., in acute myocardial infarction) and, moreover, they reduced ferric ions that could lead to intensification of the Fenton chemistry. Other tested coumarins did not substantially chelate iron with the exception of ortho-diacetoxycoumarins.
   Conclusively, the use of iron-chelating coumarins in acidic conditions may be disadvantageous in contrast to neutral conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Inbreeding and the loss of genetic diversity are known to be significant threats to small, isolated populations. Hymenoptera represent a special case regarding the impact of inbreeding. Haplodiploidy may permit purging of deleterious recessive alleles in haploid males, meaning inbreeding depression is reduced relative to diploid species. In contrast, the impact of inbreeding may be exacerbated in Hymenopteran species that have a single-locus complementary sex determination system, due to the production of sterile or inviable diploid males. We investigated the costs of brother-sister mating in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We compared inbred colonies that produced diploid males and inbred colonies that did not produce diploid males with outbred colonies. Mating, hibernation and colony founding took place in the laboratory. Once colonies had produced 15 offspring they were placed in the field and left to forage under natural conditions.
   Results: The diploid male colonies had a significantly reduced fitness compared to regular inbred and outbred colonies; they had slower growth rates in the laboratory, survived for a shorter time period under field conditions and produced significantly fewer offspring overall. No differences in success were found between non-diploid male inbred colonies and outbred colonies.
   Conclusion: Our data illustrate that inbreeding exacts a considerable cost in Bombus terrestris through the production of diploid males. We suggest that diploid males may act as indicators of the genetic health of populations, and that their detection could be used as an informative tool in hymenopteran conservation. We conclude that whilst haplodiploids may suffer less inbreeding depression than diploid species, they are still highly vulnerable to population fragmentation and reduced genetic diversity due to the extreme costs imposed by the production of diploid males.

AB  - Land consolidation (LC) is a tool for improving the effectiveness of land cultivation and for supporting rural development. In the Czech Republic it is, in addition, used to remedy the damages and wrongs caused by 40 years of suppression of land ownership. This paper investigates the specific conditions and various outcomes of LC in three study areas, focusing on the evaluation criteria of land ownership and plot arrangement before and after LC. The three study areas contain contrasting observed features, and they therefore provide a good illustration of a whole range of factors that can affect the rate of LC. The author designed LC projects in each of the study areas between 1994 and 2003, and defined two sets of criteria for ex ante and ex post evaluation based on size, shape and juxtaposition of the plots, on the natural and social conditions, and on the economic benefits and advantages of LC for the landowners. The relationship between the ex ante criteria and the three LC indicators was analyzed using a multiple regression approach. The results show that the initial conditions had a strong effect on the outcomes of the LC programmes. Defining the criteria and the models for the Czech Republic will help to improve the methodological principles underlying LC projects, and it will also support the decision-making processes of the LC authorities in order to optimize the allocation of limited funds.

AB  - Alpine pastures are characterized by considerable spatial variation in the species richness and species composition of the vegetation. This paper examines how agricultural management and site factors influence the diversity of pasture vegetation in the north-eastern Swiss Alps, based on a survey of vegetation and soils in a total of 200 plots (1 m(2)) on ten Alpine farms. The mean number of vascular plant species per plot differed significantly among farms (between 3 and 32 species m(-2)); it was strongly correlated with the total number of species per farm (r = 0.85), and both were negatively correlated with the farm area but unrelated to pasture use. The species number per m2 was negatively correlated to the phosphorus content of the soil and positively correlated to soil pH, whereas its relationship with the N- and C-content of the soil and with the average nutrient indicator value of the vegetation was unimodal. The "potential species richness" (maximum number per m(2)) and the calculated "species pool" (total number per 20 plots) showed similar types of relationships with site conditions. Out of the 164 plant species recorded in the survey, five were most common in species-poor plots, while 36 were most common in species rich plots. Overall, large variations in plot data resulted in a weak relationship between species richness, soil conditions and management. This may be due to the fact that multiple factors simultaneously influence the vegetation on Alpine pastures; these factors are partly interdependent and their effects on species richness may interact with each other.

AB  - Organic N mineralization can regulate the bioavailability of N in wetland soils and be controlled by the availability of inorganic electron accepters. During the past 40 yr, the northern Everglades has been affected by nutrient loading as a consequence of the diversion of surface water runoff from agricultural lands. The greatest hydraulic loading occurs in the summer season when precipitation is highest. Fluctuations in water levels and loading of alternate electron accepters (NO3- and SO42-) could result in variable N turnover rates. The effect of aerobic, NO3- reducing, SO42- reducing, and methanogenic conditions on potential organic N mineralization rate was investigated. Soil st 0- to 10- and 10- to 30-cm depths and overlying plant detritus were collected from eight stations along a 10-km eutrophic gradient in the northern Everglades, Florida. Selected soil characteristics including microbial biomass C and N (MBC and MEN), total P, and extractable NH4+: were measured, Significantly (P < 0.05) higher rates of N mineralization were observed in the detritus, lower rates in the 0- to 10-cm depth, and lowest rates in the 10- to 30-cm depth under each of aerobic NO3- reducing, SO42- reducing, and methanogenic renditions, Organic N mineralization rates decreased sequentially from aerobic to NO3- and SO42- reducing conditions to methanogenic conditions. Total P, MBC, and MBN were all significantly correlated (P < 0.05) to the N mineralization rates under dominance of each electron acceptor. Of all the measured soil characteristics, extractable NH; was the most strongly correlated (P < 0.01; r = 0.62-0.92) indicator of potential N mineralization rates. Results of this research have important implications for the biogeochemical cycling of N and ecosystem productivity in wetland systems.

AB  - Climate change is impacting the abundance and distribution of marine resources. The consequences of these impacts are likely to alter trophic interactions between species within an ecosystem and affect fisheries opportunities for coastal communities. Market squid Doryteuthis opalescens comprise the largest fishery (by volume) in California, USA, and questions persist about whether the changing ocean conditions are leading to an increase in squid abundance in traditional fishing locations as well as marginal habitats in northern areas. To examine this potential phenomenon, we used fisheries-independent survey data collected by the National Marine Fisheries Service between 1998 and 2019 to develop a spatiotemporal model that estimates changes in the squid density from central California to northern Washington. We found a fivefold increase in the squid index of abundance across the entire spatial domain of the surveys during the sampling period, with the largest increases occurring in the Oregon and Washington strata. Although our model demonstrated that encounter rates and squid densities for the surveys increased in warmer and more saline waters, large shifts in squid distribution were only associated with deviations in ocean temperatures that could be characterized as marine heatwaves. This analysis adds to a growing body of work documenting the spatiotemporal response of marine resources to both long-term trends in warming ocean conditions and episodic events, such as marine heatwaves. Furthermore, it demonstrates the need for ecosystem assessment models with the ability to forecast changes in species distribution and abundance at spatiotemporal scales that are relevant for coastal fishing communities.

AB  - Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a commercially and recreationally important species that has declined by > 80% across the Illinois River basin since the 1960s, suggesting impairment of population-level reproduction. Numerous controlled experiments have shown common carp reproductive physiology is susceptible to endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure at levels commonly associated with the urban and agricultural reaches of this large river. The aim of our study was to investigate spatial patterns of potential physiological and reproductive impairment in common carp related to basin-scale differences in land use. There were complex sex-specific differences in the spatial patterns of several biomarkers we examined from common carp in the Illinois River, suggesting common carp may be exhibiting physiological effects related to EDCs and other contaminants. Biomarkers in female common carp showed little spatial variation along the Illinois River, whereas multiple biomarkers in male common carp indicated a spatially variable response. However, the low prevalence of intersex condition in male common carp contrasts with centrarchid species from the same system, perhaps because of differences in trophic position, habitat use, or physiology. This same low prevalence of intersex may preclude the utility of blood plasma vitellogenin as a nonlethal indicator of intersex in male common carp. Ultimately, despite the evidence of intersex in largemouth bass and black crappie from the Illinois River, we conclude that it is unlikely that EDC exposure leading to intersex condition is contributing to the declining common carp population in this river.

AB  - Elephant camps are among the most popular destinations in Thailand for tourists from many countries. A wide range of management strategies are used by these camps, which can have varied impacts on health and welfare of elephants. The objectives of this study were to examine relationships between FGM (fecal glucocorticoid metabolite) concentrations and camp management factors (work routine, walking, restraint, rest area, foraging), and to other welfare indicators (stereotypic behaviors, body condition, foot health, and skin wounds). Data were obtained on 84 elephants (18 males and 66 females) from 15 elephant camps over a 1-year period. Elephants were examined every 3 months and assigned a body condition score, foot score, and wound score. Fecal samples were collected twice monthly for FGM analysis. Contrary to some beliefs, elephants in the observation only program where mahouts did not carry an ankus for protection had higher FGM concentrations compared to those at camps that offered riding with a saddle and shows. Elephants that were tethered in the forest at night had lower FGM concentrations compared to elephants that were kept in open areas inside the camps. There was an inverse relationship between FGM concentrations and occurrence of stereotypy, which was not anticipated. Thus, assessing adrenal activity via monitoring of FGM concentrations can provide important information on factors affecting the well-being of elephants. Results suggest that more naturalistic housing conditions and providing opportunities to exercise may be good for elephants under human care in Thailand, and that a no riding, no hook policy does not necessarily guarantee good welfare.

AB  - Premise of the Study Thinning is a frequent disturbance in managed forests, especially to increase radial growth. Due to buckling and bending risk associated with height and mass growth, tree verticality is strongly constrained in slender trees growing in dense forests and poor light conditions. Tree verticality is controlled by uprighting movements implemented from local curvatures induced by wood maturation stresses and/or eccentric radial growth. This study presents the first attempt to compare the real uprighting movements in mature trees using a theoretical model of posture control. Methods Stem lean and curvature were measured by Terrestrial LiDAR Scanner (TLS) technology before and 6 years after thinning and compared to unthinned control poles. Measures for several tree and wood traits were pooled together to implement a widely used biomechanical model of tree posture control. Changes in observed stem lean were then compared with the model predictions, and discrepancies were reviewed. Key Results Even under a highly constrained environment, most control poles were able to counterbalance gravitational curvature and avoid sagging. Thinning stimulated uprighting movements. The theoretical uprighting curvature rate increased just after thinning, then slowed after 2 years, likely due to the stem diameter increase. The biomechanical model overestimated the magnitude of uprighting. Conclusions Most suppressed beech poles maintain a constant lean angle, and uprighting movements occur after thinning, indicating that stem lean is plastic in response to light conditions. Acclimation of posture control to other changes in growth condition should be investigated, and lean angles should be measured in forest inventories as an indicator of future wood quality.

AB  - Numerous drought indices have been developed to analyze and monitor drought condition, but they are region specific and limited by various climatic conditions. In southwest China, summer drought mainly occurs from June to September, causing destructive and profound impact on agriculture, society, and ecosystems. The current study assesses the availability of meteorological drought indices in monitoring summer drought in this area at 5-day scale. The drought indices include the relative moisture index (M), the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the composite index of meteorological drought (CIspi), and the improved composite index of meteorological drought (CIwap). Long-term daily precipitation and temperature from 1970 to 2014 are used to calculate 30-day M (M (30)), SPI (SPI30), SPEI (SPEI30), 90-day SPEI (SPEI90), CIspi, and CIwap. The 5-day soil moisture observations from 2010 to 2013 are applied to assess the performance of these drought indices. Correlation analysis, overall accuracy, and kappa coefficient are utilized to investigate the relationships between soil moisture and drought indices. Correlation analysis indicates that soil moisture is well correlated with CIwap, SPEI30, M (30), SPI30, and CIspi except SPEI90. Moreover, drought classifications identified by M (30) are in agreement with that of the observed soil moisture. The results show that M (30) based on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration is an appropriate indicator for monitoring drought condition at a finer scale in the study area. According to M (30), summer drought during 1970-2014 happened in each year and showed a slightly upward tendency in recent years.

   The delta C-13(org) values of the Chia Gara rocks range from -29.99 parts per thousand to 26.93 parts per thousand, with average values of approximately -28.8 parts per thousand, indicating that the organic matter has a predominantly marine origin. Enhanced biological productivity within the photic zone of the water column during deposition of the Chia Gara Fm. is indicated by consistently high organic carbon content in most samples (average 3 wt. %), as well as by bulk geochemical and biomarker characteristics. Major contributions by aquatic algae and microorganisms with a minor terrigenous organic matter contribution are indicated by the n-alkane distribution patterns and the composition of the hopanoids, steroids, and tricyclic terpenoids. Strongly reducing bottom water is indicated by low pristane/phytane ratios, homohopane distribution patterns, and the redox-sensitive trace elements geochemistry. Salinity stratification with alkaline bottom waters is indicated by high Sr/Ba ratios and the presence of gammacerane in the analysed Chia Gara samples. These data indicate that OM enrichment in the Tithonian Berriasian Chia Gara rocks results from the combination of enhanced biological productivity and salinity stratification with anoxic bottom water conditions, which favoured OM preservation.

AB  - Anthropogenic-derived stressors represent an ever-increasing risk to organisms worldwide. To understand the effects of stressors on organisms, many studies measure an organism's oxidative status. American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) are long-lived, top trophic carnivores that have been suggested to serve as an indicator of environmental quality. Raised tail scutes on crocodilians are often marked to enable easy subsequent identifications. Recent studies have illustrated scutes can also serve as indicators of stress or toxicant exposure. In this study, we investigated another role of scutes: as potential non-destructive (i.e., not requiring euthanasia to obtain) indicators of oxidative status. Three antioxidant enzymes, superoxide-dismutase (SOD)-1, SOD2, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), were measured in non-destructible (i.e., tail scutes) and destructible tissues using Western blot. Enzyme levels were then compared with body condition and health using principal component analysis (PCA). Linear mixed models revealed that tissue had a significant effect on relative enzyme level (all P < 0.05). PCAs revealed significant groupings (eigenvalues > 1) of both tail scutes and destructible tissues. Levels of GPX1 in tail scutes were positively related with body condition and organ mass. Our results suggest antioxidant enzyme levels in alligator tail scutes may serve as important, non-destructive indicators of internal organ and whole-body oxidative status. In addition, tail scute antioxidants may also provide insight into alligator body condition and health. Future studies involving captive or wild individuals should incorporate measuring tail scute antioxidant enzyme levels, along with more traditional stress parameters, to better understand how stressors affect crocodilians.

AB  - The taxonomic structure of microbial communities in the Late Pleistocene paleosols of different ages in the Central Russian Upland formed under contrasting climatic conditions were analyzed. The humic horizons of paleosols in the interstadial periods of the Early Valdai (105-95 kyr ago), Middle Valdai (33-24 kyr ago), Mikulino interglacial (130-117 kyr ago), and of the modern (Holocene) chernozem were considered. Microbial DNA was analyzed using quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (DNA metabarcoding). The numbers of copies of archaeal, bacterial, and fungal genes gradually decreased with an increase in the soil age. All considered paleosols significantly differed from one another in the structure of their microbial communities. The Verrucomicrobia-to-Nitrospirae ratio was used as a diagnostic parameter reflecting the organic matter supply and the changes in carbon and nitrogen cycles. The Verrucomicrobia-to-Nitrospirae ratio in the interstadial soils was 140-200 times lower as compared with that in the modern soil (typical chernozem) and in the paleosols of the Mikulino interglacial. The share of gram-negative Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria increased with the soil age, whereas the share of gram-positive Actinobacteria and Firmicutes decreased. The modern chernozems and interglacial paleosols were characterized by similar values of microbial diversity, while the paleosols of the Valdai interstadial had significantly lower microbial diversity and species richness. Analysis of beta-diversity showed that the paleosols of different types and ages maintained the difference in the structure and diversity of their microbial communities depending on the conditions of their formation. Thus, the microbial communities can be used as potential stratigraphic markers and indicators of different climatic conditions, under which the given paleosols were formed.

AB  - The high concentration of fructose in agave juice has been associated with reduced ethanol tolerance of commercial yeasts used for tequila production and low fermentation yields. The selection of autochthonous strains, which are better adapted to agave juice, could improve the process. In this study, a 2-step selection process of yeasts isolated from spontaneous fermentations for tequila production was carried out based on analysis of the growth dynamics in combined conditions of high fructose and ethanol. First, yeast isolates (605) were screened to identify strains tolerant to high fructose (20%) and to ethanol (10%), yielding 89 isolates able to grow in both conditions. From the 89 isolates, the growth curves under 8 treatments of combined fructose (from 20% to 5%) and ethanol (from 0% to 10%) were obtained, and the kinetic parameters were analyzed with principal component analysis and k-means clustering. The resulting yeast strain groups corresponded to the fast, medium and slow growers. A second clustering of only the fast growers led to the selection of 3 Saccharomyces strains (199, 230, 231) that were able to grow rapidly in 4 out of the 8 conditions evaluated. This methodology differentiated strains phenotypically and could be further used for strain selection in other processes.
   Practical ApplicationA method to select yeast strains for fermentation taking into account the natural differences of yeast isolates. This methodology is based on the cell exposition to combinations of sugar and ethanol, which are the most important stress factors in fermentation. This strategy will help to identify the most tolerant strain that could improve ethanol yield and reduce fermentation time.

AB  - How animals respond to varying environmental conditions is fundamental to ecology and is a question that has gained impetus due to mounting evidence indicating negative effects of global change on biodiversity. Behavioural plasticity is one mechanism that enables individuals and species to deal with environmental changes, yet for many taxa information on behavioural parameters and their capacity to change are lacking or restricted to certain periods within the annual cycle. This is particularly true for seabirds where year-round behavioural information is intrinsically challenging to acquire due to their reliance on the marine environment where they are difficult to study. Using data from over 13,000 foraging trips throughout the annual cycle, acquired using new-generation automated VHF technology, we described sex-specific, year-round activity budgets in Cape gannets. Using these data we investigated the role of weather (wind and rain) on foraging activity and time allocated to nest attendance. Foraging activity was clearly influenced by wind speed, wind direction and rainfall during and outside the breeding season. Generally, strong wind conditions throughout the year resulted in relatively short foraging trips. Birds spent longer periods foraging when rainfall was moderate. Nest attendance, which was sex-specific outside of the breeding season, was also influenced by meteorological conditions. Large amounts of rainfall (> 2.5 mm per hour) and strong winds (> 13 m s(-1)) resulted in gannets spending shorter amounts of time at their nests. We discuss these findings in terms of life history strategies and implications for the use of seabirds as bio-indicators.

AB  - Shifting to renewable energy is an important global challenge, and there are many technologies available to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Seawater air conditioning (SWAG) is a renewable ocean thermal energy technology that will soon be implemented in Honolulu, Hawaii, on the island of Oahu. The SWAC system will operate by using cool water from 500 m depth in a heat exchange system and then will release this nutrient-rich water back into the ocean at a shallower depth of 100-140 m. The introduction of a plume of warmed. (but still relatively cool) deep seawater has unknown impacts on the tropical marine environment. Possible impacts include increases in primary production, changes in water chemistry and turbidity, and changes in the local food web. We used moored instruments and shipboard profiling to describe oceanographic parameters at the future SWAC effluent site. Parameters varied with the M2 internal tide, and denser water was correlated with higher nitrate, lower oxygen, and lower chlorophyll a (correlation coefficients 0.55, -0.58, and -0.75, respectively). The nitrate concentrations in the plume will be >30.0 mu mol kg(-1), while ambient concentrations range from <2.0-9.8 mu mol kg(-1). Irradiance levels at the effluent depth are sufficient to support net photosynthesis, and the effluent's location in the pycnocline could lead to rapid horizontal advection of the plume and expansion of the spatial scale of impacts. These baseline data provide an understanding of pre-impact conditions at the future SWAC site and will enable a more accurate environmental assessment. A comprehensive and well-resolved environmental monitoring effort during SWAC operation will be necessary to quantify and understand these impacts.

AB  - Decennial changes in Planktothrix rubescens diversity and dynamics were reconstructed by applying molecular tools to analyse DNA and RNA extracted from lake sediments. The sediments studied were sampled from a deep peri-alpine lake that has experienced both dramatic shifts in trophic conditions and large-scale climatic changes. Palaeolimnological proxies were combined with statistical modelling to investigate the relative influence of phosphorus concentrations and temperature changes on the extent of Planktothrix blooms over the last century. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the overall composition of the cyanobacterial community changed over the transition from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions. When the relative abundance of Planktothrix decreased in the 1970s, concomitant with eutrophication, total cyanobacterial abundance remained high and more Anabaena and Microcystis sequences were detected. In spite of such drastic environmental changes, the lake provided a constant niche for one particular Planktothrix species, which was consistently present from the 1920s to the present day. Phosphorus concentration was found to be the dominant driver of the relative abundance of P.rubescens, with the highest abundances observed during mesotrophic conditions. The relative role of climate was nutrient-dependent, with warmer springs having a positive effect on P.rubescens abundance only during mesotrophic periods. Overall, this study confirms that analysis of genetic signatures preserved in sediment archives allows assessment of key palaeoenvironmental indicator species that have no diagnostic microscopic cellular features in the sediment record. In the case of cyanobacteria, palaeogenetics offer unique opportunities to anticipate how future climate change might affect the response of P.rubescens to phosphorus concentration.

AB  - Describing the ocean habitats used by Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha is an important step towards understanding how environmental conditions influence their population dynamics. We used data from archival tags that recorded time, temperature and pressure (depth) to define the coastal habitats used by Chinook near Oregon and California during the autumns of 2000, 2002 and 2003. We used a clustering algorithm to summarize the data set from each year and identified 4 general habitats that described the set of ocean conditions used by Chinook. The 4 habitats, defined primarily by depth and the time of day that these depths were occupied, were characterized as (1) shallow day, (2) shallow night, (3) deep and (4) deepest. The definitions and use of each habitat were similar across years and the thermal characteristics of all habitats included water temperatures between 9 and 12degreesC. This temperature range provided the best indicator of Chinook habitat in the coastal ocean. Chinook used 9 to 12degreesC water at least 52 % of the time. Less than 10 % of surface waters within the area where Chinook were released and recovered provided these temperatures. Cross sections of subsurface temperatures suggest that between 25 and 37 % of the coastal water column was available to Chinook and contained water in the 9 to 12degreesC range. These results support hypotheses that link salmon-population dynamics to ocean temperatures. Continued monitoring of surface and subsurface thermal habitats may be useful for assessing the extent and quality of conditions most likely to sustain Chinook salmon populations.

AB  - The particle transport during a stable dry weather period was investigated in a small, heterogeneous catchment. Particle colours and particle size distributions of surficial fine-grained sediments, suspended particles and riverbank samples were compared to the suspended particle loads and stream velocities in order to increase the understanding of the low flow conditions in the Olewiger Each. All solid samples show significant, non linear spatial trends of colour. The maxima of the polynomial curves of bed sediments and of the suspended solids show a spatial lag of 500 m and 800 m respectively in comparison to the riverbanks' colour maximum. The major result of the investigation is the exclusion of tributaries or riverbank material as dominant suspended particle sources under dry weather conditions. A cross correlation analysis between the solid samples indicates that a highly mobile thin surficial sediment layer enriched in organic carbon is the most dominant source of suspended particles. The spatial patterns of the sediment and of the suspended particle trends can be explained by mixing processes of both solid fractions. Remobilisation processes, even though dominant in the upper basin, occur in the whole longitudinal section. However, local changes of sedimentation and remobilisation show a surprising small scale even in the lower basin where sedimentation predominates. Tn their temporal sequence the colours of suspended solids within single flood waves reflect the spatial variability in the catchment. Therefore, sedimentary particle colour can be used as an indicator in a 'fingerprinting' approach towards identifying active sediment sources. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The intracellular calcium ([Ca2+](i)) transient in adult rat heart cells was examined using the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3 and a laser scanning confocal microscope. We find that the electrically evoked [Ca2+](i) transient does not rise at a uniform rate at all points within the cell during the [Ca2+](i) transient. These spatial non-uniformities in [Ca2+](i) are observed immediately upon depolarization and largely disappear by the time the peak of the [Ca2+](i) transient occurs. Importantly, some of the spatial non-uniformity in [Ca2+](i) varies randomly in location from beat to beat. Analysis of the spatial character of the non-uniformities suggests that they arise from the stochastic nature of the activation of SR calcium-release channels. The non-uniformities in [Ca2+](i) are markedly enhanced by low concentrations of Cd2+, suggesting that activation of L-type calcium channels is the primary source of activator calcium for the calcium transient. In addition, the pattern of calcium release in these conditions was very similar to the spontaneous calcium sparks that are observed under resting conditions and which are due to spontaneous calcium release from the SR. The spatial non-uniformity in the evoked [Ca2+](i) transient under normal conditions can be explained by the temporal and spatial summation of a large number of calcium sparks whose activation is a stochastic process. The results are discussed with respect to a stochastic local control model for excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling, and it is proposed that the fundamental unit of E-C coupling consists of one dihydropyridine receptor activating a small group of ryanodine receptors (possibly four) in a square packing model.

AB  - Conventional in vitro toxicity studies have focused on identifying IC50 and the underlying mechanisms, but how toxicants influence biophysical and biomechanical changes in human cells, especially during developmental stages, remain understudied. Here, using an atomic force microscope, we characterized changes in biophysical (cell area, actin organization) and biomechanical (Young's modulus, force of adhesion, tether force, membrane tension, tether radius) aspects of human fetal brain-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) induced by four classes of widely used toxic compounds, including rotenone, digoxin, N-arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA), and chlorpyrifos, under exposure up to 36 h. The sub-cellular mechanisms (apoptosis, mitochondria membrane potential, DNA damage, glutathione levels) by which these toxicants induced biochemical changes in NPCs were assessed. Results suggest a significant compromise in cell viability with increasing toxicant concentration (p < 0.01), and biophysical and biomechanical characteristics with increasing exposure time (p < 0.01) as well as toxicant concentration (p < 0.01). Impairment of mitochondrial membrane potential appears to be the most sensitive mechanism of neurotoxicity for rotenone, AEA and chlorpyrifos exposure, but compromise in plasma membrane integrity for digoxin exposure. The surviving NPCs remarkably retained stemness (SOX2 expression) even at high toxicant concentrations. A negative linear correlation (R-2 = 0.92) exists between the elastic modulus of surviving cells and the number of living cells in that environment. We propose that even subtle compromise in cell mechanics could serve as a crucial marker of developmental neurotoxicity (mechanotoxicology) and therefore should be included as part of toxicology assessment repertoire to characterize as well as predict developmental outcomes.

AB  - Life history theory suggests a trade-off between costly activities such as breeding and migration and somatic self-maintenance. However, how the short-term cost of parental effort is expressed in species with a slow pace-of-life is not well understood. Also, investigating carry-over effects of migration is most meaningful when comparing migratory strategies within the same population, but this has rarely been done. We explore this hypothesis in a long-lived, pelagic seabird, the Cory's Shearwater,Calonectris borealis, where males display partial migration. By manipulating reproductive effort and taking advantage of the natural variation in migratory strategy, we investigate whether early reproductive failure and migratory strategy had implications on the physical condition of males on return to the colony the following year. We experimentally induced breeding failure from mid-incubation, tracked the over-winter movements of these males and of males that invested in parental effort, and assessed innate immunity, stress, and residual body mass the following year. Early breeding failure resulted in earlier return to the colony among all males, associated with greater probability of reproductive success. Residents had a lower tail feather fault bar intensity, an indicator of stress during the non-breeding period, compared to migrants. Reproductive effort and migratory strategy had no impact on physiological condition otherwise. Our results provide evidence that in species with a slow-pace of life, such as the Cory's Shearwater, somatic maintenance is prioritised, with the costs of reproduction and migration paid in delayed arrival date.

AB  - In recent years, Beijing has experienced severe air pollution which has caused widespread public concern. Compared to the same period in 2014, the first three quarters of 2015 exhibited significantly improved air quality. However, the air quality sharply declined in the fourth quarter of 2015, especially in November and December. During that time, Beijing issued the first red alert for severe air pollution in history. In total, 2 red alerts, 3 orange alerts, 3 yellow alerts, and 3 blue alerts were issued based on the adoption of relatively temporary emergency control measures to mitigate air pollution. This study explored the reasons for these variations in air quality and assessed the effectiveness of emergency alerts in addressing severe air pollution. A synthetic analysis of emission variations and meteorological conditions was performed to better understand these extreme air pollution episodes in the fourth quarter of 2015. The results showed that compared to those in the same period in 2014, the daily average emissions of air pollutants decreased in the fourth quarter of 2015. However, the emission levels of primary pollutants were still relatively high, which was the main intrinsic cause of haze episodes, and unfavorable meteorological conditions represented important external factors. Emergency control measures for heavy air pollution were implemented during this red alert period, decreasing the emissions of primary air pollutants by approximately 36% and the PM2.5 concentration by 11%-21%.

AB  - Microbial life flourishes in the ponds of the McMurdo Sound Region, which includes the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) and the exposed coastal areas of Ross Island, Antarctica. Diatoms live within resident microbial mats, and because of the simplified trophic structure and limited dispersal vectors, the McMurdo Sound Region is an ideal locality to investigate diatom community assembly processes. Wind is hypothesized to transport microbiota between habitats, and following the species-sorting perspective, local conditions should act as an environmental filter. However, the role of spatial scale versus habitat characteristics on diatom community structure has not been investigated. To gain insight into these processes, we sampled microbial mats from 25 ponds and used variation partitioning to assess the spatial scales at which diatoms were influenced by chemistry and physical variables. We found substantial spatial structure in diatom communities, and spatial scale explained more variability than environmental variables. No diatoms were exclusive to Ross Island, but some species were only found in the MDVs. Furthermore, diatom communities were more likely to resemble those from other nearby ponds rather than distant ones, regardless of environmental conditions. Of the environmental variables, bromide and chloride (both indicators of marine influence) were among the most important. These results suggest that geography, dispersal, and historical environmental conditions play a major role in structuring diatom communities at large spatial scales, and chemistry may be more important within regions. These results help explain the biogeography of diatoms here and elsewhere and expand our knowledge of mechanisms influencing microbial metacommunity structure.

AB  - For insight into the physiological indicators of diapause in Pieris melete, water and carbohydrate (glycogen and trehalose) levels were measured under both natural and laboratory conditions. The highest water content (3.71-3.79 mg/mg dry weight) was found in larvae and developing pupae, which was substantially higher than in diapausing pupae (2.59 mg/mg dry weight). Water content was almost stable during diapause, except for individuals approaching diapause termination (3.43-3.58 mg/mg dry weight). The total carbohydrate level was significantly higher in pre-pupae (47.41 mu mg/mg) compared to larvae (22.80 mu g/mg) and developing pupae (21.48 mu g/mg). The highest level of trehalose was detected in winter diapausing pupae, and no trehalose was found in larvae or developing pupae. Levels of glycogen were highest in pre-pupae and lowest in diapausing pupae. Levels of total carbohydrate decreased as diapause proceeded, and no significant changes were found in trehalose levels for diapausing pupae under natural conditions or treated for 60-90 days at 5 degrees C. Pupae treated at 20 degrees C for 60-90 days had significantly lower levels of trehalose than those treated for 30 days. Glycogen content was relatively stable at 5 degrees C, but increased after treatment under natural conditions and 20 degrees C for more than 60 days. These results suggest that twhe dynamics of water and carbohydrate levels are potential physiological diapause indicators, which show metabolic differences between trehalose and glycogen during diapause development.

AB  - Carotenoid-based colouration plays an important role in sexual signaling in animals as an honest indicator of individual quality during mate choice and competitive interactions. However, few studies have examined how natural variation in weather conditions influences inter-annual variation in the expression of ornamentation, potentially through affecting the dietary availability of carotenoids. In this study, we examine variation in the expression of carotenoid-based plumage colouration in relation to temperature and rainfall during the pre-moulting and moulting period over 11 years in a population of American redstarts, Setophaga ruticilla, breeding in eastern Canada. We used reflectance spectrometry of tail feathers collected from male and female redstarts to relate feather colour with weather conditions the previous breeding season during the months over which redstarts are likely to moult (June-September). At a population level, birds expressed feathers with higher red chroma and lower brightness in years following high July rainfall and low August temperature. The pattern was stronger in males, but was generally consistent across ages and sexes. Analyses of feathers from repeatedly captured birds indicated that the above patterns could be explained by individual change in feather colour. We suggest that higher rainfall during the moulting period may increase insect abundance and the availability of dietary carotenoids. This is among the first studies to show effects of weather conditions on a sexual signalling trait, which may have important consequences for sexual selection, mate choice, and the reliability of putative signals.

AB  - In the Vezaiciai Branch of the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry - Albi-Endohypogleyic Luvisol soil experiments were performed to determine perennial forages Trifolium pratense L., Trifolium repens L., Medicago sativa L., Phleum pratense L root mass and root to shoot ratio in differently managed temporary grasslands. Lithuania's Western region's specific edaphic and climatic conditions are suitable for perennial grass development and growth, ensuring a stable biological productivity. Research showed that, for all assessed indicators, perennial grass species and the meteorological conditions in many cases had substantial (P <= 0.01, P <= 0.05) influence. Biomass of different forage types (roots and shoots) were distributed differently in separate stages of age. Strong (r=0.708-0.888) correlation was determined between legumes root and shoot mass. Substantial increase in root mass of timothy and alfalfa of second year of usage influenced the increase of coefficient of biological productivity (respectively: from 0.93 to 4.54 and from 0.75 to 1.71). The proportional annual increase of red and white clover shoots and roots mass had inconsiderable impact on biological productivity coefficient (from 0.34 to 0.66). The amount of precipitation during the year and vegetation period had a significant impact on the shoot and root mass of red clover (r=0.674* to 0.736*). For the timothy and white clover roots biomass, the precipitation during vegetation period (r=0.671* and 0.704*) had significant influence. Correlation was not found between alfalfa phytomass and rainfall indicators.

AB  - Long-chain alkenones in lacustrine settings are potentially excellent biomarkers for the reconstruction of past terrestrial environmental conditions, and have been found in many different types of lakes around the globe. A wider range of factors influence the occurrence and distribution of alkenones in lake sediments and waters when compared to marine systems. Lake environmental conditions, such as temperature (in particular) and salinity, are among the key factors controlling alkenone distributions in lacustrine settings. Here we investigated alkenone distribution patterns in lakes of the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China, and their possible relationship with environmental conditions, by analyzing paired samples of suspended particulate matter in surface waters and surface sediments. Salinity of investigated lake waters ranges from almost 0 to similar to 100 g/L, while temperature variation among the lakes is minimal, effectively eliminating temperature effects on the alkenone distribution patterns observed here. We show that (1) alkenone concentrations vary substantially between the lakes, yet controlling mechanisms remain elusive; (2) C-37/C-38 ratios are substantially lower in the lakes of the Qaidam Basin than in the Lake Qinghai region, probably indicating different alkenone producers in the two regions; and (3) large variations in %C-37:4 (the percentage of the C-37:4 alkenone), determined from both surface waters and sediments, are negatively correlated with salinity. We suggest that the %C-37:4 index could be used as a salinity indicator at least on a regional scale, with careful considerations of other potentially complicating factors. However, potential reasons for why salinity could significantly affect %C-37:4 values need further investigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stature, sitting height, stature by weight, and head circumference change with varying economic conditions during early childhood. Our hypothesis is that adult head shape, as well as head size, is influenced by changes in childhood nutrition. When economic conditions are bad, nutrition and health suffer, and the result is dolichocephaly. To test this hypothesis, we measured the head length, width, and circumference of 398 adult males in Jordan. Fifty-six percent are ethnic Jordanians, and 44% are ethnic Palestinians. We divided the modern history of Jordan and the West Bank into four periods developed from historical economic data. The results of the study show that the cephalic index (Cl) among Jordanians increased significantly with economic improvement but decreased slightly during the best economic period, whereas Cl remained stable across all periods among Palestinians. The pattern among Jordanians can be explained in terms of maternal environment and early childhood nutrition. The lack of pattern in Palestinians may be due to changing nursing practices, bottle feeding, or sleeping position. When economic conditions were bad, Jordanian mothers and infants suffered from malnutrition and deficits in health care services during pre- and postnatal periods. Infants were born with very low birth weight and longer heads. However, the highest mean value of head size, circumference, among Jordanians and Palestinians is obtained from individuals who were children during the bad economic period, an unexpected result. No significant linear or quadratic trend was found for either Palestinians' or Jordanians' head circumference over time.

AB  - Shoulder lesions and body condition of sows at weaning have both environmental and genetic causes. The traits can be scored at farm level, and following recording, the traits can be included in the breeding goal and directional selection can be applied. However, to further increase the genetic progress of these traits, it is advantageous to develop indicator traits on the selection candidates (test boars or gilts, not yet exhibiting the phenotype themselves). It has previously been suggested that the scapula morphology and the spine of scapula might be a key factor for the sow to develop shoulder lesions. In this study, we developed 11 novel traits describing the morphology of the shoulder blade based on computed tomography images from scanned test boars. These traits include the area, length, width, height, and volume of the shoulder blade as well as 6 traits obtained from principal component analysis, describing 80% of the variation observed for the scapula spine profile. The analyzed traits have moderate to high heritability (h(2) from 0.29 to 0.78, SE = 0.06), low to medium genetic correlations with shoulder lesions (up to 0.4, SE = 0.1), and body condition scoring at weaning (up to 0.25, SE = 0.1). These novel phenotypes can now be recorded automatically and accurately prior to selection of the AI boars. If such recordings are included in multivariate genomic selection models, it is expected to improve the genetic progress of shoulder lesions and body condition score by weaning.

AB  - The nutritional state of animals is tightly linked to the ambient environment, and for northern ungulates the state strongly influences vital population demographics, such as pregnancy rates. Continuously growing tissues, such as hair, can be viewed as dietary records of animals over longer temporal scales. Using sequential data on nitrogen stable isotopes (delta N-15) in muskox guard hairs from ten individuals in high arctic Northeast Greenland, we were able to reconstruct the dietary history of muskoxen over approximately 2.5 years with a high temporal resolution of app. 9 days. The dietary chronology included almost three full summer and winter periods. The diet showed strong intra-and inter-annual seasonality, and was significantly linked to changes in local environmental conditions (temperature and snow depth). The summer diets were highly similar across years, reflecting a graminoid-dominated diet. In contrast, winter diets were markedly different between years, a pattern apparently linked to snow conditions. Snow-rich winters had markedly higher delta N-15 values than snow-poor winters, indicating that muskoxen had limited access to forage, and relied more heavily on their body stores. Due to the close link between body stores and calf production in northern ungulates, the dietary winter signals could eventually serve as an indicator of calf production the following spring. Our study opens the field for further studies and longer chronologies to test such links. The method of sequential stable isotope analysis of guard hairs thus constitutes a promising candidate for population-level monitoring of animals in remote, arctic areas.

AB  - Carabid beetles and environmental parameters were investigated in 52 grassland sites with three replicate pitfall traps in each site and in the valley of the River Eider in Schleswig-Holstein (northern Germany) with 61 pitfall traps. Environmental parameters included water content of soil, sand content, organic matter content and pH. Ground beetle assemblages were derived by detrended correspondence analyses (DCA) and characterised by the specific environmental conditions as means for each assemblage. On the regional scale including all investigated sites of Schleswig-Holstein, five assemblages were differentiated. On the local scale including the investigated sites in the valley of the River Eider, three assemblages were found corresponding well with those found on the regional scale. Environmental conditions at the sites of the five assemblages were correlated with land use data, soil types, and water level stages provided by three maps of a geographic information system (GIS). The GIS maps were combined to develop smaller areas with land use, soil type and water level stage information. The characteristic environmental conditions were assigned to each area to derive the spatial distribution of the five ground beetle assemblages. Spatial prediction was correct for 65% of investigated sites. The potential area of each assemblage was estimated for the valley. The different grassland areas were evaluated as potential habitats for ground beetle species comparing total species richness with the regional species richness of each assemblage. The comparison shows that species richness in the evaluated assemblages is relatively low compared to the regional potential.

AB  - The degradation of trail resources associated with expanding recreation and tourism visitation is a growing management problem in protected areas worldwide. In order to make judicious trail and visitor management decisions, protected area managers need objective and timely information on trail resource conditions. This paper introduces a trail survey method that efficiently characterizes the location and lineal extent of common trail problems. The method was applied to a large sample of trails within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, a high-use protected area in the USA. The Trail Problem-Assessment Method (TPAM) employs a continuous search for multiple indicators of pre-defined tread problems, yielding census data documenting the location, occurrence and extent of each problem. The present application employed 23 different indicators in three categories to gather inventory, resource condition, and design and maintenance data of each survey ed trail. Seventy-two backcountry hiking trails (528 km), or 35% of the Park's total trail length, were surveyed. Soil erosion and wet soil were found to be the two most common impacts on a lineal extent basis. Trails with serious tread problems were well distributed throughout the Park, although trails with wet muddy treads tended to be concentrated in areas where horse use was high. The effectiveness of maintenance features installed to divert water from trail treads was also evaluated. Water bars were found to be more effective than drainage dips. The TPAM was able to provide Park managers with objective and quantitative information for use in trail planning, management and maintenance decisions, and is applicable to other protected areas elsewhere with different environmental and impact characteristics.

AB  - A few dominant species of plants often disproportionately contribute to primary production; however, dominance has an underappreciated influence on ecosystem processes and functioning. Cascading impacts of dominant species have been documented in ecosystems undergoing eutrophication, but competitive exclusion may also influence dominance structures when limiting nutrients become scarce (i.e., in lakes experiencing oligotrophication) or with exposure to stressors to which few species are adapted (i.e., desiccation stress in wetlands). To predict impacts of widespread changes in nutrients and hydrology on dominance structures in aquatic ecosystems, we need quantitative assessments of dominance of important primary producers, including algae and cyanobacteria, which can regulate other structural and functional properties of ecosystems. We used a highly spatiotemporally resolved (7 years, 165 sites) dataset from the abundant microbial mats of the Florida Everglades to assess how and why the degree of dominance and the identity of dominant taxa vary across nutrient and desiccation gradients. Using algal counts and the dimensions of algal units (cells, coenobia, colonies, and filaments), we measured dominance as relative biovolume. As hypothesized, the relative biovolume of dominant taxa increased and the number of taxa comprising 95% of the biovolume decreased with lower concentrations of limiting nutrient in the mats (phosphorus; P) and higher desiccation stress. Algal taxa that regulate the structural integrity of mats, such as the filamentous, calcium carbonate precipitating cyanobacterium Scytonema sp., strongly influenced these patterns through their tolerance of P scarcity and desiccation. Our indicators and approach can be used to test whether dominance of microscopic primary producers, and other organisms, increases with nutrient scarcity and desiccation stress in other aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Assessing alterations of a river's flow regime provides the basis for river protection and restoration planning. The range of variation approach (RVA) is a commonly used method to evaluate alterations in a river's flow regime. However, RVA underestimates the degree of flow regime alteration potentially, because it only considers the difference in frequency between the pre-impact and post-impact hydrologic indicator values within certain target ranges and does not consider alteration of the order of hydrologic year types (HYTs; i.e. wet, average and dry years). The HYT order is an important holistic feature of the flow regime. The human-induced change of HYTs, such as from a dry year to a wet year or from an average year to a dry year, can be a major cause of ecosystem alteration. For some species, the order of the HYTs was more important than single-year events (such as the flood magnitude during a given year). To address this problem with the RVA, we proposed a modification of this method that accounts for alteration of the order of HYTs. We developed a metric for assessing the alteration of the HYT order based on Euclidean distance and then combined this metric with the RVA. We applied the revised method to a case study of the Sha River in northern China to test its effectiveness. The results demonstrated that the new method solved RVA's problem of potentially underestimating the degree of flow regime alteration and enabled a more comprehensive analysis of the alteration of the flow regime.

AB  - An important condition for the effective functioning of business entities of all forms of ownership in modern conditions of uncertainty and environment instability is the correct assessment of market conditions and opportunities in short- and long-term perspectives. The article aims to analyse modern methodological approaches to assess the competitiveness of enterprises to identify and justify possible aspects of their improvement considering the specifics of the functioning of domestic research objects. The research's methodology based on domestic and foreign scientific works, leading experts' opinions, statistical data, and public authorities' analytical materials. The results were obtained by using expert methods - to investigate the impact of market factors and resource potential on light industry enterprises competitiveness; economic and mathematical methods - to calculate the integral indicator of the enterprise competitiveness; abstract-logic method - to theoretical generalization and formulation of conclusions. In determining the integral indicator of enterprise competitiveness, the method of taxonomic analysis was used with additional consideration of the specific weight of each factor influence on an integral indicator of enterprise competitiveness. In determining the specific impact of the indicators on the integrated indicator of the industrial enterprises' competitiveness, the external experts' views involved in the industry, their qualification competencies, and the level of fluctuations in the middle of the study group were considered. It was revealed that the existence of an enterprise could be considered objectively justified if it produces goods needed from the public point of view and uses resources within the qualitatively and quantitatively defined by society. Therefore, it was proposed to allocate eight levels of competitiveness, considering the technological and resource armament to grade the light industry enterprises'' competitiveness.

AB  - Extreme climate events and nonsustainable land use are important drivers altering the functioning of European ecosystems, resulting in loss of the services provided. Yet a consensus method for regular continental scale assessment of ecosystem condition in relation to land degradation (LD) is still lacking. Here, we propose a new remote sensing-based approach allowing for improved, repeated assessment of changing pressure on terrestrial ecosystems. On the basis of segmented trend analysis of water-use efficiency (WUE), a map of ecosystem change type (ECT) was produced over Europe for the period 1999 to 2013. Results were related to drought and change in land use and land cover and to known cases of soil degradation (LD case-studies). More than 30% of the European ecosystems experienced significant changes in WUE, of which more than 20% were categorized as abrupt. Large-scale positive reversals in WUE were observed over regions with increasing crop yield and intensification of wood production, whereas decreased WUE was observed over grassland areas coinciding with high farmland abandonment. Evidence of drought pressure on ecosystem functioning (EF) was observed, with abrupt changes in functioning observed during major European drought events. The ECTs also provided relevant information on the location and type of change in EF over the LD case studies. We conclude that mapping of gradual and abrupt changes in EF is expected to be valuable tool for ecosystem condition assessment that is essential for assessing the success of reaching the LD neutrality objectives set by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.

AB  - The current review seeks to highlight the concerns that have been raised on pre-slaughter stress, contributing factors and its consequent effects on cattle behavioural responses and the quality of beef; inter-linking the activities involved from birth to slaughter. Such information is crucial in light of the consumer concerns on overall animal welfare, quality of meat and food security. Slaughter animals are exposed to different conditions during production and transportation to abattoirs on a daily basis. However; the majority of studies that have been done previously singled out different environments in the meat production chain, while conclusions have been made that the welfare of slaughter animals and the quality of meat harvested from them is dependent on the whole chain. Behaviour is a critical component used to evaluate the animals' wellbeing and it has been reported to have an effect on product quality. Apart from the influence of on-farm, transportation and abattoir conditions, the genetic background of the animal also affects how it perceives and responds to certain encounters. Stress activates the animals' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity, triggering release of various stress hormones such as catecholamines and cortisol, thus glycogen depletion prior slaughter, elevated ultimate pH and poor muscle-meat conversion. Pre-slaughter stress sometimes results to cattle attaining bruises, resulting to the affected parts of the carcass being trimmed and condemned for human consumption, downgrading of the carcass and thus profit losses.

AB  - Often climatic niche models predict that any change in climatic conditions will impact species abundance or distribution. However, the accuracy of models that just incorporate climatic information to predict future species habitat use is widely debated. Alternatively, environmental conditions may simply need to be above some minimum threshold of climatic suitability, at which point, other factors drive population size. Using the example of nesting sites of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Mediterranean (n = 105), we developed climatic niche models to examine whether a climatic suitability threshold could be identified as a climatic indicator in order for large populations of a widespread species to exist. We then assessed the climatic suitability of sites above and below this threshold in the past (1900) and future (similar to 2100). Most large sites that are currently above the climatic threshold were above the threshold in the past and future, particularly when future nesting seasonality shifted to start 1-2 months earlier. Our analyses highlight the importance of future phenological shifts for maintaining suitability. Our results provide a positive outlook for sea turtle conservation, suggesting that climatic conditions may remain suitable in the future at sites that currently support large nesting populations. Our study also provides an alternative way of interpreting the outputs of climatic niche models, by generating a threshold as an index of a minimum climatic suitability required to sustain large populations. This type of approach offers the possibility to benefit from information provided by climate-driven models, while reducing their inherent uncertainties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Programs in Canada that assess the effects of wastewater discharges on organisms, such as Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM), primarily focus on fish populations and benthic invertebrate communities. Although these methods are widely accepted, there are many situations where fish monitoring is difficult and benthic community data is difficult to interpret; in these instances alternative approaches should be used. There are, however, few alternative methods available. One potential alternative is to use invertebrate population endpoints to determine effects in the receiving environment. In this study we examined effects of sewage and pulp mill effluents in the Saint John River, New Brunswick, on two stoney genera (Plecoptera, Perlidae, Acroneuria spp. and Paragnetina spp.) and compared the responses to those of a small-bodied fish, the slimy sculpin (Coitus cognatus). Stonefly measurements included condition, developmental stage, gonad weight, and size upstream and downstream of sewage and a pulp mill discharge. Condition, developmental stage, and absolute gonad weight were greater in Paragnetina spp. downstream of the sewage discharge. Acroneuria spp. showed persistence of the late developmental stage downstream of the sewage inputs. Slimy sculpin exposed to sewage effluents also showed increased condition, but the impacts downstream of the pulp mill effluent were inconsistent in both sculpin and Paragnetina spp. Our findings suggest that stonefly populations and slimy sculpin respond to effluents in similar ways and that the responses of large long-lived invertebrate populations, such as stoneflies, may be a viable alternative to fish population monitoring in environmental assessments of point source discharges.

AB  - Drought tolerance can be an effective tool for improving aflatoxin resistance in peanut. We evaluated 140 peanut families from 4 crosses in the F-4:7 and F-4:8 generations in field trials under drought and non-drought conditions to investigate the heritability (h(2)) of aflatoxin resistance traits, and phenotypic (r(p)) and genotypic (r(G)) correlations between aflatoxin resistance and drought tolerance traits. Data were collected for seed infection by Aspergillus flavus, aflatoxin contamination, biomass, pod yield, drought tolerance index (DTI) of biomass (BID), DTI of pod yield (PY), harvest index (HI), SPAD chlorophyll meter reading (SCMR) and specific leaf area (SLA). High genotype x environment interactions and low to moderate 112 for seed infection and aflatoxin contamination (0.30 to 0.65) were observed, indicating difficulty with directly improving these traits. However, seed infection and aflatoxin contamination had significant negative r(G) with drought tolerance traits, especially with pod yield (-0.29** to-0.93**) under drought conditions, indicating that genotype selection for drought tolerance could improve aflatoxin resistance. Moreover, r(G) were strong between seed infection and aflatoxin contamination with HI (-0.33** to-0.89**), SLA (0.50** to 0.92**) and SCMR (-0.60** to-0.83**). The results indicate that HI, SLA, or SCMR traits under long-term drought conditions could be used as indirect indicators of aflatoxin resistance. Because measurements for SLA and SCMR are simple, realizable and rapid. SLA and SCMR may be practical and cost effective for application in large scale breeding programs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bedrock aquifers in alpine catchments are important regional sources of freshwater. Data regarding bedrock groundwater-recharge processes are scarce and governing dynamics are poorly understood. The main datasets used to constrain regional groundwater recharge and flow, so far, have been based on indirect methods (environmental isotopes, river discharge rates, tunnel inflows). Here, a unique dataset is presented of long-termpore-water-pressure measurements from five deep boreholes situated in the upper reaches of a mountain slope at 1,500-2,300 m above sea level. In addition to multilevel pore pressure records, a detailed analysis of the hydrogeological conditions in the Alpine catchment is provided, along with the results from investigations of groundwater recharge mechanisms in response to variations in climatic conditions and hydraulic rock-mass properties. The recorded pressure data show annual pressure variations with amplitudes of 5-45 m and responses within a few days to summer rainstorms in the available depth range of 45-277 m below ground surface. One-dimensional analytical pore-pressure diffusion models and numerical infiltration models were applied to investigate pore-pressure dynamics and water-table variations. The model results reproduced the following parameters for the uppermost 100-m-thick layer: the observed amplitudes, rates and delays of pressure increase with porosities of 0.05-0.1%, specific storage of 5 E-5 to 5 E-7m(-1), and hydraulic diffusivities of 1 E-1 to 1 E-3 m(2)/s. Boreholes located in high-diffusivity areas (strongly fractured bedrock below coarse slope debris) had the strongest pressure variations and were most sensitive to weather conditions.

AB  - Understanding the sediment dynamics in an estuary is important for its morphodynamic and ecological assessment as well as, in case of an anthropogenically controlled system, for its maintenance. However, the quantification of sediment fluxes and budgets is extremely difficult from in-situ data and requires thoroughly validated numerical models. In the study presented here, sediment fluxes and budgets in the lower Seine Estuary were quantified and investigated from seasonal to annual time scales with respect to realistic hydro- and meteorological conditions. A realistic three-dimensional process-based hydro- and sediment-dynamic model was used to quantify mud and sand fluxes through characteristic estuarine cross-sections. In addition to a reference experiment with typical forcing, three experiments were carried out and analyzed, each differing from the reference experiment in either river discharge or wind and waves so that the effects of these forcings could be separated. Hydro- and meteorological conditions affect the sediment fluxes and budgets in different ways and at different locations. Single storm events induce strong erosion in the lower estuary and can have a significant effect on the sediment fluxes offshore of the Seine Estuary mouth, with the flux direction depending on the wind direction. Spring tides cause significant up-estuary fluxes at the mouth. A high river discharge drives barotropic down-estuary fluxes at the upper cross-sections, but baroclinic up-estuary fluxes at the mouth and offshore so that the lower estuary gains sediment during wet years. This behavior is likely to be observed worldwide in estuaries affected by density gradients and turbidity maximum dynamics.

AB  - Diets of juvenile coho Oncorhynchus kisutch and Chinook O. tshawytscha salmon are made up primarily of winter-spawning fish taxa in the late-larval and early juvenile stages that are undersampled in plankton and larger trawl nets. Although we have no direct measure of the availability of fish prey important to juvenile salmon during early marine residence, we do have data on the larval stage of their prey that may be used as a surrogate for the later stages. Data on these prey items were obtained from ichthyoplankton samples collected along the Newport Oregon Hydrographic line (44.65 degrees N) during January-March in 1998-2010. We explored winter biomass of prey fish larvae as a potential indicator of marine feeding conditions for young salmon the following spring. The proportion of total winter ichthyoplankton biomass considered to be common salmon fish prey fluctuated from 13.9% in 2006 to 95.0% in 2000. The relationship between biomass of fish larvae in winter and subsequent coho salmon survival was highly significant (r(2) = 50.0, p = 0.004). When the 2 outlier years of 1998 (El Nino) and 1999 (La Nina) were removed, this relationship was also highly significant for spring Chinook (r(2) = 70.7, p = 0.0002) and significant for fall Chinook salmon (r(2) = 34.0, p = 0.03) returns. Winter larval fish composition showed a high degree of overlap with juvenile salmon diets during May, but less overlap in June. Larval fishes appeared to be an early and cost-effective indicator of ocean ecosystem conditions and future juvenile salmon survival.

AB  - Interest in forecasting impacts of climate change have heightened attention in recent decades to how animals respond to variation in climate and weather patterns. One difficulty in determining animal response to climate variation is lack of long-term datasets that record animal behaviors over decadal scales. We used radar observations from the national NEXRAD network of Doppler weather radars to measure how group behavior in a colonially-roosting bat species responded to annual variation in climate and daily variation in weather over the past 11 years. Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) form dense aggregations in cave roosts in Texas. These bats emerge from caves daily to forage at high altitudes, which makes them detectable with Doppler weather radars. Timing of emergence in bats is often viewed as an adaptive trade-off between emerging early and risking predation or increased competition and emerging late which restricts foraging opportunities. We used timing of emergence from five maternity colonies of Brazilian free-tailed bats in south-central Texas during the peak lactation period (15 June-15 July) to determine whether emergence behavior was associated with summer drought conditions and daily temperatures. Bats emerged significantly earlier during years with extreme drought conditions than during moist years. Bats emerged later on days with high surface temperatures in both dry and moist years, but there was no relationship between surface temperatures and timing of emergence in summers with normal moisture levels. We conclude that emergence behavior is a flexible animal response to climate and weather conditions and may be a useful indicator for monitoring animal response to long-term shifts in climate.

AB  - A time-course study was conducted in order to evaluate the recovery time of juvenile Sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax from transport and handling stress. Among metabolite indices, ammonia nitrogen excretion rates were used as stress indicator. The measurements were carried out in water ambience of 13 1 degrees C under natural light conditions (16L/8D photoperiod). Juveniles were transported for about 2 hours in a fish transport tank with oxygen supply. Handling stress was due to netting at the outlet site during stocking fish into the transport tank and netting at the experimental facility while transferring fish from transport tank into experimental tanks. At the end of transportation, ammonia nitrogen excretion rates of sea bass juveniles in the transport tank became about 4 times higher than that in sea water at the outlet facility. Ammonia nitrogen concentrations in fish exposed to transport and handling stress peaked 10 hours after stocking in to the tanks, and then declined to initial values 24 h after stocking. In fish under normal condition and without stress, the postprandial trend of ammonia nitrogen excretion was similar, however, a peak was reached 6 hours after feeding, and then decreased to initial values 24 h after feeding. Based on the duration for recovery of ammonia nitrogen excretion in fish, it is suggested that sea bass juveniles may completely recover from stress caused by transportation and handling, and return to normal feeding conditions in 24 hours after a 2 hour truck transport.

AB  - Callistemon is an Australian species used as ornamental plant in Mediterranean regions. The objective of this research was to analyse the ability of Callistemon to overcome water deficit in terms of adjusting its physiology and morphology. Potted Callistemon laevis Anon plants were grown in controlled environment and subjected to drought stress by reducing irrigation water by 40% compared to the control (irrigated to container capacity). The drought stress produced the smallest plants throughout the experiment. After three months of drought, the leaf area, number of leaves and root volume decreased, while root/shoot ratio and root density increased. The higher root hydraulic resistance in stressed plants caused decreases in leaf and stem water potentials resulting in lower stomatal conductance and indicating that water flow through the roots is a factor that strongly influences shoot water relations. The water stress affected transpiration (63% reduction compared with the control). The consistent decrease in g(s) suggested an adaptative efficient stomatal control of transpiration by this species, resulting in a higher intrinsic water use efficiency (P-n/g(s)) in drought conditions, increasing as the experimental time progressed. This was accompanied by an improvement in water use efficiency of production to maintain the leaf water status. In addition, water stress induced an active osmotic adjustment and led to decreases in leaf tissue elasticity in order to maintain turgor. Therefore, the water deficit produced changes in plant water relations, gas exchange and growth in an adaptation process which could promote the faster establishment of this species in gardens or landscaping projects in Mediterranean conditions.

AB  - To counter the effects of environmental stresses, the plants must undergo detoxification that is crucial to avoid the accumulation of damaging free oxygen radicals (ROI). Here, we detail the oxidative damage, the antioxidant composition, and the osmoprotection achieved in transgenic plants of peanut overexpressing the AtDREB1A transgene, driven by a stress-inducible promoter (Atrd29A) when exposed to progressive water stress conditions. This study explored the biochemical mechanisms where (i) the antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APOX), and glutathione reductase (GR) accumulated in the transgenic plants at comparably higher levels than their untransformed counterparts under dry soil conditions, (ii) a significant increase in the proline levels in the transgenic plants was observed in dry soils, and (iii) a dramatic increase in the Lipid peroxidation in the untransformed controls in drier soils. Most of the biochemical parameters related to the antioxidative machinery in the tested peanut transgenics were triggered by the overexpression of AtDREB1A that appeared to differ from the untransformed controls. The antioxidants showed a negative correlation with the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) thresholds, where the normalized transpiration rate (NTR) started decreasing in the tested plants. However, no significant relationship was observed between any of these biochemical indicators and the higher transpiration efficiency (TE) values found in the transgenic events. Our results show that changes in the antioxidative machinery in these transgenic peanut plants (overexpressing the AtDREB1A transcription factor) under water-limiting conditions played no causative role in improved TE.

AB  - Factors determining the invasibility of different types of anthropogenic vegetation were studied in the Czech Republic. A data set of 3420 vegetation plots recorded between 1945 and 2005, containing 913 species, was used. A set of climatic variables (mean annual temperature and precipitation, together with elevation), propagule pressure (substituted by human population density) and local habitat conditions (substituted by values of CSR life strategies and Ellenberg indicator values of native species) was obtained for each plot. All species were classified as native, archaeophytes (i.e. alien species introduced before 1500), and neophytes (i.e. aliens introduced after ISOO) and their relative proportion was calculated for each plot. Regression tree models were used to determine the ecological characteristics of the most invasible man-made habitats in the Czech Republic. The plots contained on average 31.9% archaeophytes and 7.3% neophytes. Correlation between the proportions of archaeophytes and neophytes was positive and significant. Both archaeophytes and neophytes were found predominantly in strongly disturbed habitats with a high nutrient supply located at low elevations in warmer climatic areas of the Czech Republic. Archaeophytes are more influenced by local habitat conditions and preferentially colonize sunny and dry man-made habitats with higher soil reaction. Neophytes have no special preferences for local habitat conditions and their highest proportion was found mainly in disturbed habitats at low elevations. Our results show that for anthropogenic vegetation in the Czech Republic, ecological and habitat characteristics are more important factors for plant invasions than different land use in the surrounding area.

AB  - The objectives of this study are to propose a remotely measurable plant transpiration transfer coefficient (h(at)) and to verify its characteristics under various environmental conditions. The h(at) is defined as (T-c-T-a) / (T-p-T-a), -here T-c, T-p, and T-a are the temperatures of the canopy, a non-transpiring canopy, and air, respectively. Theoretically, h(at) less than or equal to 1, and determines transpiration from its minimum value (zero) to its maximum value (potential transpiration rate). Five experiments were conducted between 1994 and 1999 to verify the characteristics of h(at), using 3 plant species (sorghum, tomato and melon). Theoretical validation showed that the proposed model agreed well with conventional models. Experimental results showed that the h(at) value was approximately equal to the value of the ratio of sensible heat fluxes (H/H-p), and the slope of the regression line between them was close to 1, the intercept was close to 0, and the regression coefficient was r(2) = 0.70. In addition, h(at) was not only an indicator of the water status in the plant root zone, but also an indicator of atmospheric variables. Under water-stressed conditions, h(at) was affected mainly by the water status in the plant root zone. Therefore, h(at) can be used as an indicator of plant water stress. The main advantages are that h(at) can be easily measured and applied under various conditions. Due to its simplicity, h(at) is a suitable coefficient for analyzing the process of transpiration and for determining the transpiration rate.

AB  - Globally, amphibian species are experiencing dramatic population declines, and many face the risk of imminent extinction. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been recognised as an underappreciated factor contributing to global amphibian declines. In this regard, the use of hormonal growth promotants in the livestock industry provides a direct pathway for EDCs to enter the environment-including the potent anabolic steroid 178-trenbolone. Emerging evidence suggests that 178-trenbolone can impact traits related to metabolism, somatic growth, and behaviour in non-target species. However, far less is known about possible effects of 178trenbolone on anuran species, particularly during early life stages. Accordingly, in the present study we investigated the effects of 28-day exposure to 178-trenbolone (mean measured concentrations: 10 and 66 ng/L) on body size, body condition, metabolic rate, and anxiety-related behaviour of tadpoles (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis). Specifically, we measured rates of O2 consumption of individual tadpoles as a proxy for metabolic rate and quantified their swimming activity and their time spent in the upper half of the water column as indicators of anxiety-related behaviour. Counter to our predictions based on effects observed in other taxa, we detected no effect of 178-trenbolone on body size, metabolic rate, or behaviour of tadpoles; although, we did detect a subtle, but statistically significant decrease in body condition at the highest 178-trenbolone concentration. We hypothesise that 178-trenbolone may induce taxa-specific effects on metabolic function, growth, and anxietyrelated behaviour, with anurans being less sensitive to disruption than fish, and encourage further cross-taxa investigation to test this hypothesis.

AB  - The article describes methods of non-verbal speech characteristics analysis used to determine psychophysiological state of female subjects under simulated microgravity conditions ("dry" immersion, DI), as well as the results of the study. A number of indicators of the acute period of adaptation to microgravity conditions was described. The acute adaptation period in female subjects began earlier (evening of the 1st day of DI) and ended faster than in male ones in previous studies (2nd day of DI). This was indicated by a decrease in the level of state anxiety (STAI, p < 0,05) and depression-dejection [Profile of Mood States (POMS), p < 0,05], as well as a decrease in pitch (p < 0,05) and voice intensity (p < 0,05). In addition, women, apparently, used the "freeze" coping strategy - the proportion of neutral facial expressions on the most intense days of the experiment was at maximum. The subjects in this experiment assessed their feelings and emotions better, giving more accurate answers in self-assessment questionnaires, but at the same time tried to look and sound as calm and confident as possible, controlling their expressions. Same trends in the subjects' cognitive performance were identified as in similar experimental conditions earlier: the subjects' psychophysiological excitement corresponded to better performance in sensorimotor tasks. The difference was in the speed of mathematical computation: women in the present study performed the computation faster on the same days when they made fewer pauses in speech, while in men in previous experiments this relationship was inverse.

AB  - Avocado production is nowadays questioned worldwide and at risk due to climate change and the high water footprint of this crop. Thus, there is need for the development or adoption of new strategies such as alternative production systems. In this study, Hass avocado plants grafted on two rootstocks (Mexicola-seed propagated and Dusa (R) vegetative-propagated and referred as clonal) were grown in a greenhouse and substrate (coir growth container, 55 L of volume and 500 x 480 mm, H X W) culture system in Valparaiso Region, Chile. Plant growth and development during the vegetative and reproductive phases until end of flowering (63 weeks) were monitored. Plant aerial and root parameters from these two rootstock types (seed and clonal) were monitored by measuring canopy and trunk area, trunk height, root area, type of roots (rhizotron), non-structural carbohydrates dynamics, further primary metabolites, water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrate and phosphate use efficiency (NUE and PUE). Results of this study corroborated that continuous fertigation with nutrient solution provide better growing conditions resulting in prolonged and more continuous growth and flowering than open field conditions. In addition, differences in aerial and root growth between plants grown on these two different rootstocks under similar fertigation and environmental conditions were found. Plants grown on Mexicola rootstock were more efficient energetically as sustained by higher trunk area, tree height and higher root content of the main non-structural carbohydrates (mannoheptulose and perseitol) than plants grown on the clonal rootstock. Our findings suggest that this alternative growing system for Hass avocado, besides being more intensive could have a positive impact on environmental indicators (WUE, NUE and PUE) related to sustainability.

TI  - A Numerical Model for Twin Nucleation in Shocked Zircon and Comparison With Natural Samples
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
LA  - English
KW  - DEFORMATION
AB  - Twins in zircon are increasingly being used as an indicator of shock metamorphism on Earth and other planetary bodies, yet the conditions of their formation have not been quantified. We modeled the shear stress involved with homogeneous nucleation of the most common zircon twin (112)[(1) over bar(1) over bar1]. This stress is between 1.7 to 2.6 GPa for the range of crystal sizes common to the crust, stresses that are restricted to impact deformation regimes as opposed to tectonism. The twin nucleation stress is largely pressure independent, and it is likely that twins can form over a much larger range of shock pressures than is currently appreciated. This prediction is validated by the occurrence of twins in shocked zircon from distal regions of the 2.02 Ga Vredefort impact structure.
   Plain Language Summary The mineral zircon can deform plastically by the mechanism of twinning, which is characterized by a large angle change in lattice orientation. This is typically achieved by shear. The criteria for the occurrence of twins in zircon are not well known but potentially useful since these twins are found in rocks affected by meteor impact. It is likely that previous estimates of these conditions involve a quantity that is not intrinsic to the formation of the twin itself and are being used to erroneously interpret the severity of meteorite impacts. We evaluate a theory on the twin nucleation based on the free energy required to stabilize a nascent twin "embryo" assuming homogeneity at the microscale. We assess the forces required in terms of what that would mean for the deformation conditions that caused the twin and discuss some implications for the interpretation of these features in the geologic record.

AB  - Most studies examining faunal assemblages use their sedimentary context as a critical element in constraining and reconstructing their underlying environmental controls. This has resulted in the assumption that an absence of lithofacies change in a section should be reflected in a lack of environmental variation. This inference, however, has been placed into question by evidence that marine species are influenced by a broader range of environmental dynamics than just change in lithofacies. In this study, we examine the sensitivity of marine faunas to broadly defined environmental change within lithologically homogenous strata by examining concretionary fossil assemblages of the Baculites eliasi through B. clinolobatus biozones in monotonous, clay-rich strata of the Campanian-Maastrichtian Pierre Shale in Wyoming. We recognize five biofacies, which reflect different environmental conditions related to benthic oxygenation, substrate firmness, and water depth. Analyses of abundance patterns, raw species richness trends, and life-habit patterns display recurrent switching, upsection, between low- and high-diversity intervals. Our data reveal that samples with lower diversity show a strong relationship with intervals when water conditions were deepest, whereas higher diversity samples are associated with periods when shallow-water conditions prevailed in the study area. The distribution of taxa and diversity of the assemblages most likely reflect migrating oxygen- and substrate-controlled biofacies that were responding to changes in depth. This study shows that substantial changes in biofacies, diversity, and life habits can arise in response to variations in water depth with limited to no apparent change in lithofacies supporting the hypothesis that fossil taxa are much more sensitive indicators of environmental change than lithofacies.

AB  - Offshore structures are complex systems, and numerous failure modes must be taken into consideration when reliability analysis in different loads and environment conditions are conducted on them. It is difficult to obtain structural system reliability with respect to complicated systems with numerous failure modes and dependency consideration among them. This paper applies the combination of the weakest failure modes theory with structural reliability theory to conduct reliability analysis on of side by-side offloading mooring system of FPSO. Firstly, the numerical simulation of the system in different conditions is addressed to acquire the statistical data of time-history stress of components including hawsers, fenders and yoke, based on which, the reliability indexes of all the failure modes and correlation coefficient matrix are derived. Then the weakest failure modes, i.e. the representative failure modes that have significant impact on the system, are located through Probability Network Evaluation Technique. The probability of structural system is estimated through the weakest failure modes by considering the system as series. The analysis results indicate that two environment conditions (0 degrees && and 0 degrees && in combinations of wave, wind and current) are relative dangerous, which is in good correspondence with the practical expertise. The method is verified to be an effective and convenient evaluation approach for structural reliability analysis in terms of complex systems. It is beneficial for the identification of structure indicators from the weakest failure mode group and conduct optimum of structural system configurations in the design stage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sky view factor (SVF), which is an indicator of urban canyon geometry, affects the surface energy balance, local air circulation, and outdoor thermal comfort. This study focused on a continuous and long-term meteorological observation system to investigate the effects of SVF on outdoor thermal conditions and physiological equivalent temperature (PET) in the central business district (CBD) of Beijing (which is located within Chaoyang District), specifically addressed current knowledge gaps for SVF-PET relationships in cities with typical continental/microthermal climates. An urban sub-domain scale model and the RayMan model were used to diagnose wind fields and to calculate SVF and long-term PET, respectively. Analytical results show that the extent of shading contributes to variations in thermal perception distribution. Highly shaded areas (SVF < 0.3) typically exhibit less frequent hot conditions during summer, while enduring longer periods of cold discomfort in winter than moderately shaded areas (0.3 < SVF < 0.5) and slightly shaded areas (SVF > 0.5), and vice versa. Because Beijing has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate with hot summers and long, cold, windy, and dry winters, a design project that ideally provides moderate shading should be planned to balance hot discomfort in summer and cold discomfort in winter, which effectively prolongs the comfort periods in outdoor spaces throughout the entire year. This research indicate that climate zone characteristics, urban environmental conditions, and thermal comfort requirements of residents must be accounted for in local-scale scientific planning and design, i.e., for urban canyon streets and residential estates.

AB  - Alternaria alternata is the predominant fungus involved in moldy core and core rot of Red Delicious apples. The effects of environmental conditions during bloom on moldy core and core rot, and on the need for fungicide application, were examined in 10 experiments carried out in 2007. In untreated experimental plots, typical moldy core symptoms were very common, with relatively low variability (coefficient of variation: 22.2%) among experiments; core rot incidence ranged from 2 to 26% with large variability (coefficient of variation: 90.0%) among experiments. No evidence of prevailing environmental conditions during bloom affecting the development of moldy core or core rot was detected. No effect of fungicide application (a mixture of bromuconazole + captan three times a week at bloom) on moldy core or core rot was found. A random distribution of moldy core and an occasional aggregation of core rot in the orchards were indicated from Morisita's index of dispersion (Is). The hypothesis that core rot incidence is governed by host physiology and that yield load can be used as an indicator of trees' susceptibility was examined in a set of eight observations and four experiments. No correlation was found between tree yield load and moldy core, but core rot incidence was inversely related to yield load. Furthermore, irrespective of tree yield load, core rot was more abundant on large compared with small fruits. It is concluded that host physiology, rather than pathogen occurrence or environmental conditions at bloom stage, governs the development of core rot in Red Delicious apples caused by A. alternata in Israel.

AB  - The timing of pollen appearance in the atmosphere provides a general idea of the flowering onset of plants over a wide area. Woody plants in temperate regions have evolved mechanisms to preserve cells from the risk of frost during adverse weather conditions in the period prior to flowering regulated mainly by temperature. A number of indices have been developed to quantify the rest and heat requirements of temperature, which will enable the plant to adapt to environmental conditions. However, flowering is a dynamic and complex phenomenon and it is difficult to separate individual effects of different meteorological parameters. The use of modified bioclimatic indices could be a major step forward. In this study the Alnus glutinosa flowering in four different areas in north-western Spain in the period 1995-2003 is examined, and trends identified by means of information gathered by Hirst pollen traps. Temperature plays an important role in the maturation of reproductive organs and pollen production. Comparison with bioclimatic indices showed that temperature during the 2555 days preceding pollen release was the main controlling factor, and that relationship between flowering time and bioclimatic indicator values differs according to local conditions. In colder areas, rest and heat temperature requirements are greater because the trees need protection over a longer period; in the Mediterranean region of north-westem Spain, the rest temperature requirement and the threshold temperature are both higher than in Eurosiberian areas. Ombrothermic, Continentality and Thermicity indices are thus useful tools for characterizing the various bioclimatic areas of north-western Spain.

AB  - The design of vapor-extraction remedial systems and the analysis of their performance can be improved by using models that can simulate the chemical and physical processes affecting the occurrence and movement of multiple-compound vapor-phase chemical mixtures. Previous models fall into two categories: (1) multiple-compound phase distribution models which are either nondimensional (no transport) or one-dimensional (column experiments); and (2) multidimensional, single-compound transport models. In this paper, a model is presented that couples the steady-state vapor flow equation, the advection-diffusion transport equation, and a multiple-compound, multiphase chemical partitioning model. The numerical implementation allows spatially variable fields of permeability, confining layer permeability, and initial contaminant concentrations. Based on the concentrations of each chemical compound, the model calculates whether a nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) is present, and calculates the chemical phase distribution by the appropriate equilibrium partitioning formulation (Henry's Law or Raoult's Law).
   The user can specify the location and discharge rates of any number of extraction or injection wells, including zero wells, in which case the simulation will solve transport by diffusion only. The remediation, by vapor extraction, of hypothetical fuel hydrocarbon spills was simulated to investigate the error introduced by failing to account for natural (nonideal) conditions. The nonideal conditions include inhomogeneous soil permeability, leakage of atmospheric air into the subsurface (as from a bare ground surface), and irregular contaminant distribution. The model was also run in the pure diffusion mode to simulate the transport of benzene to the ground surface, and to show the limitations of single-compound vapor flux models when a multicompound NAPL (such as gasoline) represents the source of benzene.

AB  - Aloe vera is one of the few edible species in the genus Aloe, and its products are widely used in foods, cosmetics, health care products, medicines and other fields. Barbaloin is the highest content of anthraquinones in aloe, which has potential allergenicity, and it is one of the important indicators for the quality control of aloe containing products. Aiming at resolving the problems of barbaloin instability, easy sensitization and high residue, the transformation and degradation mechanisms of barbaloin under different processing conditions (temperature, pH, food additives and metal ions) were studied in this research, and the toxicity of the products were evaluated. The results showed that the transformation and degradation of barbaloin can be significantly accelerated by high temperature, alkaline conditions, calcium chloride, carboxymethyl cellulose, Fe3+ and Mg2+ (p < 0.001). However, they can be significantly inhibited by the acidic environment and Pb2+ (p < 0.001). And the transformation and degradation of barbaloin in aloe powder were almost the same as those in the barbaloin aqueous solution. The main transformation and degradation products of barbaloin were isobarbaloin, aloe emodin, 10-Hydroxyalloin A and 10-Hydroxyalloin B, and the other two unknown products were isomers. And aloe emodin may have greater toxicity hazards and potential safety risks. The molecular electrostatic potential properties also indicated that the 10th carbon atom of barbaloin, isobarbaloin, 10-Hydroxyaloin A and 10-Hydroxyaloin B may be more likely to break chemical bonds and generate new transformation and degradation products. These research results can be applied to the control of barbaloin and aloe emodin in the processing of aloe-containing products, so as to provide the basis for the better development and utilization of aloe.

AB  - Durin April 2016, the Zagreb Institute of Archaeology, in cooperation with the Institute of Archaeology, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University in Warsaw, conducted geophisical survey and geological sampling at Slavonski Brod - Galovo, Vinkovci - Sopot, Vinkovci - Blato, Marinci - Segetac i Brsadin - Pasnjak pod selom atchaeological sites together with Sovsko jezero position. During the survey geological samples were collected which will be used for the reconstruction of paeloecological and paleoclimate conditions for the area of northern Croatia.
   By using multiple non-invasive geophysical methods, the existence of new cultural layers (at Galovo, Sopot, Segetac and Pasnjak pod selom sites) or archaeological features (for ex. the existence of a new ditch around the western part of the Sopot site or the eastern ditch around part of the Segetac site with possible remains of wooden houses on the same site) has been confirmed. The use of geophysical methods has proven to be extremely useful in the discovery of archeological features which are not visible at the surface of the sites or parts of the sites not archaeologically explored. With these methods, it is possible to obtain results that can serve as guidance for future archeological research or site protection with fewer resources in the shorter periods of time.
   Geological sampling at or near sites enables the reconstruction of ecological conditions at the time the sites were settled and the reconstruction of paleoclimate indicators. These indicators will later be compared with the known paleoclimate proxies for the Northern Hemisphere and will thus contribute to a better understanding of climate events in the past.

AB  - Wetland determination relies on assumptions that site hydrologic and edaphic conditions limit plant species to certain environments. For example, using species' wetland indicator status for wetland determination assumes that tolerance of wetland conditions best explains distributional patterns. However, abiotic and biotic factors often interact to create complex plant responses across different environments. To evaluate these interactions, we used a hydrologic gradient in the coastal temperate rainforest of southeast Alaska to (1) quantify the primary determinants of conifer distributions, (2) identify thresholds in environmental factors limiting species' success and (3) assess current wetland indicator status of local conifers (Pinus contorta, Picea sitchensis, and Tsuga heterophylla). Data were collected using a hierarchical sampling scheme and analyzed within a Bayesian framework. Topography and hydrologic regime were the primary determinants of distributional patterns, but species were limited by specific microsite factors. Competitively dominant P.sitchensis occurred where hydrology, pH, and nitrogen were most favorable for establishment, while stress-tolerant P.contorta was competitively excluded from these sites. Tsugaheterophylla occurred across the gradient but took advantage of drier conditions, which promoted biomass accumulation. Tree distributions were limited by the interaction between abiotic and biotic factors rather than by abiotic tolerance alone. This knowledge of local and regional drivers of species' distributions and the relative importance of interacting abiotic and biotic drivers provide critical information for land management and regulation. Wetland delineation procedures can be improved through application of the regional empirical limits identified for plant species, as implemented and addressed in this study.

AB  - This study aimed to assess measurements of temperature and relative humidity obtained with HOBO a data logger, under various conditions of exposure to solar radiation, comparing them with those obtained through the use of a temperature/relative humidity probe and a copper-constantan thermocouple psychrometer, which are considered the standards for obtaining such measurements. Data were collected over a 6-day period (from 25 March to 1 April, 2010), during which the equipment was monitored continuously and simultaneously. We employed the following combinations of equipment and conditions: a HOBO data logger in full sunlight; a HOBO data logger shielded within a white plastic cup with windows for air circulation; a HOBO data logger shielded within a gill-type shelter (multi-plate prototype plastic); a copper-constantan thermocouple psychrometer exposed to natural ventilation and protected from sunlight; and a temperature/relative humidity probe under a commercial, multi-plate radiation shield. Comparisons between the measurements obtained with the various devices were made on the basis of statistical indicators: linear regression, with coefficient of determination; index of agreement; maximum absolute error; and mean absolute error. The prototype multi-plate shelter (gill-type) used in order to protect the HOBO data logger was found to provide the best protection against the effects of solar radiation on measurements of temperature and relative humidity. The precision and accuracy of a device that measures temperature and relative humidity depend on an efficient shelter that minimizes the interference caused by solar radiation, thereby avoiding erroneous analysis of the data obtained.

AB  - White-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca) and Surf Scoters (M. perspicillata) are often assumed to rely on similar marine resources. To evaluate the accuracy of this assumption, we contrast seasonal distributions, foraging effort, and indicators of energy status (body mass and composition, plasma metabolites) in three major foraging sites in Puget Sound, Washington, for these rapidly declining sea duck congeners. For Surf Scoters, distributions and energy status indicated that a mussel-dominated site was relatively important in early winter, but that importance shifted during late winter and spring to seagrass sites that provided either herring spawn or epifaunal invertebrates. As winter progressed, movements among foraging sites and increased foraging effort by Surf Scoters were accompanied by greater variability in their energy status compared with White-winged Scoters; body mass declined over winter by > 9% in about one-third of past studies for Surf Scoters, well above the range of losses observed in White-winged Scoters. For White-winged Scoters, lower variability in energy status, foraging effort, and distributions throughout winter suggests that they are better able to regulate energy balance regardless of changing foraging conditions. Greater resistance to seasonal environmental changes in White-winged Scoters may be related to their > 50% larger body size, which confers lower mass-specific energy costs and access to a wider size range of bivalve prey. Perhaps because of their greater sensitivity to winter foraging conditions, Surf Scoters appear to rely on a broader range of foraging sites than White-winged Scoters.

AB  - Morphological plasticity was studied for advanced regeneration trees in different light environments of the mountainous, mixed-species forests in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. The primary species in these mixtures were very shade tolerant silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), and midtolerant Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst). Seedlings/saplings of these species were selected for measurements in different stands from two different geographical locations. Various morphological traits (specific leaf area, live crown ratio, crown width to length ratio, terminal to lateral ratio, number of internodal shoots, number of shoots in terminal whorl, stem symmetry, stem orientation, stem forking) for each regenerating tree were measured during summers of 2001 and 2002. Percentage of above canopy light and stand basal area measures were used to assess the available growing space for each seedling/sapling. Regression relationships were developed for the different morphological indicators as a function of these two variables. All species adapted their morphology along the gradient in light and basal area. Spruce seemed to be less adapted to low light conditions than both fir and beech. However, no significant differences in terms of shade tolerance were detected using the above indicators. In really dense stand conditions (less than 20% above canopy light and stand basal area above 36 m(2) ha(-1)), probability for stem forking in beech increased. In open, all three species adapted their morphology for vigorous growth. Under such conditions, spruce was better adapted than fir.

AB  - [1] Partitioning of volatile chemicals among the gas, liquid, and solid phases during the conversion of liquid water to ice in clouds can impact the poststorm distributions of chemicals in the troposphere and in precipitation. In this paper, we use a timescale-based methodology to determine the key physical parameters involved in retention and derive the dependence of retention on these parameters for nonrime freezing and rime freezing when droplet spreading is minimal. We calculate a dimensionless retention indicator for SO2, H2O2, NH3, and HNO3, for a variety of conditions relevant to natural clouds. We find that solute properties, particularly the effective Henry's constant, likely have a large impact on retention. Chemicals with very high effective Henry's constants (e.g., HNO3) will likely be retained completely under all conditions. For chemicals with lower effective Henry's constants, freezing conditions (including pH, temperature, magnitude of the hydrometeor velocity in air, and drop size) will likely have significant impacts on retention, while air pressure has only a small effect. The dependence on velocity and drop size depends on the limiting mass transport regime and is nonmonotonic due to the competing effects of ventilation on heat and mass transport. The formation of a complete or partial ice shell likely also affects retention significantly. Comparison of our results with available experimental data provides possible explanations of the trends and apparent disagreement found in the studies. The theory-based analysis and methodology presented in this paper can be used to improve experimental design and parameterization of retention in cloud models.

AB  - Over a 2-year period, three research facilities examined a semi-field testing procedure to determine its usefulness in predicting potential side-effects of pesticides on non-target leaf-dwelling insects under field exposure conditions. The ladybird beetle Coccinella septempunctata was chosen as an indicator species for such insects. The objectives of the research were to examine the amenability of the testing method and to evaluate the reproducibility and reliability of the results. Second instar larvae of the beetles were placed on aphid-infested broad bean plants and then exposed to a spray treatment with one of three insecticide formulations at different application rates. The pesticides used were ME 605 Spritzpulver (WP 30), Metasystox R (EC 250) and Pirimor Granulat (50% a.i. w/w). Larval mortalities and numbers of to successful metamorphoses observed in the tests were found to be in good agreement with observations made under agricultural field conditions. The reproductive performance of beetles which developed from the exposed larvae was highly variable between replicate groups although beetles were partly maintained in groups of comparable parent density and sex ratio.
   Overall, it is concluded that the proposed test procedure is amenable and that the observed effects on larval survivability and the number of successful metamorphoses can be used to reliably predict harmful effects of pesticides to ladybird beetles in the field. If used as testing endpoint, the reproductive performance should only be qualitatively evaluated, since this sublethal endpoint is apparently subjected to a high natural variability.

AB  - Early and minimally invasive detection of malignant events or other pathologies is of utmost importance in the pursuit of improved patient care and outcomes. Recent evidence indicates that exosomes and extracellular vesicles in serum and body fluids can contain nucleic acid, protein, and other biomarkers. Accordingly, there is great interest in applying these clinically as prognostic, predictive, pharmacodynamic, and early detection indicators. Nevertheless, existing exosome isolation methods can be time-consuming, require specialized equipment, and/or present other inefficiencies regarding purity, reproducibility and assay cost. We have developed a straightforward, three-step protocol for exosome isolation of cell culture supernatants or large volumes of biofluid based on sequential steps of dead-end pre-filtration, tangential flow filtration (TFF), and low-pressure track-etched membrane filtration that we introduce here. Our approach yields exosome preparations of high purity and defined size distribution and facilitates depletion of free protein and other low-molecular-weight species, extracellular vesicles larger than 100 nm, and cell debris. Samples of exosomes prepared using the approach were verified morphologically by nanoparticle tracking analysis and electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the presence of previously reported exosome-associated proteins. In addition to being easy-to-implement, sequential filtration yields exosomes of high purity and, importantly, functional integrity as a result of the relatively low-magnitude manipulation forces employed during isolation. This answers an unmet need for preparation of minimally manipulated exosomes for investigations into exosome function and basic biology. Further, the strategy is amenable to translation for clinical exosome isolations because of its speed, automatability, scalability, and specificity for isolating exosomes from complex biological samples.

AB  - Purpose Entrepreneurship can be understood as a systemic phenomenon, thus relying on sets of influential factors associated with socioeconomic contexts. Institutional conditions play a pivotal role in this regard, affecting the allocation of entrepreneurial efforts. The goal of this research is to verify to what extent do the pillars of Countries' Institutional Profiles - regulatory, cognitive and normative - affect both the prevalence and quality of entrepreneurship, assessing the differences between developing and developed countries both in total entrepreneurial activity and in the following qualitative frames: innovation rate, high job creation expectations and motivational index. Design/methodology/approach The authors' assessment uses data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) with a longitudinal approach for 112 countries over the period 2003-2019. Dynamic panel data regressions are applied. Findings By comparing developing and developed countries, findings highlight that institutional effects are heterogeneous among developing and developed countries, with informal institutions being more relevant for developing countries than formal ones. Also, using a broad range of institutional indicators, the authors' assessment indicated that the association between institutional conditions and productive entrepreneurship seems to be far more intricate than argued by theoretical literature. Practical implications The authors' findings indicate the need for developing countries to address formal institutional voids in order to generate more effective conditions for productive entrepreneurship to emerge. Following prior literature, this can have systemic impacts on trajectories for economic growth and development. Originality/value The originality of this research consists in using a longitudinal and integrative approach to compare institutional effects on different types of entrepreneurship, as well as comparing these effects in countries at different stages of development.

AB  - Plagioclase ultraphyric basalts (PUBs) are a class of mid-ocean ridge (MOR) lavas found in a variety of ocean floor environments, are characterized by abundant (15-40 volume %) plagioclase megacrysts and a diverse trace element and isotopic signature. Paradoxically, we never see lavas erupted on the seafloor that are in equilibrium with these PUB megacrysts. Based on petrographic evidence, melt inclusion composition, and new data on depth of entrapment calculated from CO2 contents in plagioclase-hosted inclusions, many of the megacrysts formed at upper mantle pressures (similar to 3-7 kbars). To constrain the composition of the parent magmas of the plagioclase megacrysts, we conducted a series of experiments at 5 and 10 kbars using mid-ocean ridge basalts glasses as starting materials. The experimental results were consistent with the presence of a pseudoazeotrope in the anorthitic segment of the plagioclase + basalt pseudobinary. This has the effect of dropping the anorthitic end of the feldspar loop, lowering the solidus for upper mantle conditions, and driving evolving magmas toward higher Ca. As magmas rise and pressure drops, the pseudoazeotrope disappears, and the feldspar loop at the high-An end rises, causing those magmas to undergo decompression crystallization of plagioclase and resorption of olivine. Therefore, the conditions which generated the magmas from which the megacrysts form disappear as the magmas rise and magmas evolve toward lower Ca, Mg (as we normally assume during plagioclase + olivine crystallization). In effect, the phase equilibria conditions that allow for the generation of such liquids also prevent them from being erupted as lavas.

AB  - Earthworms are key indicators of soil quality and health in vineyards, but research that considers different soil management systems, especially in Slovenian viticultural areas is scarce. In this investigation, the impact of different soil management practices such as permanent green cover, the use of herbicides in row and inter-row areas, use of straw mulch, and shallow soil tillage compared to meadow control for earthworm abundance, were assessed. The biomass and abundance of earthworms (m(2)) and distribution in various soil layers were quantified for three years. Monitoring and a survey covering 22 May 2014 to 5 October 2016 in seven different sampling dates, along with a soil profile at the depth from 0 to 60 cm, were carried out. Our results showed that the lowest mean abundance and biomass of earthworms in all sampling periods were registered along the herbicide strip (within the rows). The highest abundance was found in the straw mulch and permanent green cover treatments (higher than in the control). On the plots where the herbicide was applied to the complete inter-row area, the abundance of the earthworm community decreased from the beginning to the end of the monitoring period. In contrast, shallow tillage showed a similar trend of declining earthworm abundance, which could indicate a deterioration of soil biodiversity conditions. We concluded that different soil management practices greatly affect the soil's environmental conditions (temperature and humidity), especially in the upper soil layer (up to 15 cm deep), which affects the abundance of the earthworm community. Our results demonstrated that these practices need to be adapted to the climate and weather conditions, and also to human impacts.

AB  - -A technique for calculating the standardized indicators characterizing the thermal efficiency of combined-cycle power plants (CCPPs) using correlation equations linking the values of these indicators with different external conditions is proposed. The correlation equations were written using the results from measuring the outdoor air and cooling water temperatures; air barometric pressure and humidity; fuel (natural gas) flowrate, heating value, and density and load in steady-state operation modes of the CCPPs and their equipment. It is usually sufficient to have a sample with three groups each representing 15-20 operating modes: under winter conditions at an outdoor air temperature of -20 to -30 degrees C, under summer conditions at an outdoor air temperature of above 20 to 30 degrees C, and at an intermediate temperature of +/- 5 to +/- 7 degrees C. In each group, it is sufficient to have two operating modes each with loads close to 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 of the maximal value, and 5-10 operating modes with a close-to-nominal load. It is shown, taking a single-shaft 400 MW CCPP as an example, that the correlation equations adequately (with errors equal to approximately 1%) describe the results obtained experimentally in the normal operation modes. The developed technique opens the possibility to determine, in a more accurate and simple manner, the standardized heat rates and other technical-economic indicators of fuel utilization without using an excessive number of corrections able to distort the result. The technique can also be used for estimating the changes of CCPP indicators as a result of taking some or other measures in them.

AB  - The Late Ordovician mass extinction (LOME) was the second largest Phanerozoic crisis, but its cause remains elusive. Several triggering mechanisms have been proposed over the years, including bioevolutionary events, oceanographic changes, and geotectonic processes. Here, we report the presence of Hg spikes in the Zbrza PIG-1 borehole from the Upper Ordovician deep shelf sections of the peri-Baltic region. A strong positive anomaly in the lower late Katian (Hg/TOC = 2537.3 ppb/wt%) was noted. No correlation between Hg and TOC (R-2 = 0.07) was distinguished in the Himantian, although several positive anomalies were found. Because the Hg/Mo ratio showed trends very similar to those of Hg/TOC, it seems likely that TOC values reflect the redox conditions. In order to evaluate the role of anoxia in levels of Hg enrichment several redox indicators were measured. These showed that the elevated mercury values in the Hirnantian are not caused by anoxia/euxinia because euxinic biomarkers (maleimides and aryl isoprenoids) are present in very low abundance and pyrite framboids are absent. In total, positive Hg/TOC anomalies occur in the lower late Katian, at the Katian - Hirnantian boundary, and in the late Hirnantian. The lack of a strong Hg/TOC correlation, Ni enrichments, and the absence of 'anoxic indicators' (no biomarkers, no framboids, low Mo concentration) at these levels, supports the interpretation that Hg enrichment is due to enhanced environmental loading. We conclude that our Hg and Hg/TOC values were associated with volcanic pulses which triggered the massive environmental changes resulting in the Late Ordovician mass extinction.

AB  - Chemical-Looping Combustion (CLC) is a promising technology for performing CO2 capture in combustion processes at low cost and with lower energy consumption. Fuel conversion modelling assists in optimizing and predicting the performance of the CLC process under different operating conditions. For this work, the combustion of natural gas was modelled using a CaMnO3 -type perovskite as oxygen-carrier and taking into consideration the processes of fluid dynamics and reaction kinetics involved in fuel conversion. The CLC model was validated against experimental results obtained from the 120 kWth CLC unit at the Vienna University of Technology (TUV). Good agreement between experimental and model predictions of fuel conversion was found when the temperature, pressure drop, solids circulation rate and fuel flow were varied. Model predictions showed that oxygen transfer by means of the gas-solid reaction of the fuel with the oxygen-carrier was relevant throughout the entire fuel-reactor. However, complete combustion could be only achieved under operating conditions where the process of Chemical-Looping assisted by Oxygen Uncoupling (CLaOU) became dominant, i.e. a relevant fraction of the fuel was burnt with molecular oxygen (O-2 ) released by the oxygen-carrier. This phenomenon was improved by the design configuration of the 120 kWth CLC unit at TUV, in which oxidized particles are recirculated to the upper part of the fuel-reactor. Thus, the validated model identified the conditions at which complete combustion can be achieved, demonstrating that it is a powerful tool for the simulation and optimization of the CLC process with the CaMnO3-type material.

AB  - Process-based groundwater models are useful to understand complex aquifer systems and make predictions about their response to hydrological changes. A conceptual model for evaluating responses to environmental changes is presented, considering the hydrogeologic framework, flow processes, aquifer hydraulic properties, boundary conditions, and sources and sinks of the groundwater system. Based on this conceptual model, a quasi-three-dimensional transient groundwater flow model was designed using MODFLOW to simulate the groundwater system of Mahanadi River delta, eastern India. The model was constructed in the context of an upper unconfined aquifer and lower confined aquifer, separated by an aquitard. Hydraulic heads of 13 shallow wells and 11 deep wells were used to calibrate transient groundwater conditions during 1997-2006, followed by validation (2007-2011). The aquifer and aquitard hydraulic properties were obtained by pumping tests and were calibrated along with the rainfall recharge. The statistical and graphical performance indicators suggested a reasonably good simulation of groundwater flow over the study area. Sensitivity analysis revealed that groundwater level is most sensitive to the hydraulic conductivities of both the aquifers, followed by vertical hydraulic conductivity of the confining layer. The calibrated model was then employed to explore groundwater-flow dynamics in response to changes in pumping and recharge conditions. The simulation results indicate that pumping has a substantial effect on the confined aquifer flow regime as compared to the unconfined aquifer. The results and insights from this study have important implications for other regional groundwater modeling studies, especially in multi-layered aquifer systems.

AB  - The genesis of a suite of Jurassic (Lias) microbialites at the Urkut black shale-hosted manganese carbonate ore body (central Hungary) is described by a two-step microbial formation model that uses mineral chemistry combined with whole-profile (up section) textural context and sulfur isotopic compositions of associated pyrite and barite. Petrogenetic analysis and paleo-environmental reconstructions show that the sedimentary regime of the Oita microbialites mostly behaved as an open system during deposition of black shale under early diagenetic conditions. Sulfur isotopes and other chemostratigraphic indicators, however, reveal that the Mn ore bed horizons reached semi-closed/closed conditions which modulated sedimentation rate and organic matter burial. Barite horizons within Mn-carbonate layers preserve delta S-34(VCDT) values that average +22.2 parts per thousand, with a maximum at +35.2 parts per thousand. Barite formation occurred under semi-closed/closed conditions at diagenesis, and the Ba source is attributable to the decomposition of organic matter derived from plankton and other marine organisms, as well as transformation of biogenic silica. Pyritiferous horizons host equant, framboidal and euhedral morphotypes. The distribution and size of euhedral and framboidal sulfide habits is consistent with later diagenetic sulfate reduction under an oxic water column; more equant types occur at the contact zone of black shale and Mn-carbonate horizons. The microbialites of Urkut bear strong similarities to ore bodies at Molango (Upper Jurassic, Mexico) and Tao Jiang (Middle Ordovician, China). Manganese supply and trace metal contents (Co, Ni, Zn, Cd and As) of the sulfides also point to the effects of distal hydrothermal fluid sources to the system.

Feedstock storage limitations, labor constraints for harvest, and environmental benefits provided by perennials are rationales for developing localized perennial feedstock as an alternative or in conjunction with annual feedstocks (i.e., crop residues). Little information is available on yield, mineral, and thermochemical properties of native species as related to harvest time. The study's objectives were to compare the feedstock quantity and quality between grasses harvested in the fall or the following spring. It was hypothesized that biomass yield may decline, but translocation and/or leaching of minerals from the feedstock would improve feedstock quality. Feedstock yield did not differ by crop, harvest time, or their interactions. Both grasses averaged 6.0 Mg ha(-1) (fall) and 5.4 Mg ha(-1) (spring) with similar high heating value (17.7 MJ kg(-1)). The K/(Ca + Mg) ratio, used as a quality indicator declined to below a 0.5 threshold, but energy yield (Megajoule per kilogram) decreased 13 % by delaying harvest until spring. Only once during the four study-years were conditions ideal for early spring harvest, in contrast during another spring, very muddy conditions resulted in excessive soil contamination. Early spring harvest may be hampered by late snow, lodging, and muddy conditions that may delay or prevent harvest, and result in soil contamination of the feedstock. However, reducing slagging/fouling potential and the mass of mineral nutrients removed from the field without a dramatic loss in biomass or caloric content are reasons to delay harvest until spring.

AB  - Anuran populations are sensitive to changing environmental conditions and act as useful indicators. Presently, much information collected concerning frog populations comes from volunteers following the North American Amphibian Monitoring Protocol. Does weather variability allowed within protocol affect the abundance of calling frogs? For 10 years, Credit Valley Conservation (Ontario, Canada) has been collecting anuran data concerning nine frog species employing three frog monitoring runs. Records include frog abundance by protocol code and five weather variables. Antecedent precipitation and temperature were determined from the nearest weather station. Locations with large source populations of two Hylidae species were selected (spring peeper calling in April and gray tree frog in May). Spearman correlations suggested there were no significant relationships between calling abundance of Hylidae species and ambient wind speed or humidity. However, gray tree frogs were temperature sensitive and calling was significantly related to increased water and air temperatures as well as day time high temperatures over the previous 2 weeks. Both species of calling Hylidae were affected by the volume and timing of precipitation (though, in different ways). Gray tree frogs seem to prefer drier conditions (when temperatures are significantly warmer) while spring peepers prefer to call during, or closely following, precipitation. Monitors targeting gray tree frog should track local weather conditions and focus on evenings when it is (a) warmer than the minimum temperatures and (b) drier than suggested by the protocol. It is recommended that an additional monitoring run could be added to reduce detection variability of this species.

AB  - Testate amoebae are a group of moisture-sensitive, shell-producing protozoa that have been widely used as indicators of changes in mean water-table depth within oligotrophic peatlands. However, short-term environmental variability (i.e., sub-annual) also probably influences community composition. The objective of this study was to assess the potential influence of short-term environmental variability on the composition of testate amoeba communities in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. Testate amoebae and environmental conditions, including hourly measurements of relative humidity within the upper centimeter of the peatland surface, were examined throughout the 2008 growing season at 72 microsites within 11 peatlands of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, USA. Relationships among testate amoeba communities, vegetation, depth to water table, pH, and an index of short-term environmental variability (EVI), were examined using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and correlation analysis. Results suggest that EVI influences testate amoeba communities, with some taxa more abundant under highly variable conditions (e.g., Arcella discoides, Difflugia pulex, and Hyalosphenia subflava) and others more abundant when environmental conditions at the peatland surface were relatively stable (e.g., Archerella flavum and Bullinularia indica). The magnitude of environmental variability experienced at the peatland surface appears to be primarily controlled by vegetation composition and density. In particular, sites with dense Sphagnum cover had lower EVI values than sites with loose-growing Sphagnum or vegetation dominated by vascular plants and/or non-Sphagnum bryophytes. Our results suggest that more environmental information may be inferred from testate amoebae than previously recognized. Knowledge of relationships between testate amoebae and short-term environmental variability should lead to more detailed and refined environmental inferences.

AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux dynamics were examined in the context of other biogeochemical cycles in intertidal sediments inhabited by benthic microalgae. In August 2003, gross oxygenic photosynthetic (GOP) rates, oxygen penetration depths, and benthic flux rates were quantified at seven sites along the Duplin River, GA, USA. Sediments contained abundant benthic microalgal (BMA) biomass with a maximum chlorophyll a concentration of 201 mg chl a m(-2). Oxygen microelectrodes were used to determine GOP rates and O-2 penetration depth, which were tightly correlated with light intensity. Baseline and N-15-nitrate amended benthic flux core incubations were employed to quantify benthic fluxes and to investigate the impact of BMA on sediment water exchange under nitrogen (N)-limited and N-replete conditions. Unamended sediments exhibited tight coupling between GOP and respiration and served as a sink for water column dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and a source of silicate and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The BMA response to the N addition indicated sequential nutrient limitation, with N limitation followed by silicate limitation. In diel (light-dark) incubations, biological assimilation accounted for 83% to 150% of the nitrate uptake, while denitrification (DNF) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) accounted for < 7%; in contrast, under dark conditions, DNF and DNRA accounted for > 40% of the NO3- uptake. The N addition shifted the metabolic status of the sediments from a balance of autotrophy and heterotrophy to net autotrophy under diel conditions, and the sediments served as a sink for water column DIN, silicate, and DIC but became a source of DOC, suggesting that the increased BMA production was decoupled from sediment bacterial consumption of DOC.

AB  - [1] Salt accumulation in soil is a global problem. This paper investigates salt-affected soils on a global scale through spatial modeling within a Geographical information system (GIS). As salt-affected soils arise due to a range of processes that can be very localized and complex in nature, three main indicators have been developed to provide insight into areas at risk of salinization at a global scale. At this scale, climate and topography are the main factors influencing solute accumulation. The paper derives salinity indicators from global data sets and compares them to independent maps of salt-affected areas. The primary indicators are ( 1) low relief, ( 2) high two-way annual moisture flux, and ( 3) local flow deficit in large catchments. The first two of these are related for conditions where there is potential for a large vertical flux of salts, and where groundwater levels may be high, providing conditions for salt accumulation locally or at the base of slope catenas. The third indicator is related to conditions where there is a risk of accumulation of salts in floodplains and adjacent irrigated areas. These salinity indicators are then estimated for future GCM scenarios of climate for 2079 - 2099. Comparison of the current and scenario indicator distributions shows that the areas at risk of salinization may increase globally, through both expansion of existing areas and the creation of new ones. Current distributions of risk, and to a greater extent future scenarios, are limited by the quality and resolution of available data, and have the potential for enhancement as these data improve.

AB  - Cells in liver spheroids and Hep G2 spheroids transferred from gyrotatory culture conditions and maintained in normal static culture conditions will spread out at the edges. Based on this observation, we developed a new test called the Spheroid Cell Spreading Inhibition Test (SCSIT) to screen hepatic cytotoxicity of xenobiotics and determine the spheroid cell spreading inhibition concentration (SCSIC) of test chemicals. Four model hepatoxicants, D-galactosamine, propranolol, diclofenac, and paracetamol, were studied with SCSIT in both rat liver and HepG2 spheroids. Both liver and HepG2 spheroids were prepared under gyrotatory culture conditions and used at 6 days in vitro. The results showed that all four hepatotoxicants tested inhibited cell spreading in liver spheroids (D-galactosamine at 20 mM, propranolol at 125 M, diclofenac at 500 muM, and paracetamol at 25 mM) and HepG2 spheroids (D-galactosamine at 16 mM, propranolol at 125 muM, diclofenac at 500 muM, and paracetamol at 25 mM). The SCSIT results agreed with the conventional cytotoxic indicators, release of LDH and/or gamma-GT and the inhibition of glucose secretion from rat liver spheroids. In conclusion, this study, for the first time, described the biological characteristics of liver and HepG2 spheroid cell spreading and demonstrates its application in hepatic cytotoxicity studies. This method may be used in testing in vitro "acute" toxicity, comparing relative cytotoxicity and generating reference concentrations for subsequent studies. Therefore, SCSIT could be a useful tool for screening hepatotoxicity relevant to preclinical lead optimization and compound library screening. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB  - Applications of drones have increased significantly in the past decade for both indoor and outdoor operations. In order to assist autonomous drone navigation, there are numerous sensors installed onboard the vehicles. These include Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) chipsets, inertial sensors, barometer, lidar, radar and vision sensors. The two sensors used most often by drone autopilot controllers for absolute positioning are the GNSS chipsets and barometer. Although, for most outdoor operations, these sensors provide accurate and reliable position information, their accuracy, availability, and integrity deteriorate for indoor applications and in the presence of radio frequency interference (RFI), such as GNSS spoofing and jamming. Therefore, it is possible to derive network-based locations from Wi-Fi and cellular transmission. Although there have been many theoretical studies on network positioning, limited resources are available for the expected quantitative performance of these positioning methodologies. In this paper, the authors investigate both the horizontal and vertical accuracy of the Android network location engines under rural, suburban, and urban environments. The paper determines the horizontal location accuracy to be approximately 1637 m, 38 m, and 32 m in terms of 68% circular error probable (CEP) for rural, suburban, and urban environments, respectively, and the vertical accuracy to be 1.2 m and 4.6 m in terms of 68% CEP for suburban and urban environments, respectively. In addition, the availability and latency of the location engines are explored. Furthermore, the paper assesses the accuracy of the Android network location accuracy indicator for various drone operation environments. The assessed accuracies of the network locations provide a deeper insight into their potential for drone navigation.

AB  - The detrimental health implications of chemical preservatives in fruits have necessitated exploitation of safe and natural alternatives such as edible gums. This work studied shelf-life extension in grape (Pinot noir) under cold storage by xanthan gum (XAN) coatings enriched with ascorbic acid (XANAS) and citric acid (XANCI). Standard scientific methods were used to examine some sensory (color, texture-resilience and hardness), enzyme, anthocyanine and antioxidant activities. Also, the reaction rate mechanism was examined through modeling of selected shelf-life indicators; color change, weight loss, and antioxidants. The results revealed that, Xanthan gum and its acid modified coatings significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed polyphenol oxidase, ascorbic acid oxidase, polymethyl etherase acitivies and maintained the structural integrity of the grape during the 21 days storage period. Weight loss (%) in the grape samples was 13.66 < 13.98 < 14.16 < 15.64 in the order XANAS < XANCI < XAN < CONTROL whilst ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) activity was 150.23 > 143.18 > 136.49 > 104.5 mg/100 g AEAC corresponding to XAN > XANAS > XANCI > CONTROL. Significantly (p < 0.05) higher phytochemical contents were observed in the gum coatings compared to the control. Through statistical parameters such as the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE) and reduced Chi square (chi(2)), the second-order polynomial model predicted precisely the decomposition of color, weight loss and FRAP of grape. Color deterioration was attributed to changes in b* parameter as a result of phenolics and phytochemical decompositions resulting from enzymatic activities. Conclusively, acid modified xanthan gum coatings could preserve phytochemicals, color, antioxidant and textural properties of grape in cold temperature storage.

AB  - Lack of wastewater treatment efficiency causes receiving seawaters and bivalve molluscan shellfish to become contaminated, which can lead to public health issues. Six wastewater samples, five seawater samples and three batches of giant clams from Tahiti (French Polynesia) were investigated for the presence of enteric viruses, but also if present, for the diversity, infectivity and integrity of human adenoviruses (HAdV). Enteroviruses (EV), sapoviruses (SaV) and human polyomaviruses (HPyV) were detected in all wastewater samples. In decreasing frequency, noroviruses (NoV) GII and HAdV, rotaviruses (RoV), astroviruses (AsV), NoV GI and finally hepatitis E viruses (HEV) were also observed. Nine types of infectious HAdV were identified. HPyV and EV were found in 80% of seawater samples, NoV GII in 60%, HAdV and SaV in 40% and AsV and RoV in 20%. NoV GI and HEV were not detected in seawater. Intact and infectious HAdV-41 were detected in one of the two seawater samples that gave a positive qPCR result. Hepatitis A viruses were never detected in any water types. Analysis of transcriptomic data from giant clams revealed homologues of fucosyltransferases (FUT genes) involved in ligand biosynthesis that strongly bind to certain NoV strains, supporting the giant clams ability to bioaccumulate NoV. This was confirmed by the presence of NoV GII in one of the three batches of giant clams placed in a contaminated marine area. Overall, all sample types were positive for at least one type of virus, some of which were infectious and therefore likely to cause public health concerns.

AB  - Subsurface elevated temperatures (SETs) often occur in landfills and pose great threats to their structural and environmental integrity. Current landfill gas monitoring practices only recommend maintaining certain soil gases percentages, with no integrated strategy for predicting subsurface temperature. As a solution, this paper proposes a comprehensive risk assessment framework specific to SET mitigation. The risk model (R-SET) was constructed by incorporating independent gas variables (methane, carbon dioxide, oxygen, residual nitrogen, and temperature) identified in the existing literature as SET indicators, and analyzing gas-well data from the Bridgeton Landfill. Upon identifying these gas indictors and their safety thresholds, we found a significant association (p-value < 0.05) between safeunsafe ranges of gas variables and subsurface temperature. Temperatures above 80 degrees C were found to be associated with 100%, 92.3%, and only 4% of the unsafe ranges of methane, residual nitrogen, and oxygen, respectively. As the correlation between gases and temperature seemed to vary for different gas combinations, we developed the R-SET by incorporating into these correlation coefficients event intensities specific to certain gas combinations, and then normalizing the R-SET scale over a 0-10 range. Over the study period, we identified 22.29% of cases as medium risk at the Bridgeton Landfill and 17.7% as high risk. SETs are governed by different combinations of safe-unsafe ranges of parameters rather than any individual parameters alone. Subsequently, we used a decision tree algorithm to assess the risk types associated with R-SET values. The proposed R-SET can serve as a monitoring and decision-making tool for landfill authorities for managing and preventing SET incidents. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Because diatom communities are subject to the prevailing water quality in the Great Lakes coastal environment, diatom-based indices can be used to support coastal-monitoring programs and paleoecological studies. Diatom samples were collected from Great Lakes coastal wetlands, embayments, and high-energy sites (155 sites), and assemblages were characterized to the species level. We defined 42 metrics on the basis of autecological and functional properties of species assemblages, including species diversity, motile species, planktonic species, proportion dominant taxon, taxonomic metrics (e.g., proportion Stephanodiscoid taxa), and diatom-inferred (DI) water quality (e.g., DI chloride [Cl]). Redundant metrics were eliminated, and a diatom-based multimetric index (MMDI) to infer coastline disturbance was developed. Anthropogenic stresses in adjacent coastal watersheds were characterized using geographic information system (GIS) data related to agricultural and urban land cover and atmospheric deposition. Fourteen independent diatom metrics had significant regressions with watershed stressor data; these metrics were selected for inclusion in the MMDI. The final MMDI was developed as the weighted sum of the selected metric scores with weights based on a metric's ability to reflect anthropogenic stressors in the adjacent watersheds. Despite careful development of the multimetric approach, verification using a test set of sites indicated that the MMDI was not able to predict watershed stressors better than some of the component metrics. From this investigation, it was determined that simpler, more traditional diatom-based metrics (e.g., DI Cl, proportion Cl-tolerant species, and DI total phosphorus [TP]) provide superior prediction of overall stressor influence at coastal locales.

AB  - Given the impact of livestock on ecosystems worldwide, it is necessary to understand the effects of grazing practices on biodiversity in order to improve the sustainability of pasture management practices. In a pasture, spatio-temporal variability in livestock activity results in a heterogeneous distribution of defoliation, trampling and excreta. To date, fine-scale analyses of grazing intensity have been rare, and the geographical extent of the studies often limited. In this study, we addressed this gap by analysing the influence of contrasting intra-pasture grazing intensity on the structure and composition of dung beetle assemblages. To do this, we studied a three-level grazing intensity gradient in two distinct bioclimatic contexts, a Mediterranean steppe and the Alps, which also allowed us to determine if dung beetle responses to grazing intensity are related to bioclimatic conditions. The observed dung beetle responses showed an imprint of the bioclimatic context and the local pasture conditions, and species composition and relative abundance showed strong variations along the grazing intensity gradient in both study areas. Species assemblages from the most and least grazed parts of pastures differed strongly. By altering habitat conditions, changing dung availability and modifying competitive interactions, fine-scale heterogeneity in grazing intensity led to substantial variations in the abundance of dung beetle nesting guilds. In both study areas an increase in grazing intensity was detrimental to the largest species and the soil-digging species (which bury dung in underground nests), whereas dung-dwelling species (which reproduce inside dung pads) were favoured. We discuss the combined use of nesting guilds and body mass as potential features to generalize the application of dung beetles as indicators of grazing practices.

AB  - This study examines the integrated influence of sea level rise (SLR) and future morphology on tidal hydrodynamics along the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) coast including seven embayments and three ecologically and economically significant estuaries. A large-domain hydrodynamic model was used to simulate astronomic tides for present and future conditions (circa 2050 and 2100). Future conditions were simulated by imposing four SLR scenarios to alter hydrodynamic boundary conditions and updating shoreline position and dune heights using a probabilistic model that is coupled to SLR. Under the highest SLR scenario, tidal amplitudes within the bays increased as much as 67% (10.0cm) because of increases in the inlet cross-sectional area. Changes in harmonic constituent phases indicated that tidal propagation was faster in the future scenarios within most of the bays. Maximum tidal velocities increased in all of the bays, especially in Grand Bay where velocities doubled under the highest SLR scenario. In addition, the ratio of the maximum flood to maximum ebb velocity decreased in the future scenarios (i.e., currents became more ebb dominant) by as much as 26% and 39% in Weeks Bay and Apalachicola, respectively. In Grand Bay, the flood-ebb ratio increased (i.e., currents became more flood dominant) by 25% under the lower SLR scenarios, but decreased by 16% under the higher SLR as a result of the offshore barrier islands being overtopped, which altered the tidal prism. Results from this study can inform future storm surge and ecological assessments of SLR, and improve monitoring and management decisions within the NGOM.

AB  - Thirty-nine bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes were tested for their tolerance to late season drought stress during 2011 and 2012. The experiment was conducted under two different irrigation conditions of (a) normal irrigation and (b) late season drought stress, where irrigation was cut off after heading stage. Each of the two experiments was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The combined analysis of variance showed significant difference among genotypes, environments and genotype x environment interaction. Eleven drought tolerance indices including stress susceptibility index (SSI), tolerance index (TOL), mean production (MP), stress tolerance index (STI), harmonic mean (HM), relative drought index (RDI), geometric mean production (GMP), yield index (YI), yield stability index (YSI), drought resistance index (DI), and stress susceptibility percentage index (SSPI) were calculated based on grain yield under drought (Ys) and irrigated conditions (Yp). Yield under stress (Ys) and non-stress (Yp) conditions were significantly and positively correlated with STI, GMP, MP, HM and YI in both years. Results showed that indices of stress tolerance/resistance such as STI, GMP, MP, HM and YI can be used as the most suitable indicators for screening drought-tolerant cultivars. Screening drought-tolerant cultivars using ranking method discriminated cultivars Akbari, Roshan and Alvand as the most drought-tolerant in both years. Other cultivars identified as drought-tolerant were Kavir, Ws-82-9, Hirmand, Moghan2, Dez, Star, and Atrak in the first year, and Pishtaz, Sardari, Qods, Azadi, Toos, Sabalan, Shole and Tajan in the second year. In terms of mean yield and drought tolerance indices, genotype Alvand (3.44 t ha(-1)) was identified as the most favorable candidate.

AB  - Sexual selection promotes the evolution of signals, many of which can reliably indicate condition, health or good genes of individuals. In order to be evolutionarily stable, indicator signals must be costly to produce. Carotenoid colouration evolved in many species by sexual selection. Carotenoids besides acting as pigments have been implicated in immune defence and antioxidation which makes them likely candidates for honest signalling. A trade-off for carotenoid availability was proposed as the basis for signal honesty. Alternatively, it was suggested that carotenoid colouration is not advertising the presence of the pigment per se, but the quality of antioxidant resources which then affect carotenoid concentration. One possibility is that carotenoid-based colouration could signal colourless antioxidant mechanisms, which are partially regulated by vitamins. beta-Carotene is one of the most common precursors of vitamin A and, although present in bird diet, is not available for feather colouration. If an indirect association exists between carotenoid signal and condition, then manipulation of beta-carotene concentration could reveal that this link is indirect. We tested this by conditioning the availability of beta-carotene in the diet of a cardueline finch with yellow carotenoid colouration during moult. beta-Carotene-supplemented males had higher plasma carotenoid concentration and higher response to a cellular immunity challenge (phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)) than control males. beta-Carotene-supplemented males also had more saturated plumage colouration and were preferred by females in a mate choice test. Our results support the possibility of an indirect role for yellow carotenoid colouration.

AB  - In a context of global change, climate impacts can trigger defoliation processes in different forest species. The ICP Forests network estimates the level of forest defoliation over time in different European countries. Those data are used to related defoliation with potential causal factors. In European Southwestern forests, climate change appears to be the detonating factor of generalized defoliation. The objectives of this study were: (i) identity defoliation trends in forest trees at network of Spanish ICP Forests monitoring plots and, (ii) find out if there are underlying climate factors that trigger defoliation process along the time.
   The spatiotemporal synchronization of the defoliation response was analyzed with cross-correlation using COFECHA software. The relationship between the 88 climatic variables proposed and defoliation was analyzed using Correlated Component Regression models (CCR models) and Discriminant Analysis (DA). The significance of the variables in each model was compared using contingency tables. A peak of defoliation was observed in the mid-1990s with no recovered to the initial values of the early 1990s. The behavior of the different tree species with respect to defoliation, synchronized both in time and space, involves one or several factors that have a general and similar effect on forests in Spain. The most significant factors related to defoliation were the thermal-related factors, particularly average temperatures in April and June and the thermal oscillation of both the current year and the previous year. Only one drought indicator as statistically significant was identified (A, duration of aridity in months) and suggests that it is of limited relevance in the Spanish forest defoliation conditions.

AB  - Current challenges of humanity require a new paradigm for animal production, and invest time and attention to the development of new production techniques that take into account the principles of sustainability and animal welfare science. To do this, we must be committed to promoting animal welfare and health, ensure environmental sustainability, consumer satisfaction and profitability for producers. To change our relationship with animals there is no need for changes in market conditions or large investments, it is enough to know better the needs of the animals we raise, the management system adapted to its characteristics. Even in the most favorable management conditions, on farms that have technological resources and trained personnel, there is much to change, especially in the daily management of the animals. Some of the risks more evident in the traditional systems of beef production are: problems during parturition, morbidity and mortality of calves, lack of shade in the pastures, improper handling of animals, risk of injury, inadequate infrastructure, poor management practices during routine processing (marking, castration, vaccination, dehorning), poor welfare during loading, transport, unloading and slaughter. To remedy this, you can adopt good management practices, which have been shown to reduce risk and improve the welfare of cattle in different stages of the production chain. The objective of this review is to show some of the risks that reduce the welfare of cattle and examples of how the adoption of best management practices impact on improving the productivity of these production systems. Finally, some indicators for assessing welfare in production systems are shown.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to assess the impact of surface application of different levels of crop residue on predominant biological soil health indicators and release of CO2 fluxes from the surface soil as a result of microbial respiration under minimum tillage conditions. The experiment was conducted in a rainfed Semi-Arid Tropical (SAT) Alfisol at Hayathnagar Research Farm of Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad. Studies indicated that an application of 6 t ha(-1) of sorghum stover recorded significantly highest microbial biomass carbon of 177.11 and 167.83 mu g g(-1) of soil and highest DHA (Dehydrogenase Assay) of 2.49 and 1.74 mu g TPF g(-1) hr(-1) at surface and subsurface layers respectively. Similarly, the activity of arylsulphatase was also significantly influenced by residue application and was highest at 6 t ha(-1) plot (150.755 mu g PNP g(-1) hr(-1)) irrespective of soil depth. The activities of other soil enzymes such as urease, acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase were also significantly influenced at both the soil depths by graded levels of residue applications. On an average. quantitatively, biological soil quality indicators attained higher values in surface soil compared to subsurface soils. The CO2 flux significantly increased with the increasing levels of surface applied sorghum crop residue upto 4t ha(-1) under minimum tillage conditions. Thus, the biological soil quality indicators were significantly influenced with residue application under minimum tillage in these Alfisols.

AB  - Theoretically, plants growing under stress conditions, such as in saline or waterlogged conditions, should behave with (CO2)-C-13 discrimination and have different delta C-13 values. Therefore, this experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of factors such as salinity and hypoxia in affecting delta values of Puccinellia ciliata and Balansa clover (Trifolium michclianum Savi. Var balansae boiss). This study reveals that these two species (C-3 plants) behave differently and B. clover has more positive delta C-13 values (7.6%) compared to P. ciliata. The overall average of delta C-13 were -28.85 and -26.66 parts per thousand, respectively, for P. ciliata and B. clover. The delta C-13 values for the shoots and roots of the two species also have different values (more positive values in roots compared to shoots). Waterlogging and salinity have a significant affect on (CO2)-C-13 discrimination and, statistically, these effects on delta C-13 values are significant (p < 0.001). This means that environmental factors, such as salinity and waterlogging, create a situation for plants in which the discriminate rate against delta C-13 would be changed (less discrimination for hypoxia and more for salinity conditions). The combined effects on species and plant parts of waterlogging and salinity are not statistically insignificant on delta C-13 values, however, each factor separately has a significant effect on delta C-13 values. P. ciliata was grown in different seasons (summer and winter) and showed significant differences in delta C-13 values (by almost 4%). The carbon content (%) of the two species was different, but, were not related to delta C-13, respectively.

AB  - Purpose There is growing interest in the concept of 'deaths of despair' (DoD)-defined as deaths from three causes: suicide, drug poisoning, and alcohol-related conditions-as a more comprehensive indicator of the impact of psychological distress on mortality. The purpose of this study is to investigate the degree of commonality in trends and geographic patterning of deaths from these causes in England and Wales. Methods WHO mortality data were used to calculate age-standardised, sex-specific temporal trends in DoD mortality and in mortality from suicide, drug poisonings, and alcohol-related conditions in England and Wales, 2001-2016. Three-year average crude rates were calculated for English local authorities for 2016-2018 and associations between rates were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation. Results Between 2001 and 2016, the DoD mortality rate increased by 21 center dot 6% (males) and 16 center dot 9% (females). The increase was largely due to a rise in drug poisoning deaths, with limited tracking between trends in mortality by each cause. DoD mortality risk was highest in middle-aged people; there were rises in all age groups except 15-24 year old males and 65 + females. There were strong positive correlations (r = 0.66(males) and 0.60(females)) between local authority-area drug poisoning and alcohol-specific mortality rates in 2016-2018. Correlations of these outcomes with suicide were weaker (r = 0.29-0.54). Conclusions DoD mortality is increasing in England and Wales but there is limited evidence of commonality in the epidemiology of cause-specific mortality from the component causes of DoD (suicide, drug poisoning and alcohol-related conditions), indicating the need for tailored prevention for each outcome.

AB  - Background A significant proportion of variation in likelihood of neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) has been attributed to nonshared environmental (NSE) factors, although it remains unclear which NSE factors pose specific risks for certain NDCs. Methods A monozygotic co-twin design was applied in a sample of 224 twins (mean age = 17.70 years, SD = 6.28) controlling for confounders such as genes and shared environment. Generalized estimating equation models were fitted, using perinatal and postnatal indications of NSEs as exposure, operationalized both as separate risk factors and as cumulative risk loads. Categorical and dimensional operationalizations of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability and other NDCs were used as outcomes. Results Birth weight discordance was associated with dimensional autism and ADHD for the smaller twin, and medication during infancy was associated with dimensional autism. Among postnatal factors scarlet fever during early childhood was associated with lower IQ. Especially autism was associated with a greater cumulative perinatal or postnatal risk load. Limitations When exploring the associations between each condition and specific NSEs the risk of being statistically underpowered increases. Hence, we limit the reported findings on specific indicators of NSEs to trait levels and present descriptive data for categorical NDCs. Conclusions The findings support previous research by indicating an association between exposure to perinatal and postnatal risks and subsequent NDCs within twin pairs and suggest that autism may be especially linked to accumulative early environmental risks. The findings are potentially important for developmental outcomes prognoses and may inform targeted prevention and early interventions.

AB  - The grazing lands of the High Atlas are vulnerable to climate change and the decline of traditional management practices. However, prior to the mid-20th century, there is little information to examine historical environmental change and resilience to past climate variability. Here, we present a new pollen, non-pollen palynomorph (NPP) and microcharcoal record from a sub-alpine marsh (pozzine) at Oukaimeden, located in the Marrakech High Atlas, Morocco. The record reveals a history of grazing impacts with diverse non-arboreal pollen assemblages dominant throughout the record as well as recurrent shifts between wetter and drier conditions. A large suite of radiocarbon dates (n = 22) constrains the deposit to the last similar to 1,000 years although multiple reversed ages preclude development of a robust age-depth model for all intervals. Between relatively dry conditions during the Medieval period and in the 20th century, intervening wet conditions are observed, which we interpret as a locally enhanced snowpack during the Little Ice Age. Hydrological fluctuations evidenced by wetland pollen and NPPs are possibly associated with centennial-scale precipitation variability evidenced in regional speleothem records. The pollen record reveals an herbaceous grassland flora resilient against climatic fluctuations through the last millennium, possibly supported by sustainable collective management practices (agdal), with grazing indicators suggesting a flourishing pastoral economy. However, during the 20th century, floristic changes and increases in charcoal accumulation point to a decline in management practices, diversification of land-use (including afforestation) and intensification of human activity.

AB  - Sediment record collected from the coastal lake serves as a powerful tool for reconstructing changes in palaeoenvironment and understanding the potential signals of past storminess. In this study, we use several proxies from sediment of the Holocene Thermal Maximum at coastal Lake Lilaste, Latvia. We focus on surface texture of quartz grains from the mineral inorganic fraction as indicators of depositional environments. We then use this as a proxy for potential storm transport and combine with information on granulometry, diatom stratigraphy and chronology to answer the question whether flux of quartz grains in the lake originated from the sea or from the land. Analyses in a binocular and scanning electron microscope reveal that most of the investigated quartz grains originate from dwelling in the seawater and wave action in the nearshore zone. Grains representing very energetic subaqueous environment similar to storm events are also present. Terrestrial record is of minor significance and visible through occurrence of aeolian quartz grains.
   During drier and colder conditions, an influx of sand with aeolian imprint was delivered to the lake between 8500 and 7800 cal yr BR. Marine and terrestrial conditions alternated between 7800 and 6000 cal yr BR Storm-induced grains were likely deposited three times: at 7300 cal yr BP, 6600 6400 cal yr BP, and 6200-6000 cal yr BP. Overall stable marine environmental conditions prevailed between 6000 and 4000 cal yr BP except of the last portion of terrestrial-induced sediment at 4100 cal yr BP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biopiles can be used to dispose of slaughterhouse residuals (SLRs); however, the fate of pathogenic bacteria (e.g., pathogenic strains of Eschericia coli, Streptococcus fecalis) in these systems is not well understood. The transport of these bacteria in water leaching from the biopile could represent a significant contamination source. This research examined the transport of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae indicator bacteria from SLR biopiles. Three biopiles (2.6 m wide by 4.6 m long by 1.8 m high) were formed on soil layers in concrete cells that allowed for real-time monitoring of environmental parameters, hydrologic flux, and indicator bacteria levels in effluent leaching from the piles. In biopile effluent, indicator bacteria populations decreased exponentially following biopile formation. Indicator bacteria loads in effluent constituted <0.01% of the initial indicator bacteria levels in the biopiles, which was attributed to retention, inactivation, and death. Nearly 90% of the total indicator bacteria loads coincided with large precipitation events (>15 mm d(-1)). Movement of the indicator bacteria through the biopiles and underlying soil appeared to be consistent with preferential flow phenomena. The populations of the Enterobacteriaceae indicators remained low in conditions of higher soil water content and lower biopile temperatures, whereas the Enterococcaceae indicator appeared to regrow in these conditions. This indicated that bacterial pathogen transport from a biopile could be a concern after the disappearance of conventional bacterial indicators, such as E. coli. Management considerations should attempt to divert excess water from entering a biopile, such as locating a biopile under a roof. Unsaturated biopile and soil conditions should be maintained to impede water flow through preferential pathways in the soil underneath a biopile.

AB  - The nearshore phosphorus shunt hypothesis and the potential for mussels to excrete phosphorus sufficient to meet the growth requirements of Cladophora are now well accepted by scientists studying Great Lakes biogeochemistry. The response of algal growth to near bottom water column phosphorus concentrations and the interplay between excretion and mass transport in yielding those concentrations have, however, not been elucidated. Here we present soluble reactive phosphorus profiles from the near bottom environment of Lake Michigan at a site near Good Harbor Bay, Michigan, where both mussels and Cladophora were present. Soluble reactive phosphorus was observed to accumulate under quiescent conditions, establishing a concentration boundary layer (CBL), 5-15 cm thick, with near bottom concentrations on the order of 2-8 mu g P/L. A one-dimensional model was applied to determine mass transport conditions mediating the transition from CBL formation to CBL destruction. Significant wave height (SWH) was used as an indicator of mass transport intensity, and it was determined that the formation/destruction transition occurred at a SWH of 0.2 mat the 8-m study site depth. The Great Lakes Cladophora Model was applied to determine the time intervals required to saturate (1 day with the CBL present) and deplete (14 days with the CBL absent) algal internal P stores.

AB  - Glyoxalase system, particularly glyoxalase I (Gly I) plays an important role in regulation of cell division and is considered to be a metabolic indicator of cell proliferation. The glyoxalase system is likely to have a close link with cellular radiosensitivity. Therefore, we have examined the effect of adaptive and split-dose of gamma -rays on the activity of Gly I in the liver and spleen of mice. For the adaptive response studies, mice pre-treated with a conditioning dose of 0.5 Gy were given a challenging dose of 4 Gy at varying time intervals. In the split-dose studies, a dose of 4 Gy was delivered into two equal fractions and spaced at different time intervals. The results show that pre-exposure to a conditioning dose or the fractionation of total dose decreased the specific activity of Gly I in the liver and spleen of mice. The decreased activity of Gly I was suggestive of protective action induced by the conditioning dose and fractionation of dose. The similar pattern of radiation response of Gly I probably supported the possibility of involvement of a common pathway in the radiation-induced adaptive and split-dose effect. From these observations a close link between the Gly I and the adaptive-response as well as the split-dose effect is speculated. Since, the glyoxalase system is vital for a variety of biological functions including cell division and repair, the present findings may have relevance in understanding the dose-fractionation as well as the biological defence induced by low doses of radiations.

AB  - Previous model studies suggested that ambient measurements of key chemical species and ratios of species could be used to assess the sensitivities of ozone formation to reductions in precursor emissions. Threshold values of these indicator species and ratios, delineating the transition between VOC and NOx sensitivity, were proposed. Subsequently, measurement studies have assumed the universality of these threshold criteria and have compared local observed indicators with previously established criteria to assess ozone sensitivities. In this study the concept of indicator species is extended to combinations of observable species that are consistently associated with different site characteristics (e.g., ozone sensitivities and emissions features). The results of SARMAP Air Quality Model (SAQM) simulations in the San Joaquin Valley, California, are used to investigate the applicability of indicators to assess ozone sensitivities and emissions features. The use of three indicator ratios (O-3/(NOy-NOx), HCHO/NOy, and H2O2/HNO3) alone with SAQM-derived threshold criteria a found to be effective for identifying VOC- or NOx-sensitive regimes. NOy and (NOy-NOx)/NOy are found to be useful in describing emission features and threshold criteria are derived by SAQM prediction. SAQM-derived threshold criteria for assessing ozone sensitivities are found to differ from threshold criteria proposed by previous studies using different models and under different conditions. Such differences suggest that threshold criteria are likely to be dependent on locations and environmental conditions, including emission patterns and rates. Therefore local observed indicator species and ratios can be used to determine ozone sensitivities only if appropriate threshold criteria have been derived for the local conditions.

AB  - The Mooroton shear zone (MSZ) of the Metasedimentary Belt of the Grenville Orogen in Ontario separates the Mazinaw domain to the east from the Elzevir domain. The shear zone is composed of mafic metavolcanic, metaclastic, and marble mylonites, and is characterized by a subvertical foliation, which crosscuts the regional foliation, and a near-vertical stretching lineation. Microstructures indicate deformation occurred under crystal-plastic conditions, and shear-sense indicators give movement of east (Mazinaw) side up. The geometry of the MSZ, which follows the eastern margin of the Elzevir tonalite, implies that lithologic anisotropy guided its location. Garnet-biotite and garnet-hornblende peak temperature are juxtaposed across the MSZ, with temperatures ranging from 460 to 530 degrees C in the southeastern Elzevir and 490 to 620 degrees C in the southwestern Mazinaw, conditions in amphibolite facies. Limiting barometers applied to rocks in both domains show no significant offset. Petrologic data within the shear zone show that deformation occurred at amphibolite-facies conditions. New and previously published hornblende Ar-40/Ar-39 ages around the shear zone range from 927 +/- 3 to 1006 +/- 3 Ma, and show no systematic offset; similarly, muscovite Ar-40/Ar-39 ages in the area cluster around ca. 900 Ma. These combined data indicate that displacement had ceased along the MSZ by the time the rocks cooled through the closure temperature of hornblende (i.e., before ca. 1000 Ma), and most likely before the last regional metamorphism in the area (i.e., ca. 1030 Ma). Thus the Elzevir and Mazinaw domains acted as a coherent tectonic unit during at least the later part of the Grenville orogenic cycle.

AB  - Initial susceptibility studies of Bilophila wadsworthia indicated significant resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics, including imipenem and cefoxitin. No beta-lactamase production was detected. However, some B. wadsworthia strains may grow as a heavy "haze" at up to the highest concentration of an antibiotic on standard antimicrobial agent-containing plates, and it is often difficult to determine the point at which conventional growth stops and haze growth begins. We investigated the nature of the haze growth of B. wadsworthia by using triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) as an indicator of viability during antimicrobial susceptibility testing, by determining viability counts on antimicrobial agent-containing plates at various times, and by microscopically inspecting stained preparations of the growth on the control plate and the haze area. TTC MICs were determined by applying a TTC solution over the growth on plates inside the anaerobic chamber or within 5 min after exposure to air (aerobic TTC MICs). The haze growth reduced TTC in the chamber but not under aerobic conditions, whereas TTC was reduced by the conventional growth in both atmospheres. The aerobic TTC MICs correlated with the viability counts. Separated proteins resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing showed TTC-reactive bands only when stained under anaerobic conditions, further demonstrating the sensitivity of TTC reduction to aerobic conditions. Microscopic examination of the haze growth indicated spheroplast formation. A new antibiogram for B. wadsworthia has been established by use of aerobic TTC endpoints; we believe that the lower MICs obtained with the TTC method are likely the ones that are clinically relevant and should be used in tests of B. wadsworthia. Also, we found that when the organisms were grown on pyruvate-containing medium, 87% of 56 strains tested were beta-lactamase positive.

AB  - Today's world places increasing emphasis on comfort within living spaces. The growth in awareness of energy conservation and environmental preservation has gradually contributed to the widespread use of smart home control systems. In this study, data related to human comfort conditions were compiled, and the control of smart devices in home environments was explored. Specifically, information communication technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) were combined to create a smart control system that creates a comfortable, energy-conserving home environment through the concurrent monitoring of both indoor and outdoor environmental data. If the outdoor indicators are ideal (denoting a comfortable environment) but the indoor indicators are not ideal (denoting an uncomfortable environment), the system opens a window to allow the incorporation of favorable outdoor environmental factors into the indoor environment. When the outdoor environment is uncomfortable, the window is closed to prevent the infiltration of unfavorable outdoor environmental factors. When the indoor indicators are nonideal, various types of equipment are activated according to the detection values. For example, when the humidity level is overly high, the dehumidifier is turned on. When the concentration of particulate matter with a diameter of < 2.5 mu m is overly high, the air purifier is turned on. When the temperature is too high or low, the air conditioner is turned on, and when the CO2 concentration is too high, the fan is turned on for ventilation. The values detected by each sensor and the operating conditions of each device are also displayed on the screen for the reference of the user, who can adjust the threshold values to their preferences.

AB  - The production of exfoliated MoS2 via lithium intercalation has been widely used to prepare IT polytype dominated MoS2 (1T-MoS2) monolayers. These metallic single layers hold promise as high-performance electrodes for various electrochemical applications as well as for direct conversion to the semiconducting 2H polytype (2H-MoS2), a material of significant interest for next-generation electronics and optoelectronics. The performance in these applications is largely determined by defects introduced during processing. In this work, we systematically investigate the degradation rate and products resulting from the aging of aqueous MoS2 dispersions, obtained by chemical exfoliation under a variety of common processing conditions. Depending on the size and number of defects initially present in the material, the resulting MoS2 is found to have a surprisingly short half-life of only 2 to 6 days under alkaline conditions and exposure to both light and air. By aging samples under various environments and analyzing by UV-vis, Raman, Fourier-transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, we demonstrate that light-induced generation of superoxide by MoS2 is largely responsible for its oxidation (both 1T and 2H polytypes are affected equally). This process is accelerated under alkaline conditions because of the solubility of MoO3, which we suggest would otherwise passivate defects and edge sites. The soluble molybdates are found to be a strong indicator of oxidation, which can easily be followed by measuring the absorption at 209 nm using UV-vis spectroscopy. We hope that this work will help guide researchers in minimizing or controlling degradation, which will accelerate the successful use of MoS2 in applications.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine genotypic variation among sorghum cultivars grown under similar ecological conditions for seed vigor, salt (NaCl) and drought stresses. A seedling survival test was also performed in a pod experiment to investigate genotypic differences in terms of sorghum drought tolerance. In seven sorghum cultivars, seed vigor was determined using electrical conductivity and accelerated ageing tests. Also, germination rate and seedling growth of these cultivars were evaluated under salt and drought stress induced by PEG 6000 at water potentials of 0.0 (distilled water), -1.8, -3.6, -7.2 and -10.8 bar. The results showed that there was a significant difference in seed vigor of sorghum cultivars grown at same ecological conditions. Akdari produced more vigorous seeds than the other cultivars. The significant relationship between accelerated ageing and laboratory emergence (r= 0.967**), and between electrical conductivity and germination percentage (r= -0.873**) were determined. The suitable tests for germination and emergence potential in sorghum were electrical conductivity and accelerated ageing, respectively. Increasing NaCl and PEG levels inhibited germination and seedling growth. Germination, root length and shoot length were higher, whereas mean germination time was lower, in NaCl solution compared to in PEG solution at the same water potential. In salt, drought and seedling survival tests, Aldari showed the better performance than the others. It could be concluded that seed vigor is not a reliable indicator of germination performance under salt and drought stress conditions and that genetic differences may play an important role in stress tolerance.

AB  - The Cambrian radiation of complex animals is a fundamental event in the history of life on Earth. Much of our understanding of this event is made possible through the study of exceptionally preserved fossils in Burgess Shale-type (BST) deposits. Based on bioturbation levels in BST deposits, they are often interpreted as representing restricted oxygen settings. This study tests the low-oxygen interpretation through analysis of geochemical paleoredox proxies and bioturbation levels in three BST deposits: the early Cambrian Maotianshan Shale (China), the middle Cambrian Wheeler Shale (USA), and the middle Cambrian Spence Shale (USA). Results from 96 samples show fine-scale geochemical evidence for oxic bottom water conditions during the deposition of these three BST deposits. Trace element paleoredox indices (PI) give consistent oxic signals in all three shales. In addition, total organic carbon (TOC) and total sulfur (TS) levels in the Spence Shale are extremely low. The average C/S ratio is 3.1, comparable to values for modern oxic marine water. Bioturbation levels in all three shales are low, with rare development of minimal to moderate horizontal bioturbation. While short-term oxygen fluctuations, or poildloaerobic conditions, could still have sporadically existed in these settings, this study shows that these BST deposits were deposited in a dominantly oxic paleoredox setting. Evidence for low bioturbation levels coupled with paleoredox geochemistry indicative of oxic bottom waters suggests that pervasive exaerobic conditions, with an oxic water column positioned above oxygen-depleted sediment pore waters, may have existed in many Cambrian BST deposit paleoenvironments.

AB  - The lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation, a widespread black shale deposition, is of geological interest because of its polymetallic beds, Cambrian explosion, depositional ages, dramatic environmental changes and so on. Previous study focused mainly on inorganic geochemistry and few studies have investigated the organic fractions of upper Neoproterozoic-lower Cambrian strata in South China. Here we report a study of biomarkers plus organic carbon isotopes for black shales from Ganziping, Hunan Province (China). All the saturated hydrocarbon fractions have a unimodal distribution of n-alkanes, a high content of short-chain alkanes and maximize at C19 or C20 (C23 for sample Gzh001). The C27/C29 sterane ratio ranges from 0.77 to 1.20 and 4-methylsteranes are in low abundance. These parameters indicate that algae and bacteria are the important primary producers. Furthermore, biomarker maturity proxies show the samples to be higher maturity. The low Pr/Ph values (<0.7) suggest that the samples were deposited under anoxic conditions and, likely, under stratified water columns. In addition, 25-norhopanes and gammacerane are present as diagnostic indicators of normal marine salinity and dysoxic to anoxic conditions. During the Early Tommotian, known to coincide with a transgression event, small shelly fossils increased in abundance and diversity. Moreover, positive delta 13Corg excursions close to 1.4 parts per thousand occur at the base of the Tommotian stage. In summary, the Early Cambrian black shales were deposited under dramatic paleoenvironmental changes, including oceanic anoxia, higher primary productivity and sea-level rise.

AB  - Photoresponsive behavior in phytoplanktonic flagellates potentially controls depth regulation, vertical migration, and the accumulation of cells in preferred conditions and hence has major implications for photosynthesis, growth, and species competition. This study used microscale laboratory chambers with cell track analysis and mesoscale lake studies to investigate the responses of five phylogenetically contrasting freshwater flagellates to gradients of light. Laboratory results demonstrated that these species differed in their light preferences despite being grown at the same photon irradiance. Preferred photon irradiances were 20-120, 20, 65-120, 4-20, and>200 mumol photons.m(-2) .s(-1) , respectively, for Ceratium furcoides (Levander) Langhans, Chlamydomonas moewusii Gerloff, Dinobryon sertularia Ehrenberg, Euglena gracilis Klebs, and Plagioselmis nannoplanctica (Skuja) Novarino. Analysis of the response of individual cells showed that in all species, photoresponsive preference was the result of positive and negative phototaxis combined with step-up and step-down photophobic reactions. There was no evidence for photokinesis or cell memory. Only in C. furcoides did the preferred photon irradiance alter with growth conditions. In C. furcoides , D. sertularia , and P. nannoplanctica , irradiance preference matched the optimal irradiance for growth, whereas in the two remaining species a lower than optimal irradiance was preferred, suggesting that light may be used as an indicator of other ecological conditions. Mesoscale experiments in a lake demonstrated that the laboratory microscale measurements provide information relevant to understanding ecological distributions. Behavioral responses to light contribute to the delineation of vertical niche separation and provide a method for predicting the spatial and temporal distribution of flagellates.

AB  - Prostate specific antigen (PSA, also known as human kallikrein 3) is an important diagnostic indicator of prostatic disease. PSA exhibits low protease activity (> 10(4)-fold less than chymotrypsin) under the usual in vitro assay conditions. In addition, PSA does not react readily with prototypical serine protease inactivators. We expressed human PSA (rh-PSA) in Escherichia coli and have demonstrated that rh-PSA has properties similar to those of native PSA isolated from human seminal fluid. Both PSA and rh-PSA are > 10(3)-fold more active in the presence of 1.3 M Na2SO4. This activation is anion-dependent, following the Hofmeister series when normality is considered: SO42- approximate to citrate > Ac- > Cl- > Br- > I-. The nature of the cation has little effect on salt activation. The rate of inactivation of rh-PSA by DFP is 30-fold faster in the presence of 0.9 M Na2SO4, and the rate of inactivation by Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-CK is > 20-fold faster under these conditions. Azapeptides containing Phe or Tyr at position P, also inactivate rh-PSA in the presence of high salt concentrations. These compounds represent the first described inhibitors designed to utilize the substrate binding subsites of PSA. CD spectroscopy demonstrates that the conformation of rh-PSA changes in the presence of high salt concentrations. Analytical ultracentifugation and dynamic light scattering indicate that PSA remains monomeric under high-salt conditions. Interestingly, human prostatic fluid contains as much as 150 mu mol citrate/g wet weight, which suggests that salt concentrations may regulate PSA activity in vivo.

AB  - Coalbed gas (CBG) is a form of new energy with a large resource potential. The 813C1 is an important indicator in trace CBG origins and thermal evolution degrees. However, regarding CBG 813C1 as a genetic tracer still exists uncertainty. Here, we systematically studied the distribution characteristics, variation mechanisms and applications of the 813C1 of CBG samples produced under different conditions. The study shows CBG 813C1 are highly variable and complex. The 813C1 are from - 79.5%0 to - 10.1%0, and the correlation between 813C1 and Ro is week. The 813C1 of the production gas and coal core desorption gas are stable and could be used as an effective genetic tracer. The 813C1 of the mining coal desorption gas are significantly higher than the theoretical 813C1, however, the 813C1 of the drained coalmine gas are lower, suggesting that the mining coal desorption gas represents the residual CBG, however, the drained coalmine gas represents the first desorbed CBG. Therefore, their 813C1 cannot be used as genetic tracer, but have great potential in tracing the CBG prevention condition. The mixture of secondary biogenic gas (SBG) and thermogenic gas makes 813C1 high variability. It cannot be directly used as tracer, but is of great significant in study the mixing ratios of the two kinds of gases. The main reasons for the high variability and complexity of CBG 813C1 are the isotope desorption fractionation and the mixing of SBG and thermogenic gas. This study provides a new scientific basis for geochemical tracing and resource evaluation of CBG.

AB  - One of the major problems in artificial eel reproduction is identification of broodstock with high performance reproductive characteristics. The aim of this study was to study population characteristics and the reproductive potential of eels (Anguilla anguilla) located in Valle Campo valley (Comacchio, Italy). A total of 200 eels/period (spring-summer and autumn-winter) were measured to obtain an external indicator of their maturation state. Morphometric parameters were used to calculate condition factor (K), eye index (EI) and pectoral fin length index (PFLI). Silver index analyses showed the lack of silver males and of fully mature females. Most represented females were yellow females at stage II. Silver females represented 27.9% of the population. Seasonal analysis shows how temperature reduction favoured the presence of silver females versus yellow females. Statistical analysis of EI, cranial (CI), PFLI and gonadosomatic (GSI) indexes showed that significant differences were found for EI, CI, PFLI and GSI between yellow and silver eels. No significant difference was found between stage III and IV silver eels, while a significant difference for EI was found between stage I and II yellow eels and for IC at stage II with respect to all other stages. The present study defined how Valle Campo could present environmental and trophic conditions which could favour precocious development of a population of silver females with a noticeable reproductive potential, to be used in open sea release or in artificial reproduction programmes. On the contrary, the valley seems to present unfavourable conditions for both development and sexual maturation of male eels.

AB  - Although membrane fouling is a major issue when operating membrane bioreactors (MBRs), information regarding MBR performance and the sludge microbiome after the development of fouling remains limited. For the present study, two MBRs were operated for approximately 1 month under conditions of membrane fouling to investigate the effects of highly stressed environments on the sludge microbiome. After the development of fouling, a Collimonas-related operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was highly dominant in both reactors (relative abundances were 2053; 63%) and this predomination caused a precipitous decline in the diversity indices of the sludge microbiomes. Because the excessive predomination by limited numbers of OTUs can lead to reductions in the adaptability to environmental changes, monitoring microbial diversity may be a valuable indicator for maintaining the robustness of a sludge microbiome. While, the decrease in the abundance of the Collimonas-related OTU resulted in the predomination of distinct microorganisms in each of the reactors despite being operated under the same conditions; this finding indicates existence of strong pressure to perturb the microbiomes. Detailed analyses suggested that the availability of terminal electron acceptors and competitive interactions between microbes via the secretion of extracellular proteins appeared to differentiate the structures of the respective microbial communities. During the extracellular proteins were secreted in the sludge, considerable portion of microbes were dead and large amounts of biomolecules seemed to be released; resultantly facilitated the predomination of fermentative anaerobes in one reactor as they use organic substances but not inorganic terminal electron acceptors to generate ATP under anaerobic conditions.

AB  - Freshwater mussels are widely used in the monitoring of pollution because they are filter-feeding, longlived animals that tend to accumulate metals in their shells. The temporal scale of such studies can reach thousands of years, since the composition of shells preserves them against decay. This allows us to reconstruct past environmental conditions and to compare current environmental conditions to those prevalent thousands of years ago. Here we assessed metal concentrations (Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn) in recently harvested mussel shells and mussel shells found by archaeologists, and tested the hypothesis that levels of some metals are higher in today's shells, reflecting increasing anthropogenic impact. We observed lower metal concentrations (with the exception of Cd) in shells found by archaeologists (n = 35) than in recently harvested mussel shells (n = 14) (Unio crassus, Unio pictorum, Unio tumidus) in the same water bodies. There were no significant differences in metal levels among species in shells found by archaeologists, while in recently harvested mussels almost all metals for which we tested were found in their highest levels in Unio crassus. The results suggest that metal concentrations in prehistoric times were lower than today, which probably reflects human impact, rather than changes in the geochemical structure of rocks. The results also revealed that metal transfer between mussel shells and surrounding deposits does not occur. We therefore suggest that they might be successfully used as independent bioindicators.

AB  - Psychosocial interventions for serious mental illness are resource intensive and poorly accessible. Brief interventions (eg, single session) that are augmented by follow-on automated mobile health intervention may expand treatment access. This was a randomized single blind controlled trial with 255 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Participants were randomized to one of three conditions: CBT2go, which combined one individual session of cognitive behavioral therapy with automated thought challenging/adaptive behavior delivered through mobile devices; Self Monitoring (SM), which combined single-session illness psychoeducation with self-monitoring of symptoms; and treatment-as-usual (TAU). Participants were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (midpoint), 12 weeks (posttreatment), and 24 weeks (follow up) with our primary outcome global psychopathology (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-expanded version (BPRS-24D, and secondary outcomes community functioning (Specific Level of Function; SLOF) and defeatist performance beliefs (DPBs). We also collected data on adverse events. Outcome analyses on the primary outcome, BPRS Total score, indicated a significant time (0-24 wk) by group interaction with significant but modest improvement comparing two active conditions (CBT2go and SM) relative to TAU. Effects of CBT2go were not different from SM. There was a significant time x group interaction with better SLOF scores in CBT2go across 24 weeks, but not in SM. There were no time-by-group effects on DPBs. DPBs decreased in the CBT2go condition but not in SM. These results indicated that single intervention augmented by mobile intervention was feasible and associated with small yet sustained effects on global psychopathology and, when inclusive of CBT, community function compared with usual care.

AB  - Migratory birds can spend 8 months of the year on their wintering grounds and the conversion of natural habitats to agriculture in Latin America has been implicated in population declines of several Neotropical migrants. Despite this, few studies have directly assessed the value of agricultural habitat for wintering migrants. We compared the condition and survival of Yellow Warblers (Setophaga petechia) occupying natural (riparian forest, scrub-mangrove) and agricultural habitat (annually cropped sorghum, corn, and chili-peppers separated by hedgerow) in western Mexico. We assessed condition with five metrics (daily and seasonal changes in size-adjusted body mass, leukocyte profiles, rectrix regrowth rate, rectrix quality, and dates of departure on spring migration). We used Cormack-Jolly-Seber models fitted to mark-resighting data collected over 4 years (2012-2015) to estimate January-May monthly survival rates. We found that birds occupying agricultural habitat and riparian forest had higher monthly apparent survival between January and May than birds in scrub-mangrove. Birds in agricultural habitat also grew higher quality feathers (i.e., rectrices with a higher barbule density) than those in natural habitat. In contrast, birds in agricultural habitat were lighter than those in riparian habitat. We found no detectable effect of winter habitat use on daily or season changes in size- adjusted mass and H/L ratios, although the effect of winter habitat use on departure rates differed for males and females. Our results demonstrate that agricultural habitat may provide suitable winter habitat for a long-distance migrant and suggest that feather quality can be an indicator of winter habitat quality.Y

AB  - In this study three target radionuclides (Co-60, Cs-137, and Sb-125) were reacted with solid samples collected from the nuclear facility sites to investigate their sorption and mobility behaviors for preparing unexpected nuclear accidents. The highest sorption distribution coefficients (K(d)s) of target radionuclides (Co-60=947 mL/g, Cs-137=2105 mL/g, Sb-125=81.3 mL/g) were found in topsoil layer under groundwater condition, and the K-d values of three radionuclides decreased in the order of fractured rock and bedrock samples under the same groundwater condition. High K-d values of Co-60 in topsoil layer and fracture rock resulted from the clay minerals present, and the K-d values decreased 58-69 % under seawater condition due to high ionic strength. Cs-137 sorption was controlled by the ion exchange reaction with K+ on flayed edge sites (FES) of mica. The Cs-137 sorption was the most affected by seawater (89-97 % decrease), while Sb-125 sorption was not much affected by seawater. As the results of column and batch experiments, the retardation factors (R) of Cs-137, Co-60, and Sb-125 were determined about 5400-7400, 2000-2500, and 250-415, respectively, indicating no significant transport for these radionuclides even in fractured zone with groundwater. These results suggest that even in the case of severe nuclear accident at the nuclear facilities the mobility of released radionuclides (Co-60, Cs-137, and Sb-125) can be significantly retarded by the topsoil layer and fractured rock. In addition, the results of this study will be used for the safety and environmental performance assessment of nuclear facilities.

AB  - Nowadays, the lightweight composites with superior mechanical and tribological properties to be used for several applications in automotive and aerospace industries attract much research interest. Graphene added into ceramic-based composites is believed to positively contribute into sliding wear resistance of materials. To study an effect of graphenated fillers, dry sliding wear behaviour of spark plasma sintered alumina and its hierarchically structured composites reinforced by hybrid graphene encapsulated alumina nanofibres were tested against alumina at a reciprocating mode under mild (0.98 N) and severe (4.90 N) loading conditions for 72 h and 1 h, respectively. The tests were conducted at an average velocity of 0.006 m s(-1) in air for the composites with, different content (0-15 wt%) of the fillers corresponding to 0 1.5 wt% of graphene. Benchmarked against the pure alumina, the composites added with 1 5 wt% of hybrid nanofibres exhibited at least threefold higher wear resistance under mild conditions along with insignificant change in coefficient of friction; whilst under severe conditions, the wear resistance was found to increase up to 90% along with a decrease in the coefficient of friction only for the composite added by 1 wt% of fibres. Wear reduction for the composites with a low content of hybrid nanofibres might be attributed to increase in hardness together with increase in indentation fracture toughness. The relative index of brittleness is shown to serve as a wear performance indicator only under mild environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Eolian deposits are common in the western Pampas of Argentina, and most are assumed to be associated with glacial conditions. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic studies coupled with OSL dating in San Luis Province document for the first time a nearly continuous sequence of eolian sand sheet deposits that span most of the Holocene. Petrology and geochemical analyses indicate that the source of the sand is from pre-existing Pleistocene eolian sediments. Sand sheet deposition between Ca. 12 and 1 ka is associated with sparse, Monte-type vegetation that occurs with drier conditions (MAP 450-100 mm) than the late 20th century (similar to 700 mm). This paleoenvironmental inference is consistent with nearby pollen and lake level records. A persistent semi-arid environment in western Argentina during the Holocene may reflect sustained warm SSTs in the western equatorial Atlantic Ocean, which may have suppressed the pressure gradient between the South Atlantic Anticyclone and Chaco Low and thus, the flux of summer moisture to western Argentina. There appears to be a paleoclimatic "dipole" response between a dry western Argentina and a wet southeastern Brazil, which is consistent with the increasing strength of the South American Monsoon through the Holocene. Sand sheet accretion appears to cease by 800 to 200 years ago with wetter conditions and succession to Espinal vegetation prior to European contact. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We documented the nesting chronology, nest site selection and nest success of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu in an upstream (4th order) and downstream (5th order) reach of Baron Fork Creek, Oklahoma. Males started nesting in mid-Apr. when water temperatures increased to 16.9 C upstream, and in late-Apr. when temperatures increased to 16.2 C downstream. Strearnflows were low (77% upstream to 82% downstream of mean Apr. streamflow, and 12 and 18% of mean Jun. streamflow; 47 and 55 y of record), and decreased throughout the spawning period. Larger males nested first upstream, as has been observed in other populations, but not downstream. Upstream, progeny in 62 of 153 nests developed to swim-up stage. Downstream, progeny in 31 of 73 nests developed to swim-up. Nesting densities upstream (147/km) and downstream (100/km) were both higher than any densities previously reported. Males selected nest sites with intermediate water depths, low water velocity and near cover, behavior that is typical of smallmouth bass. Documented nest failures resulted from human disturbance, angling, and longear sunfish predation. Logistic exposure models showed that water velocity at the nest was negatively related and length of the guarding male was positively related to nest success upstream. Male length and number of degree days were both positively related to nest success downstream. Our results, and those of other studies, suggest that biological factors account for most nest failures during benign (stable, low flow) streamflow conditions, whereas nest failures attributed to substrate mobility or nest abandonment dominate when harsh streamflow conditions (spring floods) coincide with the spawning season.

AB  - Ergosterol is a membrane component specific to fungi that can be used to estimate fungal biomass using appropriate factors of conversion. Our objectives were to determine the limits of use of ergosterol content as a measure of biomass for aquatic hyphomycetes, and to evaluate a previously established ergosterol-to-biomass conversion factor. We varied inoculum quality, growth medium, and degree of shaking of four aquatic hyphomycete species. In cultures inoculated with homogenized mycelium, we found a significant effect of shaking condition and culture age on ergosterol content. In liquid cultures with defined medium, ergosterol content reached 10 to 11 mug/mg of mycelium (dry mass) and varied by factors of 2.2 during exponential growth and 1.3 during stationary phase. The increase in ergosterol content during exponential phase could be attributed, at least in part, to rapid depletion of glucose. Oxygen availability to internal hyphae within the mycelial mass is also responsible for the differences found between culture conditions. Ergosterol concentration ranged from 0.8 to 1.6 mug/mg in static cultures inoculated with agar plugs. Ergosterol content varied by a factor of 4 in two media of different richnesses, For different combinations of these parameters, strong (r(2) = 0.83 to 0.98) and highly significant (P much less than 0.001) linear relationships between ergosterol and mycelial dry mass (up to 110 mg) were observed, Overall, the ergosterol content varied by a factor of 14 (0.8 to 11 mg/g). These results suggest that care must be taken when the ergosterol content is used to compare data generated in different field environments.

AB  - Staphyloxanthin (STX), a golden carotenoid pigment produced by Staphylococcus aureus, is suggested to act as an important virulence factor due to its antioxidant properties. Restraining biosynthesis of STX was considered as an indicator of virulence decline in pigmented S. aureus isolates. However, it is not clear whether natural nonpigmented S. aureus isolates have less virulence than pigmented ones. In this study, it is aimed to compare the pigmented and non-pigmented S. aureus isolates to clarify the genetic and virulent differences between the two groups. Here, 132 S. aureus isolates were divided into two phenotype groups depending on the absorbance (OD450) of the extracted carotenoids. Then, all isolates were subjected to spa typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and then the detection of presence of 30 virulence factors and the gene integrity of crtN and crtM. Furthermore, 24 typical S. aureus isolates and 4 S. argenteus strains were selected for the murine infection assay of in vivo virulence, in which the histological observation and enumeration of CFUs were carried out. These isolates were distributed in 26 sequence types (STs) and 49 spa types. The pigmented isolates were scattered in 25 STs, while the non-pigmented isolates were more centralized, which mainly belonged to ST20 (59%) and ST25 (13%). Among the 54 non-pigmented isolates, about 20% carried intact crtN and crtM genes. The in vivo assay suggested that comparing with pigmented S. aureus, non-pigmented S. aureus and S. argenteus strains did not show a reduced virulence in murine sepsis models. Therefore, it suggested that there were no significant genetic and virulent differences between pigmented and non-pigmented S. aureus.

AB  - There is a pressing need to understand the consequences of human activities, such as land transformations, on watershed ecosystem services. This is a challenging task because different indicators of water quality and yield are expected to vary in their responsiveness to large versus local-scale heterogeneity in land use and land cover (LUC). Here we rely on water quality data collected between 1977 and 2000 from dozens of gauge stations in Puerto Rico together with precipitation data and land cover maps to (1) quantify impacts of spatial heterogeneity in LUC on several water quality indicators; (2) determine the spatial scale at which this heterogeneity influences water quality; and (3) examine how antecedent precipitation modulates these impacts. Our models explained 30-58% of observed variance in water quality metrics. Temporal variation in antecedent precipitation and changes in LUC between measurements periods rather than spatial variation in LUC accounted for the majority of variation in water quality. Urbanization and pasture development generally degraded water quality while agriculture and secondary forest re-growth had mixed impacts. The spatial scale over which LUC influenced water quality differed across indicators. Turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) responded to LUC in large-scale watersheds, in-stream nitrogen concentrations to LUC in riparian buffers of large watersheds, and fecal matter content and instream phosphorus concentration to LUC at the sub-watershed scale. Stream discharge modulated impacts of LUC on water quality for most of the metrics. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple spatial scales for understanding the impacts of human activities on watershed ecosystem services.

AB  - Arid lands cover large regions of Mexico, with problems of water scarcity, shallow soils, poor organic matter content and high salt content. Aloe [Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f.] is a viable alternative for production under limiting environmental conditions. This study evaluated the effect of salinity on leaf growth and gel quality of aloe. The study consisted in testing six saline treatments: 0, 500,1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 mg L-1 of NaCl, corresponding to electrical conductivities (EC) of 0.36 (irrigation water without adding NaCl), 1.39, 2.0, 3.6, 5.6 and 7.6 dS m(-1), respectively. The trial was conducted under a randomized complete blocks experimental design with four replications. The traits measured were leaf length, leaf width, leaf thickness, leaf biomass, gel biomass, fresh and dry biomass of the plant without root, gel pH, total soluble solids and solids precipitable in methanol. Leaf biomass and gel content were similar between 0.36 and 3.6 dS m(-1), which suggested some degree of tolerance to salt stress; however, from 5.6 dS m(-1), there was a negative effect on these and other traits. Total soluble solids concentration and precipitable solids in methanol increased as a function of EC, up to a certain limit. These parameters are considered an indicator of high added value from a commercial point of view. It is confirmed that under moderate stress conditions, in this case salinity, the quality of the gel is favored, but a negative effect accompanies growth and production of the aloe leaf.

AB  - The present study aims to assess the physicochemical parameters and distribution of aquatic macrophytes of seasonal wetlands flowing into the coast of Palk Bay, southeast coast of India. We tested the hypothesis whether there is any statistically significant difference in physicochemical parameters and macrophyte communities among study location. Water quality parameters such as temperature, pH, salinity, TDS, DO, turbidity and electrical conductivity, and the aquatic macrophyte diversity were estimated in all three stations. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson correlation were employed to assess the relationship between water quality parameters, and the water quality index (WQI) was computed to assess the status of water conditions. The ANOVA revealed that there is no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) in water quality parameters among the three stations. The lowest f value 0.180 was recorded for pH and highest of 2.478 for TDS. A total of 7 submerged macrophytes, namely Ceratophyllum demersum L., Egeria densa Planch., Lemna minor L., Marsilea quadrifolia L., Sagittaria guayanensis and Isoetes riparia; 6 rooted floating weeds, namely Potamogeton nodosus Poir., Nymphaea odorata Aiton., Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn., Myriophyllum spicatum L. and Hydrilla verticillata; 1 floating, namely Eichhornia crassipes Kunth; and 1 rooted macrophyte, namely Najas minor, were recorded in Tharavai wetland. A deplorable water quality condition was found in the selected study area, which was evidenced from WQI (>76%). Of this, submerged aquatic vegetation is used as the water quality key indicator, and it exists where there is a better water quality condition. The EC, TDS and turbidity negatively influenced the aquatic macrophytes. Therefore, there is a need for some adaptation measure to maintain the water quality for more extended period for domestic use.

AB  - Innate immunomarkers reflect both environmental contamination and fish health status, providing useful information in environmental risk assessment studies. Nevertheless, the lack of knowledge about the effect of confounding factors can lead to data misinterpretation and false diagnoses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of three confounding factors (season, sex and body size) on three-spined stickleback innate immunomarkers in laboratory conditions. Results shown strong seasonal variations in stickleback innate immunomarkers, with higher immune capacities in late winter-early spring and a disturbance during the spawning period in late spring-summer. Sex and body size had a season dependant effect on almost all tested immunomarkers. Reference ranges were established in laboratory-controlled conditions (i.e. laboratory reference ranges) and compared with data obtained from in vivo chemical expositions. The predictive power of the statistical model depended on the immunomarker, but the control data of the in vivo experiments, realized in same laboratory conditions, were globally well include in the laboratory reference ranges. Moreover, some statistical effects of the in vivo exposures were correlated with an augmentation of values outside the reference ranges, indicating a possible harmful effect for the organisms. As confounding factors influence is a major limit to integrate immunomarkers in biomonitoring programs, modelling their influence on studied parameter may help to better evaluated environmental contaminations.

AB  - In regions where there is intense polluting activity, a greater availability of metals in water impounded by dams increases the availability and contamination of the fauna and flora. Thus, we assessed the accumulation of metals in muscle and gills of fish of different trophic levels in the area of influence of Foz do Chapeco hydroelectric plant on the Uruguai river. We analyzed the metals Pb, Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn, Zn, and Fe in Hypostomus isbrueckeri (cascudo), Pimelodus maculatus (mandi), and Salminus brasiliensis (dourado). We collected specimens from both upstream and downstream of the reservoir in February and March 2014. We also measured the allometric condition factor of the fish to determine their physiological status. Physical and chemical variables of the water were measured to determine the influence of these abiotic variables on the bioavailability of metals and on the condition factor of the fish. Gills had a higher concentration of metals than muscle. Hypostomus isbrueckeri and Pimelodus maculatus possessed high concentrations of metals, indicating greater bioaccumulation in benthic species. Only chromium in muscle varied significantly between upstream and downstream, with higher concentrations in H. isbrueckeri and P. maculatus upstream. Chromium contamination, however, did not change the condition factor, which did not vary between upstream and downstream for any of the studied species. We found no influence of abiotic variables of the water on the bioavailability of the metals in the environment. Although the data do not indicate trophic magnification, the different species react differently to environmental changes and their trophic plasticity makes it difficult to assign them to specific guilds.

AB  - Different environmental factors were studied to determine which factors influence the species richness, composition and structure of vascular plants in Pinus sylvestris L. forests in a fixed dune landscape in south-western Estonia. In addition to site topographic factors, different environmental parameters were investigated. Thirty-four vascular plant species were recorded in 232 quadrats. The most abundant species was Vaccinium vitis-idaea L., which was in 82.8% of quadrats, followed by Vaccinium myrtillus L. (74.1%), Melampyrum pratense L. (71.1%) and Deschampsia flexuosa (L.) Trin. (69.8%). The multiple response permutation procedure (MRPP) showed considerable differences in species composition at the bottoms of dunes compared with that on the slopes and at the tops of dunes. Indicator species analysis (ISA) determined species exhibited characteristics specific to zone: V. myrtillus had the highest indicator value at the bottoms of dunes; Calluna vulgaris L., at the tops. Soils were Haplic Podzols, and the presence of humus horizon depended on zone. Soil conditions on the dunes were variable and site specific, in general, soils at the bottoms of the dunes were more acidic and moist compared with those of the slopes and tops of the dunes, and the nutrient content decreased toward the dune tops. According to non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and linear mixed model analyses, species coverage, composition and richness were controlled by site-specific factors such as absolute height, location and aspect of the quadrat on the dune; soil nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus contents; soil pH and moisture; light conditions; and the thickness of the litter horizon.

AB  - Biofilm formation in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) is influenced by the source water, the supply infrastructure and the operation of the system. A holistic approach was used to advance knowledge on the development of mixed species biofilms in situ, by using biofilm sampling devices installed in chlorinated networks. Key physico-chemical parameters and conventional microbial indicators for drinking water quality were analysed. Biofilm coverage on pipes was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The microbial community structure, bacteria and fungi, of water and biofilms was assessed using pyrosequencing. Conventional wisdom leads to an expectation for less microbial diversity in groundwater supplied systems. However, the analysis of bulk water showed higher microbial diversity in groundwater site samples compared with the surface water site. Conversely, higher diversity and richness were detected in biofilms from the surface water site. The average biofilm coverage was similar among sites. Disinfection residual and other key variables were similar between the two sites, other than nitrates, alkalinity and the hydraulic conditions which were extremely low at the groundwater site. Thus, the unexpected result of an exceptionally low diversity with few dominant genera (Pseudomonas and Basidiobolus) in groundwater biofilm samples, despite the more diverse community in the bulk water, is attributed to the low-flow hydraulic conditions. This finding evidences that the local environmental conditions are shaping biofilm formation, composition and amount, and hence managing these is critical for the best operation of DWDS to safeguard water quality.

AB  - The use of waste heat from exhaust gas of internal combustion engines in power plants and CHP plants is considered a promising application field for thermoelectrics (TE). Some recent studies have provided important knowledge on the energy efficiency of current and future thermoelectric generators (TEGs). The focus of these studies has been primarily on the precise modelling of power units and their operation, i.e., the quantification of power production by TEGs. One of the studies additionally assessed the costs and the CO2 emissions of fuel combustion, without equipment and fuel supply. Until now, there was no life cycle-related analysis considering TEG and power unit manufacture, environmental impacts beyond climate change and competing technologies for waste heat utilisation. In order to fill this gap, the present study applies the life cycle approach, takes account of a variety of environmental impacts and costs and compares TEGs with the competing steam expander technology. The results show that, under many conditions, TEGs in power units can save energy costs and reduce the environmental burden, i.e., they are eco-efficient. With additional expenditure, energy savings and environmental benefits can be achieved even under disadvantageous conditions. However, in the upper power range the performance of steam expanders in terms of electricity production and eco-efficiency is better. The reduction costs of greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts as eco-efficiency indicators show identical patterns. Under reasonable operating conditions, i.e., sufficient capacity utilisation of a TEG (lowest value set in the study on hand: 50%), the impacts from the manufacturing of the TEG play only a small role in the overall assessment.

AB  - Standard ecotoxicological tests are as simple as possible and food sources are mainly chosen for practical reasons. Since some organisms change their food preferences during the life-cycle, they might be food limited at some stage if we do not account for such a switch. As organisms tend to respond more sensitively to toxicant exposure under food limitation, the interpretation of test results may then be biased. Using a reformulation of the von Bertalanffy model to analyze growth data of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, we detected food limitation in the early juvenile phase. The snails were held under conditions proposed for a standardized test protocol, which prescribes lettuce as food source. Additional experiments showed that juveniles grow considerably faster when fed with fish flakes. The model is based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, which allows for mechanistic interpretation of toxic effects in terms of changes in energy allocation. In a simulation study with the DEB model, we compared the effects of three hypothetical toxicants in different feeding situations. The initial food limitation when fed with lettuce always intensified the effect of the toxicants. When fed with fish flakes, the predicted effect of the toxicants was less pronounced. From this study, we conclude that (i) the proposed test conditions for L. stagnalis are not optimal, and require further investigation, (ii) fish flakes are a better food source for juvenile pond snails than lettuce, (iii) analyzing data with a mechanistic modeling approach such as DEB allows identifying deviations from constant conditions, (iv) being unaware of food limitation in the laboratory can lead to an overestimation of toxicity in ecotoxicological tests.

AB  - Regional-scale native vegetation mapping in Australia has traditionally focussed on the detection of woody vegetation. However there is an increasing recognition that transformation of the native herbaceous ground layer to exotic species is an equally important element of vegetation loss. In grass-dominated vegetation, the ground layer contains most of the plant diversity and hence its condition is critical for maintaining the ecological function of grasslands and woodlands. However, decades of fertiliser use have transformed native pastures to exotic dominance and there is a need for regional-scale ground layer condition assessment. We used time-series Landsat 5 imagery, combined with rainfall and soil moisture data, and coupled with site-based soil phosphorus data to develop assessments of ground layer nutrient status from spectral indices. We found significant relationships between soil available phosphorus and NDVI seasonal change. A constraint in the exploration of this relationship is the need for active plant growth, and therefore sufficient rainfall for a signal to be detected. Similarly performing models were derived from two time periods and while they differed in their direction of response, both were able to predict sites with low P. Differences were due to the functional attributes of the dominant vegetation that were active at the time of image collection. Further refinement of the models should be achievable by designing plot sampling strategies more aligned to synoptic remote sensing needs, and incorporating plant composition data into the analysis.

AB  - Quaternary interglacial periods provide glimpses of a warmer Arctic and useful perspectives on possible future conditions, but records of Arctic terrestrial conditions over multiple interglacial periods are rare. Here, we take advantage of a site in the Canadian Arctic where lacustrine sediments representing the past three interglacial periods are preserved in an extant lake. We use subfossil insects (chironomids) preserved in this exceptional sedimentary archive to derive temperature reconstructions through the Holocene up to A. D. 2005, through the Last Interglacial sensu stricto (marine isotope stage or MIS 5e), and a portion of the penultimate interglacial (MIS 7). Chironomid-inferred temperatures are warmest for the early Holocene and MIS 5e, two periods with enhanced Northern Hemisphere insolation forcing relative to today. Twentieth-century warming at this site apparently caused the recent extirpation of cold stenothermous chironomid taxa. Assemblages from MIS 5e have close analogs in modern training set data as determined by squared-chord distance, and MIS 5e species assemblages are very similar to Holocene assemblages at this site. MIS 7 sediments record summer temperatures similar to those of the mid-to late Holocene, followed by a descent into glacial conditions. Even MIS 7 chironomid assemblages, dating back similar to 200,000 yr, have close modern analogs. These lake sediments also provide direct evidence for a period of regional deglaciation between MIS 5e and the Holocene (most likely MIS 5a). To our knowledge, the data presented here represent the longest paleotemperature record thus far generated using chironomids. The existence of close modern analogs for ancient chironomid assemblages at Lake CF8 suggests that this method can provide useful paleotemperature estimates extending back hundreds of millennia.

AB  - An optode device for net-photosynthesis measurements, based on oxygen-depending quenching of fluorescence from O(2)-specific sensors, and PAM fluorometry have been used to study diurnal courses of net-photosynthesis and the F(v)/F(m) ratio of the submerged plant Lagarosiphon major. Plants were pre-cultivated and studied in large mesocosm flow-through outdoor tanks under 50% and 80% shade cloth, respectively. Growth under the different shade cloths resulted in similar light compensation points (similar to 20 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), but strongly different light saturation levels, with about 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for plants grown under 80% shade cloth and about 350 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for plants grown under 50% shade cloth. Plants under both growth conditions showed a transient reduction of the maximum F(v)/F(m) value in the afternoon (down to 70% of the morning control values under 80% shade cloth and down to 85% under 50% shade cloth), which was not accompanied by a reduction of the net photosynthetic rate. This indicated that the fluorescence parameter must not be a reliable indicator of the rate of photosynthesis under all conditions. The new photo-optical device became evidenced as a valuable tool not only for laboratory experiments, but also for field studies of gas exchange of submerged plants. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The palynology and marine mollusks of a marine sequence from Rio Ovando (54 degrees 51' S, 68 degrees 35' W), Archipielago Cormoranes, Beagle Channel, has been studied in order to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions during the Middle-Late Holocene. The dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from Rio Ovando sequence reflect fjord (estuarine) environments close to terrestrial ice field, affected by glacier meltwater discharge, and characterized by short-term oscillations of sea-surface water parameters. The base of the section, which is dated at about ca. 4160 C-14 yr B.P. (4736 cal yr B.P.) (Palynological Subzone RO-2c), is characterized by a high species diversity of dinocyst and mollusks, and it is immediately followed by an interval (Palynological Subzone RO-2b) characterized by the presence of the Echinidinium-Islandinium complex and the monospecific Mytilus mollusk assemblage. This subzone registers an inverse correlation between Nothofagus dombeyi type and Echinidinium-Islandinium complex concentration values during ca. 4160 C-14 yr B.P. (4736 cal yr B.P.)-4064 C-14 yr B.P. (4540 cal yr B.P.), suggesting a variable climatic condition, probably related to Neoglacial episodes occurred in the southern Patagonia Andes during this interval. The pollen assemblages permit direct correlations with the onshore palynostratigraphy from southern of Tierra del Fuego. The high percentages of Nothofagus dombeyi type recorded throughout most of the profile strongly suggest the presence of a closed forest, confirming the existence of a variable, cool and wet climate for the Archipielago Cormoranes area during the Middle-Late Holocene.

AB  - Mate choice is often based on the assessment of multiple traits. Depending on whether traits provide redundant or different information about male characteristics, correlation between traits is expected to arise or not. In species where size increases with age, body size can be a reliable indicator of adult survival whereas secondary sexual traits advertise other qualities like the ability to exploit local resources. However, because of correlations between morphological traits it is often difficult to determine whether females base their preference on the absolute or the relative size of secondary sexual traits. We addressed this issue in the palmate newt, Triturus helveticus. We selected the two most variable traits, body size and filament length, whose weak correlation suggested that they could signal different aspects of male condition or quality. We tested female preference for both traits in two experiments in which we controlled either for body size or filament length. Females preferred males with long filament in experiment I and males with small body sizes in experiment 2. The preference for an exaggerated trait like the caudal filament is not unexpected in a context of inter-sexual selection. In contrast, the preference for small males contrasts with usual findings on mate choice. However, body size might not be a reliable quality indicator because males of different cohorts can experience different conditions throughout their life. The caudal filament, grown each breeding period, likely reflects male condition. By assessing such a character, females might evaluate the performance of a potential partner in the current environment regardless of its age.

AB  - A suite of ice-rafted dropstones and glendonites throughout the Permian succession of eastern Australia indicates the cold climate associated with the late Palaeozoic ice age persisted longest in this part of Gondwana. Paradoxically, these cold climate indicators are preserved in transgressive and highstand facies and formed at mid to high latitudes at a time when palaeofloral and sedimentological data suggest equable onshore environments during the intervening lowstands and temperate conditions at the pole. These apparent inconsistencies suggest that eastern Australia was anomalously cold in the context of post-Sakmarian Gondwanan climates, and the distribution of sedimentary indicators could indicate localized cooling by oceanographic processes. Modem upwelling of cold abyssal waters produces the specific physiochemical conditions necessary for ikaite formation, and is likely to have contributed to the development of glendonites in the eastern Australian Permian system. Such upwelling would have locally lowered surface water temperatures such that seasonal sea or river ice could form, which rafted debris across the marine shelf, and a cold-water fauna could develop. This hypothesis is supported by coupled atmosphere-ocean models for the Permian, which suggest that wind systems may have driven upwelling along this section of the Gondwanan coast. Colder conditions dissipated with the onset of the Hunter-Bowen Contractional Event and the transformation of the basin system from an open marine shelf to a foreland basin. This new hypothesis reconciles the prolonged deposition of cold-climate indicators in the eastern Australian Permian with an apparent post-Sakmarian warming elsewhere in Gondwana.

AB  - The relationship between microorganisms and birds has received increased attention recently. The state of knowledge of this relationship, however, is based largely on examination of sick or dead birds, and knowledge of the prevalence and community structure and function of microbes in healthy wild populations is limited. Using carbon substrate utilization profiles, microbial communities were examined in 91 cloacal samples from 14 species within apparently healthy summer and winter passerine populations. Within each season, gradient lengths and eigenvalues from ordination analyses suggested that many samples differed in their carbon substrate utilization and several had very different communities. Cloacal microbe carbon utilization profiles were distinguishable among host species, season-specific diet, and study site in the ordination analyses. However, these patterns were only observed for the analysis of the summer data set. The results of this study support the idea that the avian host's microbial community, relative to carbon substrate utilization, is related to host diet. Previously, this pattern had only been reported for potential pathogens isolated from the avian cloaca. Study site-specific patterns in the ordination analysis suggest that environmental conditions at a particular study site may influence cloacal microbial communities in birds. Results of this study indicate that examination of community-level physiological profiles may be a useful technique for distinguishing among avian cloacal samples, similar to that already established for discriminating aqueous and soil samples. Future studies that correlate microbe physiological profiles to condition-based indices of avian hosts may be most useful for eventually using the profile as an indicator of environmental conditions experienced by hosts.

AB  - Ikaite is a rare form of carbonate - calcium carbonate hexahydrate (CaCO3. 6H(2)O) and is the precursor to thinolites. Metastable 'ikaite' crystals, discovered in unconsolidated marine sediments in the King George Basin in the Bransfield Strait, Antarctica, are related to diagenetic remineralization reactions of organic matter. Stable C, O, and H-isotopes track the response of ikaite crystals, during growth, to changing interstitial fluid conditions as a result of bacterial sulphate reduction and methanogenesis. Ikaites form in preference over calcite or aragonite at the prevailing surface sediment conditions of -1.6 degrees C and 200 bar in the King George Basin.
   The calcareous tufa towers of the terrestrial, hypersaline Mono Lake of northern California are CaCO3-precipitates formed by the influx of submerged springs of calcium-rich freshwaters entering the alkaline lake (Sigma CO2 = 0.5 m, pH = 9.8). Under current climatic conditions the mineral calcite precipitates, but during the colder Tioga glacial period of Late Wisconsian age (12,000 to 9,000 years BP), and possibly present day during the winter season, the monoclinic calcium carbonate hexahydrate (ikaite) was the dominant phase formed. These paleo-ikaites have since recrystallized to form the calcitic pseudomorph 'thinolites'. They are found elsewhere in recent and ancient sediments of polar regions, e.g., as 'glendonites'. The environmental occurrence of ikaites and their pseudomorphs deem them as potential paleoclimatic indicators of cold environments. The larger crystals are typically restricted to colder, deeper organic-rich sediments or in moderately evaporitic basins. In these cases, the ikaite formation and decomposition may be influenced by additives such as phosphate or amino acids.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a 2D and 3D numerical modeling carried out on an unstable natural rock slope (volume = 110,000-335,000 m(3)) located in north-eastern Italy (Friuli Venezia Giulia Region). It was aimed at investigating the mechanical behavior and internal rock mass damage of the unstable slope before the collapse. The numerical simulations testify that the stability condition of the slope is close to the limit equilibrium (strength reduction factor, SRF = 1.03-1.13), as demonstrated by the considerable rock mass damage observed on the field. The overall mechanical behavior of the slope is mainly governed by the kinematic conditions of the secondary internal blocks, which, in turn, depend on the geometry and mechanical properties of the major discontinuities that delimit the adjacent blocks. Slope failure is achieved through internal rock mass damage represented by internal shear and tensile ruptures localized in correspondence with over-stressed zones. The failure mechanism is characterized by sliding along pre-existing discontinuities and inner damage in the form of the enucleation of shear bands that originate internal secondary failure surfaces and/or damaged rock mass zones. The stress-strain modeling predicts intense slope deformations in zones where rock mass damage actually occurred. This paper emphasizes the decisive connection between the geomechanical field survey and numerical modeling. The comparison of surface geological data acquired on the field with the mechanical indicators obtained from the numerical analyses can significantly improve knowledge of the rock mass damage process that involves unstable slopes approaching failure condition.

AB  - Various issues related to oil palm production, such as biodiversity, drought, water scarcity, and water and soil resource exploitation, have become major challenges for environmental sustainability. The water footprint method indicates that the quantity of water used by plants to produce one biomass product could become a parameter to assess the environmental sustainability for a plantation. The objective of this study is to calculate the water footprint of oil palm on a temporal scale based on root water uptake with a specific climate condition under different crop age and soil type conditions, as a means to assess environmental sustainability. The research was conducted in Pundu village, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The methodology adopted in carrying out this study consisted of monitoring soil moisture, rainfall, and the water table, and estimating reference evapotranspiration (ETo), root water uptake, and the oil palm water footprint. Based on the study, it was shown that the oil palm water usage in the observation area varies with different crop ages and soil types from 3.07-3.73 mm/day, with the highest contribution of oil palm water usage was in the first root zone which correlates to the root density distribution. The total water footprint values obtained were between 0.56 and 1.14 m(3)/kg for various plant ages and soil types. This study also found that the source of green water from rainfall on the upper oil palm root zone delivers the highest contribution to oil palm root water uptake than the blue water from groundwater on the bottom layer root zone.

AB  - Trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide, can effectively protect the biological structures of plants from damage under stress conditions (i.e., high or low temperature, drought, and dehydration) by forming a special protective membrane on the plant-cell surface. Transformation of maize with stably expressed trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS), the key enzyme of trehalose biosynthesis, to improve drought-resistance has important theoretical and economic values. In this study, we constructed the TPS1 gene expression vector driven by the rd29a promoter, transformed immature embryos using Agrobacterium-mediated methods, and screened the transgenic maize plants. As a result, trehalose accumulated in rd29a::TPS1 transgenic maize plants even though it was not detected in wild-type (WT) maize. After determination under repeated drought conditions, we found that the survival rate of the rd29a::TPS1 maize was 70 % higher than that of the WT. Photosynthetic physiological indicators of transgenic maize under drought conditions were better than those of the WT. Microscopic observations of the detached newborn leaves showed that stomata density on the leaf surface of rd29a::TPS1 transgenic maize after drought treatment was reduced by 20 % rom that on the WT leaf, while there were fewer and shorter villi on the leaf surface of transgenic maize than on the WT leaf. In addition, real-time PCR analyses showed that stomata density and distribution 1 (SDD1) expression in the rd29a::TPS1 transgenic maize increased. We concluded that TPS1 improves drought-resistance in maize not only by increasing trehalose content but also by decreasing stomata density and reducing the transpiration rate in transgenic maize plants.

AB  - Interstitial concentrations of CO2 and O-2 were measured to determine respiratory activities of microflora infecting stored canola, soybean, and wheat in different airtight storage times (1, 3 or 5 days) and at different moisture contents and temperatures (10, 15, 23, 25, 30, 35 and 40 C). Canola seeds and ground canola with moisture contents (m.c. wet basis) of 8.0%, 10.0%, 12.0%, 13.6% and 14.0%, soybean with 23.0% m.c., and wheat with 20.3% m.c. were used. There were significant differences in CO2 concentrations between 1-d airtight storage time and other airtight storage times except at 40 degrees C. The same moisture content canola at the same environmental condition but in different replicates accumulated different CO2 concentrations at 10 degrees C and 40 degrees C but not at temperatures of 23 and 30 degrees C. Compared with the respiration of microflora, respiration by canola itself was negligible. There was no significant difference in concentration of CO2 produced by microflora within different crops at 35 C, while there was significant difference at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Values of respiration quotients (RQ) were > 1 at almost any testing condition with few exceptions. Sum of CO2 and O-2 concentrations were close to 21%-22% at most airtight storage times and within any crop. There was a strong positive relationship between the sum and RQ values. The sum might be used to identify whether stored grain had high level of spoiled spots with high moisture content. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vibration assessments are required for new railroad lines to determine the effect of vibrations on local communities. Low accuracy assessments can significantly increase future project costs in the form of further detailed assessment or unexpected vibration abatement measures.
   This paper presents a new, high accuracy, initial assessment prediction tool for high speed lines. A key advantage of the new approach is that it is capable of including the effect of soil conditions in its calculation. This is novel because current scoping models ignore soil conditions, despite such characteristics being the most dominant factor in vibration propagation. The model also has zero run times thus allowing for the rapid assessment of vibration levels across rail networks.
   First, the development of the new tool is outlined. It is founded upon using a fully validated three dimensional finite element model to generate synthetic vibration records for a wide range of soil types. These records are analysed using a machine learning approach to map relationships between soil conditions, train speed and vibration levels. Its performance is tested through the prediction of two independent international vibration metrics on four European high speed lines and it is found to have high prediction accuracy.
   A key benefit from this increased prediction accuracy is that it potentially reduces the volume of detailed vibration analyses required for a new high speed train line. This avoids costly in-depth studies in the form of field experiments or large numerical models. Therefore the use of the new tool can result in cost savings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The adult body size of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae), varies in natural conditions. Body size is an important fitness indicator in the Mediterranean fruit fly; larger individuals are more competitive at mating and have a greater dispersion capacity and fertility. Both temperature during larval development and host fruit quality have been cited as possible causes for this variation. We studied the influence of host fruit and temperature during larval development on adult body size (wing area) in the laboratory, and determined body size variation in field populations of the Mediterannean fruit fly in eastern Spain. Field flies measured had two origins: 1) flies periodically collected throughout the year in field traps from 32 citrus groves, during the period 2003-2007; and 2) flies evolved from different fruit species collected between June and December in 2003 and 2004. In the lab, wing area of male and female adults varied significantly with temperature during larval development, being larger at the lowest temperature. Adult size also was significantly different depending on the host fruit in which larvae developed. The size of the flies captured at the field, either from traps or from fruits, varied seasonally showing a gradual pattern of change along the year. The largest individuals were obtained during winter and early spring and the smallest during late summer. In field conditions, the size of the adult Mediterannean fruit fly seems apparently more related with air temperature than with host fruit. The implications of this adult size pattern on the biology of C. capitata and on the application of the sterile insect technique are discussed.

AB  - Life history theory predicts that early pregnancy presents a relatively low cost, uncontested opportunity for a woman to terminate investment in a current reproductive opportunity if a conceptus is of poor quality and/or maternal status or environmental conditions are not propitious for a successful birth. We tested this hypothesis in rural Bolivian women experiencing substantial seasonal variation in workload and food resources. Significant risk factors for early pregnancy loss (EPL) included agropastoralism versus other economic strategies, conception during the most arduous seasons versus other seasons, and increasing maternal age. Anovulation rate (AR) was higher during the most arduous seasons and in older women. Breastfeeding and indicators of social status and living conditions did not significantly influence either risk of EPL or AR. Averaged over the year, anovulation occurred in about 1/4 of the cycles and EPL occurred in about 1/3 of the conceptions. This is the first evidence of seasonality of EPL in a non-industrialized population, and the first to demonstrate a relationship between economic activities and EPL. These findings suggest that both anovulation and EPL are potential mechanisms for modulating reproductive effort; such "failures" may also be nonadaptive consequences of conditions hostile to a successful pregnancy. In either case, variation in EPL risk associated with different subsistence activities can be expected to influence fertility levels and birth seasonality in both contemporary and past human populations. These consequences of variability in the risk of EPL can impact efforts to understand the sources of variation in reproductive success. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 21:548-558, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Many estuarine habitats are characterized by episodes of hypoxia, the frequency and severity of which may vary seasonally. Accordingly, resident fish species may show seasonal differences in their capacity to tolerate hypoxia. We have tested this hypothesis in the gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, sampled from the Lake Pontchartrain estuary (Louisiana) at different times of the year. We measured 2 indicators of hypoxia tolerance, the frequency of aquatic surface respiration (ASR) during gradual reduction in dissolved oxygen (D.O.) and survival time during severe hypoxic stress, and found both to be significantly affected by season. Fish collected during the summer did not engage in ASR until the D.O. concentration dropped to values lower than that required to elicit ASR by fish collected during other seasons. Laboratory acclimation of fish to low oxygen did not change the relationship between ASR behavior and D.O., suggesting that the observed seasonal effect on ASR was not simply due to previous exposure of summer fish to environmental hypoxia. Furthermore, fish collected during the summer and winter had significantly longer survival times during exposure to severe hypoxia than fish collected during the fall. Survival analysis indicated that the condition of fish was positively associated with survival time, and seasonal variation in condition accounted for about half of the observed difference between survival times of fish collected during the summer and fall. Seasonal variation in ASR and survival, when taken together, demonstrate that hypoxia tolerance in F. grandis may be subject to acclimatization. An increase in hypoxia tolerance during the summer could increase survivorship of fish when exposed to elevated temperatures and low oxygen concentrations which prevail during the summer months.

AB  - The composition of macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups (FFGs) has been used as surrogates of ecosystem attributes in aquatic ecosystems, but studies that utilize such knowledge are still limited in the tropics. This study investigated the suitability of abundance- vs. biomass-based metrics of macroinvertebrate FFGs as surrogates of ecosystems attributes of the Sosiani-Kipkaren River in western Kenya. Macroinvertebrates were sampled in wet and dry seasons, classified into five FFGs and used to derive five metrics that are surrogates of ecosystem attributes; (1) a balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy, (2) linkage between riparian inputs of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) and fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), (3) top-down predator control, (4) geomorphic channel stability, and (5) relative dominance of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) in transport compared to FPOM deposited in the sediments. Taxon richness, abundance and biomass of shredders were higher in forested sites, and scrapers were numerically dominant in mid-order streams, whereas collectors dominated agricultural and urban sites. Abundance-based metrics were better predictors of ecosystem attributes and displayed greater response to changes in stream size than biomass-based metrics. Moreover, there was incongruence between abundance- and biomass-based indicators for P/R and CPOM/FPOM. Catchment land use did not influence metric performance, suggesting that reach scale influences played a predominant role in structuring communities and determining ecosystem functioning. Although the use of FFGs as indicators of ecosystem integrity and functioning in this river show promise, lack of agreement between abundance- and biomass-based measures suggests that more studies are needed to refine the metrics used.

AB  - We describe how a landscape-scale approach has been adopted to conserve the UK's most threatened butterfly Argynnis adippe. Only 37 populations now remain, with 38 extinctions occurring since 1994 (51% loss). The butterfly has disappeared from most of England and Wales and is now confined to just four landscapes. Since 2005 management in these landscapes has been targeted at improving habitat quality within and connectivity between both occupied and unoccupied sites in the same networks. Conservation advice has been provided on 80% of occupied/former sites and over 270ha management implemented across 53% of occupied/former sites. Where management was undertaken, significant increases in abundance compared to the national trend were recorded for some site networks or some populations. (Re)colonisations have occurred in response to management/advice on 16 sites, all within 1km of the nearest population. However, responses to management in one landscape have been mixed, with overall abundance continuing to decline and further extinctions occurring. Habitat condition assessments on five sites in this landscape reveal significant changes between 2004 and 2016, with declines in Viola spp. cover, increased grassiness and less P. aquilinum litter/standing trash on some sites. We discuss potential drivers of both A. adippe population dynamics and habitat condition change. Our research suggests an urgent need to review the butterfly's ecological requirements and current management recommendations designed to meet them, so that new prescriptions or techniques can be developed and tested which can increase the quality and longevity of A. adippe habitat.

AB  - Begging behaviour is an important element in the parent-offspring conflict; it has been studied in many avian species. However, the majority of the studies have been entirely based on the call counts, and they agreed that vocal activity was a good indicator of chick's nutritional need and/or condition. Fewer researches were dedicated to the temporal-frequency variables of the begging calls themselves and they showed contrary results. Here begging behaviour in three burrow nested, uniparous species of auks (Alcidae) was studied. These objects provide an opportunity to study the signalling value of begging calls in the absence of important confounding factors such as nestling competition and predation pressure. I recorded calls of individual chicks in two conditions: during natural feeding and after experimental four-hour food deprivation. I found that almost all measured acoustic variables contain information about the chick's state in all studied species. The hungry chicks produced calls higher in fundamental frequency and power variables and at higher calling rate compared to naturally feeding chicks. The effect of food deprivation on most acoustic variables exceeded both the effects of individuality and species. In all studied species, the frequency variables were stronger affected by hunger than the calling rate and call durations. I suppose that such strong change of acoustic variables after food deprivation can be explained by absence of vocal individual identification in these birds. As parents do not need to check individuality of the chick in the burrow, which they find visually during the day time, the chicks could use all of the acoustic variables to communicate about their nutritional needs.

AB  - Temperature is a major factor contributing to the biogeography of intertidal poikilotherms. The population dynamics of intertidal invertebrates like mussels are strongly dependent on larval supply and larval mortality. Unlike adults, which are resistant to fluctuating environmental conditions, larvae are highly sensitive to the physicochemical conditions of the pelagic zone. The effects of rearing temperature on larval and post-larval performance of 2 coexisting mussels species, Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus, were examined in this study. In the first experiment, larvae of both species were reared separately at constant temperatures of 10, 17, and 24 degrees C from D-larvae to the dissoconch stage. In the second experiment, pediveligers were reared under the same experimental conditions as the larvae for 2 wk. Survival, growth, and lipid composition (triacylglycerol [TAG] and sterol [ST] contents) were used to compare the performance of both species. The first experiment showed a species-specific thermal tolerance range, reflecting the biogeography of the species. M. trossulus larvae showed a preference for water at 10 and 17 degrees C, corresponding to the more northerly distribution of this species, whereas M. edulis preferred temperatures of 17 and 24 degrees C. Moreover, the TAG content in larvae of both species varied with temperature, supporting the hypothesis of a positive correlation between energy reserve content and the survival of mussel larvae. In contrast, the species-specific characteristics of thermal tolerance were not observed during post-larval development, suggesting that the selective effect of temperature on mussel species occurs during early ontogeny.

AB  - Three genera of Tayassuidae are recognized in South America: Platygonus LE CONTE, 1848, Catagonus AMEGHINO, 1904 and Tayassu FISCHER, 1814. A material previously referred to the "Group Catagonus" and recently to Tayassu sp., was examined; in the light of the systematic scheme available today, it is identified as Catagonus stenocephalus (LUND in REINHARDT, 1880). The partial skull studied here is the first record of this species in the Touro Passo Stream, in outcrops of the Touro Passo Formation (Late Pleistocene), Uruguaiana, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Therefore, it is extended its geographic distribution in South America, which was previously restricted to central-eastern Argentina, Lagoa Santa (Brazil) and Bolivia. From a palaeoenvironmental point of view, the presence of this species (presumably adapted to arid or semi-arid environments) in Touro Passo Formation, together with other faunistic remains (e.g., Holmesina paulacoutoi, Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris and Tapirus terrestris) adapted to warm-temperature and humid climatic conditions, and many other indicators of open to semi-open and perhaps arid or semi-arid environments (e. g., Glyptodon clavipes, Equus neogeus, Lama sp., Hemiauchenia paradoxa, Stegomastodon platensis) show a particular fauna. This fauna supports the palaeoenvironmental conditions that extended during Lujanian times throughout the Argentinian Mesopotamia, western Uruguay and southern Brazil. In these areas, the fauna was developed under more humid conditions that those recorded for the same age in the Pampean area, being the latter mostly cold and dry, and extending throughout north-central Argentina, Paraguay and part of Bolivia.

AB  - Biodiversity is modulated by the spatial structure of the landscape. Thus, landscape metrics can be useful indicators of biota integrity and vulnerability, helping in conservation and management decisions.
   We performed the first quantitative analysis of the spatial structure of the Caatinga drylands. We estimated the habitat amount and the fragmentation pattern of this region using a multi-scale perspective.
   Using the Brazilian official database of native remnants, we calculated the number and percentage of remaining fragments per size class and we describe how habitat amount changes along the landscape. By simulating different dispersal capacities, we estimated the functional connectivity among remnants. We also calculated the cumulative core area as a function of different edge effect widths.
   Caatinga is subdivided into 47,100 fragments. Although 91% of them are smaller than 500 ha, 720 fragments are larger than 10,000 ha, corresponding to 78% of the remaining vegetation. Potentially, 95% of the vegetation is accessible to species that can cross 1000 m of matrix. With one kilometer of edge effect, the core area is reduced to a quarter of the remaining vegetation. The habitat amount analyzes reinforced the regional differences in the spatial distribution of the remnants.
   Caatinga remains well connected for species with moderate and high dispersal capacities. However much of its remaining area is vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbances. Expansion of the protected area network and effective natural resource management to avoid overexploitation of the remnants are key strategies for maintaining the Caatinga biodiversity and its services.

AB  - Acetaminophen (AAP) overdose causes severe liver injury and is the leading cause of acute liver injury in humans. The mechanisms participating in its toxic effect are glutathione depletion, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is the principal biological methyl donor and is also a precursor of glutathione. In our previous studies we have documented a protective action of SAMe against various toxic injuries of rat hepatocytes in primary cultures. The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible protective effect of SAMe against AAP-induced toxic injury of primary rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were exposed to AAP (2.5 mM) or AAP together with SAMe at the final concentrations of 5, 25 or 50 mg/l for 24 h. Incubation of hepatocytes with AAP caused a significant increase of the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p < 0.001) and decline of the activity of cellular dehydrogenases (WST-1) (p < 0.001). Co-incubation of hepatocytes with SAMe at any dose did not improve these markers of cellular integrity. The functional indicators improved in hepatocytes co-cultured with SAMe - urea production was significantly increased when using the highest dose of SAMe (p < 0.05); albumin synthesis was higher in all cultured hepatocytes exposed to SAMe (p < 0.05). SAMe did not influence AAP-induced decrease of cellular content of glutathione. Mitochondrial respiration of harvested digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes was measured; Complex II was more sensitive to toxic action of AAP, respiration was decreased by 20%. This decrease was completely abolished by SAMe.

TI  - Recycling of petroleum-contaminated sand
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
LA  - English
AB  - The environmental impact of using petroleum-contaminated sand (PCS) as a substitute in asphalt paving mixtures was examined. An appreciable component of PCS is oily sludge, which is found as the dregs in oil storage tanks and is also produced as a result of oil spills on clean sand. The current method for the disposal of oily sludge is land farming. However, this method has not been successful as an oil content of <1% w/w is required, and difficulty was encountered in reaching this target. The reuse of the sludge in asphalt paving mixtures was therefore considered as an alternative. Standard tests and environmental studies were conducted to establish the integrity of the materials containing the recycled sludge. These included physical and chemical characterization of the sludge itself, and an assessment of the mechanical properties of materials containing 0%, 5%, 22% and 50% oily sludge. The blended mixtures were subjected to special tests, such as Marshall testing and the determination of stability and flow properties. The experimental results indicated that mixtures containing up to 22% oily sludge could meet the necessary criteria for a specific asphalt concrete wearing course or bituminous base course. To maximize the assay from the recycled material, the environmental assessment was restricted to the 50% oily sludge mixture. Leachates associated with this particular mixture were assayed for total organic residue and certain hazardous metal contaminants. The results revealed that the organics were negligible, and the concentrations of the metals were not significant. Thus, no adverse environmental impact should be anticipated from the use of the recycled product. Our research showed that the disposal of oily sludge in asphalt paving mixtures could possibly yield considerable savings per tonne of asphalt concrete, and concurrently minimize any direct impact on the environment.

AB  - Steam injection into oil sands reservoirs for bitumen extraction leads to the in situ generation of gases (mainly methane). Many oil sands formations have permeable cap rocks that may allow these gases to migrate to the overlying formations and pose environmental challenges to the groundwater. We present a detailed analysis of the long-term fate of the in situ generated gases over the course of thermal oil recovery operations. The impacts of capillary barriers on upward migration of the in situ generated gases are quantified. Our findings reveal that the upward migration of gases over a 100-year period in formations with continuous flow barriers with a permeability of less than similar to 1 x 10(-18) m(2) is negligible. However, for formations with discontinuous flow barriers, the migrated gas can potentially leak to the surface depending on the capillary entry pressure of the preferential pathways (e.g., sand layers). In this case, the upward migration is primarily controlled by high permeability pathways. It was found that the migrated gas is effectively trapped by the residual and dissolution trapping mechanisms, and the gas migration to the overlying formations is prevented or significantly reduced by capillary pressure of sand layers. The results indicate that the migrated gas to the shallow groundwater is primarily comprised of methane and is free of CO2 and H2S. These results provide valuable insights into the long-term fate of these gases in thermal oil recovery operations. They also offer potential opportunities for the development of regulatory frameworks and screening considerations for caprock/seal integrity/risk assessments.

AB  - Documenting responses of biotic assemblages to coal-mining impacts is crucial to informing regulatory and reclamation actions. However, attributing biotic patterns to specific stressors is difficult given the dearth of preimpact studies and prevalence of confounding factors. Analysing species distributions and abundances, especially stratified by species traits, provides insights into how assemblage composition shifts occur. We evaluated stream habitats and fish assemblages along a mining intensity gradient in 83 headwater (2nd- and 3rd-order) streams of the upper Clinch and Powell river basins in Virginia. Our multivariate gradient (MINE.PC1) was based on percentages of watershed area covered by surface mine, underground mine and valley fill to represent spatial variance in mining intensity. MINE.PC1 was positively correlated with conductivity and percentage of substrate as cobble. Forty fish-assemblage metrics were analysed via boosted regression trees to assess assemblage responses to mining intensity, while accounting for environmental variation and spatial structure among sites. Conductivity and MINE.PC1 were strongly negatively related to occurrences of Fantail Darter (Etheostoma flabellare) and sculpin (Cottus) spp. Several taxonomic, trophic and reproductive metrics of assemblage composition responded strongly to mining intensity or its instream correlates. For example, coal mining favoured omnivore-herbivores, but inhibited invertivores, simple lithophils and nonsimple nonlithophils. We revealed distinct negative and positive responses to mining-related stressors, which suggest changes to macroinvertebrate prey availability and/or contaminant loads contribute to fish extirpations in coalfield streams. Future assessments of mining impacts on fish assemblages could be more instructive by including characterisations of physicochemical stressors and regionally calibrated biotic metrics with demonstrated sensitivity to mining.

AB  - Black rot caused by the fungus Ceratocystis fimbriata causes notable losses in sweet potato production. Perillaldehyde (PAE), a secondary metabolite in perilla, was studied to determine its antifungal effects on mycelial growth and spore germination of C. fimbriata. The effects of PAE on cell wall integrity and cell membrane permeability were also investigated. To elucidate the possible mechanisms of cell death triggered by PAE, sensitivity of C. fimbriata to PAE toxicity was determined by cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium ion concentrations ([Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]m), reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cytochrome c (cyt c) release, metacaspase activation, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization and DNA fragmentation. The results suggest that mycelial growth and spore germination were inhibited by PAE in a dose-dependent manner. Ceratocystis fimbriata spores treated with PAE experienced dramatic Ca2+ overload and elevated ROS production. Compared to untreated controls, the proportion of fluorescent cells stained with the ROS indicator DCFH-DA and treated with a range of PAE concentrations from 0.0625 to 0.50 mu L mL(-1) increased by 2.9 +/- 0.79% to 27.1 +/- 0.38%. Ca2+ overload and ROS accumulation induced depolarization of the MMP, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction. Cyt c was released from the mitochondria to the cytosol, triggering metacaspase activation. The significant antifungal activity of PAE on C. fimbriata was demonstrated by these studies, suggesting that PAE has the potential for wide application to postharvest management of tuber crops, in addition to the application to above-ground fruit and vegetables that have been previously investigated.

AB  - Objectives: Themechanisms underpinning the association between chronic stress and gut health are poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the relationship between bacterial produced short-chain fatty acids, gut barrier function, and stress measures.
   Methods: A fecal sample, hair sample, and questionnaire data were collected from 113 Belgian children (8-16 years old). Biological measures of stress included hair cortisol (most proximal 3 cm) and 5-minute heart rate variability (high frequency). Self-reportmeasures of stress included emotional problems and negative events. Fecal calprotectin was determined as amarker of intestinal inflammation and an indirect indicator of gut barrier integrity. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, acetate, valerate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate) were measured with gas chromatography. Linear regression analyses were adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic status, body mass index, fiber intake, and protein intake.
   Results: Emotional problems were significantly associated with higher butyrate (beta = 0.263), valerate (beta = 0.230), isovalerate (beta = 0.231), and isobutyrate (beta = 0.233). Heart rate variability reflecting higher parasympathetic activitywas related to lower valerate levels (beta = -0.217). Hair cortisol was not associated with the short-chain fatty acids. None of the stress measures and none of the fecal short-chain fatty acids were significantly related to fecal calprotectin.
   Conclusions: In healthy children, the impact of chronic stress is manifested more obviously in short-chain fatty acids than in intestinal inflammation as measured by levels of calprotectin. Despite the rather counterintuitive associations with butyrate, these results point to the need for further research on gut microbiome composition.

AB  - Stream fish survey data were analyzed to describe patterns of fish distributions in wadeable streams (primarily 1(st)-4(th) order) in Connecticut. Species occurrence within the United States Geological Survey 8-digit hydrologic unit code watersheds were used to aggregate similar watersheds into stream fish faunal regions. Within each identified region, multivariate analyses were used to identify major fish assemblage types and associate stream habitat with assemblage types. The analyses revealed an eastern and western faunal region defined primarily by distribution of a few native species. Native species associated with the western watersheds were: Semotilus atromaculatus (Creek Chub), Exoglossum maxillingua (Cutlips Minnow), and Cottus cognatus (Slimy Sculpin). Native fishes associated with the eastern watersheds were: Erimyzon oblongus (Creek Chubsucker), Esox niger (Chain Pickerel), and Esox americanus (Redfin Pickerel). Inclusion or non-indigenous species in the analyses resulted in a similar cast-west grouping of watersheds. Five and four assemblage types were identified in the eastern and western faunal regions, respectively. Both regions harbored 3 fluvial assemblages defined longitudinally from headwater streams to larger wadeable streams and a macro-habitat generalist assemblage inhabiting streams with proportionately more pool habitat, but taxonomic membership and indicator species rankings among assemblages were not necessarily identical between the regions. A distinct assemblage dominated by Redfin Pickerel was recognized only in the eastern region. Streams in the western region were generally higher in elevation and colder in water temperature. The discovery and description of eastern and western fish faunal regions and their fish assemblage types will be useful in stratifying the biological monitoring of streams and other aquatic resource management actions in Connecticut.

AB  - An effective strategy for managing protein databases is to provide mechanisms to transform raw data into consistent, accurate and reliable information. Such mechanisms will greatly reduce operational inefficiencies and improve one's ability to better handle scientific objectives and interpret the research results. To achieve this challenging goal for the STING project, we introduce Sting_RDB, a relational database of structural parameters for protein analysis with support for data warehousing and data mining. In this article, we highlight the main features of Sting_RDB and show how a user can explore it for efficient and biologically relevant queries. Considering its importance for molecular biologists, effort has been made to advance Sting_RDB toward data quality assessment. To the best of our knowledge, Sting_RDB is one of the most comprehensive data repositories for protein analysis, now also capable of providing its users with a data quality indicator.This paper differs from our previous study in many aspects. First, we introduce Sting_RDB, a relational database with mechanisms for efficient and relevant queries using SQL. Sting_RDB evolved from the earlier, text (flat file)-based database, in which data consistency and integrity was not guaranteed. Second, we provide support for data warehousing and mining. Third, the data quality indicator was introduced. Finally and probably most importantly, complex queries that could not be posed on a text-based database, are now easily implemented. Further details are accessible at the Sting_RDB demo web page: http:// www. cbi. cnptia. embrapa. br/ StingRDB.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) is the third most elements found in the earth crust and Al toxicity is one of the most dangerous toxicants in terms of plants. As soil acidity increases due to a number of environmental factors, Al becomes soluble and transforms into toxic forms. In the present study, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) roots were exposed to 100 mu M AlCl3 solution for short (1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 h) and long (24, 48, 72 and 96 h) term to reveal time dependent programmed cell death evidences. At the end of time periods, Al+3 accumulations, loss of plasma membrane integrity and lipid peroxidation increased time dependently. On the other hand, increase in caspase-1 like enzyme activities were observed in Al toxicity beginning from 1/2 h. Similar to apoptosis seen in animals, cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm was also determined quantitatively. As a result of our research, increase of cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm was time dependent which is one of the indicators of programmed cell death. Finally, under Al stress, genomic DNA fragmentation was measured by Flow Cytometry, and it was determined that DNA fragmentation was visible at first hours, but it was more significant after long term application in barley roots. In conclusion; the presented study highlights the adverse effects of Al on barley roots and importance of clarifying the relationship between Al toxicity and time dependent programmed cell death mechanism.

AB  - The use of aquatic macroinvertebrates as bio-indicators in water quality studies has increased considerably over the last decade in Costa Rica, and standard biomonitoring methods have now been formulated at the national level. Nevertheless, questions remain about the effectiveness of different methods of sampling freshwater benthic assemblages, and how sampling intensity may influence biomonitoring results. In this study, we compared the results of qualitative sampling using commonly applied methods with a more intensive quantitative approach at 12 sites in small, lowland streams on the southern Caribbean slope of Costa Rica. Qualitative samples were collected following the official protocol using a strainer during a set time period and macroinvertebrates were field-picked. Quantitative sampling involved collecting ten replicate Surber samples and picking out macroinvertebrates in the laboratory with a stereomicroscope. The strainer sampling method consistently yielded fewer individuals and families than quantitative samples. As a result, site scores calculated using the Biological Monitoring Working Party-Costa Rica (BMWP-CR) biotic index often differed greatly depending on the sampling method. Site water quality classifications using the BMWP-CR index differed between the two sampling methods for 11 of the 12 sites in 2005, and for 9 of the 12 sites in 2006. Sampling intensity clearly had a strong influence on BMWP-CR index scores, as well as perceived differences between reference and impacted sites. Achieving reliable and consistent biomonitoring results for lowland Costa Rican streams may demand intensive sampling and requires careful consideration of sampling methods.

AB  - This study evaluates the effects of the macroalgae Ulva ohnoi on growth and intestinal functionality and integrity of Solea senegalensis juveniles in a 90-day feeding trial. Ulva diet (U-5) included 5% dry U. ohnoi biomass, whereas an algae-free diet was used as control. After being fed for 45 and 90 days, fish body weight was recorded for growth evaluation, and biological samples were taken. The inclusion of U. ohnoi (5%) significantly affected growth performance of sole juveniles, given that after being fed for 45 and 90 days fish showed lower body weight, specific growth and weight gain rates than fish fed with the control diet. Compared to fish fed with control diet, protease activities measured in the pancreatic secretion was also reduced when Ulva was included in the diet, but these fish also showed increased alkaline phosphatase activity in their intestinal mucosa. Quantitative PCR revealed changes in the relative expression of a set of genes coding for enzymes involved in lipid absorption and metabolism, several digestive enzymes, as well as for some stress response indicators. Electron microscopy revealed a lack of damage in the intestinal mucosa, as well as significantly increased mucosal absorptive surface in those fish fed with Ulva-supplemented diet for 45 days, compared to control fish. The results suggest that U. ohnoi at low inclusion level could protect the intestinal epithelium of fish, but a relatively short administration period is recommended with the aim of avoiding negative effects on Senegalese sole growth and proteolytic digestive enzyme activities.

AB  - Tolerable soil loss (T) is defined as the maximum rate of annual soil erosion that economically and indefinitely will continue to sustain a high level of crop productivity. Currently a T value is assigned to a soil based on its current functional state and structural integrity. However, in India a default T value Of 11.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (5.0 t ac(-1) yr(-1)) is being followed. Our objective is to provide adjusted T values for India's Northwest Himalayan region by incorporating bulk density, water stable aggregate measurements, infiltration rate, soil carbon, and fertility status into the assessment. A quantitative model was used to sum up overall soil performance to define the current state of soil resource. Scaling functions were used to convert soil parameters to a 0 to 1 scale. The normalized values were then multiplied by appropriate weighting factors based on relative importance and sensitivity analysis of each indicator. A categorical ranking of soil 1, 2, or 3 was given to a soil group based on the overall assessment. A general guideline developed by the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was followed to calculate soil toss tolerance for each soil group using effective soil depth. Adjusted T values for the area ranged between 5.0 and 12.5 Mg ha 1 yr(-1) (2.2 and 5.6 t ac 1 yr(-1)) compared to 11.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (5.0 t ac(-1) yr(-1)). Use of the adjusted T values will improve conservation planning, help meet erosion control regulations for development of sustainable farm operations, and improve watershed management in this portion of India.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups (FFGs) are influenced by the availability of food sources, which can be affected by stream size and gradient. We investigated the spatial distribution patterns of FFGs by stream size (stream order, catchment area and stream width) and gradient (altitude and slope). In addition, we attempted stream classification based on the distribution patterns of FFGs. To achieve these goals, a total of 996 sampling sites of national scale located in the Republic of Korea were investigated from 2008 to 2016. Among the five physical variables, stream width and slope showed linear relationships with the indicator values of FFGs. These two physical variables had larger influences on the distribution of FFGs compared to other variables. Geology (the type of rocks) showed little influences on the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. We classified streams focusing on catchment (stream size) area and altitude (stream gradient) because they are constants that do not change with disturbances. The FFGs and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were distinctly changed by stream types, indicating that the stream classification criterion adequately represented changes in physical variables in biotic terms. In addition, the distribution of FFGs and biotic assemblages showed that benthic macroinvertebrates in the Republic of Korea were more influenced by the altitude (stream gradient) than the catchment area (stream size). In overall, this study found that the stream size and gradient markedly influence the distribution of FFGs in national regions of the Republic of Korea. Further research is needed focusing on the level of microhabitats and other parameters to identify the promising variables that influence biotic distribution.

AB  - Actinomycete isolates from indoor air and dust in water-damaged schools and children's day care centers were tested for toxicity by using boar spermatozoa as an indicator. Toxicity was detected in extracts of four strains which caused a loss of sperm motility, and the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) were 10 to 63 ng (dry weight) mi of extended boar semen(-1). The four strains were identified as Streptomyces griseus strains by 16S ribosomal DNA and chemotaxonomic methods. The four S. griseus strains had similar effects on sperm cells, including loss of motility and swelling of mitochondria, but we observed no loss of plasma membrane integrity or depletion of cellular ATP, None of the effects was observed with sperm cells exposed to extracts of other indoor actinomycete isolates at concentrations of greater than or equal to 5,000 to 72,000 ng ml(-1). The toxin was purified from all four strains and was identified as a dodecadepsipeptide, and the fragmentation pattern obtained by tandem mass spectrometry was identical to that of valinomycin, Commercial valinomycin had effects in sperm cells that were identical to the effects of the four indoor isolates of S, griseus. The EC50 of purified toxin from the S, griseus strains were 1 to 3 ng ml of extended boar semen(-1), and the EC50 of commercial valinomycin was 2 ng ml of extended boar semen(-1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of ionophoric toxin producers in an indoor environment and the first report of valinomycin-producing strains identified as S, griseus.

AB  - Streams and rivers have essential roles in landscape connectivity; however, urban watersheds are frequently modified to drain stormwater from urban areas. To determine whether an earthen stormwater drain in an urban landscape provides fish habitat temporally, we compared the fish assemblage among three reaches of a contiguous urbanized watershed in Kanata, Ontario, Canada. Watts Creek is connected to an earthen municipal surface stormwater drain (herein Kizell Drain), before discharging into the Ottawa River. We delineated transects in three reaches of the system, in Watts, in the Drain, and below their confluence (Main) and assessed the fish community using single-pass electrofishing repeated across eight months covering all seasons. Fish community composition was compared among reaches using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and permutated multivariate analyses of variance (perMANOVA). Sign association tests identified indicator species driving assemblage patterns among reaches. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to assess the influence of physical characteristics of the transects on fish assemblage structure. Finally, fish assemblage measures were separated by month and temporal comparisons of fish assemblage were performed with NMDS and perMANOVA. Over the year, fish assemblages were distinct among the three reaches, and appear to be significantly influenced by temperature, undercut banks, and riparian vegetation type. Biotic homogenization in the Drain can be attributed to degraded physical features associated with channel modification in stormwater drains. Despite management and jurisdictional differences between streams and stormwater drains, evidence that earthen stormwater drains can maintain fish assemblages temporally demonstrates their biological potential and need to be considered as interconnected fish habitat elements within the overall watershed.

AB  - Land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) change is one of the main drivers of global biodiversity change. However, the lack of detailed data on species' local distributions is frequently a major constraint to identify effective indicators of impact and to prescribe effective conservation and management measures. Here we aim to describe and demonstrate the applicability of a novel looping approach to predict spatially dynamic ecological responses to LU/LC changes. The methodology integrates statistical downscaling, multi-model inference, stochastic-dynamic modelling and simulations, and spatial projections under a common and interactive framework. We illustrate the approach with a study of passerine foraging groups and their potential indicator role under LU/LC change scenarios. Based on the coarse occurrence data from published atlases, this approach allowed transposing species richness to fine resolutions in order to assess regional ecological integrity by up scaling the local responses of those indicators again at the landscape level. Overall, our proposed framework was able to provide realistic patterns of passerine foraging responses to LU/LC changes, highlighting the usefulness of existing databases for model-based research in addressing complex emergent problems across scales. Comparative analysis between simulations and independent field data showed a promising model performance, with consistent projections of the local passerine functional composition for a significant number of point-counts tested. Our approach represents a contribution for more universal applications in the scope of conservation and landscape planning, especially when fine resolution data is difficult to obtain due to resources constraints.

AB  - Bioavailability, is critical for understanding effects that might result from exposure of biota to contaminated soils. Soils from military range and training areas (RTAs) are contaminated principally by energetic materials (EM) and metals. Their chemical characteristics are relatively well known and toxicity assessment of soils from RTAs are in some cases available. However, bioavailability on these sites needs to be comprehensively characterized. A holistic approach to bioavailability, incorporating both chemical and earthworm toxicological indicators, was applied to soils from an anti-tank firing range at a Canadian Forces Base. Results showed that HMX and the metals Zn, Pb, Bi and Cd, though not consistently the prevailing toxicants, were the most accessible to earthworms. Some metals (notably Cu, Zn, Cr and Bi) were also accumulated in earthworm tissue but those were not necessarily expected given their bioaccessibility (i.e., the chemical availability of contaminants in the environment for the organisms) at the beginning of the exposure. The tested soils impaired earthworm reproduction and reduced adult growth. Measurement of selected sublethal parameters indicated that lysosomal integrity (determined as the neutral red retention time - NRRT) was decreased, while elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity suggested that earthworms experienced oxidative stress. The correspondence between the NRRT and metal contamination pattern suggested that metals may be the main cause of lysosomal disruption in EM-contaminated soils. The approach to bioavailability appraisal adopted in this case appears to be a promising practice for site-specific assessment of contaminated land.
